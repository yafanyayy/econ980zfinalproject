I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. On the call today, I am pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc.,and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it on the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A of Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2014 and with our 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2014, and it's also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition to that, there is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, and that can also be found in our financial release which, again, is on our caterpillar.com website.
Okay. With that, let's get started. And this morning, we'll be reviewing our financial results for the quarter, for the full year of 2014, and we'll spend some time on our 2015 outlook. Now as I do each of those, I just want to kind of go through the major themes right now. 
And for the quarter, sales were about as expected, but we were disappointed with lower profit in the quarter within our outlook. And that a significant decline in inventory in the quarter more so than we anticipated was a large contributing factor to that. 
For the full year of 2014, the major theme continues to be around execution and better profit per share than 2013 and the outlook that we started the year with. 
We are pleased with what we've accomplished in 2014 given the continued weak economic conditions in the rest of the world and the declining commodity prices. 
Now for the 2015 outlook, well, it's shaping up to be a much tougher year than we were expecting when we went through our preliminary review of 2015 prices. It's been definitely a developing story, as oil prices have continued to decline. No doubt it will be a major topic of discussion when we get to the Q&A in a few minutes.
With that quick recap of the themes, let's start with the review of the fourth quarter. 
Sales and revenues were $14.2 billion, and that was close to last year, actually down about 1% from $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Profit per share all in was $1.23 and $1.35, excluding restructuring costs, and that's down from $1.54 all in and $1.68 excluding restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Quarter-to-quarter restructuring costs were a little lower in '14, about $100 million of the fourth quarter versus about $130 million in Q4 of 2013, so not a lot of change there. Excluding restructuring costs, profit per share from the fourth quarter of the year ago to this fourth quarter declined $0.33. And there were several things that contributed to the lower profit.
First, we had an absence of several favorable items from the fourth quarter of 2013. We had $115 million of LIFO benefits in the fourth quarter of '13. We had a favorable legal settlement that was close to $70 million. We had gains on the sale of securities and currency gains in our Financial Products segment. And in the fourth quarter of 2013, Financial Products also had a favorable adjustment to their allowance, while they had another favorable allowance in 2014, but it was quite a bit less. 
Now in addition to the absence of those favorable items, we also had higher employee incentive compensation. That was about $110 million up in the quarter, and that was because our incentive compensation metrics for the full year turned out better than we expected when we set them at the beginning of the year. 
Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A combined were up in the quarter, but were down for the full year. While R&D was about flat for 2014, we'll talk about this in a bit in the outlook, but we are expecting some increase in 2015. We also had unfavorable inventory absorption of the quarter, and that's a result of a more significant inventory reduction in the fourth quarter of '14 than the fourth quarter of '13. 
Now we also had some positives in the quarter. Income tax versus Q4 of '13 was positive, about $0.11 a share. Material costs were favorable. And price realization, while up less than 1%, was a small positive.
Profit per share also benefited from a lower share count, and that was a result of share purchases in 2014.
So that's the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '13. 
Let's take a look at how we did versus the outlook. And we ended nearly spot on with sales and revenues, but profit per share was $0.12 lower than the outlook that we provided last October. We did have 1 positive item in the quarter, and that was the passage of the tax extenders. The major 2014 benefit for us was the R&D tax credit included in that. More than offsetting the favorable tax, we had some negatives. The most significant being the impact of negative inventory absorption. We were expecting a small inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, and we actually ended up taking inventory down $1.1 billion. That resulted in a substantial cost absorption headwind versus our outlook. While it was a hit to profit, we won't lower inventory. We've been working to reduce it and are happy to have it lower. 
Now in addition, price realization and sales mix were not quite as positive as we'd expected, and we had modest hedging losses. None of those were what I would describe as major in all on their own, but they all kind of went in the same direction. Now when you forecast, you almost never get everything right. And even when you're close in, there are always puts and takes. In the fourth quarter, other than the R&E Tax Credit, most of the elements of our forecast went the other way.
In summary, Q4 was right on with sales. We had a major reduction in inventory and we like that, but it continued to lower than expected profit. 
Okay, that's a quick run through of the fourth quarter versus the outlook. And before we get into the '15 outlook, I'd just like to do a quick recap of the full year 2014. And to help put it in perspective, I'm going to go back in time a little bit to 2012 to set the stage.
In 2012, that was before the substantial decline in mining. Our sales and revenues were about $66 billion. And as we ended 2012, we expected 2013 to be down because of mining, and we got that and a lot more than we expected. We revised 2013 down every quarter in 2013, looking for a bottom in mining. We ended 2013 with sales down $10 billion from 2012. At the end of 2013, we would have liked to have predicted a sales increase and recovery in 2014, but we started with a view that, that wasn't in the cards for 2014, with mining remaining weak and the global economy continuing with low par growth. We expected, as a result, 2014 sales to be about flat with 2013, and that's actually about what happened. The bad news is we weren't surprised by a large rebound in the global economy. The good news is we called it pretty close to what happened and didn't get surprised with continuing bad news. 
As we started 2014, we were expecting a relatively flat top line and a flat profit per share, excluding restructuring costs. We accomplished that and a bit more. 
Excluding restructuring, profit per share was $6.38 and that's up from $5.97 in 2013, again, excluding restructuring. And it was better than our original outlook of $5.85. 
We also did better than we expected with operating cash flow. Our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was $7.5 billion in 2014. In fact, 2 of the best 3 years we've ever had were 2013 and 2014. That helped enable us to repurchase $2 billion of Caterpillar stock in 2013 and another $4.2 billion in 2014. And it helped us -- helps set us up for increases in the dividend. We took the dividend up 15% in 2013 and 17% in 2014. 
Now in addition to the financial performance, we improved inventory turns in 2014. We improved our market position for Cat machines as well. In fact, it was our fourth consecutive year. And we've done that by holding price realization low. 2014 was another year well below 1%, and we've done it by providing customers with great products. While our Tier 4 introductions aren't over, we are very pleased with what's been introduced so far and customer and dealer feedback has been positive. 
Quality is also helping, and 2014 was the fourth consecutive year that the quality of the machines that we've delivered to our customers has improved. 
I already mentioned better inventory turns, and that was great. We're on a lean journey. And certainly, we have more room to improve there. 
I'll end this recap of 2014 with safety, and we probably don't really talk enough about it, but it really is a high priority. And for the last decade, we have made steady progress on improving safety, and I'm happy to say that improvement continued in 2014.
So all in all, fourth quarter profit was disappointing, but 2014 overall was a pretty good year financially, particularly considering the economic and industry dynamics we had to work with.
Okay. With that, let's go through the 2015 outlook. 
As I'm sure you picked up from our financial release this morning, we are more negative on prospects for 2015 than we were 3 months ago when we provided you with our preliminary view of 2015 sales and revenues. 
In recent weeks, with commodity price declines, our view of 2015 has certainly been a work in progress, and we just recently finalized the outlook. 
Back in October, we expected sales and revenues would be flat to slightly up. Our current view is that sales and revenues will be about $50 billion, and that's down over 9% from 2014. 
Without a doubt, the impact of substantially lower oil and gas prices is the most significant reason we're expecting lower sales in '15. From mid-October to today, oil prices have dropped from the mid-80s to the high 40s, and that's off prices that were around 100 for most of the first half of last year. With oil this low, we expect substantial reductions in producers CapEx and that it will be negative for our sales. 
Now I'm going to take a minute to put what we do in oil and gas into some perspective for you.
Most of our oil and gas related sales are in our Energy & Transportation segment. And to scale that a bit, in 2014, about 1/3 of Energy & Transportation's $22 billion in sales were directly related to oil and gas. Their oil and gas exposure is, however, diverse. They're on the front end with engines for drilling, engines, transmission and pressure pumps for well servicing. We have engines that go into compressors sets for gas gathering. We have engines and turbines that move oil along -- oil and gas along a pipeline. And our turbines are used extensively on offshore production platforms. 
Now in addition to those direct exposures in Energy & Transportation, there are some indirect exposures that are real, but a little bit more difficult to put a specific number on. 
For example, we saw marine engines and some go into vessels that service offshore oil and gas platforms. We are in the rail business with services and locomotives. And oil transport has become an increasing business for our rail customers. 
In terms of the 2015 outlook, we believe the direct part of oil and gas will that will be hurt the earliest and most significantly will be drilling and well servicing, particularly in the second half of the year. 
At this point, because of the scale and long-term nature of projects that use turbines, we don't expect much impact there in 2015. However, if oil and gas prices stay this depressed throughout 2015, there could be a negative impact for the turbine business after 2015. So those are the more direct impacts. 
Now there are other indirect impacts from substantially lower oil prices that we think can play into 2015
In countries, and in fact, in some areas of the U.S. where oil production is significant for government machines and local economies, it will likely be a negative for the sales of Construction Equipment and our Electric Power Generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building roads to service new wells, or it can be very indirect like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund government spending. 
Order of magnitude, roughly half of our expected year-over-year decline in sales is from both direct and indirect impacts from the fairly dramatic decline in oil prices. 
Now in addition to the impact of oil and gas, there are several other factors that are contributing to the decline in the sales and revenues outlook. 
Year-over-year, we expect the stronger dollar to be a sales headwind. Commodity prices in mining have also taken another leg down over the past few months. For example, when we provided our preliminary outlook last October, copper was still over $3 a pound. Today, it's in the mid-$2.50s. Order rates for our resource industries segment had been reasonably stable at low level, but the continued decline in commodity prices and continued efficiency improvements by our mining customers have caused us to lower our sales estimate for Resource Industries in 2015.
With weakness in agriculture, we are also expecting lower sales of industrial engines, and we expect our rail business to be down in 2015 after a great year in 2014. Now that's not a new development. We anticipated that and discussed that last October. And our expectation for the construction industry in China is also lower. Our sales over the past year have held up better in China than the industry overall. But with lower expectations for China construction, we think our 2015 sales in China will be down.
Okay, that's a run through of 2015 sales, the direct and some of the indirect impacts from dramatically lower oil, lower mining sales, a stronger dollar, lower sales in our rail business and weakness in construction outside the U.S., including China. 
So let's shift over to profit. 
We are expecting $4.60 a share all in for 2015 and $4.75, excluding restructuring. We are expecting to continue with restructuring actions in 2015, but with less costs than in 2014. In 2014, restructuring costs were $441 million, and we're expecting around another $150 million in 2015. 
Now excluding the restructuring, profit per share is expected to decline from $6.38 to $4.75, and that's a drop of about $1.63. 
I'm going to go through the headwinds and tailwinds in a moment, but before I do that, I just like to put the drop in profit in perspective with the sales.
Much of the sales change between 2014 and 2015 is related to oil and gas and mining, and those are 2 areas with higher than average variable margins. Despite that, our $4.75 per share profit outlook, again, excluding restructuring, reflects a decremental operating margin close to 25% and the impact of the higher tax rate, and that's mostly because the R&D tax credit wasn't extended past 2014. Now our target range for decremental operating margin is 25% to 30%, and our 2015 has us closer to the bottom end of that, which is good. But as you might expect, there are plenty of pluses and minuses that go into that. 
On a positive side, we expect lower incentive compensation in 2015. In 2014, incentive compensation was higher than target, and that's because we exceeded our incentive metrics that we have set earlier in the year. 
We are expecting variable manufacturing costs to be favorable in 2015. And that's a result of our continuing work to remove costs and improve efficiency and lower material costs. 
Now this might be counterintuitive for some, but the stronger dollar, while negative for our sales, is positive for our costs overall, and that's because of our non- U.S. operations and our material purchases outside the U.S. And overall, that's expected to be a positive for profit.
And we are planning another small, but positive contribution from price realization. We are expecting an increase of less than 0.5%. Now the headwinds to 2015 profit include higher R&D expense. 
Now for the company in total, I'm going back a couple of years here again, for the company in total, we lowered R&D 17% in 2013 from 2012, and that was in response to the decline in sales. Now excluding the impact of incentive compensation, R&D remained at about that level in 2014. In 2015, we are planning to increase R&D. We are in a very competitive and changing world, and products and services do matter. We understand the need for profit in the short term, but we also need to invest in the future. And that's the main reason R&D is increasing. It's primarily for new and updated products and more work on new technologies that have application across the company.
In addition to R&D, cost absorption from lower inventory is also expected to be a headwind. With the decline in sales, we expect more inventory reduction in 2015 than we had in 2014. And while that's a positive for cash flow, it will have a negative impact on costs. And as I mentioned a minute ago, with the greater proportion of our expected decline in sales occurring in the higher-margin products, we anticipate an unfavorable mix impact from sales on our operating margin.
We also have higher pension expense for our defined benefit plans. And that's a result of lower interest rates at the end of 2015 and in a revision in the estimate of lifespans for the folks in our plans. 
Okay, that's a run through of what we expect for 2015. 
The bottom line for us is -- in our business is that it has been and continues to be a tough environment for many of the industries that we're in. Mining is weak, and operating below what we think a normal level is and far below the prior peak. From an industry volume standpoint, North American construction, while better than it was a couple years ago, is still about 15% below the prior peak. Europe is about over 40% off its prior peak and China is still 60% off its prior peak. So room to grow in all those areas.
Energy & Transportation, it's a diverse business serving oil and gas, transportation, power generation and industrial applications. It's been a great business for us and we are expecting another good year in 2015. It will be good, but not quite as good as 2014. 
Based on our outlook for 2015 sales and revenues, 2015 is going to be our third consecutive year of sales decline. And to put that in some perspective, that's happened only 1 other time in the history of our company, and that was during the Great Depression in 1930, '31 and '32. 
Overall, we think we've done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We have improved our market position and our operations, but we would certainly like to see a better global economy. 
So that's it. And with that, we are ready for questions."

But -- and on the restructuring, we do expect favorable variable costs next year above and beyond just material costs. So we do have some improvement baked in for that. But we do have, again, and I'm just a little bit repeating what you said, mix is negative. We've got a $5 billion decline in sales. And that's -- that is, I think -- between that and some of the continuation of our lean journey, we are likely to take inventory down more next year. And we have somewhere around a 15% to 18% negative hit to profit from cost absorption on that. So that's going to be negative for the year.

So U.S. still positive, but probably not quite as positive as we thought before. Almost every place else in the world, to some degree, negative. We're still not getting any decent economic growth in Europe. The developing countries, Brazil, China, are still, to say, challenged. We're actually expecting a little bit lower GDP growth in China next year than we had in -- or in '15 than we had in '14. So we are looking for the -- outside the U.S., construction to be weak. We also have quite a bit of the sales impact from the stronger dollar showing up in construction as well. So it will bear most of the brunt of that. We've taken a stab at trying to estimate the impact of lower oil in the oil producing regions. I will say that, that -- that's probably -- that that's tough to forecast. We don't exactly know what the Saudis, the Nigerians are going to do, but using those 2 oil exporting countries as an example, there are certainly many more. We don't exactly know what they're going to do, but we've taken our best shot so we've taken sales out of those regions as well. But I think if you were to combine it into kind of a nutshell, we are looking down 5% to 10%. Currency is a chunk of that. Outside the U.S., generally, oil-producing regions, weaker. U.S., not including oil, stronger."

So generically, what we've done over the last, I don't know, 30 years basically is try to diversify our cost base to try and help it match up a little bit better with sales. So if you take 2015, for example, the stronger dollar, as we convert all those sales from local currencies around the world into dollars, it's going to translate into fewer dollars. The flip side of that is we have substantial manufacturing operations outside the U.S. and that largely mitigates the profit impact. So we have, in the case of a stronger dollar, a decent sizable negative impact on sales, but a positive impact on costs. Usually, it's not too big of an impact one way or the other on profit, although it can depend on which currency moves and how much."

The rising dollar we expect 2015 would see more of that will not be good for U.S. manufacturing nor the U.S. economy. How that is offset against the lower oil diesel gasoline price, I don't know how it works out, but certainly, anybody producing in Japan, the U.K. or Europe, particularly Germany, is going to have -- it has had quite an advantage over their American competitors. And I would expect that to have an impact on the U.S. in some way. We've worked hard to, as Mike said, diversify our manufacturing footprint. We are large exporters and have a large cost base in Japan, Europe, U.K. as well, so we are taking advantage of that, as you mentioned, when it course its way through to the bottom line.

So considering the lead times there and the kind of projects that are there, you tend not to get big short-term swings. It's not like somebody's coming in and buying something out of inventory off the shelf. So we don't really see much of an impact with Solar for 2015.

And the backlog in mining is getting to a point where we just don't have that capability to continue to do that. So in light of copper coming down around $2.50, iron ore prices severely depressed and coal price is down, we are taking a cautious view of 2014 from mining. We were hoping that 2014 was the bottom, but given everything else that's going on in the world, at least, our estimate of China GDP being a little lower next year than this year, I think the prospects for our rebound in '15 are just probably not there. So that's negative. There is also probably a small negative in there, I don't want to overplay this, but they do sell into the oil sands in Canada.

Net debt-to-cap being around 17 and carrying about $6 billion in cash. And we had another very good year, $7.5 billion of operating cash flow. And our CapEx was fairly well below our plan level for the year. I think you'll find 1.6 being a fairly low number for us and well below what we thought in '14. And so we finished the year with net debt-to-cap around 18 and around 7 being in cash in cash, and so we are very happy with where the balance sheet is. In fact, our working capital as a percent of sales as the rate of lean and other initiatives is at a record low, around 12%. So all that said is that we feel really good about where our balance sheet is positioning. Our priorities outside of maintaining the debt rating would be growth. And we talked a little bit earlier with Andy. We're spending a significant increase on R&D in '15 over '14, and that's a big part of how we want to deploy cash, and of course, that hits the P&L. I think CapEx, around $1.6 billion is a reasonable number going into '15. There's a decent amount of, that's normal replacement type activities that go in. Our manufacturing facility. As you know, we are fairly heavy vertically integrated, which creates a little higher replacement kind of demand for capital. So I would say that's fairly reasonable going into that. You may want to ask a little bit and I'll just jump to it around deployment of cash. So I would say that we're continuing to look across opportunities. We're not announcing anything today, but that activity remains very important to us and we're continuing to focus on that. The energy valuation typically dropped, and so that's something that many are looking at, including us. But we're really happy with the balance sheet position.

This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A or Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2014, and with our 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2014, and it's also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition to that, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, and that can also be found in our financial release which, again, is on our caterpillar.com website.
Okay. With that, let's get started. In this morning, we'll be reviewing our financial results for the quarter, for the full year of 2014, and we'll spend some time on our 2015 outlook. Now as I do each of those, I just want to kind of go through the major themes right now. And for the quarter, sales were about as expected, but we were disappointed with lower profit in the quarter within our outlook. And that a significant decline in inventory in the quarter, more so than we anticipated, was a large contributing factor to that. 
For the full year of 2014, the major theme continues to be around execution and better profit per share than 2013 and the outlook that we started the year with. 
We're pleased with what we've accomplished in 2014, given the continued weak economic conditions in rest of the world and the declining commodity prices. 
Now for the 2015 outlook, well, it's shaping up to be a much tougher year than we were expecting when we went through our preliminary review of 2015 with you all last October. It's been definitely a developing story, as oil prices have continued to decline. No doubt, it will be a major topic of discussion when we get to the Q&A in a few minutes.
With that quick recap of the themes, let's start with the review of the fourth quarter. 
Sales and revenues were $14.2 billion, and that was close to last year, actually down about 1% from $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Profit per share all in was $1.23, and $1.35, excluding restructuring costs, and that's down from $1.54 all in, and $1.68, excluding restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Quarter-to-quarter restructuring costs were a little lower in '14, about $100 million in the fourth quarter versus about $130 million in Q4 of 2013, so not a lot of change there. Excluding restructuring costs, profit per share from the fourth quarter of the year ago to this fourth quarter declined $0.33. And there were several things that contributed to the lower profit.
First, we had an absence of several favorable items from the fourth quarter of 2013. We had $115 million of LIFO benefits in the fourth quarter of '13. We had a favorable legal settlement that was close to $70 million. We had gains on the sale of securities and currency gains in our Financial Products segment. And in the fourth quarter of 2013, Financial Products also had a favorable adjustment to their allowance. Now they had another favorable allowance in 2014, but it was quite a bit less. 
Now in addition to the absence of those favorable items, we also had higher employee incentive compensation. That was about $110 million up in the quarter, and that was because our incentive compensation metrics for the full year turned out better than we expected when we set them at the beginning of the year. 
Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A and R&D combined were up in the quarter, but were down for the full year. While R&D was about flat for 2014, we'll talk about this in a bit in the outlook, but we are expecting some increase in 2015. We also had unfavorable inventory absorption in the quarter, and that's a result of a more significant inventory reduction in the fourth quarter of '14 than the fourth quarter of '13. 
Now we also had some positives in the quarter. Income tax versus Q4 of '13 was positive, about $0.11 a share. Material costs were favorable. And price realization, while up less than 1%, was a small positive.
Profit per share also benefited from a lower share count, and that was a result of share purchases in 2014.
So that's the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '13. 
Let's take a look at how we did versus the outlook. And we ended nearly spot on with sales and revenues, but profit per share was $0.12 lower than the outlook that we provided last October. We did have 1 positive item in the quarter, and that was the passage of the tax extenders. The major 2014 benefit for us was the R&D tax credit included in that. More than offsetting the favorable tax, we had some negatives. The most significant being the impact of negative inventory absorption. We were expecting a small inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, and we actually ended up taking inventory down $1.1 billion. That resulted in a substantial cost absorption headwind versus our outlook. While it was a hit to profit, we want lower inventory. We've been working to reduce it and are happy to have it lower. 
Now in addition, price realization and sales mix were not quite as positive as we'd expected, and we had modest hedging losses. None of those were what I would describe as major and all on their own, but they all kind of went in the same direction. When you forecast, you almost never get everything right. And even when you're close in total, there are always puts and takes. In the fourth quarter, other than the R&D tax credit, most of the elements of our forecast went the other way.
In summary, Q4 was right on with sales. We had a major reduction in inventory and we like that, but it continued to lower than expected profit. 
Okay. That's a quick run through of the fourth quarter versus the outlook. And before we get into the '15 outlook, I'd just like to do a quick recap of the full year 2014. And to help put it in perspective, I'm going to go back in time a little bit to 2012 to set the stage.
In 2012, that was before the substantial decline in mining. Our sales and revenues were about $66 billion. And as we ended 2012, we expected 2013 to be down because of mining, and we got that and a lot more than we expected. We revised 2013 down every quarter in 2013, looking for a bottom in mining. We ended 2013 with sales down $10 billion from 2012. At the end of 2013, we would have liked to have predicted a sales increase and recovery in 2014, but we started with a view that, that wasn't in the cards for 2014, with mining remaining weak and the global economy continuing with below par growth. We expected, as a result, 2014 sales to be about flat with 2013, and that's actually about what happened. The bad news is we weren't surprised by a large rebound in the global economy. The good news is we called it pretty close to what happened and didn't get surprised with continuing bad news. 
As we started 2014, we were expecting a relatively flat top line and relatively flat profit per share, excluding restructuring costs. We accomplished that and a bit more. 
Excluding restructuring, profit per share was $6.38 and that's up from $5.97 in 2013, again, excluding restructuring. And it was better than our original outlook of $5.85. 
We also did better than we expected with operating cash flow. Our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was $7.5 billion in 2014. In fact, 2 of the best 3 years we've ever had were 2013 and 2014. That helped enable us to repurchase $2 billion of Caterpillar stock in 2013 and another $4.2 billion in 2014. And it helped us -- helped set us up for increases in the dividend. We took the dividend up 15% in 2013 and 17% in 2014. 
Now in addition to the financial performance, we improved inventory turns in 2014. We improved our market position for CAT machines as well. In fact, it was our fourth consecutive year. And we've done that by holding price realization low. 2014 was another year well below 1%, and we've done it by providing customers with great products. While our Tier 4 introductions aren't over, we're very pleased with what's been introduced so far and customer and dealer feedback has been positive. 
Quality is also helping, and 2014 was the fourth consecutive year that the quality of the machines that we've delivered to our customers has improved. 
I already mentioned better inventory turns, and that was great. We're on a lean journey. And certainly, we have more room to improve there. 
I'll end this recap of 2014 with safety, and we probably don't really talk enough about it, but it really is a high priority. And for the last decade, we have made steady progress on improving safety, and I'm happy to say that improvement continued in 2014.
So all in all, fourth quarter profit was disappointing, but 2014 overall was a pretty good year financially, particularly considering the economic and industry dynamics we had to work with.
Okay. With that, let's go through the 2015 outlook. 
As I'm sure you picked up from our financial release this morning, we are more negative on prospects for 2015 than we were 3 months ago when we provided you with our preliminary view of 2015 sales and revenues. 
In recent weeks, with commodity price declines, our view of 2015 has certainly been a work in progress, and we've just recently finalized the outlook. 
Back in October, we expected sales and revenues would be flat to slightly up. Our current view is that sales and revenues will be about $50 billion, and that's down over 9% from 2014. 
Without a doubt, the impact of substantially lower oil and gas prices is the most significant reason we're expecting lower sales in '15. From mid-October to today, oil prices have dropped from the mid-80s to the high 40s, and that's off prices that were around $100 for most of the first half of last year. With oil this low, we expect substantial reductions in producers' CapEx and that it will be negative for our sales. 
Now I'm going to take a minute to put what we do in oil and gas into some perspective for you.
Most of our oil and gas-related sales are in our Energy & Transportation segment. And to scale that a bit, in 2014, about 1/3 of Energy & Transportation's $22 billion in sales were directly related to oil and gas. Their oil and gas exposure is, however, diverse. They're on the front end with engines for drilling; engines, transmission and pressure pumps for well servicing. We have engines that go into compressors sets for gas gathering. We have engines and turbines that move oil along -- oil and gas along a pipeline. And our turbines are used extensively on offshore production platforms. 
Now in addition to those direct exposures in Energy & Transportation, there are some indirect exposures that are real, but a little bit more difficult to put a specific number on. 
For example, we saw marine engines and some go into vessels that service offshore oil and gas platforms. We're in the rail business with services and locomotives. And oil transport has become an increasing business for our rail customers. 
In terms of the 2015 outlook, we believe the direct part of oil and gas will that will be hurt the earliest and most significantly will be drilling and well servicing, particularly in the second half of the year. 
At this point, because of the scale and long-term nature of projects that use turbines, we don't expect much impact there in 2015. However, if oil and gas prices stay this depressed throughout 2015, there could be a negative impact for the turbine business after 2015. So those are the more direct impacts. 
Now there are other indirect impacts from substantially lower oil prices that we think can play into 2015
In countries and, in fact, in some areas of the U.S. where oil production is significant for government agencies and local economies, it will likely be a negative for the sales of Construction Equipment and our Electric Power Generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building roads to service new wells, or it can be very indirect like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund government spending. 
Order of magnitude, roughly half of our expected year-over-year decline in sales is from both direct and indirect impacts from the fairly dramatic decline in oil prices. 
Now in addition to the impact of oil and gas, there are several other factors that are contributing to the decline in the sales and revenues outlook. 
Year-over-year, we expect the stronger dollar to be a sales headwind. Commodity prices in mining have also taken another leg down over the past few months. For example, when we provided our preliminary outlook last October, copper was still over $3 a pound. Today, it's in the mid-$2.50s. Order rates for our Resource Industries segment had been reasonably stable at low levels, but the continued decline in commodity prices and continued efficiency improvements by our mining customers have caused us to lower our sales estimate for Resource Industries in 2015.
With weakness in agriculture, we're also expecting lower sales of industrial engines and we expect our rail business to be down in 2015, after a great year in 2014. Now that's not a new development. We anticipated that and discussed that last October. And our expectation for the construction industry in China is also lower. Our sales over the past year have held up better in China than the industry overall. But with lower expectations for China construction, we think our 2015 sales in China will be down.
Okay. That's a run through of 2015 sales, the direct and some of the indirect impacts from dramatically lower oil, lower mining sales, a stronger dollar, lower sales in our rail business and weakness in construction outside the U.S., including China. 
So let's shift over to profit. 
We're expecting $4.60 a share all in for 2015, and $4.75, excluding restructuring. We are expecting to continue with restructuring actions in 2015, but with less cost than in 2014. In 2014, restructuring costs were $441 million, and we're expecting around another $150 million in 2015. 
Now excluding the restructuring, profit per share is expected to decline from $6.38 to $4.75, and that's a drop of about $1.63. 
I'm going to go through the headwinds and tailwinds in a moment, but before I do that, I just like to put the drop in profit in perspective with the sales.
Much of the sales change between 2014 and 2015 is related to oil and gas and mining, and those are 2 areas with higher than average variable margins. Despite that, our $4.75 per share profit outlook, again, excluding restructuring, reflects a decremental operating margin close to 25% and the impact of the higher tax rate and that's mostly because the R&D tax credit wasn't extended past 2014. Now our target range for decremental operating margin is 25% to 30%, and our 2015 has us closer to the bottom end of that, which is good. But as you might expect, there are plenty of pluses and minuses that go into that. 
On the positive side, we expect lower incentive compensation in 2015. In 2014, incentive compensation was higher than target, and that's because we exceeded our incentive metrics that we have set earlier in the year. 
We're expecting variable manufacturing costs to be favorable in 2015. And that's a result of our continuing work to remove costs and improve efficiency and lower material costs. 
Now this might be counterintuitive for some, but the stronger dollar, while negative for our sales, is positive for our costs overall, and that's because of our non-U.S. operations and our material purchases outside the U.S. And overall, that's expected to be a positive for profit.
And we're planning another small but positive contribution from price realization. And we're expecting an increase of less than 0.5%. 
Now the headwinds to 2015 profit include higher R&D expense. Now for the company in total, I'm going back a couple of years here again, for the company in total, we lowered R&D 17% in 2013 from 2012, and that was in response to the decline in sales. Now excluding the impact of incentive compensation, R&D remained at about that level in 2014. In 2015, we are planning to increase R&D. We are in a very competitive and changing world, and products and services do matter. We understand the need for profit in the short term, but we also need to invest in the future. And that's the main reason R&D is increasing. It's primarily for new and updated products and more work on new technologies that have application across the company.
In addition to R&D, cost absorption from lower inventory is also expected to be a headwind. With the decline in sales, we expect more inventory reduction in 2015 than we had in 2014. And while that's a positive for cash flow, it will have a negative impact on costs. And as I mentioned a minute ago, with the greater proportion of our expected decline in sales occurring in the higher-margin products, we anticipate an unfavorable mix impact from sales on our operating margin.
We also have higher pension expense for our defined benefit plans, and that's a result of lower interest rates at the end of 2015 and in revision in the estimate of lifespans for the folks in our plans. 
Okay. That's a run through of what we expect for 2015. 
The bottom line for us is -- in our business is that it has been and continues to be a tough environment for many of the industries that we're in. Mining is weak and operating below what we think a normal level is and far below the prior peak. From an industry volume standpoint, North American construction, while better than it was a couple years ago, is still about 15% below the prior peak. Europe is about over 40% off its prior peak and China is still 60% off its prior peak. So room to grow in all those areas.
Energy & Transportation, it's a diverse business serving oil and gas, transportation, power generation and industrial applications. It's been a great business for us and we are expecting another good year in 2015. It will be good, but not quite as good as 2014. 
Based on our outlook for 2015 sales and revenues, 2015 is going to be our third consecutive year of sales decline. And to put that in some perspective, that's happened only 1 other time in the history of our company, and that was during the Great Depression in 1930, '31 and '32. 
Overall, we think we've done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We have improved our market position and our operations, but we would certainly like to see a better global economy. 
So that's it. And with that, we are ready for questions."

We always attempt to try if we can to pick up a middle reasonable ground. You did pick out, currency is a modest positive, and you're right, the incentive comp is positive as well. But -- and on the restructuring, we do expect favorable variable costs next year above and beyond just material costs. So we do have some improvement baked in for that. But we do have, again, and I'm just a little bit repeating what you said, mix is negative. We've got a $5 billion decline in sales. And that's -- that is, I think -- between that and some of the continuation of our lean journey, we are likely to take inventory down more next year. And we have somewhere around a 15% to 18% negative hit to profit from cost absorption on that. So that's going to be negative for the year. R&D is probably not going to be quite back to the 2012 levels, but we do need to fund some more.

So U.S., still positive, but probably not quite as positive as we thought before. Almost every place else in the world, to some degree, negative. We're still not getting any decent economic growth in Europe. The developing countries, Brazil, China, are still, let's just say, challenged. We're actually expecting a little bit lower GDP growth in China next year than we had in -- or in '15 than we had in '14. So we're looking for the -- outside the U.S., construction to be weak. We also have quite a bit of the sales impact from the stronger dollar showing up in construction as well. So it will bear most of the brunt of that. We've taken a stab at trying to estimate the impact of lower oil in the oil-producing regions. I will say that, that's probably -- that, that's tough to forecast. We don't exactly know what the Saudis, the Nigerians are going to do, but just using those 2 oil-exporting countries as an example, there are certainly many more. We don't exactly know what they're going to do, but we've taken our best shot, so we've taken sales out of those regions as well.

And I think, if you kind of parse out what -- how we're describing construction around the world, probably not that far off with what the rental houses are saying."

So we have another $150 million in for restructuring costs in 2015, but I wouldn't say there are any large scale plant closures in there. Certainly, $150 million wouldn't cover that. We have done a pretty good job on trying to flex our period costs down, so that's where we're really focused, not so much on bricks and mortar."

We talked a lot with you guys about improving our balance sheet coming out of '08. And when we got to the end of '13, we were very happy with our balance sheet in terms of our debt-to-cap, net debt-to-cap being around $17 billion, and carrying about $6 billion in cash. And we had another very good year, $7.5 billion of operating cash flow. And our CapEx was fairly well below our plan level for the year. I think you'll find $1.6 billion being a fairly low number for us and well below what we thought in '14. And so we finished the year with net debt-to-cap around $18 billion and around $7 billion in cash, and so we're very happy with where the balance sheet is. In fact, our working capital as a percent of sales as we've worked on lean and other initiatives is at a record low, around 12%. So all that said is that we feel really good about where our balance sheet is positioned. Our priorities outside of maintaining the debt rating would be growth. And we talked a little bit earlier with Andy. We're spending a significant increase on R&D in '15 over '14, and that's a big part of how we want to deploy cash, and of course, that hits the P&L. I think, CapEx, around $1.6 billion isn't a reasonable number going into '15. There's a decent amount of that, that's normal replacement type activities that go in our manufacturing facility. As you know, we're fairly highly vertically integrated, which creates a little higher replacement kind of demand for capital. So I would say that's fairly reasonable going into that. You may want to ask a little bit and I'll just jump to it around deployment of cash. So I would say that we're continuing to look at growth opportunities. We're not announcing anything today, but that activity remains very important to us and we're continuing to focus on that. The energy valuation typically dropped, and so that's something that many are looking at, including us. But we're really happy with the balance sheet position. We'll consider stock repurchase as we head into 2015. But again, those priorities remained pretty well the same for us, Ann."

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A or Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2014, and with our 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2014, and it's also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition to that, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, and that can also be found in our financial release which, again, is on our caterpillar.com website.
Okay. With that, let's get started. In this morning, we'll be reviewing our financial results for the quarter, for the full year of 2014, and we'll spend some time on our 2015 outlook. Now as I do each of those, I just want to kind of go through the major themes right now. And for the quarter, sales were about as expected, but we were disappointed with lower profit in the quarter within our outlook. And that a significant decline in inventory in the quarter, more so than we anticipated, was a large contributing factor to that. 
For the full year of 2014, the major theme continues to be around execution and better profit per share than 2013 and the outlook that we started the year with. 
We're pleased with what we've accomplished in 2014, given the continued weak economic conditions in rest of the world and the declining commodity prices. 
Now for the 2015 outlook, well, it's shaping up to be a much tougher year than we were expecting when we went through our preliminary review of 2015 with you all last October. It's been definitely a developing story, as oil prices have continued to decline. No doubt, it will be a major topic of discussion when we get to the Q&A in a few minutes.
With that quick recap of the themes, let's start with the review of the fourth quarter. 
Sales and revenues were $14.2 billion, and that was close to last year, actually down about 1% from $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Profit per share all in was $1.23, and $1.35, excluding restructuring costs, and that's down from $1.54 all in, and $1.68, excluding restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Quarter-to-quarter restructuring costs were a little lower in '14, about $100 million in the fourth quarter versus about $130 million in Q4 of 2013, so not a lot of change there. Excluding restructuring costs, profit per share from the fourth quarter of the year ago to this fourth quarter declined $0.33. And there were several things that contributed to the lower profit.
First, we had an absence of several favorable items from the fourth quarter of 2013. We had $115 million of LIFO benefits in the fourth quarter of '13. We had a favorable legal settlement that was close to $70 million. We had gains on the sale of securities and currency gains in our Financial Products segment. And in the fourth quarter of 2013, Financial Products also had a favorable adjustment to their allowance. Now they had another favorable allowance in 2014, but it was quite a bit less. 
Now in addition to the absence of those favorable items, we also had higher employee incentive compensation. That was about $110 million up in the quarter, and that was because our incentive compensation metrics for the full year turned out better than we expected when we set them at the beginning of the year. 
Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A and R&D combined were up in the quarter, but were down for the full year. While R&D was about flat for 2014, we'll talk about this in a bit in the outlook, but we are expecting some increase in 2015. We also had unfavorable inventory absorption in the quarter, and that's a result of a more significant inventory reduction in the fourth quarter of '14 than the fourth quarter of '13. 
Now we also had some positives in the quarter. Income tax versus Q4 of '13 was positive, about $0.11 a share. Material costs were favorable. And price realization, while up less than 1%, was a small positive.
Profit per share also benefited from a lower share count, and that was a result of share purchases in 2014.
So that's the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '13. 
Let's take a look at how we did versus the outlook. And we ended nearly spot on with sales and revenues, but profit per share was $0.12 lower than the outlook that we provided last October. We did have 1 positive item in the quarter, and that was the passage of the tax extenders. The major 2014 benefit for us was the R&D tax credit included in that. More than offsetting the favorable tax, we had some negatives. The most significant being the impact of negative inventory absorption. We were expecting a small inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, and we actually ended up taking inventory down $1.1 billion. That resulted in a substantial cost absorption headwind versus our outlook. While it was a hit to profit, we want lower inventory. We've been working to reduce it and are happy to have it lower. 
Now in addition, price realization and sales mix were not quite as positive as we'd expected, and we had modest hedging losses. None of those were what I would describe as major and all on their own, but they all kind of went in the same direction. When you forecast, you almost never get everything right. And even when you're close in total, there are always puts and takes. In the fourth quarter, other than the R&D tax credit, most of the elements of our forecast went the other way.
In summary, Q4 was right on with sales. We had a major reduction in inventory and we like that, but it continued to lower than expected profit. 
Okay. That's a quick run through of the fourth quarter versus the outlook. And before we get into the '15 outlook, I'd just like to do a quick recap of the full year 2014. And to help put it in perspective, I'm going to go back in time a little bit to 2012 to set the stage.
In 2012, that was before the substantial decline in mining. Our sales and revenues were about $66 billion. And as we ended 2012, we expected 2013 to be down because of mining, and we got that and a lot more than we expected. We revised 2013 down every quarter in 2013, looking for a bottom in mining. We ended 2013 with sales down $10 billion from 2012. At the end of 2013, we would have liked to have predicted a sales increase and recovery in 2014, but we started with a view that, that wasn't in the cards for 2014, with mining remaining weak and the global economy continuing with below par growth. We expected, as a result, 2014 sales to be about flat with 2013, and that's actually about what happened. The bad news is we weren't surprised by a large rebound in the global economy. The good news is we called it pretty close to what happened and didn't get surprised with continuing bad news. 
As we started 2014, we were expecting a relatively flat top line and relatively flat profit per share, excluding restructuring costs. We accomplished that and a bit more. 
Excluding restructuring, profit per share was $6.38 and that's up from $5.97 in 2013, again, excluding restructuring. And it was better than our original outlook of $5.85. 
We also did better than we expected with operating cash flow. Our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was $7.5 billion in 2014. In fact, 2 of the best 3 years we've ever had were 2013 and 2014. That helped enable us to repurchase $2 billion of Caterpillar stock in 2013 and another $4.2 billion in 2014. And it helped us -- helped set us up for increases in the dividend. We took the dividend up 15% in 2013 and 17% in 2014. 
Now in addition to the financial performance, we improved inventory turns in 2014. We improved our market position for CAT machines as well. In fact, it was our fourth consecutive year. And we've done that by holding price realization low. 2014 was another year well below 1%, and we've done it by providing customers with great products. While our Tier 4 introductions aren't over, we're very pleased with what's been introduced so far and customer and dealer feedback has been positive. 
Quality is also helping, and 2014 was the fourth consecutive year that the quality of the machines that we've delivered to our customers has improved. 
I already mentioned better inventory turns, and that was great. We're on a lean journey. And certainly, we have more room to improve there. 
I'll end this recap of 2014 with safety, and we probably don't really talk enough about it, but it really is a high priority. And for the last decade, we have made steady progress on improving safety, and I'm happy to say that improvement continued in 2014.
So all in all, fourth quarter profit was disappointing, but 2014 overall was a pretty good year financially, particularly considering the economic and industry dynamics we had to work with.
Okay. With that, let's go through the 2015 outlook. 
As I'm sure you picked up from our financial release this morning, we are more negative on prospects for 2015 than we were 3 months ago when we provided you with our preliminary view of 2015 sales and revenues. 
In recent weeks, with commodity price declines, our view of 2015 has certainly been a work in progress, and we've just recently finalized the outlook. 
Back in October, we expected sales and revenues would be flat to slightly up. Our current view is that sales and revenues will be about $50 billion, and that's down over 9% from 2014. 
Without a doubt, the impact of substantially lower oil and gas prices is the most significant reason we're expecting lower sales in '15. From mid-October to today, oil prices have dropped from the mid-80s to the high 40s, and that's off prices that were around $100 for most of the first half of last year. With oil this low, we expect substantial reductions in producers' CapEx and that it will be negative for our sales. 
Now I'm going to take a minute to put what we do in oil and gas into some perspective for you.
Most of our oil and gas-related sales are in our Energy & Transportation segment. And to scale that a bit, in 2014, about 1/3 of Energy & Transportation's $22 billion in sales were directly related to oil and gas. Their oil and gas exposure is, however, diverse. They're on the front end with engines for drilling; engines, transmission and pressure pumps for well servicing. We have engines that go into compressors sets for gas gathering. We have engines and turbines that move oil along -- oil and gas along a pipeline. And our turbines are used extensively on offshore production platforms. 
Now in addition to those direct exposures in Energy & Transportation, there are some indirect exposures that are real, but a little bit more difficult to put a specific number on. 
For example, we saw marine engines and some go into vessels that service offshore oil and gas platforms. We're in the rail business with services and locomotives. And oil transport has become an increasing business for our rail customers. 
In terms of the 2015 outlook, we believe the direct part of oil and gas will that will be hurt the earliest and most significantly will be drilling and well servicing, particularly in the second half of the year. 
At this point, because of the scale and long-term nature of projects that use turbines, we don't expect much impact there in 2015. However, if oil and gas prices stay this depressed throughout 2015, there could be a negative impact for the turbine business after 2015. So those are the more direct impacts. 
Now there are other indirect impacts from substantially lower oil prices that we think can play into 2015
In countries and, in fact, in some areas of the U.S. where oil production is significant for government agencies and local economies, it will likely be a negative for the sales of Construction Equipment and our Electric Power Generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building roads to service new wells, or it can be very indirect like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund government spending. 
Order of magnitude, roughly half of our expected year-over-year decline in sales is from both direct and indirect impacts from the fairly dramatic decline in oil prices. 
Now in addition to the impact of oil and gas, there are several other factors that are contributing to the decline in the sales and revenues outlook. 
Year-over-year, we expect the stronger dollar to be a sales headwind. Commodity prices in mining have also taken another leg down over the past few months. For example, when we provided our preliminary outlook last October, copper was still over $3 a pound. Today, it's in the mid-$2.50s. Order rates for our Resource Industries segment had been reasonably stable at low levels, but the continued decline in commodity prices and continued efficiency improvements by our mining customers have caused us to lower our sales estimate for Resource Industries in 2015.
With weakness in agriculture, we're also expecting lower sales of industrial engines and we expect our rail business to be down in 2015, after a great year in 2014. Now that's not a new development. We anticipated that and discussed that last October. And our expectation for the construction industry in China is also lower. Our sales over the past year have held up better in China than the industry overall. But with lower expectations for China construction, we think our 2015 sales in China will be down.
Okay. That's a run through of 2015 sales, the direct and some of the indirect impacts from dramatically lower oil, lower mining sales, a stronger dollar, lower sales in our rail business and weakness in construction outside the U.S., including China. 
So let's shift over to profit. 
We're expecting $4.60 a share all in for 2015, and $4.75, excluding restructuring. We are expecting to continue with restructuring actions in 2015, but with less cost than in 2014. In 2014, restructuring costs were $441 million, and we're expecting around another $150 million in 2015. 
Now excluding the restructuring, profit per share is expected to decline from $6.38 to $4.75, and that's a drop of about $1.63. 
I'm going to go through the headwinds and tailwinds in a moment, but before I do that, I just like to put the drop in profit in perspective with the sales.
Much of the sales change between 2014 and 2015 is related to oil and gas and mining, and those are 2 areas with higher than average variable margins. Despite that, our $4.75 per share profit outlook, again, excluding restructuring, reflects a decremental operating margin close to 25% and the impact of the higher tax rate and that's mostly because the R&D tax credit wasn't extended past 2014. Now our target range for decremental operating margin is 25% to 30%, and our 2015 has us closer to the bottom end of that, which is good. But as you might expect, there are plenty of pluses and minuses that go into that. 
On the positive side, we expect lower incentive compensation in 2015. In 2014, incentive compensation was higher than target, and that's because we exceeded our incentive metrics that we have set earlier in the year. 
We're expecting variable manufacturing costs to be favorable in 2015. And that's a result of our continuing work to remove costs and improve efficiency and lower material costs. 
Now this might be counterintuitive for some, but the stronger dollar, while negative for our sales, is positive for our costs overall, and that's because of our non-U.S. operations and our material purchases outside the U.S. And overall, that's expected to be a positive for profit.
And we're planning another small but positive contribution from price realization. And we're expecting an increase of less than 0.5%. 
Now the headwinds to 2015 profit include higher R&D expense. Now for the company in total, I'm going back a couple of years here again, for the company in total, we lowered R&D 17% in 2013 from 2012, and that was in response to the decline in sales. Now excluding the impact of incentive compensation, R&D remained at about that level in 2014. In 2015, we are planning to increase R&D. We are in a very competitive and changing world, and products and services do matter. We understand the need for profit in the short term, but we also need to invest in the future. And that's the main reason R&D is increasing. It's primarily for new and updated products and more work on new technologies that have application across the company.
In addition to R&D, cost absorption from lower inventory is also expected to be a headwind. With the decline in sales, we expect more inventory reduction in 2015 than we had in 2014. And while that's a positive for cash flow, it will have a negative impact on costs. And as I mentioned a minute ago, with the greater proportion of our expected decline in sales occurring in the higher-margin products, we anticipate an unfavorable mix impact from sales on our operating margin.
We also have higher pension expense for our defined benefit plans, and that's a result of lower interest rates at the end of 2015 and in revision in the estimate of lifespans for the folks in our plans. 
Okay. That's a run through of what we expect for 2015. 
The bottom line for us is -- in our business is that it has been and continues to be a tough environment for many of the industries that we're in. Mining is weak and operating below what we think a normal level is and far below the prior peak. From an industry volume standpoint, North American construction, while better than it was a couple years ago, is still about 15% below the prior peak. Europe is about over 40% off its prior peak and China is still 60% off its prior peak. So room to grow in all those areas.
Energy & Transportation, it's a diverse business serving oil and gas, transportation, power generation and industrial applications. It's been a great business for us and we are expecting another good year in 2015. It will be good, but not quite as good as 2014. 
Based on our outlook for 2015 sales and revenues, 2015 is going to be our third consecutive year of sales decline. And to put that in some perspective, that's happened only 1 other time in the history of our company, and that was during the Great Depression in 1930, '31 and '32. 
Overall, we think we've done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We have improved our market position and our operations, but we would certainly like to see a better global economy. 
So that's it. And with that, we are ready for questions."

So U.S., still positive, but probably not quite as positive as we thought before. Almost every place else in the world, to some degree, negative. We're still not getting any decent economic growth in Europe. The developing countries, Brazil, China, are still, let's just say, challenged. We're actually expecting a little bit lower GDP growth in China next year than we had in -- or in '15 than we had in '14. So we're looking for the -- outside the U.S., construction to be weak. We also have quite a bit of the sales impact from the stronger dollar showing up in construction as well. So it will bear most of the brunt of that. We've taken a stab at trying to estimate the impact of lower oil in the oil-producing regions. I will say that, that's probably -- that, that's tough to forecast. We don't exactly know what the Saudis, the Nigerians are going to do, but just using those 2 oil-exporting countries as an example, there are certainly many more. We don't exactly know what they're going to do, but we've taken our best shot, so we've taken sales out of those regions as well.

We're large exporters and have a large cost base in Japan, Europe, U.K. as well, so we are taking advantage of that, as he mentioned, when it works its way through to the bottom line. But overall, I don't think it's a very good positive for U.S. manufacturing and it's a policy issue, I think, that is concerning."

So considering the lead times there and the kind of projects that are there, you tend not to get big short-term swings. It's not like somebody's coming in and buying something out of inventory off the shelf. So we don't really see much of an impact with solar for 2015.

And the backlog in mining is getting to a point where we just don't have the capability to continue to do that. So in light of copper coming down around $2.50, iron ore prices severely depressed and coal price is down, we're taking a cautious view of 2014 for mining. We were hoping that 2014 was the bottom, but given everything else that's going on in the world, at least our estimate of China GDP being a little lower next year than this year, I think, the prospects for a rebound in '15 are just probably not there.

I think, the dealers are actually doing a pretty good job on rental. It's been an increasing piece of their business.

We talked a lot with you guys about improving our balance sheet coming out of '08. And when we got to the end of '13, we were very happy with our balance sheet in terms of our debt-to-cap, net debt-to-cap being around $17 billion, and carrying about $6 billion in cash. And we had another very good year, $7.5 billion of operating cash flow. And our CapEx was fairly well below our plan level for the year. I think you'll find $1.6 billion being a fairly low number for us and well below what we thought in '14. And so we finished the year with net debt-to-cap around $18 billion and around $7 billion in cash, and so we're very happy with where the balance sheet is. In fact, our working capital as a percent of sales as we've worked on lean and other initiatives is at a record low, around 12%. So all that said is that we feel really good about where our balance sheet is positioned. Our priorities outside of maintaining the debt rating would be growth. And we talked a little bit earlier with Andy. We're spending a significant increase on R&D in '15 over '14, and that's a big part of how we want to deploy cash, and of course, that hits the P&L. I think, CapEx, around $1.6 billion isn't a reasonable number going into '15. There's a decent amount of that, that's normal replacement type activities that go in our manufacturing facility. As you know, we're fairly highly vertically integrated, which creates a little higher replacement kind of demand for capital. So I would say that's fairly reasonable going into that. You may want to ask a little bit and I'll just jump to it around deployment of cash. So I would say that we're continuing to look at growth opportunities. We're not announcing anything today, but that activity remains very important to us and we're continuing to focus on that. The energy valuation typically dropped, and so that's something that many are looking at, including us. But we're really happy with the balance sheet position. We'll consider stock repurchase as we head into 2015. But again, those priorities remained pretty well the same for us, Ann."

This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A or Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2014, and with our 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2014, and it's also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition to that, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, and that can also be found in our financial release which, again, is on our caterpillar.com website.
Okay. With that, let's get started. In this morning, we'll be reviewing our financial results for the quarter, for the full year of 2014, and we'll spend some time on our 2015 outlook. Now as I do each of those, I just want to kind of go through the major themes right now. And for the quarter, sales were about as expected, but we were disappointed with lower profit in the quarter than our outlook. And that a significant decline in inventory in the quarter, more so than we anticipated, was a large contributing factor to that. 
For the full year of 2014, the major theme continues to be around execution and better profit per share than 2013 and the outlook that we started the year with. 
We're pleased with what we've accomplished in 2014, given the continued weak economic conditions in rest of the world and the declining commodity prices. 
Now for the 2015 outlook, well, it's shaping up to be a much tougher year than we were expecting when we went through our preliminary review of 2015 with you all last October. It's been definitely a developing story, as oil prices have continued to decline. No doubt, it will be a major topic of discussion when we get to the Q&A in a few minutes.
With that quick recap of the themes, let's start with the review of the fourth quarter. 
Sales and revenues were $14.2 billion, and that was close to last year, actually down about 1% from $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Profit per share all in was $1.23, and $1.35, excluding restructuring costs, and that's down from $1.54 all in, and $1.68, excluding restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Quarter-to-quarter, restructuring costs were a little lower in '14, about $100 million in the fourth quarter versus about $130 million in Q4 of 2013, so not a lot of change there. Excluding restructuring costs, profit per share from the fourth quarter of the year ago to this fourth quarter declined $0.33. And there were several things that contributed to the lower profit.
First, we had an absence of several favorable items from the fourth quarter of 2013. We had $115 million of LIFO benefits in the fourth quarter of '13. We had a favorable legal settlement that was close to $70 million. We had gains on the sale of securities and currency gains in our Financial Products segment. And in the fourth quarter of 2013, Financial Products also had a favorable adjustment to their allowance. Now they had another favorable allowance in 2014, but it was quite a bit less. 
Now in addition to the absence of those favorable items, we also had higher employee incentive compensation. That was about $110 million up in the quarter, and that was because our incentive compensation metrics for the full year turned out better than we expected when we set them at the beginning of the year. 
Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A and R&D combined were up in the quarter, but were down for the full year. While R&D was about flat for 2014, we'll talk about this in a bit in the outlook, but we are expecting some increase in 2015. We also had unfavorable inventory absorption in the quarter, and that's a result of a more significant inventory reduction in the fourth quarter of '14 than the fourth quarter of '13. 
Now we also had some positives in the quarter. Income tax versus Q4 of '13 was positive, about $0.11 a share. Material costs were favorable. And price realization, while up less than 1%, was a small positive.
Profit per share also benefited from a lower share count, and that was a result of share purchases in 2014.
So that's the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '13. 
Let's take a look at how we did versus the outlook. And we ended nearly spot on with sales and revenues, but profit per share was $0.12 lower than the outlook that we provided last October. We did have 1 positive item in the quarter, and that was the passage of the tax extenders. The major 2014 benefit for us was the R&D tax credit included in that. More than offsetting the favorable tax, we had some negatives, the most significant being the impact of negative inventory absorption. We were expecting a small inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, and we actually ended up taking inventory down $1.1 billion. That resulted in a substantial cost absorption headwind versus our outlook. While it was a hit to profit, we want lower inventory. We've been working to reduce it and are happy to have it lower. 
Now in addition, price realization and sales mix were not quite as positive as we'd expected, and we had modest hedging losses. None of those were what I would describe as major and all on their own, but they all kind of went in the same direction. When you forecast, you almost never get everything right. And even when you're close in total, there are always puts and takes. In the fourth quarter, other than the R&D tax credit, most of the elements of our forecast went the other way.
In summary, Q4 was right on with sales. We had a major reduction in inventory and we like that, but it continued to lower than expected profit. 
Okay. That's a quick run through of the fourth quarter versus the outlook. And before we get into the '15 outlook, I'd just like to do a quick recap of the full year 2014. And to help put it in perspective, I'm going to go back in time a little bit to 2012 to set the stage.
In 2012, that was before the substantial decline in mining. Our sales and revenues were about $66 billion. And as we ended 2012, we expected 2013 to be down because of mining, and we got that and a lot more than we expected. We revised 2013 down every quarter in 2013, looking for a bottom in mining. We ended 2013 with sales down $10 billion from 2012. At the end of 2013, we would have liked to have predicted a sales increase and recovery in 2014, but we started with a view that that wasn't in the cards for 2014, with mining remaining weak and the global economy continuing with below par growth. We expected, as a result, 2014 sales to be about flat with 2013, and that's actually about what happened. The bad news is we weren't surprised by a large rebound in the global economy. The good news is we called it pretty close to what happened and didn't get surprised with continuing bad news. 
As we started 2014, we were expecting a relatively flat top line and relatively flat profit per share, excluding restructuring costs. We accomplished that and a bit more. 
Excluding restructuring, profit per share was $6.38 and that's up from $5.97 in 2013, again, excluding restructuring. And it was better than our original outlook of $5.85. 
We also did better than we expected with operating cash flow. Our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was $7.5 billion in 2014. In fact, 2 of the best 3 years we've ever had were 2013 and 2014. That helped enable us to repurchase $2 billion of Caterpillar stock in 2013 and another $4.2 billion in 2014. And it helped us -- helped set us up for increases in the dividend. We took the dividend up 15% in 2013 and 17% in 2014. 
Now in addition to the financial performance, we improved inventory turns in 2014. We improved our market position for CAT machines as well. In fact, it was our fourth consecutive year. And we've done that by holding price realization low. 2014 was another year well below 1%, and we've done it by providing customers with great products. While our Tier 4 introductions aren't over, we're very pleased with what's been introduced so far and customer and dealer feedback has been positive. 
Quality is also helping, and 2014 was the fourth consecutive year that the quality of the machines that we've delivered to our customers has improved. 
I already mentioned better inventory turns, and that was great. We're on a lean journey. And certainly, we have more room to improve there. 
I'll end this recap of 2014 with safety, and we probably don't really talk enough about it, but it really is a high priority. And for the last decade, we have made steady progress on improving safety, and I'm happy to say that improvement continued in 2014.
So all in all, fourth quarter profit was disappointing, but 2014 overall was a pretty good year financially, particularly considering the economic and industry dynamics we had to work with.
Okay. With that, let's go through the 2015 outlook. 
As I'm sure you picked up from our financial release this morning, we are more negative on prospects for 2015 than we were 3 months ago when we provided you with our preliminary view of 2015 sales and revenues. 
In recent weeks, with commodity price declines, our view of 2015 has certainly been a work in progress, and we've just recently finalized the outlook. 
Back in October, we expected sales and revenues would be flat to slightly up. Our current view is that sales and revenues will be about $50 billion, and that's down over 9% from 2014. 
Without a doubt, the impact of substantially lower oil and gas prices is the most significant reason we're expecting lower sales in '15. From mid-October to today, oil prices have dropped from the mid-80s to the high 40s, and that's off prices that were around $100 for most of the first half of last year. With oil this low, we expect substantial reductions in producers' CapEx and that it will be negative for our sales. 
Now I'm going to take a minute to put what we do in oil and gas into some perspective for you.
Most of our oil and gas-related sales are in our Energy & Transportation segment. And to scale that a bit, in 2014, about 1/3 of Energy & Transportation's $22 billion in sales were directly related to oil and gas. Their oil and gas exposure is, however, diverse. They're on the front end with engines for drilling; engines, transmission and pressure pumps for well servicing. We have engines that go into compressors sets for gas gathering. We have engines and turbines that move oil along -- oil and gas along a pipeline. And our turbines are used extensively on offshore production platforms. 
Now in addition to those direct exposures in Energy & Transportation, there are some indirect exposures that are real, but a little bit more difficult to put a specific number on. 
For example, we saw marine engines and some go into vessels that service offshore oil and gas platforms. We're in the rail business with services and locomotives. And oil transport has become an increasing business for our rail customers. 
In terms of the 2015 outlook, we believe the direct part of oil and gas will that will be hurt the earliest and most significantly will be drilling and well servicing, particularly in the second half of the year. 
At this point, because of the scale and long-term nature of projects that use turbines, we don't expect much impact there in 2015. However, if oil and gas prices stay this depressed throughout 2015, there could be a negative impact for the turbine business after 2015. So those are the more direct impacts. 
Now there are other indirect impacts from substantially lower oil prices that we think can play into 2015.
In countries and, in fact, in some areas of the U.S. where oil production is significant for government agencies and local economies, it will likely be a negative for the sales of Construction Equipment and our Electric Power Generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building roads to service new wells, or it can be very indirect like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund government spending. 
Order of magnitude, roughly half of our expected year-over-year decline in sales is from both direct and indirect impacts from the fairly dramatic decline in oil prices. 
Now in addition to the impact of oil and gas, there are several other factors that are contributing to the decline in the sales and revenues outlook. 
Year-over-year, we expect the stronger dollar to be a sales headwind. Commodity prices in mining have also taken another leg down over the past few months. For example, when we provided our preliminary outlook last October, copper was still over $3 a pound. Today, it's in the mid-$2.50s. Order rates for our Resource Industries segment had been reasonably stable at low levels, but the continued decline in commodity prices and continued efficiency improvements by our mining customers have caused us to lower our sales estimate for Resource Industries in 2015.
With weakness in agriculture, we're also expecting lower sales of industrial engines and we expect our rail business to be down in 2015, after a great year in 2014. Now that's not a new development. We anticipated that and discussed that last October. And our expectation for the construction industry in China is also lower. Our sales over the past year have held up better in China than the industry overall. But with lower expectations for China construction, we think our 2015 sales in China will be down.
Okay. That's a run through of 2015 sales, the direct and some of the indirect impacts from dramatically lower oil, lower mining sales, a stronger dollar, lower sales in our rail business and weakness in construction outside the U.S., including China. 
So let's shift over to profit. 
We're expecting $4.60 a share all in for 2015, and $4.75, excluding restructuring. We are expecting to continue with restructuring actions in 2015, but with less cost than in 2014. In 2014, restructuring costs were $441 million, and we're expecting around another $150 million in 2015. 
Now excluding the restructuring, profit per share is expected to decline from $6.38 to $4.75, and that's a drop of about $1.63. 
I'm going to go through the headwinds and tailwinds in a moment, but before I do that, I just like to put the drop in profit in perspective with the sales.
Much of the sales change between 2014 and 2015 is related to oil and gas and mining, and those are 2 areas with higher than average variable margins. Despite that, our $4.75 per share profit outlook, again, excluding restructuring, reflects a decremental operating margin close to 25% and the impact of the higher tax rate and that's mostly because the R&D tax credit wasn't extended past 2014. Now our target range for decremental operating margin is 25% to 30%, and our 2015 has us closer to the bottom end of that, which is good. But as you might expect, there are plenty of pluses and minuses that go into that. 
On the positive side, we expect lower incentive compensation in 2015. In 2014, incentive compensation was higher than target, and that's because we exceeded our incentive metrics that we have set earlier in the year. 
We're expecting variable manufacturing costs to be favorable in 2015. And that's a result of our continuing work to remove costs and improve efficiency and lower material costs. 
Now this might be counterintuitive for some, but the stronger dollar, while negative for our sales, is positive for our costs overall, and that's because of our non-U.S. operations and our material purchases outside the U.S. And overall, that's expected to be a positive for profit.
And we're planning another small but positive contribution from price realization. And we're expecting an increase of less than 0.5%. 
Now the headwinds to 2015 profit include higher R&D expense. Now for the company in total, I'm going back a couple of years here again, for the company in total, we lowered R&D 17% in 2013 from 2012, and that was in response to the decline in sales. Now excluding the impact of incentive compensation, R&D remained at about that level in 2014. In 2015, we are planning to increase R&D. We are in a very competitive and changing world, and products and services do matter. We understand the need for profit in the short term, but we also need to invest in the future. And that's the main reason R&D is increasing. It's primarily for new and updated products and more work on new technologies that have application across the company.
In addition to R&D, cost absorption from lower inventory is also expected to be a headwind. With the decline in sales, we expect more inventory reduction in 2015 than we had in 2014. And while that's a positive for cash flow, it will have a negative impact on costs. And as I mentioned a minute ago, with the greater proportion of our expected decline in sales occurring in the higher-margin products, we anticipate an unfavorable mix impact from sales on our operating margin.
We also have higher pension expense for our defined benefit plans, and that's a result of lower interest rates at the end of 2015 and in revision in the estimate of lifespans for the folks in our plans. 
Okay. That's a run through of what we expect for 2015. 
The bottom line for us is -- in our business is that it has been and continues to be a tough environment for many of the industries that we're in. Mining is weak and operating below what we think a normal level is and far below the prior peak. From an industry volume standpoint, North American construction, while better than it was a couple years ago, is still about 15% below the prior peak. Europe is about over 40% off its prior peak and China is still 60% off its prior peak. So room to grow in all those areas.
Energy & Transportation, it's a diverse business serving oil and gas, transportation, power generation and industrial applications. It's been a great business for us and we are expecting another good year in 2015. It will be good, but not quite as good as 2014. 
Based on our outlook for 2015 sales and revenues, 2015 is going to be our third consecutive year of sales decline. And to put that in some perspective, that's happened only 1 other time in the history of our company, and that was during the Great Depression in 1930, '31 and '32.

We always attempt to try if we can to pick up a middle reasonable ground. You did pick out, currency is a modest positive, and you're right, the incentive comp is positive as well. But -- and on the restructuring, we do expect favorable variable costs next year above and beyond just material costs. So we do have some improvement baked into that. But we do have, again, and I'm just a little bit repeating what you said, mix is negative. We've got a $5 billion decline in sales. And that's -- that is, I think -- between that and some of the continuation of our lean journey, we are likely to take inventory down more next year. And we have somewhere around a 15% to 18% negative hit to profit from cost absorption on that. So that's going to be negative for the year.

So U.S., still positive, but probably not quite as positive as we thought before. Almost every place else in the world, to some degree, negative. We're still not getting any decent economic growth in Europe. The developing countries, Brazil, China, are still, let's just say, challenged. We're actually expecting a little bit lower GDP growth in China next year than we had in -- or in '15 than we had in '14. So we're looking for the -- outside the U.S., construction to be weak. We also have quite a bit of the sales impact from the stronger dollar showing up in construction as well. So it will bear most of the brunt of that. We've taken a stab at trying to estimate the impact of lower oil in the oil-producing regions. I will say that, that's probably -- that, that's tough to forecast. We don't exactly know what the Saudis, the Nigerians are going to do, but just using those 2 oil-exporting countries as an example, there are certainly many more. We don't exactly know what they're going to do, but we've taken our best shot, so we've taken sales out of those regions as well.

We talked a lot with you guys about improving our balance sheet coming out of '08. And when we got to the end of '13, we were very happy with our balance sheet in terms of our debt-to-cap, net debt-to-cap being around $17 billion, and carrying about $6 billion in cash. And we had another very good year, $7.5 billion of operating cash flow. And our CapEx was fairly well below our plan level for the year. I think you'll find $1.6 billion being a fairly low number for us and well below what we thought in '14. And so we finished the year with net debt-to-cap around $18 billion and around $7 billion in cash, and so we're very happy with where the balance sheet is. In fact, our working capital as a percent of sales as we've worked on lean and other initiatives is at a record low, around 12%. So all that said is that we feel really good about where our balance sheet is positioned. Our priorities outside of maintaining the debt rating would be growth. And we talked a little bit earlier with Andy. We're spending a significant increase on R&D in '15 over '14, and that's a big part of how we want to deploy cash, and of course, that hits the P&L. I think CapEx, around $1.6 billion isn't a reasonable number going into '15. There's a decent amount of that that's normal replacement type activities that go in our manufacturing facility. As you know, we're fairly highly vertically integrated, which creates a little higher replacement kind of demand for capital. So I would say that's fairly reasonable going into that. You may want to ask a little bit and I'll just jump to it around deployment of cash. So I would say that we're continuing to look at growth opportunities. We're not announcing anything today, but that activity remains very important to us and we're continuing to focus on that. The energy valuation typically dropped, and so that's something that many are looking at, including us. But we're really happy with the balance sheet position. We'll consider stock repurchase as we head into 2015. But again, those priorities remained pretty well the same for us, Ann."

If you like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors Section of our caterpillar.com website. It'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate that make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2015, and it's also in our forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.
In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release. And again, it's posted at the caterpillar.com.
Okay, with that, let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing financial results for the first quarter and our revised outlook for 2015. And then there are about 3 points that I'd like to start with actually before we get into the detail. And the first is that from a macro standpoint, and in our view, not much has changed since our last earnings conference call in January. So we're staying pretty focused on the things that we do have some control of, and that's execution and operational improvement. Things like safety, quality, market share, efficiency, cost control, inventory turns and cash flow. And we continue to make progress.
And that brings me to my second point. Given the environment we're in, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Sales in the quarter were pretty close to what we expected, and we were pleased with the bottom line.
And that brings me to my third point. And that's a reminder of what we said in our year-end conference call back in January. [ph] We said that we expected the year to start out stronger than it would end, and that's still what we expect. And that's probably evident to you if you consider our first quarter actual results and what we're expecting for the first year.
Okay, with those 3 points, let's get into the quarter. Sales and revenues were $12.7 billion, and that was about 4% less than the $13.2 billion that we had in the first quarter last year. $342 million of that decline in sales was a result of a stronger dollar, and sales volume was unfavorable $295 million. Those 2 items were partially offset by a small improvement in price realization. That was $105 million, definitely in the right direction, but less than 1%.
Now the only region in the world that was up was North America, and that was up 9%. The North American improvement was pretty much across the board in each of our -- with each of our segments being in positive territory.
Outside of North America, that wasn't the case, and sales in each of our segments were down in Latin America, Europe Africa/Middle East and in the Asia Pacific region. In total, sales and revenues were off 18% in Latin America, and sales of all of our equipment segments, that's Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation were down double digits. Construction was off 23%, and a sizable portion of that was the absence of a large order from the Brazilian government that we had in the first quarter last year and weaker construction activity in general in the region, particularly Brazil. Resource Industries was also down 23% in Latin America, reflecting continuing weakness in mining. And that's pretty much the case in every region. And Energy & Transportation was down 11%.
Sales and revenues in the Europe Africa/Middle East region were down 12%. Construction Industries was off 14%, and most of that was from less favorable dealer inventory changes and the impact of currency on our sales.
Resource Industries was also off 14%, again weak mining. And Energy & Transportation was down 8%.
Sales and revenues in Asia Pacific were down 13%, with the most significant decline in Construction Industries at 21%. Construction Industries were down substantially in China and lower in Japan as a result of the stronger dollar versus the yen. Our sales in Japan, which are in yen, essentially translated into fewer dollars. Okay, that's a recap of sales.
Profit per share, though, was higher in the first quarter than it was in the first quarter a year ago. This year, it was $1.81 per share. A year ago, in the first quarter, it was $1.44 a share.
Now we had restructuring cost in both quarters. In the first quarter of last year, we had $0.17 per share of restructuring cost, and that was mostly from the actions that we took in our European operations. This year, we had $0.05 per share of restructuring costs in the first quarter. So excluding restructuring, profit per share improved from $1.61 a year ago to $1.86 in the current quarter -- in the first quarter. Now the primary reason profit per share was up was: number one was the $120 million gain that we had from the sale of our remaining ownership in what was our third-party logistics business. We also had, as I mentioned a minute ago, $105 million of positive price realization, and we had $77 million of favorable currency impact that helped operating profit. And I'm just going to stop there for a minute and chat about currency. It's a subject that, for us, seems to be frequently misunderstood. Now I'd just like to clarify things again. We do have substantial sales that are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And when the dollar strengthens, that causes those sales to translate into fewer dollars, and that's a negative for our top line. That said, we also have substantial manufacturing operations and we source substantial purchase material outside the U.S. So our factories outside the U.S. allows sourcing outside the U.S. And that results in lower cost when translated to U.S. dollars. And that's exactly what happened this quarter. Sales translated into fewer dollars. As I mentioned a little bit ago, $342 million fewer. However, the impact on cost was favorable $419 million, and the net operating profit was positive $77 million. While we're not 100% exactly balanced in our currency exposures, we do have reasonably offsetting sales and cost positions that usually keep the profit impact of exchange rates swings to a reasonably manageable level. Okay, that's the story on currency. I'll kind of get back to profit now.
I'd already talked about the positive items, and offsetting those positives for the quarter, we did have lower sales volume, and that was negative to our operating profit, about $83 million, and we had higher cost. The most significant cost factor was a change in the timing of expense related to divesting of stock-based compensation. The timing change won't have an impact on full year versus 2014, but it did add to the costs in the first quarter. Okay, that's a quick run-through of profit versus the first quarter last year.
Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Machinery and Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was a little over $1 billion in the quarter, but that was about $800 million lower than the first quarter last year. And most of that decline came from higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of this year, and they are based on performance in 2014. We used about $400 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. And with relatively modest needs for CapEx this year, we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2015. And as you might expect, the timing and the amount that we ultimately repurchase, well, that will be subject to business and market conditions as we progress through the year and our cash appointment priority. Our balance sheet remained strong with a debt to total capital ratio of 37.1%. And that's about right in the middle of our targeted 30% to 45% range. And it was slightly favorable versus year-end 2014. If you net cash with the debt, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 18.3%.
Now before we get into the revised outlook, I'll just recap changes in the order backlog over the last quarter because I suspect many of you are interested in that. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of $16.5 billion, and that's about $800 million lower than the year-end 2014. The decline was split between Construction Industries and Resource Industries. You might have expected that Energy & Transportation would've also declined from year-end as a result of weakness in the oil industry. It was in total, however, about flat. We did have a decline in the backlog because of weakness in oil, but that was about offset by an increase in the backlog for locomotives.
Okay, with that, let me go through the 2015 outlook. As I've started out, in terms of overall world economic growth, we don't expect much change from the outlook that we've provided with our year-end results in January. And the same goes for our sales and revenues. We're holding it at about $50 billion for 2015. Now while we're not changing the sales outlook, just as a reminder, we do expect 2015 to be over $5 billion lower than 2014. And as we said last January, and I'll reiterate today, the impact of substantially lower oil prices is the most significant reason for the decline. And we still think the most significant impact from oil will be from engines and other equipment that we sell for drilling and well servicing. And that's the spot where we expect a large drop in demand this year. We've already started to see the impact of that in our order backlog as new orders have not kept pace with sales and the backlog is declining. And we'll start seeing that its sales over the course of [indiscernible] We also expect that indirect effects from substantially lower oil prices will be negative in 2015 versus 2014. In countries and in some regions of the U.S. where oil production is significant to either government receipts or for the local economies, it will likely be negative for sales of construction equipment and for electric power generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building a road to service a new well. Or it can be very indirect, like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund spending. Because many of those construction-related impacts are indirect, it does make it tough to measure. But anecdotally, we believe we're already starting to see the impact of that in our Construction business.
Now in addition to oil, there are several other factors that are contributing to the year-over-year decline in sales. The stronger dollar is a headwind to sales, but again not profit. Commodity prices and mining are generally weak, particularly iron ore and coal, and that's negative for mining and our Resource Industries segment. With weaknesses in agriculture, we're expecting lower sales of industrial engines. And we expect our rail business to be down in 2015, after a great year in 2014. And we expect weakness in the Construction Industries of key developing countries like China and Brazil. And that was certainly evident in our first quarter. So that's a recap of our year-over-year changes down from 2014, but no change in the top line outlook for 2015. We did raise the profit outlook again this morning. Our previous outlook was $4.60 per share all in and $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. This morning, we raised the profit outlook to $4.70 per share all in and $5 per share excluding restructuring costs. Now the changes from the previous outlook include more restructuring activity. We've increased our restructuring cost estimate from about $150 million expected for the year, up $100 million to about $250 million, with almost all of the increase related to facilities that produce mining products. We added the $120 million gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining ownership in the third-party logistics business. That wasn't in our previous outlook. And based on our first quarter actual results, we made some additional improvements to the profit outlook. While we held the top line and made a modest improvement to the bottom line of our outlook, 2015 is still shaping up to be an uncertain and challenging year. There continues to be softness in Latin America, particularly Brazil. China growth is concerning. The stability and scale of economic recovery in the United States remains concerning. Europe is still a question mark. Mining hasn't shown improvement yet. And while we're still planning a sharp decline in our oil-related sales in 2015, there's still a concern around that.
So to wrap up and move on to the Q&A portion of the call, sales and revenues in the first quarter were about as we expected, and we had a solid profit quarter. We repurchased 400 million of shares in the quarter. The balance sheet remains strong, and we're very focused on operational performance and cost control. But it still looks like a tough year and we've not seen meaningful signs of recovery in many of our cyclical businesses.
So with that, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

We have order of magnitude of 180 million dealers or 180 dealers roughly around the world. And at any given point in time, you've got some of them that probably have a little too much and some that have probably a little too little.

So what we actually sold in the quarter, at least in terms of new equipment, was fairly balanced between those 3 subsectors. But if you look at what was ordered and what we think is going to happen for sales as the year unfolds, probably not a lot of change in total for construction, but a bit more of a shift to BCP, smaller machines. I think part of that is, in countries like China where the selling season is very late in the year, that helped excavation sales and then that pales down later in the year.

I think the segment that is doing -- the segments that are doing better right now are construction and Energy & Transportation. Construction, in particular, did a little bit better.

I can't remember the third, but probably the third last year as well. It's just a tough business right now. It's dog eat dog. And although a lot of that product that we sell is dollar-based, the sales are conducted in dollars a lot in mining. Some of our key competition like Komatsu probably has more of yen cost base than [indiscernible] being aggressive. So it's a tough industry."

Euro, Brazilian currency, pound currency off 20% to 30% in the last year. You know all of our competitors aren't in the U.S. So it's a -- it really is a competitive environment out there, but we are not giving up our pins goals, our market share goals. We're doing as well as we can be expected in a tough market that we are. Certainly, our cost management the last couple of years has helped that. Our lean manufacturing, where we generated cost advantage, has helped. And we're still very much focused on market here.

There's been a lot of discussions about it, and we've been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We'll go through a process where we are cyclical. We've seen this before on the one side. We want to be ready for the upturn our business model to produce quality products, lower operating costs, produces price and service for us the dealers and repeat business. And so on that side, given the fact that our sales can move fairly dramatically through the cycles, we want to be ready to be able to meet that demand. But on the other side, it's absolutely clear and a good question that this current economic environment presents a lot of opportunities. But we've been at this since 2013. And in fact, if you kind of add up what we've done in the last 3 years, including what we plan to do in '15, we're sort of roughly $900 million of restructuring cost. We've closed or downsized roughly 20 facilities, about 5 million of square feet during that period, again through '15 and about 15,000 employees, which is unfortunate. All in then, if you look at the benefit, we've mentioned to you before that we believe after '15, the benefit per year would be $400 million to $500 million per year. With what we've done, which we've had higher benefits on anticipated and what we have in place, we'll be at the high end or exceed that in terms of our benefits per year. And so it's a robust process. It stands by our products groups with involvement across all the facilities, all the regions. There's been some discussion about the facilities. It's very hard to disclose a single-store standard facility, in terms of the mining trucks it will be the same for each of [indiscernible] So those things just don't dollar out in terms of return to shareholders.

If you go back to 2012, we were 66 [indiscernible] in sales. We're $50 billion now. We've lost roughly $16 billion. 75% of that is mining. And we've held at a 25% decremental pass-through right in that range. And so there's a lot of things going on that support that, including lean and material cost. But I would say that we're pretty happy with that pass-through over that 3-year period. We've done that with little price, higher quality and growing market shares. I'm not saying we won't have more to do, but that process is ongoing, and we've been pretty active in it."

I mean, there are a small pluses and minuses. But by and large, you can look at our full year, take out our first quarter and think about the remainder as the close to what we're thinking."

If you like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors Section of our caterpillar.com website. It'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2015, and it's also in our forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.
In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release. And again, it's posted at caterpillar.com.
Okay. With that, let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing financial results for the first quarter and our revised outlook for 2015. And then, there are about 3 points that I'd like to start with actually before we get into the details. And the first is that from a macro standpoint, in our view, not much has changed since our last earnings conference call in January. So we're staying pretty focused on the things that we do have some control of, and that's execution and operational improvement. Things like safety, quality, market share, efficiency, cost control, inventory turns and cash flow. And we continue to make progress.
And that brings me to my second point. Given the environment we're in, we were pleased with our first quarter results. Sales in the quarter were pretty close to what we expected, and we were pleased with the bottom line.
And that brings me to my third point. And that's a reminder of what we said in our year-end conference call back in January. We said that we expected the year to start out stronger than it would end, and that's still what we expect. And that's probably evident to you if you consider our first quarter actual results and what we're expecting for the first year.
Okay. With those 3 points, let's get into the quarter. Sales and revenues were $12.7 billion, and that was about 4% less than the $13.2 billion that we had in the first quarter last year. $342 million of that decline in sales was a result of a stronger dollar, and sales volume was unfavorable $295 million. Those 2 items were partially offset by a small improvement in price realization. That was $105 million, definitely in the right direction, but less than 1%.
Now the only region in the world that was up was North America, and that was up 9%. The North American improvement was pretty much across the board in each of our -- with each of our segments being in positive territory.
Outside of North America, that wasn't the case, and sales in each of our segments were down in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and in the Asia Pacific region. In total, sales and revenues were off 18% in Latin America, and sales of all of our equipment segments, that's Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation were down double digits. Construction was off 23%, and a sizable portion of that was the absence of a large order from the Brazilian government that we had in the first quarter last year and weaker construction activity in general in the region, particularly Brazil. Resource Industries was also down 23% in Latin America, reflecting continuing weakness in mining. And that's pretty much the case in every region. And Energy & Transportation was down 11%.
Sales and revenues in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region were down 12%. Construction Industries was off 14%, and most of that was from less favorable dealer inventory changes and the impact of currency on our sales.
Resource Industries was also off 14%, again, weak mining. And Energy & Transportation was down 8%.
Sales and revenues in Asia Pacific were down 13%, with the most significant decline in Construction Industries at 21%. Construction Industries were down substantially in China and lower in Japan as a result of the stronger dollar versus the yen. Our sales in Japan, which are in yen, essentially translated into fewer dollars. 
Okay. That's a recap of sales. Profit per share, though, was higher in the first quarter than it was in the first quarter a year ago. This year, it was $1.81 per share. A year ago, in the first quarter, it was $1.44 a share.
Now we had restructuring cost in both quarters. In the first quarter of last year, we had $0.17 per share of restructuring cost, and that was mostly from the actions that we took in our European operations. This year, we had $0.05 per share of restructuring costs in the first quarter. So excluding restructuring, profit per share improved from $1.61 a year ago to $1.86 in the current quarter -- in the first quarter. Now the primary reason profit per share was up, number one, was the $120 million gain that we had from the sale of our remaining ownership in what was our third-party logistics business. We also had, as I mentioned a minute ago, $105 million of positive price realization, and we had $77 million of favorable currency impact that helped operating profit. And I'm just going to stop here for a minute and chat about currency. It's a subject that, for us, seems to be frequently misunderstood. Now I'd just like to clarify things again. We do have substantial sales that are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And when the dollar strengthens, that causes those sales to translate into fewer dollars, and that's a negative for our top line. That said, we also have substantial manufacturing operations and we source substantial purchase material outside the U.S. So our factories outside the U.S. allows sourcing outside the U.S. And that results in lower cost when translated to U.S. dollars. And that's exactly what happened this quarter. Sales translated into fewer dollars. As I mentioned a little bit ago, $342 million fewer. However, the impact on cost was favorable $419 million, and the net to operating profit was positive $77 million. While we're not 100% exactly balanced in our currency exposures, we do have reasonably offsetting sales and cost positions that usually keep the profit impact of exchange rate swings to a reasonably manageable level. 
Okay. That's the story on currency. I'll kind of get back to profit now. I'd already talked about the positive items, and offsetting those positives for the quarter, we did have lower sales volume, and that was negative to our operating profit, about $83 million, and we had higher cost. The most significant cost factor was a change in the timing of expense related to divesting of stock-based compensation. The timing change won't have an impact on full year versus 2014, but it did add to cost in the first quarter. 
Okay. That's a quick run-through of profit versus the first quarter last year. Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was a little over $1 billion in the quarter, but that was about $800 million lower than the first quarter last year. And most of that decline came from higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of this year, and they are based on performance in 2014. We used about $400 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. And with relatively modest needs for CapEx this year, we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2015. And as you might expect, the timing and the amount that we ultimately repurchase, well, that will be subject to business and market conditions as we progress through the year and on our cash deployment priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to total capital ratio of 37.1%. And that's about right in the middle of our targeted 30% to 45% range. And it was slightly favorable versus year-end 2014. If you net cash with the debt, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 18.3%.
Now before we get into the revised outlook, I'll just recap changes in the order backlog over the last quarter because I suspect many of you are interested in that. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of $16.5 billion, and that's about $800 million lower than the year-end 2014. The decline was split between Construction Industries and Resource Industries. You might have expected that Energy & Transportation would've also declined from year-end as a result of weakness in the oil industry. It was, in total, however, about flat. We did have a decline in the backlog because of weakness in oil, but that was about offset by an increase in the backlog for locomotives.
Okay. With that, let me go through the 2015 outlook. As I've started out, in terms of overall world economic growth, we don't expect much change from the outlook that we provided with our year-end results in January. And the same goes for our sales and revenues, we're holding it at about $50 billion for 2015. 
Now while we're not changing the sales outlook, just as a reminder, we do expect 2015 to be over $5 billion lower than 2014. And as we said last January, and I'll reiterate today, the impact of substantially lower oil prices is the most significant reason for the decline. And we still think the most significant impact from oil will be from engines and other equipment that we sell for drilling and well servicing. And that's the spot where we expect a large drop in demand this year. We've already started to see the impact of that in our order backlog as new orders have not kept pace with sales, and the backlog is declining. And we'll start seeing that hit sales over the course of 2015. We also expect that indirect effects from substantially lower oil prices will be negative in 2015 versus 2014. In countries and in some regions of the U.S. where oil production is significant for either government receipts or for the local economies, it will likely be negative for sales of construction equipment and for our electric power generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building a road to service a new well, or it can be very indirect, like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund spending. Because many of those construction-related impacts are indirect, it does make it tough to measure. But anecdotally, we believe we're already starting to see the impacts of that in our Construction business.
Now in addition to oil, there are several other factors that are contributing to the year-over-year decline in sales. The stronger dollar is a headwind to sales, but again, not profit. Commodity prices in mining are generally weak, particularly iron ore and coal, and that's negative for mining in our Resource Industries segment. With weaknesses in agriculture, we're expecting lower sales of industrial engines. And we expect our rail business to be down in 2015 after a great year in 2014. And we expect weakness in the Construction Industries of key developing countries like China and Brazil. And that was certainly evident in our first quarter. So that's a recap of our year-over-year changes, down from 2014, but no change in the top line outlook for 2015. We did raise the profit outlook again this morning. Our previous outlook was $4.60 per share all-in, and $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. This morning, we raised the profit outlook to $4.70 per share all-in, and $5 per share excluding restructuring costs. 
Now the changes from the previous outlook include more restructuring activity. We've increased our restructuring cost estimate from about $150 million expected for this year, up $100 million to about $250 million, with almost all of the increase related to facilities that produce mining products. We added the $120 million gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining ownership in the third-party logistics business that wasn't in our previous outlook. And based on our first quarter actual results, we made some additional improvements to the profit outlook. While we held the top line and made a modest improvement to the bottom line of our outlook, 2015 is still shaping up to be an uncertain and challenging year. There continues to be softness in Latin America, particularly Brazil. China growth is concerning. The stability and scale of economic recovery in the United States remains concerning. Europe is still a question mark. Mining hasn't shown improvement yet. And while we're still planning a sharp decline in our oil-related sales in 2015, there's still a concern around that.
So to wrap up and move on to the Q&A portion of the call, sales and revenues in the first quarter were about as we expected, and we had a solid profit quarter. We repurchased 400 million of shares in the quarter. The balance sheet remains strong, and we're very focused on operational performance and cost control. But it still looks like a tough year and we've not seen meaningful signs of recovery in many of our cyclical businesses.
So with that, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

So no, I wouldn't say we added anything for that. Now we did add to restructuring costs. And down the road, after those are complete, those should definitely lead to more benefits. But actually, in the short term, there are related costs for things like rearrangement that aren't included in the number that can tend to be a little bit negative around the time you're actually doing it. So I'd say, on balance, that is relative to our original outlook, not a big reason for change. We took the profit outlook up, mostly because of very good cost control in the first quarter. I know we don't give quarterly guidance, but we were a little better than we thought we were going to be in the quarter. And some of that, of course, was timing. But some of it is spending that we don't think we'll have to make as the year goes on."

And partly because, I think, sometimes, it gets taken out of context. We expect an inventory build in the first quarter. The selling season from dealers to end customers tends to be heavier in the summertime, and so dealers add the inventories ahead of summertime. That occurred this year in Construction Industries. We have order of magnitude of 180 million dealers -- or 180 dealers roughly around the world. And at any given point in time, you've got some of them that probably have a little too much and some that have probably a little too little. If we look at our months of supply on hand, we kind of try to judge that in a reasonable range and we do look at that by region. And by and large, I think, our dealer inventory, we would say, is in a reasonable range. Now from here, we definitely believe it will come down over the course of the year. That happened last year.

Now I think, Resource Industries margins will likely come down as the year progresses. We kind of said before we thought something around breakeven was probably reasonable. I think that we're going to add the spending over the course of the year. We've got some R&D programs that we need to do there. We talked about that in January.

We do plan to spend some more on R&D. And we talked about that last January. We're looking at negative mix. We'll have negative product mix in E&T because of the decline in the oil business that's coming. We also expect some negative mix in Construction Industries. If you look at what they sold in the first quarter, it was relatively balanced between -- we have 3 pieces of construction, earthmoving, excavation and building construction products, or BCP, our smaller equipment. So what we actually sold in the quarter, at least in terms of new equipment, was fairly balanced between those 3 subsectors. But if you look at what was ordered and what we think is going to happen for sales as the year unfolds, probably not a lot of change in total for construction, but a bit more of a shift to BCP, smaller machines. I think, part of that is, in countries like China where the selling season is very early in the year, that helps excavation sales and then that tails down later in the year. So we're looking at some negative mix in construction as the year goes on. I don't think, for the year, we're not, at least in our -- contemplated in our outlook, we're not going to fall below double digits for construction. E&T operating profit percent will, I think, for sure, come down. Or I don't know, I guess, I can't say for sure.

I think, the segment that is doing -- the segments that are doing better right now are Construction and Energy & Transportation. Construction, in particular, did a little bit better. But part of that is really from a few -- 3 things. One is we had last year this big Brazilian order from the government. And while that was good volume, it was pretty low price. So without that, sort of our average price level is up a bit. We had some favorable geographic mix, and we did take list price increases, small, but up at the beginning of the year. So that all contributed a bit. I think, with Resource Industries, it's been down year-over-year for the last -- certainly, last couple of quarters. I can't remember the third, but probably in the third last year as well. It's just a tough business right now. It's dog eat dog.

There's been a lot of discussion about it, and we've been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We'll go through a process where we are cyclical, we've seen this before. On the one side, we want to be ready for the upturn. Our business model is to produce quality products, lowest on our operating costs, produces parts and service for us and the dealers and repeat business. And so on that side, given the fact that our sales can move fairly dramatically through the cycles, we want to be ready to be able to meet that demand. But on the other side, it's absolutely clear and a good question that this current economic environment presents a lot of opportunities. So we've been at this since 2013. In fact, if you kind of add up what we've done in the last 3 years, including what we plan to do in '15, we'll incur roughly $900 million of restructuring cost. We've closed or downsized roughly 20 facilities, about 5 million of square feet during that period, again, through '15, and about 15,000 employees, which is unfortunate. All-in then, if you look at the benefits, we mentioned to you before that we believe after '15, the benefit per year would be $400 million to $500 million per year. With what we've done, which we've had higher benefits on in the anticipated and what we have in place, we'll be at the high end or exceed that in terms of our benefits per year. And so it's a robust process. It's done by our product source planning group, with involvement across all the facilities, all the regions. There's been some discussion about big facilities. It's very hard to close a single source Decatur facility, in terms of the mining trucks, it would be the same for Peoria. So those things just don't dollar out in terms of return to shareholders. And we do it at net present value calculation through that. So I would say that we're continuing to look. We've added a few more in the mining space. If you go back to 2012, we were $66 billion in sales. We're $50 billion now. We've lost roughly $16 billion. 75% of that is mining. And we've held at a 25% decremental pull-through right in that range. And so there's a lot of things going on that support that, including lean and material cost. But I would say that we're pretty happy with that pull-through over that 3-year period. We've done that with little price and higher quality and growing market shares. So I'm not saying we won't have more to do, but that process is ongoing, and we've been pretty active in it."

We have, I think, marine sales up a bit higher in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. And much of the rest of the business is actually reasonably -- in fact, I just looked at this, this morning, kind of almost anticipating this question. The rest of the year, for most of the rest of the businesses are, by and large, relatively stable as we go through the year.

But I would say that we're in the driver's seat with cash generation, with our inventory turnover, raising our lean manufacturing, bring up cash.

That potentially could be a negative. I would say we're not really seeing a lot of that right now, outside of kind of the drilling and fracking where activity is off. Remember, though, and I think this needs to be said, a lot of our business in oil and gas, probably most of our business in oil and gas, is gas. And so far, that's held up pretty well. Demand for gas is good and the compression business is doing pretty well. So oil is just one piece of our oil and gas business.
Well, with that, I think, we're going to wrap it up. We're at the top of the hour. Thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you again next quarter."

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors Section of our caterpillar.com website. It'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2015, and it's also in our forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.
In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release. And again, it's posted at caterpillar.com.
Okay. With that, let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing financial results for the first quarter and our revised outlook for 2015. And then there are about 3 points that I'd like to start with, actually, before we get into the details. And the first is that from a macro standpoint, in our view, not much has changed since our last earnings conference call in January. So we're staying pretty focused on the things that we do have some control of, and that's execution and operational improvement. Things like safety, quality, market share, efficiency, cost control, inventory turns and cash flow. And we continue to make progress.
And that brings me to my second point. Given the environment we're in, we were pleased with our first quarter results. Sales in the quarter were pretty close to what we expected, and we were pleased with the bottom line.
And that brings me to my third point. And that's a reminder of what we said in our year-end conference call back in January. We said that we expected the year to start out stronger than it would end, and that's still what we expect. And that's probably evident to you if you consider our first quarter actual results and what we're expecting for the first year.
Okay. With those 3 points, let's get into the quarter. Sales and revenues were $12.7 billion, and that was about 4% less than the $13.2 billion that we had in the first quarter last year. $342 million of that decline in sales was a result of the stronger dollar, and sales volume was unfavorable $295 million. Those 2 items were partially offset by a small improvement in price realization. That was $105 million, definitely in the right direction, but less than 1%.
Now the only region in the world that was up was North America, and that was up 9%. The North American improvement was pretty much across the board in each of our -- with each of our segments being in positive territory.
Outside of North America, that wasn't the case, and sales in each of our segments were down in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and in the Asia Pacific region. In total, sales and revenues were off 18% in Latin America, and sales of all of our equipment segments, that's Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation, were down double digits. Construction was off 23%, and a sizable portion of that was the absence of a large order from the Brazilian government that we had in the first quarter last year and weaker construction activity in general in the region, particularly Brazil. Resource Industries was also down 23% in Latin America, reflecting continuing weakness in mining. And that's pretty much the case in every region. And Energy & Transportation was down 11%.
Sales and revenues in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region were down 12%. Construction Industries was off 14%, and most of that was from less favorable dealer inventory changes and the impact of currency on our sales.
Resource Industries was also off 14%, again, weak mining. And Energy & Transportation was down 8%.
Sales and revenues in Asia Pacific were down 13%, with the most significant decline in Construction Industries at 21%. Construction Industries were down substantially in China and lower in Japan as a result of the stronger dollar versus the yen. Our sales in Japan, which are in yen, essentially translated into fewer dollars. 
Okay. That's a recap of sales. Profit per share, though, was higher in the first quarter than it was in the first quarter a year ago. This year, it was $1.81 per share. A year ago, in the first quarter, it was $1.44 a share.
Now we had restructuring costs in both quarters. In the first quarter of last year, we had $0.17 per share of restructuring costs, and that was mostly from the actions that we took in our European operations. This year, we had $0.05 per share of restructuring costs in the first quarter. So excluding restructuring, profit per share improved from $1.61 a year ago to $1.86 in the current quarter -- in the first quarter. Now the primary reasons profit per share was up, number one, was the $120 million gain that we had from the sale of our remaining ownership in what was our third-party logistics business. We also had, as I mentioned a minute ago, $105 million of positive price realization, and we had $77 million of favorable currency impact that helped operating profit. And I'm just going to stop here for a minute and chat about currency. It's a subject that, for us, seems to be frequently misunderstood. Now I'd just like to clarify things again. We do have substantial sales that are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And when the dollar strengthens, that causes those sales to translate into fewer dollars, and that's a negative for our top line. That said, we also have substantial manufacturing operations and we source substantial purchase material outside the U.S. So our factories outside the U.S. allow sourcing outside the U.S. And that results in lower cost when translated to U.S. dollars. And that's exactly what happened this quarter. Sales translated into fewer dollars. As I mentioned a little bit ago, $342 million fewer. However, the impact on cost was favorable $419 million, and the net to operating profit was positive $77 million. While we're not 100% exactly balanced in our currency exposures, we do have reasonably offsetting sales and cost positions that usually keep the profit impact of exchange rate swings to a reasonably manageable level. 
Okay. That's the story on currency. I'll kind of get back to profit now. I'd already talked about the positive items, and offsetting those positives for the quarter, we did have lower sales volume, and that was negative to our operating profit, about $83 million, and we had higher cost. The most significant cost factor was a change in the timing of expense related to divesting of stock-based compensation. The timing change won't have an impact on the full year versus 2014, but it did add to cost in the first quarter. 
Okay. That's a quick run-through of profit versus the first quarter last year. Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was a little over $1 billion in the quarter, but that was about $800 million lower than the first quarter last year. And most of that decline came from higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of this year, and they are based on performance in 2014. We used about $400 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. And with relatively modest needs for CapEx this year, we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2015. And as you might expect, the timing and the amount that we ultimately repurchase, well, that will be subject to business and market conditions as we progress through the year and on our cash deployment priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to total capital ratio of 37.1%. And that's about right in the middle of our targeted 30% to 45% range. And it was slightly favorable versus year-end 2014. If you net cash with the debt, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 18.3%.
Now before we get into the revised outlook, I'll just recap changes in the order backlog over the last quarter because I suspect many of you are interested in that. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of $16.5 billion, and that's about $800 million lower than the year-end 2014. The decline was split between Construction Industries and Resource Industries. You might have expected that Energy & Transportation would've also declined from year-end as a result of weakness in the oil industry. It was, in total, however, about flat. We did have a decline in the backlog because of weakness in oil, but that was about offset by an increase in the backlog for locomotives.
Okay. With that, let me go through the 2015 outlook. As I started out, in terms of overall world economic growth, we don't expect much change from the outlook that we provided with our year-end results in January. And the same goes for our sales and revenues, we're holding it at about $50 billion for 2015. 
Now while we're not changing the sales outlook, just as a reminder, we do expect 2015 to be over $5 billion lower than 2014. And as we said last January, and I'll reiterate today, the impact of substantially lower oil prices is the most significant reason for the decline. And we still think the most significant impact from oil will be from engines and other equipment that we sell for drilling and well servicing. And that's the spot where we expect a large drop in demand this year. We've already started to see the impact of that in our order backlog as new orders have not kept pace with sales, and the backlog has decline. And we'll start seeing that hit sales over the course of 2015. We also expect that indirect effects from substantially lower oil prices will be negative in 2015 versus 2014. In countries and in some regions of the U.S. where oil production is significant for either government receipts or for the local economies, it will likely be negative for sales of construction equipment and for our electric power generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct, like building a road to service a new well, or it can be very indirect, like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund spending. Because many of those construction-related impacts are indirect, it does make it tough to measure. But anecdotally, we believe we're already starting to see the impact of that in our Construction business.
Now in addition to oil, there are several other factors that are contributing to the year-over-year decline in sales. The stronger dollar is a headwind to sales, but again, not profit. Commodity prices in mining are generally weak, particularly iron ore and coal, and that's negative for mining in our Resource Industries segment. With weaknesses in agriculture, we're expecting lower sales of industrial engines. And we expect our rail business to be down in 2015 after a great year in 2014. And we expect weakness in the Construction Industries of key developing countries like China and Brazil. And that was certainly evident in our first quarter. So that's a recap of our year-over-year changes, down from 2014, but no change in the top line outlook for 2015. We did raise the profit outlook again this morning. Our previous outlook was $4.60 per share all-in, and $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. This morning, we raised the profit outlook to $4.70 per share all-in, and $5 per share excluding restructuring costs. 
Now the changes from the previous outlook include more restructuring activity. We've increased our restructuring cost estimate from about $150 million expected for this year, up $100 million to about $250 million, with almost all of the increase related to facilities that produce mining products. We added the $120 million gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining ownership in the third-party logistics business. That wasn't in our previous outlook. And based on our first quarter actual results, we made some additional improvements to the profit outlook. While we held the top line and made a modest improvement to the bottom line of our outlook, 2015 is still shaping up to be an uncertain and challenging year. There continues to be softness in Latin America, particularly Brazil. China growth is concerning. The stability and scale of economic recovery in the United States remains concerning. Europe is still a question mark. Mining hasn't shown improvement yet. And while we're still planning a sharp decline in our oil-related sales in 2015, there's still a concern around that.
So to wrap up and move on to the Q&A portion of the call, sales and revenues in the first quarter were about as we expected, and we had a solid profit quarter. We repurchased 400 million of shares in the quarter. The balance sheet remains strong, and we're very focused on operational performance and cost control. But it still looks like a tough year and we've not seen meaningful signs of recovery in many of our cyclical businesses.
So with that, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

But actually, in the short term, there are related costs for things like rearrangement that aren't included in the number that can tend to be a little bit negative around the time you're actually doing it. So I'd say, on balance, that is relative to our original outlook, not a big reason for change. We took the profit outlook up, mostly because of very good cost control in the first quarter. I know we don't give quarterly guidance, but we were a little better than we thought we were going to be in the quarter. And some of that, of course, was timing. But some of it is spending that we don't think we'll have to make as the year goes on."

I think that we're going to add to spending over the course of the year. We've got some R&D programs that we need to do there. We talked about that in January.

In our view, that can't keep happening, but it has been happening. So when that turns around, it's like the industry overall. It's a little bit hard to predict the timing. But we understand where both part sales and equipment sales are to what's, at least for equipment, a reasonable replacement level. It's far below that.

But we expect that the first quarter was kind of seasonally low on costs. So just as a matter of course, discretionary cost will go up a bit from the first quarter level. We do plan to spend some more on R&D. And we talked about that last January. We're looking at negative mix. We'll have negative product mix in E&T because of the decline in the oil business that's coming. We also expect some negative mix in Construction Industries. If you look at what they sold in the first quarter, it was relatively balanced between -- we have 3 pieces of construction: earthmoving, excavation and building construction products, or BCP, our smaller equipment. So what we actually sold in the quarter, at least in terms of new equipment, was fairly balanced between those 3 subsectors. But if you look at what was ordered and what we think is going to happen for sales as the year unfolds, probably not a lot of change in total for construction, but a bit more of a shift to BCP, smaller machines. I think, part of that is, in countries like China where the selling season is very early in the year, that helps excavation sales and then that tails down later in the year. So we're looking at some negative mix in Construction as the year goes on. I don't think for the year, we're not, at least in our -- contemplated in our outlook, we're not going to fall below double digits for Construction. E&T operating profit percent will, I think, for sure, come down. Or I don't know, I guess, I can't say for sure. We would expect it would come down, and mostly because of the declines in the oil business, which is -- tends to be bigger, a little bit higher-margin product."

I mean, we had, for the company overall, $105 million of price realization. That's less than 1%. I think, the segment that is doing -- the segments that are doing better right now are Construction and Energy & Transportation. Construction, in particular, did a little bit better. But part of that is really from a few -- 3 things. One is we had last year this big Brazilian order from the government. And while that was good volume, it was pretty low price. So without that, sort of our average price level is up a bit. We had some favorable geographic mix, and we did take list price increases, small, but up at the beginning of the year. So that all contributed a bit. I think, with Resource Industries, it's been down year-over-year for the last -- certainly, last couple of quarters. I can't remember the third, but probably in the third last year as well. It's just a tough business right now. It's dog eat dog. And although a lot of that product that we sell is dollar-based, the sales are conducted in dollars a lot in mining, some of our key competition like Komatsu probably has more of yen cost base than we do, and they're being aggressive.

We're doing as well as we can be expected in a tough market that we are. Certainly, our cost management the last couple of years has helped that.

Let me talk a little bit about this. There's been a lot of discussion about it, and we've been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We'll go through a process where we are cyclical, we've seen this before.",469,"No, it's good. Andy, it's Brad. Let me talk a little bit about this. There's been a lot of discussion about it, and we've been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We'll go through a process where we are cyclical, we've seen this before. On the one side, we want to be ready for the upturn. Our business model is to produce quality products, lowest owner-operating costs, produces parts and service for us and the dealers and repeat business. And so on that side, given the fact that our sales can move fairly dramatically through the cycles, we want to be ready to be able to meet that demand. But on the other side, it's absolutely clear and a good question that this current economic environment presents a lot of opportunities. So we've been at this since 2013. In fact, if you kind of add up what we've done in the last 3 years, including what we plan to do in '15, we'll incur roughly $900 million of restructuring cost. We've closed or downsized roughly 20 facilities, about 5 million of square feet during that period, again, through '15, and about 15,000 employees, which is unfortunate. All-in then, if you look at the benefits, we mentioned to you before that we believe after '15, the benefit per year would be $400 million to $500 million per year. With what we've done, which we've had higher benefits on than we anticipated, and what we have in place, we'll be at the high end or exceed that in terms of our benefits per year. And so it's a robust process. It's done by our product source planning group, with involvement across all the facilities, all the regions. There's been some discussion about big facilities. It's very hard to close a single source Decatur [ph] facility, in terms of the mining trucks. It would be the same for East Peoria. So those things just don't dollar out in terms of return to shareholders. And we do it a net present value calculation through that. So I would say that we're continuing to look. We've added a few more in the mining space. If you go back to 2012, we were $66 billion in sales. We're $50 billion now. We've lost roughly $16 billion. 75% of that is mining. And we've held at a 25% decremental pull-through right in that range. And so there's a lot of things going on that support that, including lean and material cost. But I would say that we're pretty happy with that pull-through over that 3-year period. We've done that with little price and higher quality and growing market share. So I'm not saying we won't have more to do, but that process is ongoing, and we've been pretty active in it."

We have, I think, marine sales up a bit higher in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. And much of the rest of the business is actually reasonably -- in fact, I just looked at this, this morning, kind of almost anticipating this question. The rest of the year, for most of the rest of the businesses are, by and large, relatively stable as we go through the year. So the dropoff will be more oil, but it will be mitigated a little bit by timing in some of the segments and a little bit of an increase in marine."

Doug Oberhelman here. We really haven't changed our priorities of cash at all. If anything, the top priority to maintain the balance sheet is, I think, becoming more important to us as the uncertainty around us continues on, if not increases. We reported that we're about, I guess, 37% or so of debt to debt and equity. That's been coming -- trending down and we'll trend that down throughout the year. We've bought $400 million of shares in the first quarter, which, I think, is a reasonable planning rate for the rest of the year, assuming our plan holds up. We will end the -- I have no doubt we'll end the year with cash, a lot of cash, as we did in the first quarter, over $7 billion. I think, in this area of uncertainty where, day to day, one never knows what's going to happen, and having recently been burned on that in 2008 with a big downturn and a weak balance sheet, that's where we're going to be. The other thing, and I've said this before, is that we are continually looking for growth opportunities and that strong balance sheet allows us lots of flexibility for growth, for protection, maintain our dividend, modestly increase it, as we've said before, and buy shares back. But I would say that we're in the driver's seat with cash generation, with our inventory turnover, arising our lean manufacturing, bringing up cash. And as these other priorities work through, share buyback will likely, over time, continue to be an important thing for us. But in 2015, we're just planning right now on that $400 million until we -- kind of third quarter or so, given the uncertainties and the challenges we face that we see every day in the marketplace."

That potentially could be a negative. I would say we're not really seeing a lot of that right now, outside of kind of the drilling and frac-ing where activity is off. Remember, though, and I think this needs to be said, a lot of our business in oil and gas, probably most of our business in oil and gas, is gas. And so far, that's held up pretty well. Demand for gas is good and the compression business is doing pretty well. So oil is just one piece of our oil and gas business.

This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2015, and it's also in our forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.
In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release. And again, it's posted at caterpillar.com.
Okay. With that, let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing financial results for the first quarter and our revised outlook for 2015. And then there are about 3 points that I'd like to start with, actually, before we get into the details. And the first is that from a macro standpoint, in our view, not much has changed since our last earnings conference call in January. So we're staying pretty focused on the things that we do have some control of, and that's execution and operational improvement. Things like safety, quality, market share, efficiency, cost control, inventory turns and cash flow. And we continue to make progress.
And that brings me to my second point. Given the environment we're in, we were pleased with our first quarter results. Sales in the quarter were pretty close to what we expected, and we were pleased with the bottom line.
And that brings me to my third point. And that's a reminder of what we said in our year-end conference call back in January. We said that we expected the year to start out stronger than it would end, and that's still what we expect. And that's probably evident to you if you consider our first quarter actual results and what we're expecting for the first year.
Okay. With those 3 points, let's get into the quarter. Sales and revenues were $12.7 billion, and that was about 4% less than the $13.2 billion that we had in the first quarter last year. $342 million of that decline in sales was a result of the stronger dollar, and sales volume was unfavorable $295 million. Those 2 items were partially offset by a small improvement in price realization. That was $105 million, definitely in the right direction, but less than 1%.
Now the only region in the world that was up was North America, and that was up 9%. The North American improvement was pretty much across the board in each of our -- with each of our segments being in positive territory.
Outside of North America, that wasn't the case, and sales in each of our segments were down in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and in the Asia Pacific region. In total, sales and revenues were off 18% in Latin America, and sales of all of our equipment segments, that's Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation, were down double digits. Construction was off 23%, and a sizable portion of that was the absence of a large order from the Brazilian government that we had in the first quarter last year and weaker construction activity in general in the region, particularly Brazil. Resource Industries was also down 23% in Latin America, reflecting continuing weakness in mining. And that's pretty much the case in every region. And Energy & Transportation was down 11%.
Sales and revenues in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region were down 12%. Construction Industries was off 14%, and most of that was from less favorable dealer inventory changes and the impact of currency on our sales.
Resource Industries was also off 14%, again, weak mining. And Energy & Transportation was down 8%.
Sales and revenues in Asia Pacific were down 13%, with the most significant decline in Construction Industries at 21%. Construction Industries were down substantially in China and lower in Japan as a result of the stronger dollar versus the yen. Our sales in Japan, which are in yen, essentially translated into fewer dollars. 
Okay. That's a recap of sales. Profit per share, though, was higher in the first quarter than it was in the first quarter a year ago. This year, it was $1.81 per share. A year ago, in the first quarter, it was $1.44 a share.
Now we had restructuring costs in both quarters. In the first quarter of last year, we had $0.17 per share of restructuring costs, and that was mostly from the actions that we took in our European operations. This year, we had $0.05 per share of restructuring costs in the first quarter. So excluding restructuring, profit per share improved from $1.61 a year ago to $1.86 in the current quarter -- in the first quarter. Now the primary reasons profit per share was up, number one, was the $120 million gain that we had from the sale of our remaining ownership in what was our third-party logistics business. We also had, as I mentioned a minute ago, $105 million of positive price realization, and we had $77 million of favorable currency impact that helped operating profit. And I'm just going to stop here for a minute and chat about currency. It's a subject that, for us, seems to be frequently misunderstood. Now I'd just like to clarify things again. We do have substantial sales that are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And when the dollar strengthens, that causes those sales to translate into fewer dollars, and that's a negative for our top line. That said, we also have substantial manufacturing operations and we source substantial purchase material outside the U.S. So our factories outside the U.S. allow sourcing outside the U.S. And that results in lower cost when translated to U.S. dollars. And that's exactly what happened this quarter. Sales translated into fewer dollars. As I mentioned a little bit ago, $342 million fewer. However, the impact on cost was favorable $419 million, and the net to operating profit was positive $77 million. While we're not 100% exactly balanced in our currency exposures, we do have reasonably offsetting sales and cost positions that usually keep the profit impact of exchange rate swings to a reasonably manageable level. 
Okay. That's the story on currency. I'll kind of get back to profit now. I'd already talked about the positive items, and offsetting those positives for the quarter, we did have lower sales volume, and that was negative to our operating profit, about $83 million, and we had higher cost. The most significant cost factor was a change in the timing of expense related to divesting of stock-based compensation. The timing change won't have an impact on the full year versus 2014, but it did add to cost in the first quarter. 
Okay. That's a quick run-through of profit versus the first quarter last year. Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was a little over $1 billion in the quarter, but that was about $800 million lower than the first quarter last year. And most of that decline came from higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of this year, and they are based on performance in 2014. We used about $400 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. And with relatively modest needs for CapEx this year, we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2015. And as you might expect, the timing and the amount that we ultimately repurchase, well, that will be subject to business and market conditions as we progress through the year and on our cash deployment priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to total capital ratio of 37.1%. And that's about right in the middle of our targeted 30% to 45% range. And it was slightly favorable versus year-end 2014. If you net cash with the debt, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 18.3%.
Now before we get into the revised outlook, I'll just recap changes in the order backlog over the last quarter because I suspect many of you are interested in that. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of $16.5 billion, and that's about $800 million lower than the year-end 2014. The decline was split between Construction Industries and Resource Industries. You might have expected that Energy & Transportation would've also declined from year-end as a result of weakness in the oil industry. It was, in total, however, about flat. We did have a decline in the backlog because of weakness in oil, but that was about offset by an increase in the backlog for locomotives.
Okay. With that, let me go through the 2015 outlook. As I started out, in terms of overall world economic growth, we don't expect much change from the outlook that we provided with our year-end results in January. And the same goes for our sales and revenues, we're holding it at about $50 billion for 2015. 
Now while we're not changing the sales outlook, just as a reminder, we do expect 2015 to be over $5 billion lower than 2014. And as we said last January, and I'll reiterate today, the impact of substantially lower oil prices is the most significant reason for the decline. And we still think the most significant impact from oil will be from engines and other equipment that we sell for drilling and well servicing. And that's the spot where we expect a large drop in demand this year. We've already started to see the impact of that in our order backlog as new orders have not kept pace with sales, and the backlog has declined. And we'll start seeing that hit sales over the course of 2015. We also expect that indirect effects from substantially lower oil prices will be negative in 2015 versus 2014. In countries and in some regions of the U.S. where oil production is significant for either government receipts or for the local economies, it will likely be negative for sales of construction equipment and for our electric power generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct, like building a road to service a new well, or it can be very indirect, like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund spending. Because many of those construction-related impacts are indirect, it does make it tough to measure. But anecdotally, we believe we're already starting to see the impact of that in our Construction business.
Now in addition to oil, there are several other factors that are contributing to the year-over-year decline in sales. The stronger dollar is a headwind to sales, but again, not profit. Commodity prices in mining are generally weak, particularly iron ore and coal, and that's negative for mining in our Resource Industries segment. With weaknesses in agriculture, we're expecting lower sales of industrial engines. And we expect our rail business to be down in 2015 after a great year in 2014. And we expect weakness in the Construction Industries of key developing countries like China and Brazil. And that was certainly evident in our first quarter. So that's a recap of our year-over-year changes, down from 2014, but no change in the top line outlook for 2015. We did raise the profit outlook again this morning. Our previous outlook was $4.60 per share all-in, and $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. This morning, we raised the profit outlook to $4.70 per share all-in, and $5 per share excluding restructuring costs. 
Now the changes from the previous outlook include more restructuring activity. We've increased our restructuring cost estimate from about $150 million expected for this year, up $100 million to about $250 million, with almost all of the increase related to facilities that produce mining products. We added the $120 million gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining ownership in the third-party logistics business. That wasn't in our previous outlook. And based on our first quarter actual results, we made some additional improvements to the profit outlook. While we held the top line and made a modest improvement to the bottom line of our outlook, 2015 is still shaping up to be an uncertain and challenging year. There continues to be softness in Latin America, particularly Brazil. China growth is concerning. The stability and scale of economic recovery in the United States remains concerning. Europe is still a question mark. Mining hasn't shown improvement yet. And while we're still planning a sharp decline in our oil-related sales in 2015, there's still a concern around that.
So to wrap up and move on to the Q&A portion of the call, sales and revenues in the first quarter were about as we expected, and we had a solid profit quarter. We repurchased 400 million of shares in the quarter. The balance sheet remains strong, and we're very focused on operational performance and cost control. But it still looks like a tough year and we've not seen meaningful signs of recovery in many of our cyclical businesses.
So with that, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

So I'd say, on balance, that is relative to our original outlook, not a big reason for change. We took the profit outlook up, mostly because of very good cost control in the first quarter. I know we don't give quarterly guidance, but we were a little better than we thought we were going to be in the quarter. And some of that, of course, was timing.

And partly because, I think, sometimes, it gets taken out of context. We expect an inventory build in the first quarter.

We have, order of magnitude, 180 million dealers -- or 180 dealers roughly around the world. And at any given point in time, you've got some of them that probably have a little too much and some that have probably a little too little. If we look at our months of supply on hand, we kind of try to judge that in a reasonable range and we do look at that by region.

Now I think, Resource Industries margins will likely come down as the year progresses. We kind of said before we thought something around breakeven was probably reasonable. I think that we're going to add to spending over the course of the year. We've got some R&D programs that we need to do there. We talked about that in January.

We do plan to spend some more on R&D. And we talked about that last January. We're looking at negative mix. We'll have negative product mix in E&T because of the decline in the oil business that's coming. We also expect some negative mix in Construction Industries. If you look at what they sold in the first quarter, it was relatively balanced between -- we have 3 pieces of construction: earthmoving, excavation and building construction products, or BCP, our smaller equipment. So what we actually sold in the quarter, at least in terms of new equipment, was fairly balanced between those 3 subsectors. But if you look at what was ordered and what we think is going to happen for sales as the year unfolds, probably not a lot of change in total for construction, but a bit more of a shift to BCP, smaller machines. I think, part of that is, in countries like China where the selling season is very early in the year, that helps excavation sales and then that tails down later in the year. So we're looking at some negative mix in Construction as the year goes on. I don't think for the year, we're not, at least in our -- contemplated in our outlook, we're not going to fall below double digits for Construction.

There's been a lot of discussion about it, and we've been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We'll go through a process where we are cyclical, we've seen this before. On the one side, we want to be ready for the upturn. Our business model is to produce quality products, lowest owner-operating costs, produces parts and service for us and the dealers and repeat business. And so on that side, given the fact that our sales can move fairly dramatically through the cycles, we want to be ready to be able to meet that demand. But on the other side, it's absolutely clear and a good question that this current economic environment presents a lot of opportunities. So we've been at this since 2013. In fact, if you kind of add up what we've done in the last 3 years, including what we plan to do in '15, we'll incur roughly $900 million of restructuring cost. We've closed or downsized roughly 20 facilities, about 5 million of square feet during that period, again, through '15, and about 15,000 employees, which is unfortunate. All-in then, if you look at the benefits, we mentioned to you before that we believe after '15, the benefit per year would be $400 million to $500 million per year. With what we've done, which we've had higher benefits on than we anticipated, and what we have in place, we'll be at the high end or exceed that in terms of our benefits per year. And so it's a robust process. It's done by our product source planning group, with involvement across all the facilities, all the regions. There's been some discussion about big facilities. It's very hard to close a single source Decatur [ph] facility, in terms of the mining trucks. It would be the same for East Peoria. So those things just don't dollar out in terms of return to shareholders. And we do it a net present value calculation through that. So I would say that we're continuing to look. We've added a few more in the mining space. If you go back to 2012, we were $66 billion in sales. We're $50 billion now. We've lost roughly $16 billion. 75% of that is mining. And we've held at a 25% decremental pull-through right in that range. And so there's a lot of things going on that support that, including lean and material cost. But I would say that we're pretty happy with that pull-through over that 3-year period. We've done that with little price and higher quality and growing market share. So I'm not saying we won't have more to do, but that process is ongoing, and we've been pretty active in it."

We have, I think, marine sales up a bit higher in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. And much of the rest of the business is actually reasonably -- in fact, I just looked at this, this morning, kind of almost anticipating this question. The rest of the year, for most of the rest of the businesses are, by and large, relatively stable as we go through the year.

Doug Oberhelman here. We really haven't changed our priorities of cash at all. If anything, the top priority to maintain the balance sheet is, I think, becoming more important to us as the uncertainty around us continues on, if not increases. We reported that we're about, I guess, 37% or so of debt to debt and equity. That's been coming -- trending down and we'll trend that down throughout the year. We've bought $400 million of shares in the first quarter, which, I think, is a reasonable planning rate for the rest of the year, assuming our plan holds up. We will end the -- I have no doubt we'll end the year with cash, a lot of cash, as we did in the first quarter, over $7 billion. I think, in this area of uncertainty where, day to day, one never knows what's going to happen, and having recently been burned on that in 2008 with a big downturn and a weak balance sheet, that's where we're going to be. The other thing, and I've said this before, is that we are continually looking for growth opportunities and that strong balance sheet allows us lots of flexibility for growth, for protection, maintain our dividend, modestly increase it, as we've said before, and buy shares back. But I would say that we're in the driver's seat with cash generation, with our inventory turnover, arising our lean manufacturing, bringing up cash. And as these other priorities work through, share buyback will likely, over time, continue to be an important thing for us. But in 2015, we're just planning right now on that $400 million until we -- kind of third quarter or so, given the uncertainties and the challenges we face that we see every day in the marketplace."

That potentially could be a negative. I would say we're not really seeing a lot of that right now, outside of kind of the drilling and fracking where activity is off. Remember, though, and I think this needs to be said, a lot of our business in oil and gas, probably most of our business in oil and gas, is gas. And so far, that's held up pretty well. Demand for gas is good and the compression business is doing pretty well. So oil is just one piece of our oil and gas business.

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. It will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information, and that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in the aggregate, could make actual results to differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, that's Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can be found in our financial release today, and that's also been posted at our caterpillar.com website.
Okay. Let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing our financial results for the second quarter and our outlook for 2015. For the quarter, sales and revenues were $12.3 billion and profit per share was $1.16, and that was $1.27 excluding restructuring costs. Also, those numbers were about -- is about what we expected. No big surprises. In fact, from a macro standpoint, much of what we were expecting when 2015 started seems to be playing out. We expected that mining would continue to be very weak, and it certainly has. We were concerned about weakening sales of construction equipment in China and Brazil, and both are down substantially from last year. With a sharp drop in oil prices from last fall, we expected we'd have sales headwinds in our Energy & Transportation segment and in construction equipment sales in the parts of the world where oil production was important, and that's happened.
Now on the plus side, we also expected that our people would continue to execute on the things that we can control. And we've done that with decremental margins better than our target. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and a balance sheet that remains healthy with a debt-to-capital ratio of near 35%.
So with that introduction behind us, let's get into a little more detail on the quarter. Again, sales and revenues were 13% lower than last year. The decline was widespread with lower sales in every geographic region of the world and down versus last year in each of our business segments.
We'll start with Construction Industries, which was down 18% and down in all regions. Latin America was the most significant decline, down 47%, and that was mostly a result of weak demand in general and in particular Brazil and also absent of large order that we had from the Brazilian government from last year. Asia Pacific region was down 30%, with much of that decline in China and Japan. In China, the construction industry continued to weaken. And in Japan, the main issue was currency exchange as the yen weakened versus the dollar, and our sales that are denominated in yen there are translating into fewer dollars.
In the Europe Africa Middle East region, Construction Industries sales were down 18%, and much of that was from currency translation as local currencies, particularly the euro, were weaker than the dollar compared with the second quarter of last year. In addition, there was some unfavorable dealer inventory change in the Europe Africa Middle East region.
Well, North America was off 3%, and we have seen some strength in residential and nonresidential construction, but that's been offset or slightly more than offset by a drop in sales to customers serving oil and gas.
In Resource Industries, which is mostly mining, sales were down 11% versus the second quarter of 2014, and mining sales continue to weaken for both new equipment and, to a lesser degree, for aftermarket parts. Sales related to quarry and aggregates did improve, but it wasn't enough to offset the decline in mining.
In Resource Industries, sales were down in all regions. Suffice to say, that mining remains weak around the world, and we haven't yet seen signs of a recovery. If you'd like a little more regional flavor, there's more in the Resource Industries section in this morning's financial release.
For Energy & Transportation, sales were down 12%. And while down in all regions, I think probably the most useful way to cover Energy & Transportation is by major industry, and that's oil and gas, transportation, power gen and industrial sales. In short, sales in each of these industries was down. And in order of magnitude, the most significant decline was for transportation, and that was mostly lower locomotive sales in North America. Locomotive sales last year in 2014 were pretty good. In 2015, regulations for emissions changed in the United States and Tier 4 started. And our tier locomotive isn't expected to be available until later in 2016, [ph] so sales this year are down.
Now oil- and gas-related sales were also lower, and that's probably not surprising to you given the decline in oil prices over the past year and softening investment by oil producers. Sales of industrial engines also declined. And just for your reference, we sell these industrial engines to ag customers, electric power packagers, construction and material handling customers and for a wide variety of other applications. And in general, demand was down a bit, and currency also had an unfavorable impact, particularly in Europe.
Power generation sales were also down, and most of that was currency translation-related, again in Europe in particular, where our euro-based deals translated to lesser dollars.
Okay. That's a summary of sales and revenues. Again, all in all, about as we expected for the quarter and down about 13% from last year.
Profit for the quarter was $1.16. We did have $0.11 a share or $89 million of restructuring cost. And without restructuring, profit was $1.27. Our profit is down from a year ago while we were $1.57 all in and $1.69 [ph] last year in the second quarter excluding restructuring. Operating profit declined from $1,475,000,000 in the second quarter last year to $1,130,000,000 this year. Now that's a drop of $345 million. More than all that decline, $483 million in total, was a result of lower sales volume.
In addition, Financial Products was down $49 million. Our R&D costs were a little bit higher than the second quarter of last year as well.
Now on the favorable side for operating profit, price realization was a positive. It was $84 million. Certainly in the right direction, but less than 1% of sales. Manufacturing costs were slightly favorable and would've been more so if not for a headwind from inventory absorption, and that was a result of an increase in our inventory over the course of the second quarter of 2014 and a decline in inventory in the second quarter of 2015.
Let's talk about currency for a moment. While the impact on sales was negative, over $400 million, it was actually positive to operating profit, about $80 million. And that's because we have a significant cost base outside the U.S. and a stronger U.S. dollar causes those costs to translate into fewer dollars, and that more than offset the negative impact on sales. Now there are other currency impacts in our P&L as well below operating profit.
And other income and expense, again below operating profit. Quarter-over-quarter was unfavorable $78 million. And most of that was related to currency translation on our balance sheet position and hedging. So in summary, on balance, relative to profit, currency didn't have much of an impact second quarter to second quarter. Okay, that's profit versus last year, and the major story is sales volume.
So let's turn to the outlook, and that will be actually pretty easy to cover because little is actually changed. Back in January, with our original outlook, we expected sales and revenues of about $50 billion. And at the end of the first quarter, we held that. This morning, we lowered about $1 billion to $49 billion. The most important point in that is, for the most part, the change is currency-related. The dollar strengthened some in the first quarter and strengthened a bit more in the second quarter, particularly against the yen, and it's moved enough versus our original outlook that we needed to reflect it in today's updated outlook for the year.
Now sitting here about halfway through the year, except for currency impacts, the overall sales and revenue outlook is pretty -- is still pretty close to what we expected when we started the year. While we would've liked to have been surprised to the upside, our sales outlook of 6 months ago, it's proving to be pretty accurate so far, particularly given the degree of uncertainty in the world and the things that we expected will happen in 2015, including world economic growth that wasn't much different than '14, the impact of lower oil prices on Energy & Transportation and construction equipment sales, lower mining sales, headwinds in China and Brazil and the decline in locomotive sales.
Now profit in the outlook is being held flat with what we expected at the end of the first quarter, and that's $4.70 a share or $5 a share excluding restructuring. While that's unchanged from last quarter, it is up from our original outlook from January, which was $4.60 a share or $4.75 without restructuring. And I mentioned that a few minutes ago, and I think it's probably worth repeating while we're talking about the outlook, what happened in the second quarter for sales and profit is about what we were expecting when we were on this call 3 months ago. Now if you consider that our full year outlook and actual results for the first half, it's evident that we were expecting lower sales and profit in the second half of the year. Excluding restructuring costs, our outlook would reflect about $1.24 decline in profit per share first half to second half. And that's a result of lower sales in the second half, about $1 billion. Seasonal cost patterns, the first quarter is usually a pretty light quarter for cost, and the fourth quarter is seasonally higher, and that includes R&D costs. We have the absence of the gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining interest in the third-party logistics business. We do expect some negative sales mix in the second half, particularly related to oil and gas. That will likely decline more in the second half than it has in the first half. And we're expecting more negative inventory absorption. We're forecasting a decent-sized inventory decline, that's Caterpillar inventory, in the second half of the year, more than the first half of the year.
Now in terms of how the next 2 quarters are going to play out, we think that sales will be less in the third quarter than the fourth quarter, about $750 million lower. And that's not unusual. Just for example, in 2014, last year, sales in the third quarter were about $700 million below the fourth quarter.
Now as the result of lower sales in the third quarter, third quarter is likely to be our lowest-profit quarter for the year. As expected, again, 2015 is turning out to be another challenging year. We're serving several industries that at the moment are weak: mining, oil and gas and in many parts of the world, construction, again particularly China and Brazil. We are, however, executing on the things that are more in our control. We've taken substantial restructuring actions and more are likely. We're improving quality, safety and our market position for many of our products. We're also generating cash. Our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow, again, was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And given the weakness in many of our business is right now, we don't need cash to deploy for capacity, and our balance sheet a strong. Our ME&T debt-to-cap ratio is near 35%, well within our target range, and we have $7.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. And that brings me to the other announcement we made this morning. And that's our intention to repurchase another $1.5 billion of stock in the third quarter. Now that, plus what we've repurchased in the first half, should take us to around $2 billion by the time we get to the end of the third quarter. And as a reminder, we did increase the quarterly dividend the second quarter, and that was back in June. We took it up 10% from $0.70 a quarter to $0.77. And if you annualized that, it's a rate of about $3.08 a share.
So in summary, sales and profit in the second quarter, about as we expected. No change in the profit outlook for the year, $1.6 billion of ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter, $1.5 billion share repurchase, 10% increase in the dividend. We think we've done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We've improved our market position and our operations. Now all that said, we'd certainly be happy to see a better global economy.
So with that, we are ready to take your questions."

A number of facilities has been downsized, closed and have been announced to do so in the next -- this year and next year. We'll continually view that. What we're hearing from customers, of course, and seeing from customers is an ongoing fairly high production rate. Now I don't know how long that will hold up. But so far, we haven't seen a big drop in production. We certainly see no exposure there and won't for in the foreseeable future. But we have not seen any -- I guess, we have seen our trucks and ancillary equipment especially being used longer and longer and longer. Service intervals being extended. As long as we see that, we know there's a replacement cycle coming at some point. It's just extended. In terms of where we see us long term, I think a lot of that's going to depend on what we see for long-term growth rate. And is the world going to grow at 2% for the next 10 years? Or is it going to grow at 3% or something else? And I think we'll continue to model that. We do that right.

It's been funded now and run by the Chinese. It's a somewhat similar bank to the several regional banks that are around, whether it's in Latin America or Asia -- to some degree, World Bank. They are focusing certainly around Asian infrastructure. We're there. Our business model works very well. I think a significant piece of this is aimed at the Silk Road, the new silk -- One Belt, one Road project. It's probably a 50-year project going forward. My expectation would be that we're a local Chinese company. Our dealer service products throughout that region. And when it comes down to it, and they build infrastructure, complete those kinds of things funded by that AIB, the best supplier is going to win a construction equipment, just like anything else. Now will there be bias in another direction? Probably, as we see today, but we do pretty well in China. Some expectation is that it's China trying to take its investments even more broadly than they have been doing. We do it -- we've done pretty well with that around the road so far, and that would be my expectation going forward. Having said that, a bit political. It would be nice to see United States involved with that. We've not been -- a lot of European countries have joined in, and most Asians have joined in to aim at areas that need a lot of development, and that, I hope, is in our future. But again, a little bit off the subject, but is, I think, pertinent to the answer."

And again, I'm not going to get into next year, but I'll just -- I'll talk about it -- I'll talk about a couple. One is inventory absorption impact is negative. This year, we're going to end up with a pretty healthy -- by the time we get to the end of the year, we think, a reasonably healthy inventory reduction for Cat inventory. And if you think about it, our sales this year versus last year are down from about 55 in our outlook down to about 49. And so there's inventory coming out. Now without getting too far ahead and talking about next year, I'll just say, if I look at what the analyst consensus is right now for next year -- it's not our forecast -- but collectively, you guys have our sales about roughly flat with that next year. And if that were the case, the degree of inventory coming out, which is going to be pretty heavily weighted to the second half of this year, that would be less of a drag. So I think the second half of this year is going to have some negative in it related to that. Also, there's a lot of first half, second half differences, some that are seasonal. Just for example, we tend to build dealer inventory in the first half of the year as we're kind of preparing for the summer selling season, particularly for construction. And then we tend to use -- dealers tend to use inventory in the second half of the year, and we tend to undersell demand. And that will be the case, we think again, this year, we expect dealer inventories to come down. So there are some kind of built-in headwinds in the second half of the year. So I'm not going to get into a guidance game too much, but I don't think it's appropriate to probably take the second half of this year and multiply by 2, I think, because of headwinds like that. Now all that said, next year, we'll definitely be set up as a bit of a mix problem for us. We have -- if you think about this year, particularly in the recent piece of oil and gas, we came into the year with a pretty decent backlog, so much of the sales decline that we're going to have for the year in the oil and gas is going to be in the second half of the year. So one way to think of it is, good first half -- or reasonable first half for oil and gas, lower second half. Unless something changes in the marketplace, I think the likelihood is that you'd have a couple of weak halves next year. I mean, the backlog now, we're kind of through. So I think without -- I don't think that's likely a big secret, year-over-year -- full year-over-year, you'll be looking at probably some margin weakness because of that. I think in terms of the E&T margins overall, they've done a great job. I mean, just if you look at the work that they've done over the past 3, 4 years, it's just been phenomenal. And in -- I mean, we focus a lot and we talk a lot when we have you on the phone about oil and gas, but they've taken up margins almost every part of the business. I mean, industrial, for example, they've done a fabulous job on controlling costs and getting margins up there. So I think it's no doubt with recip oil and gas coming down, there will be some pressure on E&T margins in the second half of the year. And unless the situation with oil and gas changes, I'm sure those pressures will continue. I know you would've probably liked a little more of a numerical discussion around '16, but we'll have that maybe in October."

Dealers are preparing for getting equipment lined up for the selling season. So that will likely happen, I would think, again. So I mean, without again getting too specific, I would suspect, if the seasonal patterns hold it on the second half, we probably build a little bit of backlog in construction. In mining, the whole book-to-bill has been slightly negative. I mean, it's getting to a point where there's not a lot of drawdown coming in, and I think we should probably be coming to the point where that's not very significant one way or the other. Until we get a recovery, that would be great. And then in E&T, you talked about the backlog coming down this year, and that goes back to the point that I made a little bit ago. We started the year with a pretty healthy backlog of recip engines for oil and gas, and that's worked down throughout the year. There might be a little bit more of that to come out.

I'm just saying that sales next year are going to be dependent a lot on what happens in the global economy. We're on the edge right now of what's needed for growth. We have a pretty decent correlation, particularly in the U.S. When GDP is above 2.5%, we tend to grow. When it's about 2.5% or below, it varies by degree. We don't.

We've never been positioned at a time like this with that strong of a balance sheet, which allows us to return some of that to shareholders. Now we go down on the top line further, we'll have to assess where we are with our capital structure and everything else about that would play into it. We'd probably revise it to some degree.

And then when we get particularly in the fourth quarter, we have a tendency to sell more than we produce. Inventory comes down. So I think a part of what you're going to see in the fourth quarter is just a little bit of a seasonal pattern for us. That happened last year as well. We had a pretty sizable inventory reduction in the second half. I think if you just look at our inventory levels broadly, Cat inventory, we're working on lean with like kind of the year in and year out to take them down for efficiency. It would be nice if we had enough increase in volume that it cause inventory to go up from a volume standpoint. But all else being equal, we're working hard to improve inventory turns and be more efficient. So I guess, all else being equal, we'd like to see it continue to come down a little bit as we improve processes. But I'm going to make a comment on dealer inventory, too. It wasn't asked directly. But I think most of what we're seeing over the course of the -- this year, first half, second half, it was -- it will be more reduction in the second half. But again, I think there's some seasonality in dealer inventory that way. It will likely start to build again in the first quarter for the selling season. Then I don't think dealer inventories overall are out of line or problematic or anything of the case like that. So I think, reasonably speaking, most of the dealer inventory reduction that was because there was too much, per se, happened in 2013 and 2014.
With that, we are at the top of the hour, and I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We'll sign off and talk to you again next quarter."

This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information, and that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in the aggregate, could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, that's Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can be found in our financial release today, and that's also been posted at our caterpillar.com website.
Okay. Let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing our financial results for the second quarter and our outlook for 2015. For the quarter, sales and revenues were $12.3 billion and profit per share was $1.16, and that was $1.27 excluding restructuring costs. Also, those numbers were about -- is about what we expected. No big surprises. In fact, from a macro standpoint, much of what we were expecting when 2015 started seems to be playing out. We expected that mining would continue to be very weak, and it certainly has. We were concerned about weakening sales of construction equipment in China and Brazil, and both are down substantially from last year. With a sharp drop in oil prices from last fall, we expected we'd have sales headwinds in our Energy & Transportation segment and in construction equipment sales in the parts of the world where oil production was important, and that's happened.
Now on the plus side, we also expected that our people would continue to execute on the things that we can control. And we've done that with decremental margins better than our target. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and a balance sheet that remains healthy with a debt-to-cap ratio near 35%.
So with that introduction behind us, let's get into a little more detail on the quarter. Again, sales and revenues were 13% lower than last year. The decline was widespread with lower sales in every geographic region of the world and down versus last year in each of our business segments.
We'll start with Construction Industries, which was down 18% and down in all regions. Latin America was the most significant decline, down 47%, and that was mostly a result of weak demand in general and in particular Brazil and also absent of large order that we had from the Brazilian government from last year. Asia Pacific region was down 30%, with much of that decline in China and Japan. In China, the construction industry continued to weaken. And in Japan, the main issue was currency exchange as the yen weakened versus the dollar, and our sales that are denominated in yen there are translating into fewer dollars.
In the Europe, Africa, Middle East region, Construction Industries sales were down 18%, and much of that was from currency translation as local currencies, particularly the euro, were weaker than the dollar compared with the second quarter of last year. In addition, there was some unfavorable dealer inventory change in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region.
Well, North America was off 3%, and we have seen some strength in residential and nonresidential construction, but that's been offset or slightly more than offset by a drop in sales to customers serving oil and gas.
In Resource Industries, which is mostly mining, sales were down 11% versus the second quarter of 2014, and mining sales continue to weaken for both new equipment and, to a lesser degree, for aftermarket parts. Sales related to quarry and aggregates did improve, but it wasn't enough to offset the decline in mining.
In Resource Industries, sales were down in all regions. Suffice to say, that mining remains weak around the world, and we haven't yet seen signs of a recovery. If you'd like a little more regional flavor, there's more in the Resource Industries section in this morning's financial release.
For Energy & Transportation, sales were down 12%. And while down in all regions, I think probably the most useful way to cover Energy & Transportation is by major industry, and that's oil and gas, transportation, power gen and industrial sales. In short, sales in each of these industries was down. And in order of magnitude, the most significant decline was for transportation, and that was mostly lower locomotive sales in North America. Locomotive sales last year in 2014 were pretty good. In 2015, regulations for emissions changed in the United States and Tier 4 started. And our tier locomotive isn't expected to be available until later in 2016, so sales this year are down.
Now oil- and gas-related sales were also lower, and that's probably not surprising to you given the decline in oil prices over the past year and softening investment by oil producers. Sales of industrial engines also declined. And just for your reference, we sell these industrial engines to ag customers, electric power packagers, construction and material handling customers and for a wide variety of other applications. And in general, demand was down a bit, and currency also had an unfavorable impact, particularly in Europe.
Power generation sales were also down, and most of that was currency translation-related, again in Europe in particular, where our euro-based sales translated to fewer dollars. 
Okay. That's a summary of sales and revenues. Again, all in all, about as we expected for the quarter and down about 13% from last year.
Profit for the quarter was $1.16. We did have $0.11 a share or $89 million of restructuring cost. And without restructuring, profit was $1.27. Our profit is down from a year ago while we were $1.57 all in and $1.69 last year in the second quarter, excluding restructuring. Operating profit declined from $1,475,000,000 in the second quarter last year to $1,130,000,000 this year. Now that's a drop of $345 million. More than all of that decline, $483 million in total, was a result of lower sales volume.
In addition, Financial Products was down $49 million. Our R&D costs were a little bit higher than the second quarter of last year as well.
Now on the favorable side for operating profit, price realization was a positive. It was $84 million. Certainly in the right direction, but less than 1% of sales. Manufacturing costs were slightly favorable and would have been more so if not for a headwind from inventory absorption, and that was a result of an increase in our inventory over the course of the second quarter of 2014 and a decline in inventory in the second quarter of 2015.
Let's talk about currency for a moment. While the impact on sales was negative, over $400 million, it was actually positive to operating profit, about $80 million. And that's because we have a significant cost base outside the U.S. and a stronger U.S. dollar causes those costs to translate into fewer dollars, and that more than offset the negative impact on sales. Now there are other currency impacts in our P&L as well below operating profit.
And other income and expense, again below operating profit. Quarter-over-quarter was unfavorable, $78 million. And most of that was related to currency translation on our balance sheet position and hedging. So in summary, on balance, relative to profit, currency didn't have much of an impact on our second quarter to second quarter. Okay, that's profit versus last year, and the major story is sales volume.
So let's turn to the outlook, and that will be actually pretty easy to cover because little has actually changed. Back in January, with our original outlook, we expected sales and revenues of about $50 billion. And at the end of the first quarter, we held that. This morning, we lowered about $1 billion to $49 billion. The most important point in that is, for the most part, the change is currency-related. The dollar strengthened some in the first quarter and strengthened a bit more in the second quarter, particularly against the yen, and it's moved enough versus our original outlook that we needed to reflect it in today's updated outlook for the year.
Now sitting here about halfway through the year, except for currency impacts, the overall sales and revenue outlook is pretty -- is still pretty close to what we expected when we started the year. While we would have liked to have been surprised to the upside, our sales outlook of 6 months ago is proving to be pretty accurate so far, particularly given the degree of uncertainty in the world and the things that we expected would happen in 2015, including world economic growth that wasn't much different than '14, the impact of lower oil prices on Energy & Transportation and construction equipment sales, lower mining sales, headwinds in China and Brazil and the decline in locomotive sales.
Now profit in the outlook is being held flat with what we expected at the end of the first quarter, and that's $4.70 a share or $5 a share excluding restructuring. While that's unchanged from last quarter, it is up from our original outlook from January, which was $4.60 a share or $4.75 without restructuring. And I mentioned that a few minutes ago, and I think it's probably worth repeating while we're talking about the outlook, what happened in the second quarter for sales and profit is about what we were expecting when we were on this call 3 months ago. Now if you consider that our full year outlook and actual results for the first half, it's evident that we're expecting lower sales and profit in the second half of the year. Excluding restructuring costs, our outlook would reflect about $1.24 decline in profit per share first half to second half. And that's a result of lower sales in the second half, about $1 billion. Seasonal cost patterns. The first quarter is usually a pretty light quarter for cost, and the fourth quarter is seasonally higher, and that includes R&D costs. We have the absence of the gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining interest in the third-party logistics business. We do expect some negative sales mix in the second half, particularly related to oil and gas. That will likely decline more in the second half than it has in the first half. And we're expecting more negative inventory absorption. We're forecasting a decent-sized inventory decline, that's Caterpillar inventory, in the second half of the year, more than the first half of the year.
Now in terms of how the next 2 quarters are going to play out, we think that sales will be less in the third quarter than the fourth quarter, about $750 million lower. And that's not unusual. Just for example, in 2014, last year, sales in the third quarter were about $700 million below the fourth quarter.
Now as the result of lower sales in the third quarter, third quarter is likely to be our lowest-profit quarter for the year. As expected, again, 2015 is turning out to be another challenging year. We're serving several industries that at the moment are weak: mining, oil and gas and in many parts of the world, construction, again particularly China and Brazil. We are, however, executing on the things that are more in our control. We've taken substantial restructuring actions and more are likely. We're improving quality, safety and our market position for many of our products. We're also generating cash. Our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow, again, was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And given the weakness in many of our businesses right now, we don't need cash to deploy for capacity, and our balance sheet is strong. Our ME&T debt-to-cap ratio is near 35%, well within our target range, and we have $7.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. And that brings me to the other announcement we made this morning. And that's our intention to repurchase another $1.5 billion of stock in the third quarter. Now that, plus what we've repurchased in the first half, should take us to around $2 billion by the time we get to the end of the third quarter. And as a reminder, we did increase the quarterly dividend in the second quarter, and that was back in June. We took it up $0.10 from $0.70 a quarter to $0.77. And if you annualize that, it's a rate of about $3.08 a share.
So in summary, sales and profit in the second quarter, about as we expected. No change in the profit outlook for the year, $1.6 billion of ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter, $1.5 billion share repurchase, 10% increase in the dividend. We think we've done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We've improved our market position and our operations. Now all that said, we'd certainly be happy to see a better global economy.
So with that, we are ready to take your questions."

A number of facilities have been downsized, closed and have been announced to do so in the next -- this year and next year. We'll continually view that. What we're hearing from customers, of course, and seeing from customers is an ongoing fairly high production rate. Now I don't know how long that will hold up. But so far, we haven't seen a big drop in production. We certainly see no expansion and won't for the foreseeable future. But we have not seen any -- or we -- I guess we have seen our trucks and ancillary equipment especially being used longer and longer and longer. Service intervals being extended. As long as we see that, we know there's a replacement cycle coming at some point. It's just extended. In terms of where do we see us long term, I think a lot of that's going to depend on what we see for long-term growth rate. And is the world going to grow at 2% for the next 10 years? Or is it going to grow at 3% or something else? And I think we'll continue to monitor that. We do that right now. And particularly as we go into '16, we'll take a look at that towards the end of the year.

It's been funded now and run by the Chinese. It's a somewhat similar bank to the several regional banks that are around, whether it's Latin America or Asia -- to some degree, World Bank. They are focusing certainly around Asian infrastructure. We're there. Our business model works very well. I think a significant piece of this is aimed at the Silk Road, the new silk -- one belt, one road project. It's probably a 50-year project going forward. My expectation would be that we're a local Chinese company. Our dealer service products throughout that region. And when it comes down to it, and they build infrastructure, complete those kinds of things funded by that AIIB, that the best supplier is going to win construction equipment, just like anything else. Now will there be bias in another direction? Probably, as we see today, but we do pretty well in China. So my expectation is that that's China trying to take its investments even more broadly than they have been doing. We do it -- we've done pretty well with that around the world so far, and that would be my expectation going forward. Having said that, a bit political. It would be nice to see the United States involved with that. We've not been -- a lot of the European countries have joined in, and most Asians have joined in to aim at areas that need a lot of development, and that, I hope, is in our future.

I mean there are some headwinds in the second half of this year. And again, I'm not going to get into next year, but I'll just -- I'll talk about a couple. One is inventory absorption impact is negative. This y",672,"David, this is Mike. Let me start with that. I mean there are some headwinds in the second half of this year. And again, I'm not going to get into next year, but I'll just -- I'll talk about a couple. One is inventory absorption impact is negative. This year, we're going to end up with a pretty healthy -- by the time we get to the end of the year, we think, a reasonably healthy inventory reduction for Cat inventory. And if you think about it, our sales this year versus last year are down from about $55 billion and then our outlook down to about $49 billion. And so there's inventory coming out. Now without getting too far ahead and talking about next year, I'll just say, if I look at what the analyst consensus is right now for next year, it's not our forecast, but collectively, you guys have our sales about roughly flat with that next year. And if that were the case, the degree of inventory coming out, which is going to be pretty heavily weighted to the second half of this year, that would be less of a drag. So I think the second half of this year is going to have some negatives in it related to that. Also, there's a lot of first half, second half differences, some that are seasonal. Just for example, we tend to build dealer inventory in the first half of the year as we're kind of preparing for the summer selling season, particularly for construction. And then we tend to use -- dealers tend to use inventory in the second half of the year, and we tend to undersell demand. And that will be the case, we think, again this year, we expect dealer inventories to come down. So there are some kind of built-in headwinds in the second half of the year. So I'm not going to get into a guidance game too much, but I don't think it's appropriate to probably take the second half of this year and multiply it by 2, I think, because of headwinds like that. Now all that said, next year will definitely be set up as a bit of a mix problem for us. We have -- if you think about this year, particularly in the recip piece of oil and gas, we came into the year with a pretty decent backlog, so much of the sales decline that we're going to have for the year in oil and gas is going to be in the second half of the year. So -- and one way to think of it is, good first half, a reasonable first half for recip oil and gas, lower second half. Unless something changes in the marketplace, I think the likelihood is that you'd have a couple of weak halves next year. I mean the backlog now we're kind of through. So I think without -- and I don't think that's likely a big secret, year-over-year -- full year-over-year, you'll be looking at probably some margin weakness because of that. I think in terms of E&T margins overall, they've done a great job. I mean just -- if you look at the work that they've done over the past 3, 4 years, it's just been phenomenal. And in -- I mean we focus a lot and we talk a lot when we have you on the phone about oil and gas, but they've taken up margins in almost every part of the business. I mean industrial, for example, they've done a fabulous job on controlling costs and getting margins up there. So I think it's no doubt with recip oil and gas coming down, there will be some pressure on E&T margins in the second half of the year. And unless the situation with oil and gas changes, I'm sure those pressures will continue. I know you would've probably liked a little more of a numerical discussion around '16, but we'll have that maybe in October."

So I -- and I mean without again getting too specific, I would suspect, if the seasonal patterns hold that on the second half, we probably build a little bit of backlog in construction. In mining, the whole book-to-bill has been slightly negative. I mean it's getting to a point where there's not a lot of drawdown coming, and I think we should probably be coming to the point where that's not very significant one way or the other. Until we get a recovery, that would be great. And then in E&T, you talked about the backlog coming down this year, and that goes back to the point that I made a little bit ago. We started the year with a pretty healthy backlog of recip engines for oil and gas, and that's worked down throughout the year. There might be a little bit more of that to come out.

With the work we've been able to do on our variable margin, we're going to be right around 25% for that period. We're well below 25% to 30% decremental in the first half of the year. And so because of that, we're very happy to be able to fund our R&D programs and to be in a position of strength to have those when the market does turn around. And as Doug mentioned, we've got close to $8 billion of cash. Our debt-to-cap is low. We don't have huge CapEx needs at this point in time. And we're going to fund R&D close to the levels of 2012, which was a record year. And we'll do all that and still have a very strong balance sheet heading into next year."

So I think if you look at our business, we, a bit like dealers, sometimes tend to build some inventory in the beginning of the year as we're ramping up production for the selling season. And then when we get particularly in the fourth quarter, we have a tendency to sell more than we produce. Inventory comes down. So I think a part of what you're going to see in the fourth quarter is just a little bit of a seasonal pattern for us. That happened last year as well. We had a pretty sizable inventory reduction in the second half. I think if you just look at our inventory levels broadly, Cat inventory, we're working on lean. We'd like, kind of year in and year out, to take them down for efficiency. It would be nice if we had enough increase in volume that it caused inventory to go up from a volume standpoint. But all else being equal, we're working hard to improve inventory turns and be more efficient. So I guess, all else being equal, we'd like to see it continue to come down a little bit as we improve processes. But -- and I'll make a comment on dealer inventory, too. It wasn't asked directly. But I think most of what we're seeing over the course of the -- this year, first half, second half, it was -- it will be more reduction in the second half. But again, I think there's some seasonality in dealer inventory that way. It'll likely start to build again in the first quarter for the selling season. And I don't think dealer inventories overall are out of line or problematic or anything of the case like that. So I think, reasonably speaking, most of the dealer inventory reduction that was -- because there was too much, per se, happened in 2013 and 2014.
With that, we are at the top of the hour, and I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We'll sign off and talk to you again next quarter."

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information, and that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in the aggregate, could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, that's Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can be found in our financial release today, and that's also been posted at our caterpillar.com website.
Okay. Let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing our financial results for the second quarter and our outlook for 2015. For the quarter, sales and revenues were $12.3 billion and profit per share was $1.16, and that was $1.27 excluding restructuring costs. Also, those numbers were about -- is about what we expected. No big surprises. In fact, from a macro standpoint, much of what we were expecting when 2015 started seems to be playing out. We expected that mining would continue to be very weak, and it certainly has. We were concerned about weakening sales of construction equipment in China and Brazil, and both are down substantially from last year. With the sharp drop in oil prices from last fall, we expected we'd have sales headwinds in our Energy & Transportation segment and in construction equipment sales in the parts of the world where oil production was important, and that's happened.
Now on the plus side, we also expected that our people would continue to execute on the things that we can control. And we've done that with decremental margins better than our target. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and a balance sheet that remains healthy with a debt-to-cap ratio near 35%.
So with that introduction behind us, let's get into a little more detail on the quarter. Again, sales and revenues were 13% lower than last year. The decline was widespread with lower sales in every geographic region of the world and down versus last year in each of our business segments.
We'll start with Construction Industries, which was down 18% and down in all regions. Latin America was the most significant decline, down 47%, and that was mostly a result of weak demand in general and, in particular, Brazil and also absence of a large order that we had from the Brazilian government from last year. Asia Pacific region was down 30%, with much of that decline in China and Japan. In China, the construction industry continued to weaken. And in Japan, the main issue was currency exchange as the yen weakened versus the dollar, and our sales that are denominated in yen there are translating into fewer dollars.
In the Europe, Africa, Middle East region, Construction Industries sales were down 18%, and much of that was from currency translation as local currencies, particularly the euro, were weaker than the dollar compared with the second quarter of last year. In addition, there was some unfavorable dealer inventory change in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region.
Now North America was off 3%, and we have seen some strength in residential and nonresidential construction, but that's been offset, or slightly more than offset, by a drop in sales to customers serving oil and gas.
In Resource Industries, which is mostly mining, sales were down 11% versus the second quarter of 2014, and mining sales continue to weaken for both new equipment and, to a lesser degree, for aftermarket parts. Sales related to quarry and aggregates did improve, but it wasn't enough to offset the decline in mining.
In Resource Industries, sales were down in all regions. Suffice to say, that mining remains weak around the world, and we haven't yet seen signs of a recovery. If you'd like a little more regional flavor, there's more in the Resource Industries section in this morning's financial release.
For Energy & Transportation, sales were down 12%. And while down in all regions, I think probably the most useful way to cover Energy & Transportation is by major industry, and that's oil and gas, transportation, power gen and industrial sales. In short, sales in each of these industries was down. And in order of magnitude, the most significant decline was for transportation, and that was mostly lower locomotive sales in North America. Locomotive sales last year in 2014 were pretty good. In 2015, regulations for emissions changed in the United States and Tier 4 started. And our tier locomotive isn't expected to be available until later in 2016, so sales this year are down.
Now oil- and gas-related sales were also lower, and that's probably not surprising to you given the decline in oil prices over the past year and softening investment by oil producers. Sales of industrial engines also declined. And just for your reference, we sell these industrial engines to ag customers, electric power packagers, construction and material handling customers and for a wide variety of other applications. And in general, demand was down a bit, and currency also had an unfavorable impact, particularly in Europe.
Power generation sales were also down, and most of that was currency translation-related, again in Europe in particular, where our euro-based sales translated to fewer dollars. 
Okay. That's a summary of sales and revenues. Again, all in all, about as we expected for the quarter and down about 13% from last year.
Profit (sic) [profit per share] in the quarter was $1.16. We did have $0.11 a share or $89 million of restructuring cost. And without restructuring, profit was $1.27. Our profit is down from a year ago while we were $1.57 all in and $1.69 last year in the second quarter, excluding restructuring. Operating profit declined from $1,475,000,000 in the second quarter last year to $1,130,000,000 this year. Now that's a drop of $345 million. More than all of that decline, $483 million in total, was a result of lower sales volume.
In addition, Financial Products was down $49 million. Our R&D costs were a little bit higher than the second quarter of last year as well.
Now on the favorable side for operating profit, price realization was a positive. It was $84 million. Certainly in the right direction, but less than 1% of sales. Manufacturing costs were slightly favorable and would have been more so if not for a headwind from inventory absorption, and that was a result of an increase in our inventory over the course of the second quarter of 2014 and a decline in inventory in the second quarter of 2015.
Let's talk about currency for a moment. While the impact on sales was negative, over $400 million, it was actually positive to operating profit, about $80 million. And that's because we have a significant cost base outside the U.S. and a stronger U.S. dollar causes those costs to translate into fewer dollars, and that more than offset the negative impact on sales. Now there are other currency impacts in our P&L as well below operating profit.
And other income and expense, again below operating profit, quarter-over-quarter was unfavorable, $78 million. And most of that was related to currency translation on our balance sheet position and hedging. So in summary, on balance, relative to profit, currency didn't have much of an impact second-quarter to second-quarter. Okay, that's profit versus last year, and the major story is sales volume.
So let's turn to the outlook, and that will be actually pretty easy to cover because little has actually changed. Back in January, with our original outlook, we expected sales and revenues of about $50 billion. And at the end of the first quarter, we held that. This morning, we lowered about $1 billion to $49 billion. The most important point in that is, for the most part, the change is currency-related. The dollar strengthened some in the first quarter and strengthened a bit more in the second quarter, particularly against the yen, and it's moved enough versus our original outlook that we needed to reflect it in today's updated outlook for the year.
Now sitting here about halfway through the year, except for currency impacts, the overall sales and revenues outlook is pretty -- is still pretty close to what we expected when we started the year. While we would have liked to have been surprised to the upside, our sales outlook of 6 months ago is proving to be pretty accurate so far, particularly given the degree of uncertainty in the world and the things that we expected would happen in 2015, including world economic growth that wasn't much different than '14, the impact of lower oil prices on Energy & Transportation and construction equipment sales, lower mining sales, headwinds in China and Brazil and the decline in locomotive sales.
Now profit in the outlook is being held flat with what we expected at the end of the first quarter, and that's $4.70 a share or $5 a share excluding restructuring. While that's unchanged from last quarter, it is up from our original outlook from January, which was $4.60 a share or $4.75 without restructuring. And I mentioned it a few minutes ago, and I think it's probably worth repeating while we're talking about the outlook: what happened in the second quarter for sales and profit is about what we were expecting when we were on this call 3 months ago. Now if you consider that our full year outlook and actual results for the first half, it's evident that we're expecting lower sales and profit in the second half of the year. Excluding restructuring costs, our outlook would reflect about $1.24 decline in profit per share first half to second half. And that's a result of lower sales in the second half, about $1 billion. Seasonal cost patterns. The first quarter is usually a pretty light quarter for cost, and the fourth quarter is seasonally higher, and that includes R&D costs. We have the absence of the gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining interest in the third-party logistics business. We do expect some negative sales mix in the second half, particularly related to oil and gas. That will likely decline more in the second half than it has in the first half. And we're expecting more negative inventory absorption. We're forecasting a decent-sized inventory decline, that's Caterpillar inventory, in the second half of the year, more than the first half of the year.
Now in terms of how the next 2 quarters are going to play out, we think that sales will be less in the third quarter than the fourth quarter, about $750 million lower. And that's not unusual. Just for example, in 2014, last year, sales in the third quarter were about $700 million below the fourth quarter.
Now as of a result of lower sales in the third quarter, third quarter is likely to be our lowest-profit quarter for the year. As expected, again, 2015 is turning out to be another challenging year. We're serving several industries that at the moment are weak: mining, oil and gas and in many parts of the world, construction, again particularly China and Brazil. We are, however, executing on the things that are more in our control. We've taken substantial restructuring actions and more are likely. We're improving quality, safety and our market position for many of our products. We're also generating cash. Our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow, again, was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And given the weakness in many of our businesses right now, we don't need cash to deploy for capacity, and our balance sheet is strong. Our ME&T debt-to-cap ratio is near 35%, well within our target range, and we have $7.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. And that brings me to the other announcement we made this morning. And that's our intention to repurchase another $1.5 billion of stock in the third quarter. Now that, plus what we've repurchased in the first half, should take us to around $2 billion by the time we get to the end of the third quarter. And as a reminder, we did increase the quarterly dividend in the second quarter, and that was back in June. We took it up $0.10 from $0.70 a quarter to $0.77. And if you annualize that, it's a rate of about $3.08 a share.
So in summary, sales and profit in the second quarter, about as we expected. No change in the profit outlook for the year, $1.6 billion of ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter, $1.5 billion share repurchase, 10% increase in the dividend. We think we've done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We've improved our market position and our operations. Now all that said, we'd certainly be happy to see a better global economy.
So with that, we are ready to take your questions."

A number of facilities have been downsized, closed and have been announced to do so in the next -- this year and next year. We'll continually view that. What we're hearing from customers, of course, and seeing from customers is an ongoing fairly high production rate. Now I don't know how long that will hold up. But so far, we haven't seen a big drop in production. We certainly see no expansion and won't for the foreseeable future. But we have not seen any -- or we -- I guess we have seen our trucks and ancillary equipment, especially, being used longer and longer and longer. Service intervals being extended. As long as we see that, we know there's a replacement cycle coming at some point. It's just extended. In terms of where do we see this long term, I think a lot of that's going to depend on what we see for long-term growth rate. And is the world going to grow at 2% for the next 10 years? Or is it going to grow at 3% or something else? And I think we'll continue to monitor that. We do that right now.

They are focusing certainly around Asian infrastructure. We're there. Our business model works very well. I think a significant piece of this is aimed at the Silk Road, the new silk -- one belt, one road project. It's probably a 50-year project going forward. My expectation would be that we're a local Chinese company. Our dealers service products throughout that region. And when it comes down to it, and they build infrastructure, complete those kinds of things funded by that AIIB, that the best supplier is going to win on construction equipment, just like anything else. Now will there be bias in another direction? Probably, as we see today, but we do pretty well in China. So my expectation is that that's China trying to take its investments even more broadly than they have been doing. We do it -- we've done pretty well with that around the world so far, and that would be my expectation going forward. Having said that, a bit political. It would be nice to see the United States involved with that. We've not been.

And we've got pretty good cost reduction doing that. So that's a lot of work between suppliers, purchasing, our engineering group to take cost beyond inflation and commodities out of the product. That continues this year. I think our expectation is there's still quite a bit of room to go there. That's always an ongoing effort. Above and beyond that, it does rely a little bit on what's going on with commodities, but I think there's still a lot of room to run there."

I mean there are some headwinds in the second half of this year. And again, I'm not going to get into next year, but I'll just -- I'll talk about a couple. One is inventory absorption impact is negative. This y",671,"David, this is Mike. Let me start with that. I mean there are some headwinds in the second half of this year. And again, I'm not going to get into next year, but I'll just -- I'll talk about a couple. One is inventory absorption impact is negative. This year, we're going to end up with a pretty healthy -- by the time we get to the end of the year, we think, a reasonably healthy inventory reduction for Cat inventory. And if you think about it, our sales this year versus last year are down from about $55 billion and in our outlook down to about $49 billion. And so there's inventory coming out. Now without getting too far ahead and talking about next year, I'll just say, if I look at what the analyst consensus is right now for next year, it's not our forecast, but collectively, you guys have our sales about roughly flat with that next year. And if that were the case, the degree of inventory coming out, which is going to be pretty heavily weighted to the second half of this year, that would be less of a drag. So I think the second half of this year is going to have some negatives in it related to that. Also, there's a lot of first half, second half differences, some that are seasonal. Just for example, we tend to build dealer inventory in the first half of the year as we're kind of preparing for the summer selling season, particularly for construction. And then we tend to use -- dealers tend to use inventory in the second half of the year, and we tend to undersell demand. And that will be the case, we think, again this year, we expect dealer inventories to come down. So there are some kind of built-in headwinds in the second half of the year. So I'm not going to get into a guidance game too much, but I don't think it's appropriate to probably take the second half of this year and multiply by 2, I think, because of headwinds like that. Now all that said, next year will definitely be set up as a bit of a mix problem for us. We have -- if you think about this year, particularly in the recip piece of oil and gas, we came into the year with a pretty decent backlog, so much of the sales decline that we're going to have for the year in oil and gas is going to be in the second half of the year. So -- and one way to think of it is, good first half, a reasonable first half for recip, oil and gas, lower second half. Unless something changes in the marketplace, I think the likelihood is that you'd have a couple of weak halves next year. I mean the backlog now we're kind of through. So I think without -- and I don't think that's likely a big secret, year-over-year -- full year-over-year, you'll be looking at probably some margin weakness because of that. I think in terms of E&T margins overall, they've done a great job. I mean just -- if you look at the work that they've done over the past 3, 4 years, it's just been phenomenal. And in -- I mean we focus a lot and we talk a lot when we have you on the phone about oil and gas, but they've taken up margins in almost every part of the business. I mean industrial, for example, they've done a fabulous job on controlling costs and getting margins up there. So I think it's no doubt with recip, oil and gas coming down, there will be some pressure on E&T margins in the second half of the year. And unless the situation with oil and gas changes, I'm sure those pressures will continue. I know you would've probably liked a little more of a numerical discussion around '16, but we'll have that maybe in October."

So I -- and I mean without again getting too specific, I would suspect, if the seasonal patterns hold, that on the second half we'd probably build a little bit of backlog in construction. In mining, the whole book-to-bill has been slightly negative. I mean it's getting to a point where there's not a lot of drawdown coming, and I think we should probably be coming to the point where that's not very significant one way or the other. Until we get a recovery, that would be great. And then in E&T, you talked about the backlog coming down this year, and that goes back to the point that I made a little bit ago. We started the year with a pretty healthy backlog of recip engines for oil and gas, and that's worked down throughout the year. There might be a little bit more of that to come out.

I'm just saying that sales next year are going to be dependent a lot on what happens in the global economy. We're on the edge right now of what's needed for growth. We have a pretty decent correlation, particularly in the U.S. When GDP is above 2.5%, we tend to grow. When it's about 2.5% or below, it varies by degree, we don't.

So I think if you look at our business, we, a bit like dealers, sometimes tend to build some inventory in the beginning of the year as we're ramping up production for the selling season. And then when we get particularly in the fourth quarter, we have a tendency to sell more than we produce and inventory comes down. So I think a part of what you're going to see in the fourth quarter is just a little bit of a seasonal pattern for us. That happened last year as well. We had a pretty sizable inventory reduction in the second half. I think if you just look at our inventory levels broadly, Cat inventory, we're working on lean. We'd like, kind of year in and year out, to take them down for efficiency. It would be nice if we had enough increase in volume that it caused inventory to go up from a volume standpoint. But all else being equal, we're working hard to improve inventory turns and be more efficient. So I guess, all else being equal, we'd like to see it continue to come down a little bit as we improve processes. But -- and I'll make a comment on dealer inventory, too. It wasn't asked directly. But I think most of what we're seeing over the course of the -- this year, first half, second half, it was -- it will be more reduction in the second half. But again, I think there's some seasonality in dealer inventory that way. It'll likely start to build again in the first quarter for the selling season. And I don't think dealer inventories overall are out of line or problematic or anything of the case like that. So I think, reasonably speaking, most of the dealer inventory reduction that was -- because there was too much, per se, happened in 2013 and 2014.
With that, we are at the top of the hour, and I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We'll sign off and talk to you again next quarter."

So we're going to do today's conference call a little bit differently than we have in the past. We're going to be going through a slide deck. And if you don't have that in front of you right now, it's available on our website, caterpillar.com, and it's where the conference call link is for the webcast. And it's under Events & Presentations, and it's also in the Quarterly Results section. So I'll go through the forward-looking statements, and if you need to get that, please do. 
So this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. Any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the code without the express written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investor section of our caterpillar.com website, and that will be on the section labeled Results Webcast. 
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in the aggregate, could make actual results differ materially from our projections and can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, also in the forward-looking statement language in today's release. It's also on Page 2 of this morning's slide deck. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release as well and at the end of our presentation material. And again, all that's been posted at the caterpillar.com website. 
Okay, with that, let's get started with the slide deck, and if I could ask you to flip the Page 3. The page numbers are at the bottom of each page. So the first page of the agenda, that's this discussion, I'll be going over third quarter results, the '15 outlook and the preliminary view of '16. That will go fairly quickly, then I'll turn it over to Doug Oberhelman, and he'll walk through kind of business conditions and segment in key industries, actions we've taken, progress we've made and the things we're doing to protect the future of the company. 
So with that, let's turn to Page 4. And I'm going to start off with something again a little different. If you look to the bottom right-hand corner of the slide, well, first, at the top of the slide, we have sales and revenues, profit per share, profit per share without restructuring cost. So $13.5 billion in the third quarter a year ago, $11 billion in sales and revenues this third quarter. That's a decline of about 19% or $2.5 billion. About 14% of that is volume. About 3.5% of that was currency. 
Our profit per share all in dropped at at $1.1 [ph] from $163 to $162. And excluding restructuring costs, a similar amount down $0.97 from $1.72 to $0.75. Now down the bottom right-hand corner, I have a comment and it's not year-over-year, but comment the is kind of relative to probably the expectations that we have going into the quarter and probably the expectations that you had going into the quarter. We have 2 items that we didn't really expect that are of some significance here. One is lower incentive compensation, and that's because we lowered the outlook. Our previous outlook, excluding restructuring cost, was $5. The current forecast, excluding restructuring, is $4.60. And that means that incentive comp is going to be lower, and we made a year-to-date adjustment to that expense in the third quarter. That was actually favorable for profit about $0.09 a share. The flip side of that is we had currency translation heavy losses on our non-U.S. assets and liabilities, and that was about $135 million negative in the quarter. Now this is not what runs through our operating profit. It's not the translation impact on sales and cost. This is a sort of your net monetary position. You have an asset or liability position in foreign currencies or operations outside the U.S. We had the losses in this quarter of about $135 million, and a lot of that was from Brazil and China where currencies weakened during the quarter. We don't forecast of that. We tend not to forecast short-term currency movements. And so versus where we were at the end of July when we talked about our full year forecast, that was new news. 
So now let's step back a little bit and talk about the change quarter-over-quarter. Again, sales down 19%, and that was mostly lower volume; the negative currency, about 3.5%; and we also had a small change in price realization, a negative about 0.5%. And it certainly a tough environment for pricing out there. Volume is down. It's very competitive, and the strong dollar is not helping that disclosure. Now third quarter of last year, sales were still pretty strong in our businesses that support loyal customers. It was also a good quarter a year ago for locomotive sales in our Energy & Transportation segment. And both of those businesses are down this year. Energy & Transportation was the biggest contributor to that $2.5 billion decline in sales. They accounted for about $1.4 billion of it. Construction was also down, and that was really led by Latin America and Asia. And Latin America, Brazil, generally in recession, difficult economic environment there, and sales for us certainly reflect that difficulty. And Asia, the same can be said for China, slowing growth, quite depressed construction equipment market in China. Resource Industries, which is again principally mining, also down a bit. But as the number there -- numbers there decline, percentage changes have less and less impact on the dollars. So that's a quick review of sales. Again, profit in the quarter, excluding restructuring, was $0.97, and it was down to $1.01. And essentially, the profit decline was a result of the lower sales volume. Currency, again, was a little negative overall. I talked about the impact below operating profit, the negative $0.17 in this quarter. It was actually a positive next year, so the year-over-year impact of that below operating profit currency was even more. That was offset a little bit by currency benefits up in operating profit. Sales translated lower, but it was pretty positive for costs. 
Manufacturing costs and SG&A were both lower, and that was a partial offset to the lower volume. So again, that's a quick run-through of the third quarter. If I could get you to move on to the next slide, Slide 5 at the top, it's titled 2015 outlook. So let's orient the slide. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have the outlook that we had in July with our second quarter financial. At that point in time, we were thinking this year was going to be about $49 billion in sales and revenues, profit of about $4.70 a share or $5 without the restructuring cost. Now you can see on the box below that, a month ago, we did update that sales outlook to about $48 billion. We've kept that today. Sales and revenues at the top end, about $48 billion. Now it says on this slide here, top end of about $48 billion. So the situation is, we have a tendency to round our full year sales forecast to the nearest billion, and most of the time, that's okay when you have quite a bit of runway for the rest of the year. At this point in the year, we only have 1 quarter to go, so I think it was good to remind everyone that we do tend to round it to the nearest billion. And in this particular case, we round it up to $48 billion from our internal forecast, and that's by and large about the same as it was when we updated the outlook a month ago. 
So if we look at the profit outlook today, it's $4.60 excluding restructuring and $4.60 [ph] including some fairly substantial restructuring. The restructuring cost for the year are about expected to be about $800 million now. In July, with our profit outlook for the second quarter release, we were thinking about $250 million. That big increase is a result of all the actions that we announced on September 24, and I think Doug will talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes. And so if you look at the change from, excluding restructuring, from $5 down to $4.60, really more than all of that was due to -- or about all that was due to the decline in the sales and revenues forecast. We also had the $0.17 negative that was in the quarter for currency translation. But partly offsetting that, we have lower-cost for the rest of the year. Some because we're, I think, doing a pretty good job of managing cost out, and some of it because incentive compensation for the year is going to be a bit lower. So that's a quick recap of the 2015 outlook. 
If I could get you to go to Page 6, and that's the outlook, preliminary outlook for sales and revenues for next year. And this is essentially unchanged from what we said a month ago in our restructuring announcement. We think 2016 is going to be about 5% below 2015. Now this would be our fourth consecutive down year. That's never happened to Caterpillar in the history of the company. Resource industries again, which is primarily mining, we're expecting to be down around 10%, but again from a very low base. I can tell you 10% means a lot less today than 10% meant in 2012. Construction Industries, down flat to down 5% from 2015. Energy & Transportation, down 5% to 10%, and that's mostly, not entirely, but mostly oil and gas. I think it's worth mentioning around oil and gas, the biggest impact we've seen has been for reciprocating engines and related to drilling and well servicing. We had a pretty good healthy large backlog of those kind of products where we came into 2015. The result of that is our sales in the first half of the year, we've talked about this before, were higher than what order rates were at that time because we were working off that backlog. That's largely behind us now. We're going to have a very challenged second half of 2015. So in '15, we had a good first half or that kind of products, a much weaker second half. Essentially what we have for that kind of product in 2016 is 2 weak halves, first half and second half. And that's quite a bit of a change year-over-year in Energy & Transportation. 
Okay, if I could get you to move on and then to Page 7. This is a little bit of a setup. After this one, I'm going to turn it over to Doug. And it's just a depiction of what's happened to our sales since peak, which was in 2012. It's been a pretty difficult 3 years. We think next year will kind of continue that. Overall, we were about $66 billion in sales and revenues in 2012. Next year, we're going to be down probably a little more than $20 billion from that level, and that ends up being over 30%. Now what makes up the decline tough and I think our performance more significant is that most of that decline, nearly 2/3 of it has been in Resource Industries, which is primarily Mining, and back in 2012, it was without question, our most profitable segment. Another 10% of the $20 billion-or-so decline is a result of currency impacts. Now I should also -- it's not noted on the chart, but in construction, we're also down. And fundamentally, one of the things that's changed is emerging -- or not emerging, developing countries construction, Asia, Latin America has also declined over that period. 
So that's a recap, and with that, I'd like to turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman."

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We're taking a little different approach this quarter with the way in which we go through our business. Mike summarized the quarter well, I think. And it's opera",3732,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We're taking a little different approach this quarter with the way in which we go through our business. Mike summarized the quarter well, I think. And it's operationally reasonably solid, particularly when you factor back in that translation loss primarily in Brazil. There are not too many months. You have a 22% devaluation in the currency anywhere in the world, that's certainly what happened in Brazil in the third quarter. 
What I'd like to do is run down our key industries and kind of talk about where we see them today. And then a little bit of a reminder of while cyclical, why we like it's so much over time. And I would just that without some going to start on Page 8 and talk about Mining a little bit. There's no question that the China-driven commodity super-cycle drove a lot of things up in the world the last decade or so, and now we're living off the backlash of that. It's kind of amazing to me that even with that, the amount of mining activity going on that is ore and overburdened being moved with the exception of coal is still running at a pretty high level around the world. And that is one of the things that has kind of baffled us in terms of the replacement cycle as our trucks and fleet have continued to operate without replacement and, frankly, with a very extended aftermarket and product support levels as minors are doing what they need to do to preserve cash, lower expenses. We haven't seen that dramatic of an extension in the life cycles ever. There's also a big push for productivity, which we like an awful lot because it plays to our business model. And as a result of that, of course, all that piled onto the peak of '12, and we're now at levels to go way back. The other interesting thing in terms of mining trucks at the peak in '11 and '12, we're producing 1,500-plus trucks per year at the run rate. Certainly, in '15, we'll be probably 90% -- 10% of that 90% -- 70% -- or 80% to 90% below that. And with no replace -- where the replacement cycle being extended, the parts demand being deferred a bit, we're seeing that really come through in 2015. I guess if there's a silver lining in the cloud, as long as ore and overburden is removed, the trucks are running, the fleets are moving, capacity, the excess capacity of mining is being used up at some point, that replacement cycle will come back to us. We won't need a boom, and I don't expect a boom like we saw in the 2000s, but the replacement cycle would feel pretty good and we'll be ready for that when it happens. Long term, I think all of you are aware the population growth in the planet, the demand for electricity, the demand for a lot of things, including coal, and in fact, even the U.S. Government Commerce Energy Departments forecast fairly healthy energy growth over the next 20 years, 30 years, including all aspects of energy supply coal; nuclear, not so much; but certainly gas will be a big player on that as well. So we expect over time this industry to come back. And of course, for surface mines, we provide -- can provide up to 70% of the rolling stock that goes into surface mine, and we worked a lot under our underground mine that we didn't have prior to a few years ago. So we're very bullish about this over the long term. And particularly as our business model matures here, I think we'll be set up. The problem, of course, is this big whiplash we've seen from the bust of the super-cycle. 
Moving on into oil and gas, and I would draw distinction here as we have been doing lately between oil and gas. Oil certainly has taken the brunt of the downturn. You know the oil price. Everybody does. We've seen CapEx dry up in that market. Our customers are adjusting, and we see idle rigs all over the place. Therein lies the turnaround some point where supply drops and demand continues to grow. But in the case of oil, that's where we see and of course, we big backlog both primarily in recip a year ago, we worked through that. And as we go into '16, that's what Mike talked about, fueling a full year impact to the oil drop and, to some degree, gas. Gas has held up a little bit better. Gas pipelines have been good. The expansion of compression has been good, and of course, the conversion of a lot of coal plants to natural gas has helped that demand. And while gas prices have come down quite a bit, they haven't tanked as we've seen with the coal or oil for that matter. So this is another really super business for us long term with our solar turbine business, which is a key player and provider in compression and elsewhere. Our recent business -- and over time, as the world sorts out supply and demand, we'll enjoy that business. Again, it's a great aftermarket business as well, aftermarket opportunity. 
Moving into construction, and we've got just kind of by region here. As we go through, North America is okay, and I'm on Page 11 -- I'm sorry, Page 10, i beg your pardon, I missed Energy & Transportation. I'll go back. Thank you, Mike. Page 10 and specifically talking about rail here. I just went through oil and gas. Rail has -- rail, primarily through Progress Rail acquisition there in the late 2000s and the acquisition of EMD, have really put us on the map internationally in the rail business. It's a business, we like an awful lot. It has a lot of characteristics in our larger horsepower, bigger iron products that we're used to dealing with. And it's turned out to be a -- one with a lot of growth and opportunity as well. We've done an awful lot of restructuring, primarily in EMD the last few years and are now quite competitive with the others in that business, particularly internationally. Our 2015 locomotive sales are down. There's no question that we did not have a Tier 4-ready locomotive. At the beginning of 2015, I would tell you that we planned it that way based on some early discussions with our customers in the rail business. A year ago, it looked like demand was taking off. Our Tier 4 locomotive will be ready the middle of next year or so. We have orders today. The preliminary results are very positive. And in fact, as we've seen the rail business soften here lately, I'm kind of fueling that are about our transition to Tier 4 where we'll end up. So quite happy with that long term. It's plays to all of our strengths here at Caterpillar with an awful lot of -- with an awful lot of after market opportunity And frankly, the EMD predecessors really led atrophy. So we're spending a lot of time on that in our Progress Rail and EMD part, getting lots of opportunities internationally and certainly with a very high-quality Tier 4 locomotive shares a lot of the DNA from our recent business. Our normal cap from business will have a very competitive product there moving on to 2016. 
Now I'll go to Page 11 and talk a little bit about construction regionally. At North America, as we said, for next year, flat to down a little bit this year. We've kind of seen it's a slow down a bit as the year wears on. Certainly, residential is improving. There's statistics and news the last few days of it even better, and non-res is building. What we need, frankly, is some heavy civil and highway. I am optimistic that we'll get some kind of in highway bill here between now and the end of the year. I'm optimistic that there'll be a multiyear, and we'll jumpstart this a little bit certainly from a low base anything feel good. We've seen a number of states around the country enact initiatives, whether it's bonds or tax increases to pay for infrastructure. That will get going this winter. And I would think by spring, we can see a little uptick in that piece of it. But again, we're calling kind of flat to down a little in our construction business for 2016. Latin America, led by Brazil, is weak. I was just in Brazil 2 weeks ago. It's a profound slowdown there. I wouldn't expect to see much of an upturn until '16. But what the Brazilians are talking about, what they typically have done in the past to stimulate their economy has been around infrastructure. So if they get that together, we could see that coming out sometime in the next year as well. 
Europe Africa/Middle East, really a split set the story. Europe is actually kind of stable and positive. We've seen that in some of our retail numbers. We've just had a big -- we had several of our officers in Europe with the big distributor meeting in the news is not -- is no longer totally doom and gloom, but there are some stories. Our numbers don't reflect all of that yet. But I'd say and some of you heard me say this, I think that Western Europe anyway, including Scandinavia and Southern Europe, is probably where the United States was 2 to 3 years ago, particularly with the QE now I think finally starting to kick in there. Middle East is all about the oil price and political unrest, and we've seen that. Asia/Pacific is backed up for China. And China has really -- is working to transform their economy long term. It's going to be great. It will be the largest construction equipment market in the world. I like our market position there. I like our business model there. It's coming our way, but they're planning out the impact of cycles and as we see that as well. So long term, again, population growth, lots of infrastructure needs, hindered to some degree by a lot of debt load. But over time, that infrastructure will be demanded in needed, and we'll be right in the middle of that as it goes. 
Moving to number 12, Page 12, I'd like to talk now a little bit about operational progress. Even in this tough business climate, I'm very happy to report to you, this is not news for most of you, but we've had a market position increase every year since 2010, and our market position is up significantly around the world in that period of time. It's due to several things. I think, one, the quality of our product has never been better by our metrics around defects per unit. Our dealers are performing well. We lost only 1 dealer in the Great Recession, and they're very strong today, as strong as they've ever been. And the quality of our -- the design of our product in the Tier 4 offerings that we're putting out there are strong. So even with overcapacity in the industry and even with a very weak set of currencies for many of our competitors, even the last year, our market share is up slightly around the world. And I think that it says a lot about what we can do, should be doing in a downturn as we're in and what we can do with things recover. We're managing costs I think pretty well. We've talk to you all for years about increment and decrement profit margins. When we grow from $32 billion in '09 to $66 billion in '12. We were right in there with our incremental margin of 25% plus. As we've seen the top line come down from 66 to 48 now this year, we've been in that decremental margin area of 25% to 30%. Now we announced a major restructuring obviously a month ago as we anticipated 2016 to get out in front of that. And I would say going into '16, we feel good about continuing on our decremental margin program if sales are down, which they appear to be and will be in 2016. I talked about product quality, our balance sheet, I can't say enough about. We entered the recession, and we entered 2009 with a debt-to-cap ratio of almost 60% and kind of normal operating cash on the balance sheet, today, even after a fairly significant stock buyback the last couple of years, a dividend increase of 83% during this period of time, our balance sheet is strong at 37.5% debt-to-cap with about double the amount of cash or balance sheet of $6 billion, which sets was up for I think just about anything that come at a cycle-wise or opportunity-wise in the future. 3 of our 4 best years in history have been the last few years in cash flow. I mentioned the dividend, the stock buyback, and I want to emphasize that the dividend is a priority use of cash. It's particularly the maintenance thereof. We did not reduce the dividend in the '08, '09 financial crisis. We paid the dividend every year for over 20 years and maintaining that is a key use of our cash, a priority of our company. 
Just to comment on Cat Financial and our captive finance business. It's a great business model. It's been proven through several ups and downs. Key metrics are in line with long-term averages despite weakness in a few very critical markets, and it's healthy, well-managed and risk is very much under control. 
Moving to page 14. We'll continue on this path of active actions given the industry weakness. We, in fact, have more capacity than we need today. But that said, the CapEx we've invested the last few years means our plants are modern. Our machines and tooling are up-to-date. Our Lean manufacturing is progressing very well inside our plants, and we're positioned to handle a lot more volume when recovery comes. CapEx of this year and next year will be less than half of what it was in 2012. We're kind of in a maintenance capital mode, and I would expect that to continue for a while as even when volumes pick up. We've implemented and announced substantial restructuring up until now. And I think we reported the last 2 [ph] quarters that we've reduced about 10% of our production square footage already through consolidations and closing. And as painful as it is, our workforce has declined more than 35,000 in the last 3 years. These have generated substantial cost reduction for us. 
Moving on to page 15. We talked -- I just mentioned the September 24 announcement, very painful to our people across the world, but necessary. We anticipate between now and '18 about $1.5 billion of annual cost reduction. We will commit to you and I commit to you today as we did on September 24 that in 2016, we will see $750 million of cost reduction, and we will report on that specifically every quarter against that goal. We plan on reducing about 4,000 to 5,000 of our nonproduction workforce before the end of '16. A piece of that this year. Our team moved quickly. Once we decided to -- we decided '15 was not shaping up for recovery and '16 would be down. We've never done it this way before. Our idea was to come out with a voluntary early retirement program, which was very successful, follow with reduction in workforce, and everybody ready to go with full year cost reductions general in 2016, and we're right on plan to make that happen. All in all, we should be about another 10,000 reduction by the end of '18 with about another 20 facilities identified. And we've already announced a few of those. We'll have likely a few more by the end of the year. And as soon as we have a final determination on those, we'll be announcing them and you can expect to see them as we get to them. 
Now Page 16 is an important one, and this is really a summary of our Lean manufacturing and what I'm calling leaning of everything journey. And I'd like to start in the lower right-hand corner with Built in Quality defect per machine. And this goes back to 2010. We've introduced during this period, particularly in '13 and '14 and now '15, we'll have introduced 300 new models with Tier 4 interim and Tier 4 final product improvements. And you will notice that our quality in terms of defects per machine has improved significantly. Now you can also see on there that's kind of plateaued the last year. Well that a's plateau that far exceeds the targets we put in place back in 2010, and I would submit these are some of the best of industry quality numbers we've seen. This is evidence, in my opinion and all of us, around the benefits of implementing Lean manufacturing in our plant. This is one of them. The quality is right of the front, and you can see we've had good luck with that. I'd like to move up to cost. And in terms of gross margin as a percent of sales, these are right off the P&L and you'll see it. And while you might think that a $0.06 improvement in gross margin isn't all that great, I'd like to point out couple of things. This is a period of time when mix has shift significantly away from mining to smaller products. It's also a period where we had quite a bit of higher depreciation expense built in. So I'm quite happy that we are seeing the cost of goods sold as a result of Lean making its way through here in terms of progress, and we see our mix return to some mining equipment later on. We have some very good opportunities for continued improvement. I'd like to move over to safety, lower left. And this is one that for lots of reasons, we're very happy with but indicative again of the Lean manufacturing process and including people on the floor that do the work in the process of continuous improvement. We started this way back, way back in the early 2000s. We were one of the industrial companies with the highest recordable injury frequency. We're now, at this level, we think one of the best. Why is this important? You may not as investors appreciate this in terms of dollars and cents, but a safe, efficient, high-quality factory means a profitable place and we see that in cost reduction and then, of course, our incremental and decremental pull-throughs. Lastly, one area that continuing to frustrate and frustrate us greatly is inventory. And I'll be just a bit defensive here but not too much. We've seen our top line decrease since 2012 by $20 billion, as Mike mentioned. Our inventory is also down about $4.5 billion, but our turns are flat. It's very difficult to improve efficiencies in plants when so many plants run on interim schedules. But we managed to maintain our inventory turnover in that period of time. I have high expectations that we'll move from what today is about a 2.5 inventory turnover rate, up smartly, and our goal is 3.5 by '18, and I think we've talked most of you in the past about that, where we can get some consistent schedules. And I don't want -- again, I don't want to sound overly defensive on that because I think we've done pretty well kind of catching the knife on the way down to reduce our inventory by $4.5 billion, but we've got a lot of opportunity still to come here that's upside in terms of inventory conversion and cash and efficiency of asset turnover. So this to me is a pretty good status of our Lean journey. We'll continue to talk to you about this in more detail as we go forward. 
Finally, Page 17, and then I'll get the Q&A, but 2 big initiatives we're working on besides Lean. Our dealer initiative that we call Across the Table to drive better market performance across our businesses that where we distribute product through dealers. I can tell you, we have about 11 or 12 different initiatives, everything from eBusiness to parts warehouse efficiency to all kinds of things that we're very much on plan. '16 will be our third year, really our third year of implementation, and we sure like what we see. The dealers are pretty enthusiastic about it as well. And I think to end on this, the most exciting piece is really around technology and data analytics. The Caterpillar of the next few years will be quite different than the Caterpillar of the last few years. We have a vision here that every one of our 3 million machines and engines and many of our competitors machines and engines owned by our customers are connected, have sensors leading to us, their owners, our dealer, all kinds of data that then we can predict failures, we can predict hours of use. We can predict maintenance levels, all kinds of things that will really improve our aftermarket and our customer satisfaction. We've invested in a joint venture called Uptake with a partner that we really like. That business started around our locomotive business. That's been taken to market, beginning to be taken to market right now. I would expect to see the same around our construction equipment in the next year or 2. We also have a very important supplier with Tremble, who supplies the hardware on our machines that connects us to them. So this is a very exciting area. I won't dwell on it too much although I could. It's one of the most exciting things I've seen in many years around here to change our work going forward and really use technology of the 21st century for our customers for them to make more money and, obviously, us as well. 
So with that, I'm going to conclude, Michael, and you can conduct Q&A."

Nothing that would be significant enough to really drive enough an upturn. So I wou",507,"Yes, I'll do as much of that as I can. First off, when we say about 5%, I mean that's kind of our base case. It presumes a very modest improvement in kind of level growth. Nothing that would be significant enough to really drive enough an upturn. So I would say our view is that's pretty balanced. I think if we got some recovery in China or better U.S. growth or maybe more energy demand, that could be -- those could be positive. Some kind of a recession or a mistake by the Fed or the ECB that will help drive down the economy, I guess, can be on the downside. We're also not expecting much in the way of commodity prices, kind of, by and large -- I'm not saying exactly where we are today, but, by and large, around the levels that we're at today on commodities is pretty much what we're thinking around next year. And that's the same for currencies. I mean, we're not expecting the dollar to get materially stronger or weaker. So I think our view right now is it's pretty balanced. I think in construction, we have it, what's to say, probably reasonably flat to slightly down in most places in the world. I mean, Brazil is very weak. China is very weak, but they were in '15 as well. In fact, the business is down so far in those 2 countries, in particular, that just the size and scope were to have much significance in terms of the dollar decline next year is a bit diminished. And I think -- so I think construction, not a lot of change from kind of where we've been this year. I think in terms of Mining, it's just a really tough environment out there, and I think our forecast is reflective of what mining companies are saying about cutting CapEx a bit further. That said, the new equipment sales are so low right now. If they decline another -- if new equipment sales declined another 5% or 10%, the dollar amount of that is, I probably wouldn't use the word de minimis, but it's not very much because it's down so far. And I think that's an industry that doesn't tend to move in small increments. So the upside to that is if it turned around and we started to see some of the things that Doug talked about, maybe more rebuilds or some uplift in commodity prices, that could be helped. But for now, we're certainly not forecasting any of that. For Energy & Transportation, really, the big down next year is, in a lot of ways, absence of a good first half of '15 in really the refit side of oil and gas through well-servicing and drilling. We have a pretty low year this year already for rail after the '14 peak and not having a Tier 4 locomotive for this year. We'll have 1 next year. So I would see massive deterioration in other areas outside of that."

As we said, Energy & Transportation is expected to be down between 5% and 10% in 2016, and we said that the primary driver of that decline is oil and gas. Again, as we've said, the primary driver there is reduced sales into drilling and well-servicing. Our Solar business is made up of 3 major categories: oil and gas, power generation and customer services. And that oil and gas business can really be separated between oil production, which is primarily generator set that we sell offshore, and that business is certainly down. Projects have been delayed, and we've seen that trend into lower sales. On the other hand, our gas compression business at Solar is going quite well. A lot of that is driven by the very robust activity in large interstate pipelines being built primarily North America, and that's really being fed by a combination of fuel switching to natural gas and also the fact that the new LNG export facilities have to be fed. So again, that business is quite strong. The customer services part of the business, as you all know, I think an important part of Solar's business, while oil companies are starting to squeeze their maintenance budgets, turbines are not being taken out of operation. They're still operating. That still requires parts and overhaul and field service, so that business is expected to hold up fairly well as is our power generation business."

I mean, we're looking at another $750 million of cost reduction next year, and that will be spread across all of our segments and I think should be certainly help for margins that's reasonably significant. I think Energy & Transportation is a pretty profitable business in most all of the underlying sectors, not just oil and gas. Oil and gas is definitely a good business. And you'll see in our third order of this year's results, you're already seeing the major drop now in the third quarter from the refit, well-servicing and drilling reductions. Those are in the third quarter numbers already. There's nothing really weird or unusual that's kind of propping up the third quarter that I know of."

So we're going to do today's conference call a little bit differently than we have in the past. We're going to be going through a slide deck. And if you don't have that in front of you right now, it's available on our website, caterpillar.com, and it's where the conference call link is for the webcast. And it's under Events & Presentations, and it's also in the Quarterly Results section. So I'll go through the forward-looking statements. And if you need to get that, please do.

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and that will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, also in the forward-looking statement language in today's release. It's also on Page 2 of this morning's slide deck.
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release as well and at the end of our presentation material. And again, all that's been posted at the caterpillar.com website.
Okay. With that, let's get started with the slide deck. And if I could ask you to flip to Page 3. The page numbers are at the bottom of each page. So the first page is the agenda that's says discussion. I'll be going over third quarter results, the '15 outlook and the preliminary view of 2016. That will go fairly quickly. Then I'll turn it over to Doug Oberhelman, and he'll walk through kind of business conditions in our segments and key industries, actions we've taken, progress we've made and the things we're doing to protect the future of the company.
So with that, let's turn to Page 4. And I'm going to start off with something again a little different. If you look to the bottom right-hand corner of the slide -- well, first, at the top of the slide, we have sales and revenues, profit per share, profit per share without restructuring cost. So $13.5 billion in the third quarter a year ago, $11 billion in sales and revenues this third quarter. That's a decline of about 19% or $2.5 billion. About 14% of that is volume. About 3.5% of that was currency.
Our profit per share all-in dropped $1.01 from $1.63 to $0.62. And excluding restructuring costs, a similar amount, down $0.97 from $1.72 to $0.75. Now down the bottom right-hand corner, I have a comment and it's not year-over-year. The comment is kind of relative to probably the expectations that we had going into the quarter and probably the expectations that you had going into the quarter. We had 2 items that we didn't really expect that are of some significance here. One is lower incentive compensation, and that's because we lowered the outlook. Our previous outlook, excluding restructuring costs, was $5. The current forecast, excluding restructuring, is $4.60. And that means that incentive comp is going to be lower, and we made a year-to-date adjustment to that expense in the third quarter. That was actually favorable for profit about $0.09 a share.
The flip side of that is we had currency translation heavy losses on our non-U.S. assets and liabilities, and that was about $135 million negative in the quarter. Now this is not what runs through our operating profit. It's not the translation impact on sales and cost. This is sort of your net monetary position, you have an asset or liability position in foreign currencies or operations outside the U.S. We had the losses in this quarter of about $135 million, and a lot of that was from Brazil and China where currencies weakened during the quarter. We don't forecast that. We tend not to forecast short-term currency movements. And so versus where we were at the end of July when we talked about our full year forecast, that was new news.
So now let's step back a little bit and talk about the change quarter-over-quarter. Again, sales down 19% that was mostly lower volume; the negative currency, about 3.5%; and we also had a small change in price realization, negative about 0.5%. And it's certainly a tough environment for pricing out there. Volume down. It's very competitive. And the strong dollar is not helping that situation.
Now third quarter of last year, sales were still pretty strong in our businesses that support loyal customers, and it was also a good quarter a year ago for locomotive sales in our Energy & Transportation segment. And both of those businesses are down this year. Energy & Transportation was the biggest contributor to that $2.5 billion decline in sales. They account for about $1.4 billion of it. Construction was also down, and that was really led by Latin America and Asia. In Latin America, Brazil, generally in recession, difficult economic environment there, and sales for us certainly reflect that difficulty. And in Asia, the same can be said for China, slowing growth, a quite depressed construction equipment market in China.
Resource Industries, which is again principally mining, also down a bit. But as the number there -- numbers there decline, percentage changes have less and less impact on the dollars. So that's a quick review of sales.
Again, profit in the quarter, excluding restructuring, was $0.97. And with, it was down $1.01. And essentially, the profit decline was a result of the lower sales volume.
Currency, again, was a little negative overall. I talked about the impact below operating profit, the negative $0.17 in this quarter. It was actually a positive next year. So the year-over-year impact of that below operating profit currency was even more. That was offset a little bit by currency benefits up in operating profit. Sales translated lower, but it was pretty positive for costs.
Manufacturing costs and SG&A were both lower, and that was a partial offset to the lower volume.
So again, that's a quick run-through of the third quarter. If I could get you to move on to the next slide, Slide 5. At the top, it's titled 2015 outlook. So let's orient the slide. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have the outlook that we had in July with our second quarter financial release. And at that point in time, we were thinking this year was going to be about $49 billion in sales and revenues, profit of about $4.70 a share, $5 without the restructuring cost.
Now you can see on the box below that a month ago, we did update that sales outlook to about $48 billion. We've kept that today. Sales and revenues at the top end are about $48 billion. Now it says on the slide here, top end of about $48 billion. So the situation is we have a tendency to round our full year sales forecast to the nearest billion. And most of the time, that's okay when you have quite a bit of runway for the rest of the year. At this point in the year, we only have one quarter to go. So I think it was good to remind everyone that we do tend to round it to the nearest billion. And in this particular case, we round it up to $48 billion from our internal forecast, and that's by and large about the same as it was when we updated the outlook a month ago.
So if we look at the profit outlook. Today, it's $4.60 excluding restructuring and $4.60 [ph] including some fairly substantial restructuring. The restructuring costs for the year are about -- expected to be about $800 million now.
In July, with our profit outlook for the second quarter release, we were thinking about $250 million. That big increase is a result of all the actions that we announced on September 24, and I think Doug will talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes.
And so if you look at the change from -- excluding restructuring from $5 down to $4.60, really more than all of that was due to -- or about all of that was due to the decline in the sales and revenues forecast. We also had the $0.17 negative that was in the quarter for currency translation. But partly offsetting that, we have lower cost for the rest of the year. Some because we're, I think, doing a pretty good job of managing cost out and some of it because incentive compensation for the year is going to be a bit lower. So that's a quick recap of the 2015 outlook.
If I could get you to go to Page 6, and that's the outlook -- preliminary outlook for sales and revenues for next year. And this is essentially unchanged from what we said a month ago in our restructuring announcement. We think 2016 is going to be about 5% below 2015. Now this would be our fourth consecutive down year. That's never happened to Caterpillar in the history of the company.
Resource Industries, again, which is primarily mining, we're expecting to be down around 10%, but again from a very low base. I can tell you 10% means a lot less today than 10% meant in 2012.
Construction Industries, down -- flat to down 5% from 2015.
Energy & Transportation, down 5% to 10%. And that's mostly -- not entirely, but mostly oil and gas. I think it's worth mentioning around oil and gas, the biggest impact that we've seen has been for reciprocating engines and related to drilling and well servicing. We had a pretty good, healthy, large backlog of those kind of products when we came into 2015. The result of that is our sales in the first half of the year, and we've talked about this before, were higher than what order rates were at the time because we were working off that backlog. That's largely behind us now. We're going to have a very challenged second half of 2015.
So in '15, we had a good first half for that kind of product, a much weaker second half. Essentially what we have for that kind of product in 2016 is 2 weak halves, first half and second half. And that's quite a bit of a change year-over-year in Energy & Transportation.
Okay. If I could get you to move on then to Page 7. This is a little bit of a setup. After this slide, I'm going to turn it over to Doug. And it's just a depiction of what's happened to our sales since peak, which was in 2012. It's been a pretty difficult 3 years. We think next year will kind of continue that. Overall, we were about $66 billion in sales and revenues in 2012. Next year, we're going to be down probably a little more than $20 billion from that level, and that ends up being over 30%.
Now what makes that decline tough and I think our performance more significant is that most of that decline, nearly 2/3 of it, has been in Resource Industries, which is primarily mining. And back in 2012, it was without question, our most profitable segment. Another 10% of that $20 billion or so decline is a result of currency impacts. Now I should also -- it's not noted on the chart. But in construction, we're also down. And fundamentally, one of the things that's changed is emerging -- or not emerging, developing countries' construction, Asia, Latin America has also declined over that period.
So that's a recap. And with that, I'd like to turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman."

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We're taking a little different approach this quarter with the way in which we go through our business. Mike summarized the quarter well, I think. And it's opera",3769,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We're taking a little different approach this quarter with the way in which we go through our business. Mike summarized the quarter well, I think. And it's operationally reasonably solid, particularly when you factor back in that translation loss, primarily in Brazil. There are not too many months. You have a 22% devaluation in the currency anywhere in the world, and that's certainly what happened in Brazil in the third quarter.
What I'd like to do is run down our key industries and kind of talk about where we see them today. And then a little bit of a reminder of while cyclical, why we like them so much over time. And I will just go through that. So I'm going to start on Page 8 and talk about mining a little bit. There's no question that the China-driven commodity super-cycle drove a lot of things up in the world the last decade or so, and now we're living off the backlash of that. It's kind of amazing to me that even with that, the amount of mining activity going on, that is ore and overburden being moved with the exception of coal, is still running at a pretty high level around the world. And that is one of the things that has kind of baffled us in terms of the replacement cycle as our trucks and fleet have continued to operate without replacement and, frankly, with a very extended aftermarket and product support levels as miners have -- are doing what they need to do to preserve cash, lower expenses. We haven't seen that dramatic of an extension in the life cycles ever.
There's also a big push for productivity, which we like an awful lot because it plays to our business model. And as a result of that, of course, all that's piled on to the peak of '12. And we're now at levels that go way back.
The other interesting thing in terms of mining trucks, at the peak in '11 and '12, we were producing 1,500-plus trucks a year on a run rate. Certainly, in '15, we'll be probably 90% -- 10% of that 90% -- 70% -- or 80% to 90% below that. And with no replace -- with the replacement cycle being extended, the parts demand being deferred a bit, we're seeing that really come through in 2015. I guess, if there's a silver lining in the cloud, as long as ore and overburden is removed, the trucks are running, the fleets moving, capacity -- the excess capacity of mining is being used up at some point, that replacement cycle will come back to us. We won't need a boom, and I don't expect a boom like we saw in the 2000s. But the replacement cycle would feel pretty good, and we'll be ready for that when it happens. Long term, I think all of you are aware the population growth in the planet, the demand for electricity, the demand for a lot of things, including coal and, in fact, even the U.S. government Commerce and Energy Departments forecast fairly healthy energy growth over the next 20 years, 30 years, including all aspects of energy supply. Coal; nuclear, not so much; but certainly gas will be a big player in that as well. So we expect over time this industry to come back. And of course, for surface mines, we provide -- can provide up to 70% of the rolling stock that goes into a surface mine, and we work a lot on our underground mining that we didn't have prior to a few years ago. So we're very bullish about this over the long term. And particularly, as our business model matures here, I think we'll be set up. The problem, of course, is this big whiplash we've seen from the bust of the super-cycle.
Moving on into oil and gas, and I would draw distinction here as we have been doing lately between oil and gas. Oil certainly has taken the brunt of the downturn. You know the oil price. Everybody does. We've seen CapEx dry up in that market. Our customers are adjusting, and we see idle rigs all over the place. Therein lies the turnaround at some point when supply drops and demand continues to grow. But in the case of oil, that's where we see -- and of course, we webbed off [ph] a big backlog, both in -- primarily in recip a year ago. We worked through that. And as we go into '16, that's what Mike talked about, feeling a full year impact of the oil drop and, to some degree, gas.
Gas has held up a little bit better. Gas pipelines have been good. The expansion of compression has been good. And of course, the conversion of a lot of coal plants to natural gas has helped that demand. And while gas prices have come down quite a bit, they haven't tanked as we've seen with the coal or oil for that matter. So this is another really super business for us long term with our solar turbine business, which is a key player and provider in compression and elsewhere, our recent business. And over time, as the world sorts out supply and demand, we'll enjoy that business. Again, it's a great aftermarket business as well, aftermarket opportunity. 
Moving in to construction, and we've got this kind of by region here as we go through. North America is okay. I'm on Page 11 -- I'm sorry, I'm on Page 10. I beg your pardon, I missed Energy & Transportation. I'll go back here. Thank you, Mike. Page 10 and specifically talking about rail here. I just went through oil and gas. Rail has -- rail, primarily through Progress Rail, our acquisition there in the late 2000s, and the acquisition of EMD, have really put us on the map internationally in the rail business. And it's a business we like an awful lot. It has a lot of characteristics in our larger horsepower, bigger iron products that we're used to dealing with. And it's turned out to be a -- one with a lot of growth and opportunity as well. We've done an awful lot of restructuring, primarily in EMD the last few years and are now quite competitive with the others in that business, particularly internationally.
Our 2015 locomotive sales are down. There's no question that we did not have a Tier 4-ready locomotive. At the beginning of 2015, I would tell you that we planned it that way based on some early discussions with our customers in the rail business. A year ago, it looked like demand was taking off. Our Tier 4 locomotive will be ready the middle of next year or so. We have orders today. The preliminary results are very positive. And in fact, as we've seen the rail business soften here lately, I'm kind of feeling better about our transition to Tier 4 and where we'll end up. So quite happy with that long term. It plays to all of our strengths here at Caterpillar with an awful lot of aftermarket opportunity that, frankly, the EMD predecessors really led that [ph]. So we're spending a lot of time on that in our Progress Rail. And EMD people are getting after lots of opportunity internationally. And certainly, with a very high-quality Tier 4 locomotive that shares a lot of the DNA from our recent business, our normal CAT brand business, we'll have a very competitive product there moving on into 2016.
Now I'll go to Page 11 and talk a little bit about construction regionally. North America, as we said, for next year, flat to down a little bit this year. We've kind of seen it slow down a bit as the year wears on. Certainly, residential is improving. There's statistics and news the last few days of it even better. And non-res is building.
What we need, frankly, is some heavy civil and highway. I am optimistic that we'll get some kind of a highway bill here between now and the end of the year. I'm optimistic that it'll be a multiyear, and we'll jump start this a little bit. Certainly, from a low base, anything will feel good. We've seen a number of states around the country enact initiatives, whether it's bonds or tax increases to pay for infrastructure. That will get going this winter. And I would think by spring, we can see a little uptick in that piece of it. But again, we're calling kind of flat to down a little in our construction business for 2016.
Latin America, led by Brazil, is weak. I was just in Brazil 2 weeks ago. It's a profound slowdown there. I wouldn't expect to see much of an upturn until '16. But what the Brazilians are talking about, what they typically have done in the past to stimulate their economy has been around infrastructure. So if they get that together, we could see that coming out sometime in the next year as well.
Europe/Africa/Middle East, really a split set of stories. Europe is actually kind of stable and positive. And you've seen that in some of our retail numbers. We've just had a big -- we had several of our officers in Europe with a big distributor meeting. And the news is not -- is no longer totally doom and gloom, but there are some stories. Our numbers don't reflect all of that yet. But I'd say, and some of you have heard me say this, I think that Western Europe, anyway, including Scandinavia and the Southern Europe, is probably where the United States was 2 to 3 years ago, particularly with the QE now, I think, finally starting to kick in there.
Middle East is all about the oil price and political unrest, and we've seen that.
Asia Pacific is backed up for China. And China has really -- is working to transform their economy long term. It's going to be great. It will be the largest construction equipment market in the world. I like our market position there. I like our business model there. It's coming our way. But they're planning out the impact of cycles, and we see that as well. So long term, again, population growth, lots of infrastructure needs, hindered to some degree by a lot of debt load. But over time, that infrastructure will be demanded and needed, and we'll be right in the middle of that as it goes.
Moving to number 12 -- Page 12, I'd like to talk now a little bit about operational progress. Even in this tough business climate, I'm very happy to report to you, and this is not news for most of you, but we've had a market position increase every year since 2010. And our market position is up significantly around the world in that period of time. It's due to several things. I think, one, the quality of our product has never been better by our metrics around defects per unit. Our dealers are performing well. We lost only 1 dealer in the Great Recession, and they're very strong today, as strong as they've ever been.
And the quality of our -- or the design of our product in the Tier 4 offerings we're putting out there are strong. So even with overcapacity in the industry and even with a very weak set of currencies for many of our competitors, even in the last year, our market share is up slightly around the world. And I think that says a lot about what we can do, should be doing in a downturn that we're in and then what we can do when things recover.
We're managing costs, I think, pretty well. We've talked to you all for years about increment and decrement profit margins. When we grow from $32 billion in '09 to $66 billion in '12. We were right in there with our incremental margins of 25%-plus. As we've seen the top line come down from $66 billion to the $48 billion now this year, we've been in that decremental margin area of 25% to 30%.
Now we announced a major restructuring obviously a month ago as we anticipated 2016 to get out in front of that. And I would say going into '16, we feel good about continuing on our decremental margin program if sales are down, which they appear to be and will be in 2016.
I talked about product quality. Our balance sheet, I can't say enough about. We entered the recession -- or rather we entered 2009 with a debt-to-cap ratio of almost 60% and kind of normal operating cash on the balance sheet. Today, even after a fairly significant stock buyback the last couple of years, a dividend increase of 83% during this period of time, our balance sheet is strong at 37.5% debt-to-cap with about double the amount of cash in our balance sheet of $6 billion, which sets us up for, I think, just about anything that come at us cycle-wise or opportunity-wise in the future.
Three of our 4 best years in history have been the last few years in cash flow. I mentioned the dividend, the stock buyback. And I want to emphasize that the dividend is a priority use of cash. It's particularly the maintenance thereof. We did not reduce the dividend in the '08, '09 financial crisis. We've paid a dividend every year for over 20 years, and maintaining that is a key use of our cash and a priority for our company.
Just to comment on Cat Financial and our captive finance business. It's a great business model. It's been proven through several ups and downs. Key metrics are in line with long-term averages despite weakness in a few very critical markets, and it's healthy, well managed and risk is very much under control.
Moving to Page 14. We'll continue on this path of action items given the industry weakness. We, in fact, have more capacity than we need today. But that said, the CapEx we've invested in the last few years means our plants are modern. Our machines and tooling are up-to-date. Our Lean manufacturing is progressing very well inside our plants, and we're positioned to handle a lot more volume when recovery comes.
CapEx this year and next year will be less than half of what it was in 2012. We're kind of in a maintenance capital mode, and I would expect that to continue for a while as -- even when volumes pick up. We've implemented and announced [ph] substantial restructuring up until now. And I think we've reported the last few quarters that we've reduced about 10% of our production square footage already through consolidations and closing. And as painful as it is, our workforce has declined more than 35,000 in the last 3 years. These have generated substantial cost reduction for us.
Moving on to page 15. We talked -- I just mentioned the September 24 announcement, very painful to our people across the world but necessary. We anticipate between now and '18 about $1.5 billion of annual cost reduction. We will commit to you and I commit to you today as we did on September 24 that in 2016 we will see $750 million of cost reduction, and we'll report on that specifically every quarter against that goal. We plan on reducing about 4,000 to 5,000 of our non-production workforce before the end of '16. A piece of that this year. Our team moved quickly once we decided to -- we decided '15 was not shaping up for recovery and '16 would be down. We've never done it this way before. Our idea was to come out with a voluntary early retirement program, which was very successful, followed with a reduction in workforce. And everybody ready to go with full year cost reduction in January 1, 2016, and we're right on plan to make that happen.
All in all, we should be about another 10,000 reduction by the end of '18 with about another 20 facilities identified. And we've already announced a few of those. We'll have likely a few more by the end of the year. And as soon as we have a final determination on those, we'll be announcing them, and you can expect to see them as we get to them.
Now Page 16 is an important one, and this is really a summary of our Lean manufacturing and what I'm calling leaning of everything journey. And I'd like to start in the lower right-hand corner with Built in Quality defects per machine. And this goes back to 2010. We've introduced during this period, particularly in '13 and '14 and now '15, we'll have introduced 300 new models with Tier 4 interim and Tier 4 final product improvements. And you will notice that our quality in terms of defects per machine has improved significantly. Now you can also see on there that's kind of plateaued the last year. Well that's a plateau that far exceeds the targets we put in place back in 2010. And I would submit, these are some of the best-in-the-industry quality numbers we've seen. This is evidence, in my opinion and all of us, around the benefits of implementing Lean manufacturing in our plant. This is one of them. And quality is right up at the front. And you can see we've had good luck with that.
I'd like to move up to cost. And in terms of gross margin as a percent of sales, these are right off the P&L, and you'll see it. And while you might think that a 0.6% improvement in gross margin isn't all that great, I'd like to point out a couple of things. This is a period of time when the mix shifts significantly away from mining to smaller products. It's also a period where we had quite a bit of higher depreciation expense built in. So I'm quite happy that we are seeing the cost of goods sold as a result of Lean making its way through here in terms of progress. And we see our mix return to some mining equipment later on. We have some very good opportunities for continued improvement.
I'd like to move over to safety, lower left. And this is one that for lots of reasons, we're very happy with. But it's indicative again of the Lean manufacturing process and including people on the floor that do the work in the process of continuous improvement. We started this way back in the early 2000s. We were one of the industrial companies with the highest recordable injury frequency. We're now, at this level, we think one of the best. Why is this important? You may not as investor appreciate this in terms of dollars and cents. But a safe, efficient, high-quality factory means a profitable place, and we see that in the cost reduction and then, of course, our incremental and decremental pull-throughs.
Lastly, one area that's continuing to frustrate me and frustrate us greatly is inventory. And I'll be just a bit defensive here but not too much. We've seen our top line decrease since 2012 by $20 billion, as Mike mentioned. Our inventory is also down about $4.5 billion, but our turns are flat. It's very difficult to improve efficiencies in plants when so many plants run on interim schedules. But we've managed to maintain our inventory turnover in that period of time. I have high expectations that we'll move from what today is about a 2.5 inventory turnover rate, up smartly, and our goal is 3.5 by '18, and I think we've talked to most of you in the past about that, when we can get some consistent schedules. And I don't want -- again, I don't want to sound overly defensive on that because I think we've done pretty well kind of catching the knife on the way down to reduce our inventory by $4.5 billion, but we've got a lot of opportunity still to come here that's upside in terms of inventory conversion in cash and efficiency of asset turnover. So this to me is a pretty good status of our Lean journey. We'll continue to talk to you about this in more detail as we go forward.
Finally, Page 17, and then I'll get to Q&A. But 2 big initiatives we're working on besides Lean: Our dealer initiative that we call Across the Table to drive better market performance across our businesses that -- where we distribute product through dealers. I can tell you, we have about 11 or 12 different initiatives, everything from eBusiness to parts warehouse efficiencies to all kinds of things that we're very much on plan. '16 will be our third year -- really our third year of implementation. And we sure like what we see. The dealers are pretty enthusiastic about it as well.
And I think to end on this, the most exciting piece is really around technology and data analytics. The Caterpillar of the next few years will be quite different than the Caterpillar of the last few years. We have a vision here that every one of our 3 million machines and engines and many of our competitive machines and engines owned by our customers are connected, have sensors, leading to us their owners, our dealer, all kinds of data. Then we can predict failures. We can predict hours of use. We can predict maintenance levels, all kinds of things that will really improve our aftermarket and our customer satisfaction. We've invested in a joint venture called Uptake with a partner that we really like. That business started around our locomotive business. That's been taken to market -- beginning to be taken to market right now. I will expect to see the same around our construction equipment in the next year or 2.
We also have a very important supplier with Trimble, who supplies the hardware on our machines that connects us to them. So this is a very exciting area. I won't dwell on it too much, although I could. It's one of the most exciting things I've seen in many years around here to change our world going forward and really use technology of the 21st century for our customers, for them to make more money and, obviously, us as well. 
So with that, I'm going to conclude, Michael, and you can conduct the Q&A."

First off, I would say when we say about 5%, I mean, that's kind of our base case. It presumes a very modest improvement in kind of global growth. Nothing that would be significant enough to really drive an upturn. S",518,"Yes. I'll do as much of that as I can. First off, I would say when we say about 5%, I mean, that's kind of our base case. It presumes a very modest improvement in kind of global growth. Nothing that would be significant enough to really drive an upturn. So I would say our view is that's pretty balanced. I think if we got some recovery in China or better U.S. growth or maybe more energy demand, that could be -- those could be positive. Some kind of a recession or a mistake by the Fed or the ECB that kind of drove down the economy, I guess, could be on the downside. We're also not expecting much in the way of commodity prices. I kind of -- by and large -- I'm not saying exactly where we are today. But by and large, around the levels that we're at today on commodities is pretty much what we're thinking around next year. And that's the same for currencies. I mean, we're not expecting the dollar to get materially stronger or weaker. So I think our view right now is it's pretty balanced. I think in construction, we have it, let's just say, probably reasonably flat to slightly down in most places in the world. I mean, Brazil is very weak. China is very weak, but they were in '15 as well. In fact, the business is down so far in those 2 countries in particular. Just the size and scope for it to have much significance in terms of a dollar decline next year is a bit diminished. And I think -- so I think construction, not a lot of change from kind of where we've been this year. I think in terms of mining, it's just a really tough environment out there. And I think our forecast is reflective of what mining companies are saying about cutting CapEx a bit further. That said, the new equipment sales are so low right now. If it decline another -- if new equipment sales declined another 5% or 10%, the dollar amount of that is -- I probably wouldn't use the word de minimis, but it's not very much because it's down so far. And I think that's an industry that -- it doesn't tend to move in small increments. So the upside to that is if it turned around and we started to see some of the things that Doug talked about, maybe more rebuilds or some uplift in commodity prices, that could be a help. But for now, we're certainly not forecasting any of that. For Energy & Transportation, really, the big down next year is, in a lot of ways, absence of a good first half of '15 in really the recip side of oil and gas for well servicing and drilling. We have a pretty low year this year already for rail after the '14 peak and the -- not having a Tier 4 locomotive for this year. We'll have 1 next year. So I wouldn't see massive deterioration in other areas outside of that."

As we said, Energy & Transportation is expected to be down between 5% and 10% in 2016, and we said that the primary driver of that decline is oil and gas. Again, as we've said, the primary driver there is reduced sales into drilling and well servicing. Our Solar business is made up of 3 major categories: oil and gas, power generation and customer services. And that oil and gas business can really be separated between oil production, which is primarily generator sets that we sell offshore, and that business is certainly down. Projects have been delayed and we've seen that translate into lower sales. On the other hand, our gas compression business at Solar is doing quite well. A lot of that is driven by the very -- the robust activity in large interstate pipelines being built primarily in North America, and that's really being fed by a combination of fuel switching to natural gas and also the fact that the new LNG export facilities have to be fed. So again, that business is quite strong. The customer services part of the business, as you all know, I think an important part of Solar's business. While oil companies are starting to squeeze their maintenance budgets, turbines are not being taken out of operation. They're still operating. That still requires parts and overhaul and field service. So that business is expected to hold up fairly well, as is our power generation business."

I mean, we're looking at another $750 million of cost reduction next year. That will be spread across all of our segments and I think should be certainly help for margins that's reasonably significant. I think Energy & Transportation is a pretty profitable business in most all of the underlying sectors, not just oil and gas. Oil and gas is definitely a good business.

But you got to remember that most all of our construction equipment business is -- the higher-value machines are made in region. So we try to run the currency zones of yen, currency zone of the dollar, the currency zone of the euros. And we've had that philosophy for quite some time. So we offset costs with sales. To the extent that, that will aid inventory turnover maybe a bit, but the target that I will put out there that we've had is that 3.5 inventory turnover around there in '17 or '18. And we have -- if anything, want to expedite that. We look forward and I have teams in place to move that on.

She, effective November 1, becomes our Director of Investor Relations.
So we're going to do today's conference call a little bit differently than we have in the past. We're going to be going through a slide deck. And if you don't have that in front of you right now, it's available on our website, caterpillar.com, and it's where the conference call link is for the webcast. And it's under Events & Presentations, and it's also in the Quarterly Results section. So I'll go through the forward-looking statements. And if you need to get that, please do. 
So this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. Any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the express written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and that will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, also in the forward-looking statement language in today's release. It's also on Page 2 of this morning's slide deck.
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release as well and at the end of our presentation material. And again, all that's been posted at the caterpillar.com website.
Okay. With that, let's get started with the slide deck. And if I could ask you to flip to Page 3. The page numbers are at the bottom of each page. So the first page is the agenda that's says discussion. I'll be going over third quarter results, the '15 outlook and the preliminary view of 2016. That will go fairly quickly. Then I'll turn it over to Doug Oberhelman, and he'll walk through kind of business conditions in our segments and key industries, actions we've taken, progress we've made and the things we're doing to protect the future of the company.
So with that, let's turn to Page 4. And I'm going to start off with something again a little different. If you look to the bottom right-hand corner of the slide -- well, first, at the top of the slide, we have sales and revenues, profit per share, profit per share without restructuring cost. So $13.5 billion in the third quarter a year ago, $11 billion in sales and revenues this third quarter. That's a decline of about 19% or $2.5 billion. About 14% of that is volume. About 3.5% of that was currency.
Our profit per share all-in dropped $1.01 from $1.63 to $0.62. And excluding restructuring costs, a similar amount, down $0.97 from $1.72 to $0.75. Now down the bottom right-hand corner, I have a comment and it's not year-over-year. The comment is kind of relative to probably the expectations that we had going into the quarter and probably the expectations that you had going into the quarter. We had 2 items that we didn't really expect that are of some significance here. One is lower incentive compensation, and that's because we lowered the outlook. Our previous outlook, excluding restructuring costs, was $5. The current forecast, excluding restructuring, is $4.60. And that means that incentive comp is going to be lower, and we made a year-to-date adjustment to that expense in the third quarter. That was actually favorable for profit about $0.09 a share.
The flip side of that is we had currency translation hedging losses on our non-U.S. assets and liabilities, and that was about $135 million negative in the quarter. Now this is not what runs through our operating profit. It's not the translation impact on sales and costs. This is sort of your net monetary position, you have an asset or liability position in foreign currencies or operations outside the U.S. We had the losses in this quarter of about $135 million, and a lot of that was from Brazil and China where currencies weakened during the quarter. We don't forecast that. We tend not to forecast short-term currency movements. And so versus where we were at the end of July when we talked about our full year forecast, that was new news.
So now let's step back a little bit and talk about the change quarter-over-quarter. Again, sales down 19% that was mostly lower volume; the negative currency, about 3.5%; and we also had a small change in price realization, negative about 0.5%. And it's certainly a tough environment for pricing out there. Volume down. It's very competitive. And the strong dollar is not helping that situation.
Now third quarter of last year, sales were still pretty strong in our businesses that support loyal customers, and it was also a good quarter a year ago for locomotive sales in our Energy & Transportation segment. And both of those businesses are down this year. Energy & Transportation was the biggest contributor to that $2.5 billion decline in sales. They accounted for about $1.4 billion of it. Construction was also down, and that was really led by Latin America and Asia. In Latin America, Brazil, generally in recession, difficult economic environment there, and sales for us certainly reflect that difficulty. And in Asia, the same can be said for China, slowing growth, a quite depressed construction equipment market in China.
Resource Industries, which is again principally mining, also down a bit. But as the number there -- numbers there decline, percentage changes have less and less impact on the dollars. So that's a quick review of sales.
Again, profit in the quarter, excluding restructuring, was $0.97. And with, it was down $1.01. And essentially, the profit decline was a result of the lower sales volume.
Currency, again, was a little negative overall. I talked about the impact below operating profit, the negative $0.17 in this quarter. It was actually a positive next year. So the year-over-year impact of that below operating profit currency was even more. That was offset a little bit by currency benefits up in operating profit. Sales translated lower, but it was pretty positive for costs.
Manufacturing costs and SG&A were both lower, and that was a partial offset to the lower volume.
So again, that's a quick run-through of the third quarter. If I could get you to move on to the next slide, Slide 5. At the top, it's titled 2015 outlook. So let's orient the slide. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have the outlook that we had in July with our second quarter financial release. And at that point in time, we were thinking this year was going to be about $49 billion in sales and revenues, profit of about $4.70 a share, $5 without the restructuring cost.
Now you can see on the box below that a month ago, we did update that sales outlook to about $48 billion. We've kept that today. Sales and revenues at the top end are about $48 billion. Now it says on the slide here, top end of about $48 billion. So the situation is we have a tendency to round our full year sales forecast to the nearest billion. And most of the time, that's okay when you have quite a bit of runway for the rest of the year. At this point in the year, we only have one quarter to go. So I think it was good to remind everyone that we do tend to round it to the nearest billion. And in this particular case, we round it up to $48 billion from our internal forecast, and that's by and large about the same as it was when we updated the outlook a month ago.
So if we look at the profit outlook. Today, it's $4.60 excluding restructuring and $4.60 [ph] including some fairly substantial restructuring. The restructuring costs for the year are about -- expected to be about $800 million now.
In July, with our profit outlook for the second quarter release, we were thinking about $250 million. That big increase is a result of all the actions that we announced on September 24, and I think Doug will talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes.
And so if you look at the change from -- excluding restructuring from $5 down to $4.60, really more than all of that was due to -- or about all of that was due to the decline in the sales and revenues forecast. We also had the $0.17 negative that was in the quarter for currency translation. But partly offsetting that, we have lower costs for the rest of the year. Some because we're, I think, doing a pretty good job of managing cost out and some of it because incentive compensation for the year is going to be a bit lower. So that's a quick recap of the 2015 outlook.
If I could get you to go to Page 6, and that's the outlook -- preliminary outlook for sales and revenues for next year. And this is essentially unchanged from what we said a month ago in our restructuring announcement. We think 2016 is going to be about 5% below 2015. Now this would be our fourth consecutive down year. That's never happened to Caterpillar in the history of the company.
Resource Industries, again, which is primarily mining, we're expecting to be down around 10%, but again from a very low base. I can tell you 10% means a lot less today than 10% meant in 2012.
Construction Industries, down -- flat to down 5% from 2015.
Energy & Transportation, down 5% to 10%. And that's mostly -- not entirely, but mostly oil and gas. I think it's worth mentioning around oil and gas, the biggest impact that we've seen has been for reciprocating engines and related to drilling and well servicing. We had a pretty good, healthy, large backlog of those kind of products when we came into 2015. The result of that is our sales in the first half of the year, and we've talked about this before, were higher than what order rates were at the time because we were working off that backlog. That's largely behind us now. We're going to have a very challenged second half of 2015.
So in '15, we had a good first half for that kind of product, a much weaker second half. Essentially what we have for that kind of product in 2016 is 2 weak halves, first half and second half. And that's quite a bit of the change year-over-year in Energy & Transportation.
Okay. If I could get you to move on then to Page 7. This is a little bit of a setup. After this slide, I'm going to turn it over to Doug. And it's just a depiction of what's happened to our sales since peak, which was in 2012. It's been a pretty difficult 3 years. We think next year will kind of continue that. Overall, we were about $66 billion in sales and revenues in 2012. Next year, we're going to be down probably a little more than $20 billion from that level, and that ends up being over 30%.
Now what makes that decline tough and I think our performance more significant is that most of that decline, nearly 2/3 of it, has been in Resource Industries, which is primarily mining. And back in 2012, it was without question, our most profitable segment. Another 10% of that $20 billion or so decline is a result of currency impacts. Now I should also -- it's not noted on the chart. But in construction, we're also down. And fundamentally, one of the things that's changed is emerging -- or not emerging, developing countries' construction, Asia, Latin America has also declined over that period.
So that's a recap. And with that, I'd like to turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman."

We're taking a little different approach this quarter with the way in which we go through our business. Mike summarized the quarter well, I think. And it's operationally reasonably solid, particularly when you factor back in that translation loss, primarily in Brazil. There are not too many months you have a 22% devaluation in the currency anywhere in the world, and that's certainly what happened in Brazil in the third quarter.
What I'd like to do is run down our key industries and kind of talk about where we see them today. And then a little bit of a reminder of while cyclical, why we like them so much over time. And I will just go through that. So I'm going to start on Page 8 and talk about mining a little bit. There's no question that the China-driven commodity super-cycle drove a lot of things up in the world the last decade or so, and now we're living off the backlash of that. It's kind of amazing to me that even with that, the amount of mining activity going on, that is ore and overburden being moved with the exception of coal, is still running at a pretty high level around the world. And that is one of the things that has kind of baffled us in terms of the replacement cycle as our trucks and fleet have continued to operate without replacement and, frankly, with a very extended aftermarket and product support levels as miners have -- are doing what they need to do to preserve cash, lower expenses. We haven't seen that dramatic of an extension in the life cycles ever.
There's also a big push for productivity, which we like an awful lot because it plays to our business model. And as a result of that, of course, all that's piled on to the peak of '12. And we're now at levels that go way back.
The other interesting thing in terms of mining trucks, at the peak in '11 and '12, we were producing 1,500-plus trucks a year on a run rate. Certainly, in '15, we'll be probably 90% -- 10% of that 90% -- 70% -- or 80% to 90% below that. And with no replace -- with the replacement cycle being extended, the parts demand being deferred a bit, we're seeing that really come through in 2015. I guess, if there's a silver lining in the cloud, as long as ore and overburden is removed, the trucks are running, the fleets moving, capacity -- the excess capacity of mining is being used up at some point, that replacement cycle will come back to us. We won't need a boom, and I don't expect a boom like we saw in the 2000s. But a replacement cycle would feel pretty good, and we'll be ready for that when it happens. Long term, I think all of you are aware the population growth in the planet, the demand for electricity, the demand for a lot of things, including coal and, in fact, even the U.S. government Commerce and Energy Departments forecast fairly healthy energy growth over the next 20 years, 30 years, including all aspects of energy supply. Coal; nuclear, not so much; but certainly gas will be a big player in that as well. So we expect over time this industry to come back. And of course, for surface mines, we provide -- can provide up to 70% of the rolling stock that goes into a surface mine, and we work a lot on our underground mining that we didn't have prior to a few years ago. So we're very bullish about this over the long term. And particularly, as our business model matures here, I think we'll be set up. The problem, of course, is this big whiplash we've seen from the bust of the super-cycle.
Moving on into oil and gas, and I would draw distinction here as we have been doing lately between oil and gas. Oil certainly has taken the brunt of the downturn. You know the oil price. Everybody does. We've seen CapEx dry up in that market. Our customers are adjusting, and we see idle rigs all over the place. Therein lies the turnaround at some point when supply drops and demand continues to grow. But in the case of oil, that's where we see -- and of course, we whipped [ph] off a big backlog, both in -- primarily in recip a year ago. We worked through that. And as we go into '16, that's what Mike talked about, feeling a full year impact of the oil drop and, to some degree, gas.
Gas has held up a little bit better. Gas pipelines have been good. The expansion of compression has been good. And of course, the conversion of a lot of coal plants to natural gas has helped that demand. And while gas prices have come down quite a bit, they haven't tanked as we've seen with the coal or oil for that matter. So this is another really super business for us long term with our solar turbine business, which is a key player and provider in compression and elsewhere, our recip business. And over time, as the world sorts out supply and demand, we'll enjoy that business. Again, it's a great aftermarket business as well, aftermarket opportunity. 
Moving in to construction, and we've got this kind of by region here as we go through. North America is okay. I'm on Page 11 -- I'm sorry, I'm on Page 10. I beg your pardon, I missed Energy & Transportation. I'll go back here. Thank you, Mike. Page 10 and specifically talking about rail here. I just went through oil and gas. Rail has -- rail, primarily through Progress Rail, our acquisition there in the late 2000s, and the acquisition of EMD, have really put us on the map internationally in the rail business. And it's a business we like an awful lot. It has a lot of characteristics in our larger horsepower, bigger iron products that we're used to dealing with. And it's turned out to be a -- one with a lot of growth and opportunity as well. We've done an awful lot of restructuring, primarily in EMD the last few years and are now quite competitive with the others in that business, particularly internationally.
Our 2015 locomotive sales are down. There's no question that we did not have a Tier 4-ready locomotive. At the beginning of 2015, I would tell you that we planned it that way based on some early discussions with our customers in the rail business. A year ago, it looked like demand was taking off. Our Tier 4 locomotive will be ready the middle of next year or so. We have orders today. The preliminary results are very positive. And in fact, as we've seen the rail business soften here lately, I'm kind of feeling better about our transition to Tier 4 and where we'll end up. So quite happy with that long term. It plays to all of our strengths here at Caterpillar with an awful lot of width and an awful lot of aftermarket opportunity that, frankly, the EMD predecessors really let atrophy. So we're spending a lot of time on that in our Progress Rail. And EMD people are getting after lots of opportunity internationally. And certainly, with a very high-quality Tier 4 locomotive that shares a lot of the DNA from our recent business, our normal CAT brand business, we'll have a very competitive product there moving on into 2016.
Now I'll go to Page 11 and talk a little bit about construction regionally. North America, as we said, for next year, flat to down a little bit this year. We've kind of seen it slow down a bit as the year wears on. Certainly, residential is improving. There's statistics and news the last few days have been even better. And non-res is building.
What we need, frankly, is some heavy civil and highway. I am optimistic that we'll get some kind of a highway bill here between now and the end of the year. I'm optimistic that it'll be a multiyear, and we'll jump start this a little bit. Certainly, from a low base, anything will feel good. We've seen a number of states around the country enact initiatives, whether it's bonds or tax increases to pay for infrastructure. That will get going this winter. And I would think by spring, we can see a little uptick in that piece of it. But again, we're calling kind of flat to down a little in our construction business for 2016.
Latin America, led by Brazil, is weak. I was just in Brazil 2 weeks ago. It's a profound slowdown there. I wouldn't expect to see much of an upturn until '16. But what the Brazilians are talking about, what they typically have done in the past to stimulate their economy has been around infrastructure. So if they get that together, we could see that coming out sometime in the next year as well.
Europe/Africa/Middle East, really a split set of stories. Europe is actually kind of stable and positive. And you've seen that in some of our retail numbers. We've just had a big -- we had several of our officers in Europe with a big distributor meeting. And the news is not -- is no longer totally doom and gloom, but there are some stories. Our numbers don't reflect all of that yet. But I'd say, and some of you have heard me say this, I think that Western Europe, anyway, including Scandinavia and the Southern Europe, is probably where the United States was 2 to 3 years ago, particularly with the QE now, I think, finally starting to kick in there.
Middle East is all about the oil price and political unrest, and we've seen that.
Asia Pacific is backed up for China. And China has really -- is working to transform their economy long term. It's going to be great. It will be the largest construction equipment market in the world. I like our market position there. I like our business model there. It's coming our way. But they're planning out the impact of cycles, and we see that as well. So long term, again, population growth, lots of infrastructure needs, hindered to some degree by a lot of debt load. But over time, that infrastructure will be demanded and needed, and we'll be right in the middle of that as it goes.
Moving to number 12 -- Page 12, I'd like to talk now a little bit about operational progress. Even in this tough business climate, I'm very happy to report to you, and this is not news for most of you, but we've had a market position increase every year since 2010. And our market position is up significantly around the world in that period of time. It's due to several things. I think, one, the quality of our product has never been better by our metrics around defects per unit. Our dealers are performing well. We lost only 1 dealer in the Great Recession, and they're very strong today, as strong as they've ever been.
And the quality of our -- or the design of our product in the Tier 4 offerings we're putting out there are strong. So even with overcapacity in the industry and even with a very weak set of currencies for many of our competitors, even in the last year, our market share is up slightly around the world. And I think that says a lot about what we can do, should be doing in a downturn that we're in and then what we can do when things recover.
We're managing costs, I think, pretty well. We've talked to you all for years about increment and decrement profit margins. When we grow from $32 billion in '09 to $66 billion in '12. We were right in there with our incremental margins of 25%-plus. As we've seen the top line come down from $66 billion to the $48 billion now this year, we've been in that decremental margin area of 25% to 30%.
Now we announced a major restructuring obviously a month ago as we anticipated 2016 to get out in front of that. And I would say going into '16, we feel good about continuing on our decremental margin program if sales are down, which they appear to be and will be in 2016.
I talked about product quality. Our balance sheet, I can't say enough about. We entered the recession -- or rather we entered 2009 with a debt-to-cap ratio of almost 60% and kind of normal operating cash on the balance sheet. Today, even after a fairly significant stock buyback the last couple of years, a dividend increase of 83% during this period of time, our balance sheet is strong at 37.5% debt-to-cap with about double the amount of cash on our balance sheet of $6 billion, which sets us up for, I think, just about anything that come at us cycle-wise or opportunity-wise in the future.
Three of our 4 best years in history have been the last few years in cash flow. I mentioned the dividend, the stock buyback. And I want to emphasize that the dividend is a priority use of cash. It's particularly the maintenance thereof. We did not reduce the dividend in the '08, '09 financial crisis. We've paid a dividend every year for over 20 years, and maintaining that is a key use of our cash and a priority for our company.
Just to comment on Cat Financial and our captive finance business. It's a great business model. It's been proven through several ups and downs. Key metrics are in line with long-term averages despite weakness in a few very critical markets, and it's healthy, well managed and risk is very much under control.
Moving to Page 14. We'll continue on this path of action items given the industry weakness. We, in fact, have more capacity than we need today. But that said, the CapEx we've invested in the last few years means our plants are modern. Our machines and tooling are up-to-date. Our Lean manufacturing is progressing very well inside our plants, and we're positioned to handle a lot more volume when recovery comes.
CapEx this year and next year will be less than half of what it was in 2012. We're kind of in a maintenance capital mode, and I would expect that to continue for a while as -- even when volumes pick up. We've implemented and announced substantial restructuring up until now. And I think we've reported the last few quarters that we've reduced about 10% of our production square footage already through consolidations and closings. And as painful as it is, our workforce has declined more than 35,000 in the last 3 years. These have generated substantial cost reduction for us.
Moving on to page 15. We talked -- I just mentioned the September 24 announcement, very painful to our people across the world but necessary. We anticipate between now and '18 about $1.5 billion of annual cost reduction. We will commit to you and I commit to you today as we did on September 24 that in 2016 we will see $750 million of cost reduction, and we'll report on that specifically every quarter against that goal. We plan on reducing about 4,000 to 5,000 of our non-production workforce before the end of '16. A piece of that this year. Our team moved quickly once we decided to -- we decided '15 was not shaping up for recovery and '16 would be down. We've never done it this way before. Our idea was to come out with a voluntary early retirement program, which was very successful, followed with a reduction in workforce. And everybody ready to go with full year cost reduction in January 1, 2016, and we're right on plan to make that happen.
All in all, we should be about another 10,000 reduction by the end of '18 with about another 20 facilities identified. And we've already announced a few of those. We'll have likely a few more by the end of the year. And as soon as we have a final determination on those, we'll be announcing them, and you can expect to see them as we get to them.
Now Page 16 is an important one, and this is really a summary of our Lean manufacturing and what I'm calling leaning of everything journey. And I'd like to start in the lower right-hand corner with Built in Quality defects per machine. And this goes back to 2010. We've introduced during this period, particularly in '13 and '14 and now '15, we'll have introduced 300 new models with Tier 4 interim and Tier 4 final product improvements. And you will notice that our quality in terms of defects per machine has improved significantly. Now you can also see on there that's kind of plateaued the last year. Well that's a plateau that far exceeds the targets we put in place back in 2010. And I would submit, these are some of the best-in-the-industry quality numbers we've seen. This is evidence, in my opinion and all of us, around the benefits of implementing Lean manufacturing in our plant. This is one of them. And quality is right up at the front. And you can see we've had good luck with that.
I'd like to move up to cost. And in terms of gross margin as a percent of sales, these are right off the P&L, and you'll see it. And while you might think that a 0.6% improvement in gross margin isn't all that great, I'd like to point out a couple of things. This is a period of time when the mix shifts significantly away from mining to smaller products. It's also a period where we had quite a bit of higher depreciation expense built in. So I'm quite happy that we are seeing the cost of goods sold as a result of Lean make its way through here in terms of progress. And we see our mix return to some mining equipment later on. We have some very good opportunities for continued improvement.
I'd like to move over to safety, lower left. And this is one that for lots of reasons, we're very happy with. But it's indicative again of the Lean manufacturing process and including people on the floor that do the work in the process of continuous improvement. We started this way back in the early 2000s. We were one of the industrial companies with the highest recordable injury frequency. We're now, at this level, we think one of the best. Why is this important? You may not as investor appreciate this in terms of dollars and cents. But a safe, efficient, high-quality factory means a profitable place, and we see that in the cost reduction and then, of course, our incremental and decremental pull-throughs.
Lastly, one area that's continuing to frustrate me and frustrate us greatly is inventory. And I'll be just a bit defensive here but not too much. We've seen our top line decrease since 2012 by $20 billion, as Mike mentioned. Our inventory is also down about $4.5 billion, but our turns are flat. It's very difficult to improve efficiencies in plants when so many plants run on interim schedules. But we've managed to maintain our inventory turnover in that period of time. I have high expectations that we'll move from what today is about a 2.5 inventory turnover rate, up smartly, and our goal is 3.5 by '18, and I think we've talked to most of you in the past about that, when we can get some consistent schedules. And I don't want -- again, I don't want to sound overly defensive on that because I think we've done pretty well kind of catching the knife on the way down to reduce our inventory by $4.5 billion, but we've got a lot of opportunity still to come here that's upside in terms of inventory conversion in cash and efficiency of asset turnover. So this to me is a pretty good status of our Lean journey. We'll continue to talk to you about this in more detail as we go forward.
Finally, Page 17, and then I'll get to Q&A. But 2 big initiatives we're working on besides Lean: Our dealer initiative that we call Across the Table to drive better market performance across our businesses that -- where we distribute product through dealers. I can tell you, we have about 11 or 12 different initiatives, everything from eBusiness to parts warehouse efficiencies to all kinds of things that we're very much on plan. '16 will be our third year -- really our third year of implementation. And we sure like what we see. The dealers are pretty enthusiastic about it as well.
And I think to end on this, the most exciting piece is really around technology and data analytics. The Caterpillar of the next few years will be quite different than the Caterpillar of the last few years. We have a vision here that every one of our 3 million machines and engines and many of our competitive machines and engines owned by our customers are connected, have sensors, leading to us their owners, our dealer, all kinds of data. Then we can predict failures. We can predict hours of use. We can predict maintenance levels, all kinds of things that will really improve our aftermarket and our customer satisfaction. We've invested in a joint venture called Uptake with a partner that we really like. That business started around our locomotive business. That's been taken to market -- beginning to be taken to market right now. I would expect to see the same around our construction equipment in the next year or 2.
We also have a very important supplier with Trimble, who supplies the hardware on our machines that connects us to them. So this is a very exciting area. I won't dwell on it too much, although I could. It's one of the most exciting things I've seen in many years around here to change our world going forward and really use technology of the 21st century for our customers, for them to make more money and, obviously, us as well. 
So with that, I'm going to conclude, Michael, and you can conduct the Q&A."

First off, I would say when we say about 5%, I mean, that's kind of our base case. It presumes a very modest improvement in kind of global growth. Nothing that would be significant enough to really drive an upturn. S",518,"Yes. I'll do as much of that as I can. First off, I would say when we say about 5%, I mean, that's kind of our base case. It presumes a very modest improvement in kind of global growth. Nothing that would be significant enough to really drive an upturn. So I would say our view is that's pretty balanced. I think if we got some recovery in China or better U.S. growth or maybe more energy demand, that could be -- those could be positive. Some kind of a recession or a mistake by the Fed or the ECB that kind of drove down the economy, I guess, could be on the downside. We're also not expecting much in the way of commodity prices. I kind of -- by and large -- I'm not saying exactly where we are today. But by and large, around the levels that we're at today on commodities is pretty much what we're thinking around next year. And that's the same for currencies. I mean, we're not expecting the dollar to get materially stronger or weaker. So I think our view right now is it's pretty balanced. I think in construction, we have it, let's just say, probably reasonably flat to slightly down in most places in the world. I mean, Brazil is very weak. China is very weak, but they were in '15 as well. In fact, the business is down so far in those 2 countries in particular. Just the size and scope for it to have much significance in terms of a dollar decline next year is a bit diminished. And I think -- so I think construction, not a lot of change from kind of where we've been this year. I think in terms of mining, it's just a really tough environment out there. And I think our forecast is reflective of what mining companies are saying about cutting CapEx a bit further. That said, the new equipment sales are so low right now. If it declined another -- if new equipment sales declined another 5% or 10%, the dollar amount of that is -- I probably wouldn't use the word de minimis, but it's not very much because it's down so far. And I think that's an industry that -- it doesn't tend to move in small increments. So the upside to that is if it turned around and we started to see some of the things that Doug talked about, maybe more rebuilds or some uplift in commodity prices, that could be a help. But for now, we're certainly not forecasting any of that. For Energy & Transportation, really, the big down next year is, in a lot of ways, absence of a good first half of '15 in really the recip side of oil and gas for well servicing and drilling. We have a pretty low year this year already for rail after the '14 peak and the -- not having a Tier 4 locomotive for this year. We'll have one next year. So I wouldn't see massive deterioration in other areas outside of that."

Again, as we've said, the primary driver there is reduced sales into drilling and well servicing. Our Solar business is made up of 3 major categories: oil and gas, power generation and customer services. And that oil and gas business can really be separated between oil production, which is primarily generator sets that we sell offshore, and that business is certainly down. Projects have been delayed and we've seen that translate into lower sales. On the other hand, our gas compression business at Solar is doing quite well. A lot of that is driven by the very -- the robust activity in large interstate pipelines being built primarily in North America, and that's really being fed by a combination of fuel switching to natural gas and also the fact that the new LNG export facilities have to be fed. So again, that business is quite strong. The customer services part of the business, as you all know, I think an important part of Solar's business. While oil companies are starting to squeeze their maintenance budgets, turbines are not being taken out of operation. They're still operating. That still requires parts and overhaul and field service. So that business is expected to hold up fairly well, as is our power generation business."

That will be spread across all of our segments and I think should be certainly help for margins that's reasonably significant. I think Energy & Transportation is a pretty profitable business in most all of the underlying sectors, not just oil and gas. Oil and gas is definitely a good business.

So we try to run the currency zones of yen, currency zone of the dollar, the currency zone of the euros. And we've had that philosophy for quite some time. So we offset costs with sales. To the extent that, that will aid inventory turnover maybe a bit, but the target that I will put out there that we've had is that 3.5 inventory turnover around there in '17 or '18.

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors Section of our caterpillar.com website. It'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2015, and it's also in our forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.
In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release. And again, it's posted at caterpillar.com.
Okay. With that, let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing financial results for the first quarter and our revised outlook for 2015. And then there are about 3 points that I'd like to start with, actually, before we get into the details. And the first is that from a macro standpoint, in our view, not much has changed since our last earnings conference call in January. So we're staying pretty focused on the things that we do have some control of, and that's execution and operational improvement. Things like safety, quality, market share, efficiency, cost control, inventory turns and cash flow. And we continue to make progress.
And that brings me to my second point. Given the environment we're in, we were pleased with our first quarter results. Sales in the quarter were pretty close to what we expected, and we were pleased with the bottom line.
And that brings me to my third point. And that's a reminder of what we said in our year-end conference call back in January. We said that we expected the year to start out stronger than it would end, and that's still what we expect. And that's probably evident to you if you consider our first quarter actual results and what we're expecting for the first year.
Okay. With those 3 points, let's get into the quarter. Sales and revenues were $12.7 billion, and that was about 4% less than the $13.2 billion that we had in the first quarter last year. $342 million of that decline in sales was a result of the stronger dollar, and sales volume was unfavorable $295 million. Those 2 items were partially offset by a small improvement in price realization. That was $105 million, definitely in the right direction, but less than 1%.
Now the only region in the world that was up was North America, and that was up 9%. The North American improvement was pretty much across the board in each of our -- with each of our segments being in positive territory.
Outside of North America, that wasn't the case, and sales in each of our segments were down in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and in the Asia Pacific region. In total, sales and revenues were off 18% in Latin America, and sales of all of our equipment segments, that's Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation, were down double digits. Construction was off 23%, and a sizable portion of that was the absence of a large order from the Brazilian government that we had in the first quarter last year and weaker construction activity in general in the region, particularly Brazil. Resource Industries was also down 23% in Latin America, reflecting continuing weakness in mining. And that's pretty much the case in every region. And Energy & Transportation was down 11%.
Sales and revenues in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region were down 12%. Construction Industries was off 14%, and most of that was from less favorable dealer inventory changes and the impact of currency on our sales.
Resource Industries was also off 14%, again, weak mining. And Energy & Transportation was down 8%.
Sales and revenues in Asia Pacific were down 13%, with the most significant decline in Construction Industries at 21%. Construction Industries were down substantially in China and lower in Japan as a result of the stronger dollar versus the yen. Our sales in Japan, which are in yen, essentially translated into fewer dollars. 
Okay. That's a recap of sales. Profit per share, though, was higher in the first quarter than it was in the first quarter a year ago. This year, it was $1.81 per share. A year ago, in the first quarter, it was $1.44 a share.
Now we had restructuring costs in both quarters. In the first quarter of last year, we had $0.17 per share of restructuring costs, and that was mostly from the actions that we took in our European operations. This year, we had $0.05 per share of restructuring costs in the first quarter. So excluding restructuring, profit per share improved from $1.61 a year ago to $1.86 in the current quarter -- in the first quarter. Now the primary reasons profit per share was up, number one, was the $120 million gain that we had from the sale of our remaining ownership in what was our third-party logistics business. We also had, as I mentioned a minute ago, $105 million of positive price realization, and we had $77 million of favorable currency impact that helped operating profit. And I'm just going to stop here for a minute and chat about currency. It's a subject that, for us, seems to be frequently misunderstood. Now I'd just like to clarify things again. We do have substantial sales that are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And when the dollar strengthens, that causes those sales to translate into fewer dollars, and that's a negative for our top line. That said, we also have substantial manufacturing operations and we source substantial purchase material outside the U.S. So our factories outside the U.S. allow sourcing outside the U.S. And that results in lower cost when translated to U.S. dollars. And that's exactly what happened this quarter. Sales translated into fewer dollars. As I mentioned a little bit ago, $342 million fewer. However, the impact on cost was favorable $419 million, and the net to operating profit was positive $77 million. While we're not 100% exactly balanced in our currency exposures, we do have reasonably offsetting sales and cost positions that usually keep the profit impact of exchange rate swings to a reasonably manageable level. 
Okay. That's the story on currency. I'll kind of get back to profit now. I'd already talked about the positive items, and offsetting those positives for the quarter, we did have lower sales volume, and that was negative to our operating profit, about $83 million, and we had higher cost. The most significant cost factor was a change in the timing of expense related to divesting of stock-based compensation. The timing change won't have an impact on the full year versus 2014, but it did add to cost in the first quarter. 
Okay. That's a quick run-through of profit versus the first quarter last year. Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was a little over $1 billion in the quarter, but that was about $800 million lower than the first quarter last year. And most of that decline came from higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of this year, and they are based on performance in 2014. We used about $400 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares. And with relatively modest needs for CapEx this year, we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2015. And as you might expect, the timing and the amount that we ultimately repurchase, well, that will be subject to business and market conditions as we progress through the year and on our cash deployment priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to total capital ratio of 37.1%. And that's about right in the middle of our targeted 30% to 45% range. And it was slightly favorable versus year-end 2014. If you net cash with the debt, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 18.3%.
Now before we get into the revised outlook, I'll just recap changes in the order backlog over the last quarter because I suspect many of you are interested in that. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of $16.5 billion, and that's about $800 million lower than the year-end 2014. The decline was split between Construction Industries and Resource Industries. You might have expected that Energy & Transportation would've also declined from year-end as a result of weakness in the oil industry. It was, in total, however, about flat. We did have a decline in the backlog because of weakness in oil, but that was about offset by an increase in the backlog for locomotives.
Okay. With that, let me go through the 2015 outlook. As I started out, in terms of overall world economic growth, we don't expect much change from the outlook that we provided with our year-end results in January. And the same goes for our sales and revenues, we're holding it at about $50 billion for 2015. 
Now while we're not changing the sales outlook, just as a reminder, we do expect 2015 to be over $5 billion lower than 2014. And as we said last January, and I'll reiterate today, the impact of substantially lower oil prices is the most significant reason for the decline. And we still think the most significant impact from oil will be from engines and other equipment that we sell for drilling and well servicing. And that's the spot where we expect a large drop in demand this year. We've already started to see the impact of that in our order backlog as new orders have not kept pace with sales, and the backlog has declined. And we'll start seeing that hit sales over the course of 2015. We also expect that indirect effects from substantially lower oil prices will be negative in 2015 versus 2014. In countries and in some regions of the U.S. where oil production is significant for either government receipts or for the local economies, it will likely be negative for sales of construction equipment and for our electric power generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct, like building a road to service a new well, or it can be very indirect, like construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund spending. Because many of those construction-related impacts are indirect, it does make it tough to measure. But anecdotally, we believe we're already starting to see the impact of that in our Construction business.
Now in addition to oil, there are several other factors that are contributing to the year-over-year decline in sales. The stronger dollar is a headwind to sales, but again, not profit. Commodity prices in mining are generally weak, particularly iron ore and coal, and that's negative for mining in our Resource Industries segment. With weaknesses in agriculture, we're expecting lower sales of industrial engines. And we expect our rail business to be down in 2015 after a great year in 2014. And we expect weakness in the Construction Industries of key developing countries like China and Brazil. And that was certainly evident in our first quarter. So that's a recap of our year-over-year changes, down from 2014, but no change in the top line outlook for 2015. We did raise the profit outlook again this morning. Our previous outlook was $4.60 per share all-in, and $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. This morning, we raised the profit outlook to $4.70 per share all-in, and $5 per share excluding restructuring costs. 
Now the changes from the previous outlook include more restructuring activity. We've increased our restructuring cost estimate from about $150 million expected for this year, up $100 million to about $250 million, with almost all of the increase related to facilities that produce mining products. We added the $120 million gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining ownership in the third-party logistics business. That wasn't in our previous outlook. And based on our first quarter actual results, we made some additional improvements to the profit outlook. While we held the top line and made a modest improvement to the bottom line of our outlook, 2015 is still shaping up to be an uncertain and challenging year. There continues to be softness in Latin America, particularly Brazil. China growth is concerning. The stability and scale of economic recovery in the United States remains concerning. Europe is still a question mark. Mining hasn't shown improvement yet. And while we're still planning a sharp decline in our oil-related sales in 2015, there's still a concern around that.
So to wrap up and move on to the Q&A portion of the call, sales and revenues in the first quarter were about as we expected, and we had a solid profit quarter. We repurchased 400 million of shares in the quarter. The balance sheet remains strong, and we're very focused on operational performance and cost control. But it still looks like a tough year and we've not seen meaningful signs of recovery in many of our cyclical businesses.
So with that, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

I know we don't give quarterly guidance, but we were a little better than we thought we were going to be in the quarter. And some of that, of course, was timing.

I think that we're going to add to spending over the course of the year. We've got some R&D programs that we need to do there. We talked about that in January.

We'll have negative product mix in E&T because of the decline in the oil business that's coming. We also expect some negative mix in Construction Industries. If you look at what they sold in the first quarter, it was relatively balanced between -- we have 3 pieces of construction: earthmoving, excavation and building construction products, or BCP, our smaller equipment. So what we actually sold in the quarter, at least in terms of new equipment, was fairly balanced between those 3 subsectors. But if you look at what was ordered and what we think is going to happen for sales as the year unfolds, probably not a lot of change in total for construction, but a bit more of a shift to BCP, smaller machines. I think, part of that is, in countries like China where the selling season is very early in the year, that helps excavation sales and then that tails down later in the year. So we're looking at some negative mix in Construction as the year goes on. I don't think for the year, we're not, at least in our -- contemplated in our outlook, we're not going to fall below double digits for Construction.

I mean, we had, for the company overall, $105 million of price realization. That's less than 1%. I think, the segment that is doing -- the segments that are doing better right now are Construction and Energy & Transportation. Construction, in particular, did a little bit better. But part of that is really from a few -- 3 things. One is we had last year this big Brazilian order from the government. And while that was good volume, it was pretty low price. So without that, sort of our average price level is up a bit. We had some favorable geographic mix, and we did take list price increases, small, but up at the beginning of the year. So that all contributed a bit. I think, with Resource Industries, it's been down year-over-year for the last -- certainly, last couple of quarters. I can't remember the third, but probably in the third last year as well. It's just a tough business right now. It's dog eat dog. And although a lot of that product that we sell is dollar-based, the sales are conducted in dollars a lot in mining, some of our key competition like Komatsu probably has more of yen cost base than we do, and they're being aggressive. So it's a tough industry."

You know all of our competitors aren't in the U.S., so it's a -- it really is a competitive environment out there, but we are not giving up our pins goals, our market share goals. We're doing as well as we can be expected in a tough market that we are. Certainly, our cost management the last couple of years has helped that. Our lean manufacturing, where we generated cost advantage, has helped. And we're still very much focused on market share.

There's been a lot of discussion about it, and we've been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We'll go through a process where we are cyclical, we've seen this before. On the one side, we want to be ready for the upturn. Our business model is to produce quality products, lowest owner-operating costs, produces parts and service for us and the dealers and repeat business. And so on that side, given the fact that our sales can move fairly dramatically through the cycles, we want to be ready to be able to meet that demand. But on the other side, it's absolutely clear and a good question that this current economic environment presents a lot of opportunities. So we've been at this since 2013. In fact, if you kind of add up what we've done in the last 3 years, including what we plan to do in '15, we'll incur roughly $900 million of restructuring cost. We've closed or downsized roughly 20 facilities, about 5 million of square feet during that period, again, through '15, and about 15,000 employees, which is unfortunate. All-in then, if you look at the benefits, we mentioned to you before that we believe after '15, the benefit per year would be $400 million to $500 million per year. With what we've done, which we've had higher benefits on than we anticipated, and what we have in place, we'll be at the high end or exceed that in terms of our benefits per year. And so it's a robust process. It's done by our product source planning group, with involvement across all the facilities, all the regions. There's been some discussion about big facilities. It's very hard to close a single source Decatur [ph] facility, in terms of the mining trucks. It would be the same for East Peoria. So those things just don't dollar out in terms of return to shareholders. And we do it a net present value calculation through that. So I would say that we're continuing to look. We've added a few more in the mining space. If you go back to 2012, we were $66 billion in sales. We're $50 billion now. We've lost roughly $16 billion. 75% of that is mining. And we've held at a 25% decremental pull-through right in that range. And so there's a lot of things going on that support that, including lean and material cost. But I would say that we're pretty happy with that pull-through over that 3-year period. We've done that with little price and higher quality and growing market share. So I'm not saying we won't have more to do, but that process is ongoing, and we've been pretty active in it."

Maybe once in the last 20 years, and that was a quarter when you were just starting to buy Bucyrus. So even if I pull out the gain on the first quarter, still have $1.72, if the second quarter has been also $1.72 or higher, to do your full year, the back half of the year has to be doing $0.70, $0.75 per quarter.

So a couple of things, you're correct in the idea that, particularly for reciprocating engines, we'll have fairly sizable declines in the second half of the year, actually beginning in the -- probably beginning sometime in the second quarter and continuing on through the year. But there are other parts of the business, like Solar, where the timing of the year is usually the second half is higher than the first half. And we certainly see that happening this year. We have, I think, marine sales up a bit higher in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. And much of the rest of the business is actually reasonably -- in fact, I just looked at this, this morning, kind of almost anticipating this question. The rest of the year, for most of the rest of the businesses are, by and large, relatively stable as we go through the year. So the dropoff will be more oil, but it will be mitigated a little bit by timing in some of the segments and a little bit of an increase in marine."

Mining inventories is going to continue to come down a little bit this year, not as much as last year, but kind of continue edging its way down like it did in the first quarter."

Doug Oberhelman here. We really haven't changed our priorities of cash at all. If anything, the top priority to maintain the balance sheet is, I think, becoming more important to us as the uncertainty around us continues on, if not increases. We reported that we're about, I guess, 37% or so of debt to debt and equity. That's been coming -- trending down and we'll trend that down throughout the year. We've bought $400 million of shares in the first quarter, which, I think, is a reasonable planning rate for the rest of the year, assuming our plan holds up. We will end the -- I have no doubt we'll end the year with cash, a lot of cash, as we did in the first quarter, over $7 billion. I think, in this area of uncertainty where, day to day, one never knows what's going to happen, and having recently been burned on that in 2008 with a big downturn and a weak balance sheet, that's where we're going to be. The other thing, and I've said this before, is that we are continually looking for growth opportunities and that strong balance sheet allows us lots of flexibility for growth, for protection, maintain our dividend, modestly increase it, as we've said before, and buy shares back. But I would say that we're in the driver's seat with cash generation, with our inventory turnover, arising our lean manufacturing, bringing up cash. And as these other priorities work through, share buyback will likely, over time, continue to be an important thing for us. But in 2015, we're just planning right now on that $400 million until we -- kind of third quarter or so, given the uncertainties and the challenges we face that we see every day in the marketplace."

But generally speaking, if you're going to produce and you're going to move things through -- oil through a pipeline, or you need the equipment to work to do that, if there is hesitation, if there's customers, maybe like mining, they have a possibility they could push out things like overhauls and rebuilds. That potentially could be a negative. I would say we're not really seeing a lot of that right now, outside of kind of the drilling and fracking where activity is off. Remember, though, and I think this needs to be said, a lot of our business in oil and gas, probably most of our business in oil and gas, is gas. And so far, that's held up pretty well. Demand for gas is good and the compression business is doing pretty well. So oil is just one piece of our oil and gas business.
