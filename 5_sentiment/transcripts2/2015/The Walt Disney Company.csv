191564,280032649,753890,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Good afternoon. I'm very pleased announced The Walt Disney Company had another incredibly strong quarter with diluted earnings per share up 23% to $1.27.

I'm very pleased announced The Walt Disney Company had another incredibly strong quarter with diluted earnings per share up 23% to $1.27. These results were driven by solid performance across all of our businesses and once again demonstrated the strength of our brands and content in a proven franchise strategy that will drive long-term value.
And Frozen is a great example of this strategy. On March 13, along with Cinderella, we're premiering a new 7-minute Frozen Theater, bringing back all the beloved characters and voices and introducing a great new song. This time last year, we are excited about the box office success of Frozen, which went on to win the Oscar and become the highest-grossing animated feature of all time. 
Now a full year after its release, we're seeing the true impact of Frozen across our entire company. Overall, retail toy sales in North America were up 4% in 2014 and according to a leading market research firm, much of the credit for that growth belongs to Frozen, which was both the biggest and fastest-growing toy property of the year. It's also enormously popular in our Parks and Resorts and showcase successful mobile game and gave a significant boost to our home entertainment business for the quarter, along with Maleficent and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. And Frozen is just 1 of the 11 franchises of Disney currently driving more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales. The strong holiday demand for Frozen, as well as Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man and Avengers, led to the most successful quarter ever for Disney Consumer Products. 
Among the companies, Disney stands out, no one else comes close to our unparalleled collection of strong brands, where our pipeline of great content and our unprecedented ability to leverage creative success and great value across the entire company allows us to adapt to emerging challenges, taking advantage of new opportunities and most importantly, innovate for the future. 
For example, who else but ESPN launched the first-ever College Football Playoffs with such enormous success. The 2 semifinals and the national championship broke previous records to become the 3 most-watched telecast in the history of cable television, an achievement that speaks to the tremendous potential of this annual event and further strengthens ESPN's undisputed position as the #1 sports brand. 
Our studio is obviously a key franchise drivers and we have a strong slate of upcoming movies. We started the fiscal year with Disney Animation's Big Hero 6, which has already generated just under $500 million in global box office. It's also been #1 in Japan for 5 weeks and is yet to open in some key markets. And Into the Woods has been both acclaimed by critics and embraced by audiences. 
As I said, next month, one of our most beloved and iconic characters comes to life in Disney's first-ever live-action Cinderella. It's a fresh look in this classic story and it's also stunningly beautiful film. 
Later in the spring, we're looking forward to an original Disney adventure called Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney and directed by Brad Burke. 
As every Marvel fan knows, the highly-anticipated adventure sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, opens in May, where the first trailer was released in November. Fans viewed it more than 34 million times in just 24 hours, the speed and magnitude of their reaction certainly speaks to the incredible excitement around Avengers. 
Ant Man debuts in July, bringing another great character to the screen with Marvel's trademark blend of action, humor and heart. We're also thrilled to have 2 original Pixar movies on the way this year. In June, Inside Out will give audiences an all-access pass into the mind of an 11 year-old girl and Thanksgiving, the good dinosaur takes a humorous look what the world would be like if the asteroid that wiped out the Dinosaur has actually missed. Of course, there are millions of Star Wars' fans, the first 11 months of this year will be an exciting countdown to the December 18 release of Star Wars: The Force of Awakens. 
There's a strong emotional connection to this franchise that transcends geography and generations, and the brief teaser trailer released last November has been viewed more than 123 million times. Having been on the set and have seen most of the footage, I can definitely say that the excitement is justified. It marks the beginning of the new era exceptional Star Wars, as well as an opportunity for continued growth across all of our businesses. 
As a truly global company, we've talked a lot about the importance of developing local content and the success of the film TK in India is a perfect example. It's now India's highest-grossing movie of all-time, with almost $107 million in global box office. It's also Bollywood most successful movie ever. Coproduced and released by our Indian subsidiary, You TV, Piquet will soon be thousand 500 screens across China. This is also a dynamic and exciting time for our Parks and Resorts with another very strong performance in Q1 and plenty to look forward to, including the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort. 
I was in China the week before last and saw amazing progress. We just topped off our signature Shanghai Disneyland hotel and we're nearing completion on iconic features throughout the park, including the largest castle we've ever built. And we're getting ready to start casting hundreds of performers we'll need to entertain our guests. It's thrilling to see Shanghai Disney Resort rapidly coming to live. The artistry, complexity, the magnitude of the detail, it's all. 
As you recall, after we broke ground on this incredible resort, we announced an $800 million expansion, significantly increasing both the size of the park and the number of attractions available to our guests on opening day. Even with that expansion, we will complete major construction by the end of this calendar year, and we're planning a spectacular grand opening in spring of 2016, which we believe is the optimum time to showcase the full grandeur of this world-class destination. 
Obviously, we're proud with our performance and our record in creating significant value for our company and our shareholders and we're very optimistic about our future. 
And now I'm going to turn the call over to Jay to take you through the details of our Q1 performance and then we'll take questions. Jay?"

Fiscal 2015 is off to a great start as we delivered another strong quarter of financial results. 
Earnings per share were up 23%, driven by a record revenue, up 9% over last year and 17% growth in segment operating income. The result this quarter a little bit more detail in a moment, a further evidence our strategy of investing in high-quality content drive significant long-term value across our businesses. 
Our Consumer Products, our broad content portfolio, fueled incredibly strong financial results. Segment operating income was up 46% on revenue growth of 22%. Margins expanded by 720 basis points, reflecting strength in both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. 
Growth in licensing was driven by Frozen and, to a lesser extent, Disney Channel's properties, Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man and Avengers, partly offset by a higher revenue share with The Studio. 
On a basis, earned licensing revenue in the first quarter was up an impressive 23% over last year and just particularly notable given the size of our licensing business. 
Higher results in our retail business were primarily due to the continued demand for Frozen merchandise, which drove double-digit growth in same-store sales and across Europe and Japan, as well as higher online sales in those regions. 
At The Studio, the success of our fiscal 2014 theatrical slate continue to drive financial in the first quarter it. Operating income was up 33% over last year due to increases in home entertainment, higher revenue share of Consumer Products and an increase in television distribution. 
While we were very pleased with the worldwide box office performance of Big Hero 6, theatrical results were lower in the first quarter, reflecting a record-breaking performance of Frozen last year. 
The increase in home entertainment was primarily driven by higher unit sales of Guardians of the Galaxy, Frozen and Maleficent compared to Monsters University and The Lone Ranger in Q1 last year. The increase in television distribution in the first quarter was due to better performance of Q1 titles, including The Avengers, Captain America 2 and Frozen compared to last year's titles. 
The studio [indiscernible] higher revenue share from Consumer Products in the first quarter due to the strong sales of Frozen merchandise. 
The Parks and Resorts segment had another great quarter. Operating income was up 20% on revenue growth of 9% due to continued strength at our domestic operations. Despite lower results at our international operations, total segment margins were up 190 basis points, with major new initiatives accounting for 80 basis points of the year-over-year increase. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our recent major investments that they have contributed nicely to the robust growth of domestic base business. In the first quarter, growth in operating income domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs. 
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks were up 7%, with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort each setting an all-time attendance record for any quarter. For capital spending in our domestic parks was up 4% on higher ticket prices, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 8 percentage points to 89% and [indiscernible] was up 4%. 
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservation are [indiscernible] up 3% from compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 4%. 
Turning to Media Networks, segment revenue was up 11% and operating income was up 3% at higher results at Broadcasting were partially offset by lower results at cable to primarily higher programming and production costs at ESPN. 
Broadcasting operating income increased 35% driven by higher affiliate revenue and higher program sales, partially offset by lower ad revenue. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to the rate increases, as well as higher rates in new affiliate agreements. 
Program sales were up in the first quarter due to sales of ABC Studios shows, including Criminal Minds, Scandal and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue the network was down in the quarter, as a result of fewer primetime unit sold, partially offset by higher rates. Quarter-to-date pricing at ABC Network is running 10% above upfront levels. 
Cable segment resource was down modestly, as lower operating income at ESPN was partially offset by increases at the worldwide Disney Channels and ABC Family. Lower results at ESPN were primarily due to higher programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, higher marketing costs related to the College Football Playoffs and the launch of the SEC Network. This quarter's results reflect ESPN's continued investment in what is already the deepest and broadest portfolio of sports rights. 
As a result, programming production expenses were up mid-teens percent during the first quarter due to higher expenses for NFL rights and this is the first year of ESPN's new 8-year contract and addition sports rights for the SEC Network. 
As we discussed in the past, we expect growth in cable programming costs to be in the low teens and that increase will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect cable programming costs to be up about 25% in the first half of the fiscal year and relatively flat in the second half. 
The cost increase this quarter and what we expect in Q2 are consistent with the first half and full year outlook. ESPN has long-term agreements for the most valuable sports rights. While the first year of new contracts a result in above trend cost increases and adversely affect result in the short-term, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow ESPN over the long term. 
During the first quarter, we made a major affiliate distribution deal completion of with our 10 largest affiliate projects. Due to  contractual provisions in ESPN's new agreements, ESPN will no longer defer a portion of it affiliate revenue for most of its contracts as was previously the case. Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 20% in the quarter, reflecting the benefits of new affiliate agreements, lower deferred revenue at ESPN and the launch of the SEC Network. The 20% increase in affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $136 million as ESPN deferred $136 million in affiliate revenue in Q1 last year compared to no deferred affiliate revenue in Q1 this year. 
Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenues at ESPN, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double-digits. Revenue at ESPN was down 2% in the first quarter. While total ratings were up, ad revenue was lower as ratings for certain key programs were down compared to last year, partially offset right higher rates. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales were pacing up 18% on the strength of the first College Football Playoff, which aired last month. 
The increase at Worldwide Disney Channels was due to higher affiliate revenue at domestic count and higher advertising revenue at international panels, partially offset by higher programming costs. The increase in ABC Family was driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenues, reflecting an increase in units sold. 
In Interactive, operating income increased 36% in the quarter, driven by higher results in our global games business due to the continued success of Tsum Tsum, as well as lower product development costs, partially offset by lower results at our console gaming business. Lower console games performance reflected higher per unit costs driven by Disney Infinity, growing unit sales and higher marketing costs. The decrease in unit sales was driven by a lower sales of catalog titles and Disney Infinity figures, partially offset by higher sales of Disney starter packs. 
We continue to take a balance approach to capital allocation while investing for the long term sustainable growth, while returning meaningful capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased 15 million shares for about $1.3 billion and increased our dividend by 34% from $0.86 per share to $1.15 per share. 
Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 15.5 million shares for about $1.4 billion. Overall, we feel great about this quarter as we look up across our businesses, there's a lot to be excited about in 2015 and beyond. But we are not taking anything for granted as we recognize, we have a lot of work ahead of us. We believe the strength in our brands coupled with the integrated nature of our company and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

First of all, about 10 million guests have already worn the men's and so far, what we're hearing from them is overwhelmingly positive. Basically, the percentage of their rate is excellent significant. So what that basically tells us and what we actually have seen is that it is serving the purpose that we set out to serve, which is to essentially make the experience more seamless, basically make it easier to give people an opportunity to enjoy what they do when they visit Orlando or Walt Disney World even more than they used it and make them enjoy more of it, meaning experience more. Just to give you for instance, there were days during the holiday season where we are entertaining 250,000 guests at a time on a property. And when you just consider how many guests you have to flow-through the gates when the park opens in the morning, the fact you have a band that enables you to basically walk right in, touch the band to a kiosk and keep going instead of handing a ticket to cast member, making sure the ticket right and then going in, that's obviously creating a huge improvement, meaning much quicker entrants into the park. And what this all adds up to is our ability to manage our people at that time without in any way diminishing guest experience.

And we believe that it's worthwhile experiment or worthy attempt to try to convince young people or younger people to sign up to cable when they either wouldn't have signed it for it, they might have waited Michael's comment aside. There's definitely an opportunity not just for ESPN, but for other Disney brands of ultimately put products in the marketplace that reach consumers directly. I think we have that opportunity with Disney-branded service. We may have an opportunity to bring out a Marvel-type product and possibly even Star Wars. But we also are mindful of the value of the expanded basic bundle to this company. And we do not believe that there is any reason for us to attempt to take out some of these product particularly ESPN quickly or right now. In other words, there is time. If we see that, the market dynamics are changing in such a way that if better for us as a company to take the product out directly and to not only improve our margins by taking out the middleman but to create a closer relationship with the consumer that can be mined for either revenue-generating purposes, then will do that.

First of all, there are only a couple of bumps left, big upticks in the ESPN program cost base over the next, let's call it, 4 or 5 years. The first one, we're in the middle, which is our new NFL deal. The launch of the SEC Network and next quarter, in a pretty significant way, the BCS college football playoffs. And the second big one down the road in '17 is the beginning of our new NBA deal. Other than those bumps which, as I've said, one we're in the middle of, in fact, we gave you some guidance on costs this year that we would be experiencing very heavy ESPN programming costs in the first half of the year and much lighter in the second. I can tell you that those numbers looks like about 25% in the first half of the year and only 1% -- flat to 1% increase in the second half of the year. And then there's 17 when the NBA deal sticks in -- kicks in. So we told you many, many times, of course, I'm talking about overall cable margins because that's all we speak of. The -- other than that, we've told you many, many times, we don't run ESPN on a margin basis. We won't give you guidance on what the margins will look like, but we expect the business to continue to grow. We have those 2 periods of year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter cost increases and other than that, we still have high expectations for growth in these business."

And then we've got Avengers in May. And then, of course, 2 Pixar films in calendar 2015, although we don't know that any one of them will drive significant Consumer Products. And Star Wars, as you mentioned, Alexia, the end of the year. We're not going to predict whether there'll be a ramp up of buying ahead of Star Wars except that we believe because of the strength of the franchise and the buzz around the movie, which we saw certainly was the case when we put the T-shirt traitor out just around Christmas time, that we're likely to see some buying in advance of the movie of consumer products. The other thing that I wanted to mention because we've talked a lot about Frozen, you didn't mention it, is that we're coming out on March 13, attached to Cinderella was the 7-minute Frozen short. That's just great. That has the all the key players, both the voice talent and the character talent and the characters and a great song and we actually believe that it's going to generate some more buzz for Frozen.

So to recap, scatter pricing was up in the market and overall ad sales, as you said, were down as ABC sold fewer units this year compared to last year. And the lower unit sales can be attributed to a number of factors, and I think the combination is -- the combination of those factors had an impact on this quarter, making the advertising sales numbers lower. And those are related to the length of the show, how the shows are written, the number for promotional spots we put in the shows as opposed to sold spots. The number of ads we inserted into the programs and how we use inventory in the quarter to manage our make good liability. And that -- those combined to deliver notwithstanding the ratings we had, their own favorite is we had the season to slightly depress our advertising revenue. So I think ABC is extremely well positioned this year relative to its peers. We expect a tightening of inventory as the year progresses.

But let's just say that we've got be plants for it and huge.
[Audio Gap]
Hong Kong and at Shanghai are obviously Shanghai has yet to open. So may be it sounds somewhat premature. But the size of the land that we have there, the expansion opportunities in a market that we think is just perfect for the Disneyland experience suggests that once we open, it's just the beginning in terms of variety of offerings that we'll be able to provide. And then, of course, well the franchise that we talked about earlier, which is Frozen. But I think actually, says a lot about other franchises to. There are clearly more opportunities to mine some of these great franchises across the parks. And when you go to Imagineering, there's a vast so to speak in terms of stories and characters that the imaginaries have to draw from to create great park experiences. And I think one of the things that we're seeing now in our parks and one of the reasons why the results were so strong across the board, Christmas time, is that there is definitely a halo effect that consumers have for Disney based on all of these franchises, and it is not just what exists in the parks, I think you have 2 includes Marvel and you haven't to include Star Wars as well. The brand's strength has never been stronger. The array of franchises never been greater. We said we've got 11 franchises that are going to generate $1 billion this year in retail sales. And that just I think results in an enthusiasm for the brand and an enthusiasm for the park experience that we provide it's just not only ample opportunities to create from all of that, but for consumers to basically engage with us in more ways and more places than ever before."

So look, I don't think that we can underestimate the impact that Frozen has had across our company and all of our businesses, but I don't think it would be right to take from that the implication that even our Consumer Products business was overly dominated by the Frozen franchise this quarter. You asked whether we think Frozen has, to put words into your mouth, we think Frozen has legs. We absolutely believe this is the beginning of a long-term franchise for the company, and that will reflect itself up all of our divisions, Consumer Products certainly not the least of which. But if it if you look at the last quarter, many other franchisors, franchises were contractors to the success of the Consumer Products division. By the way, not the least of which was Mickey and Minnie, the Disney Channel franchises and we like what Frozen delivered but it's not, it's certainly not the 1 and only for of us. We have 11 franchises that now retail at over $1 billion as of the last year. So our Consumer Products business really has a lot of breadth in addition to depth and we're only beginning this year to see what the Avengers and overall Marvel franchises are going to deliver, which is -- has also been a huge contributor. And I think if you look down the road, you can imagine that we'll be adding Star Wars to that on in very, very significant play with the release of that film. so it's a broad-based business and I think that Frozen will continue to play a big part in it, but I wouldn't make the mistake of thinking that is the same dominant force that you have to worry about repeating year-on-year in the Consumer Products business. In terms of margin, obviously, the licensing business is incredibly highly leveraged. But I think the real margin story for his past quarter has been the Disney stores business, where we saw increases both in the physical brick-and-mortar stores, in all of the 3 regions we operate, which is Japan, Europe and North America, as well as the online business in those 3 regions. So we've -- I would venture to say and I think I'm right about this, we have restored margins in that business this past quarter and it was a big contributor to the margin story for consumer products.

And I think that you have to look at return to -- capital return to shareholders in aggregate, which is the way we think about it. Your second question on arrivals. So I don't think that we know or have seen an impact on international arrivals due to exchange rates. Said for many, many quarters, the overall range of our international business is between 18% and 22% of total attendance at our domestic parks. Q1 is usually on the low end of that range. It was again the low end of that range this year. And I think that if there's going to be an effect of the there varying exchange rates around the world, it will take a while and if those exchange rates affect the economies from which our international business is sourced, we might see any impact but as of yet, we have that scene that.

First of all, Maker's results in terms of consumption, a number of videos streamed since the time that we bought them has been up substantially, just huge growth. And what that tells us is really what our instinct was when we brought bought them and we're really interested in and compelled by substantial increase in consumption of short form video and digital platforms. We had consumption of short form video on our own digital platforms like ESPN.com, disney.com, ABC. But we didn't have the kind of traction or the kind of traffic that Maker had. We thought this will be a great opportunity for us to distribute much more effectively in the short form -- in short form. And also was entrée into a world of creativity that we thought we could tap into, particularly when we allowed those that are creating in that space access to our franchises and our brands. Those are kind of combination of things. It was just as true expertise that we did not have as much as we thought we should. And certainly, production and creative expertise that we thought we could use. And it was I think unique acquisition opportunity for us again given all the growth in short form consumption. I don't see it necessarily suggest the direction in terms of where we're heading as a company over all, the power of this company largely easy and it's brands, it's storytelling and creativity that runs across platforms and is often distributed by third party, whether they movie theater owners, big box retailers or MVPDs, to name a few, or new platforms like Netflix and Amazon and Hulu. So I think that the primary thrust that the company is going to continue to be investing as brands in, in its creativity and selling as broadly as we possibly can to be like being new space well. And one last think I think is a think this business going to look larger and larger in terms of the Disney's future and we touched upon it a little bit earlier today that I think this company needs to focus more on creating a tighter or a closer relationship to its customers for a variety of reasons, not only to the mine customer data and the usage and obviously period revenue opportunities from that but to provide customers with experience they want them and basically to be even more user-friendly, more customers able more customizable, Murray personalized. That's really important in terms of the long-term future of this company and you will see various initiatives that are aimed at achieving just that."

We obviously were embarking on a very large fairly complicated project, one of the largest we've ever engaged in, probably one of the largest ever in China. After we opened, we decided that the opportunity existed in China and specifically in Shanghai to build something even bigger with more tractions and basically more capacity so that we could handle more guests. And so not only did we design but we agreed with our partners to build approximately $800 million more in capacity, which obviously added to the scale of what we're building. So now that we are well into construction and we released the great photo today of the Disneyland Hotel, which gives you an idea for our how far along we are. We believe that targeting the not the spring as we was more than targeting we plan to open in the spring of 2016 is much more opportune for us, given the size of what we are doing, what we are building and the complexity of it. And given the fact that the weather is better in the spring, as you said, David, it is after the Chinese New Year where we expect a huge demand and it's been easy to open after that event right before. I might have misspoken, after we broke ground, we decided that we'll build Shanghai, not have to reopen. And so we've got a great tragic unfolding. I was there the week before last and every time I go, I'm just at the scale of it and the variety and that uniqueness of these and I continue to believe heavily in the opportunity that we've got to bring a great Disneyland experience to the most populous country in the world. And my enthusiasm has only grown for but also because we are growing something bigger and we like spring versus winter than spring of '16 it these. And we probably will be more specific about an opening date I'm guessing sometime in the middle of this year."

I'm very pleased to announced The Walt Disney Company had another incredibly strong quarter with diluted earnings per share up 23% to $1.27. These results were driven by solid performance across all of our businesses and once again demonstrated the strength of our brands and content and a proven franchise strategy that will drive long-term value.
And Frozen is a great example of this strategy. On March 13, along with Cinderella, we're premiering a new 7-minute short Frozen Fever, bringing back all the beloved characters and voices and introducing a great new song. This time last year, we were excited about the box office success of Frozen, which went on to win the Oscar and become the highest-grossing animated feature of all time. Now a full year after its release, we're seeing the true impact of Frozen across our entire company. 
Overall, retail toy sales in North America were up 4% in 2014. And according to a leading market research firm, much of the credit for that growth belongs to Frozen, which was both the biggest and fastest-growing toy property of the year. It's also enormously popular in our Parks and Resorts. It's showcased in a successful mobile game, and it gave a significant boost to our home entertainment business for the quarter, along with Maleficent and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. And Frozen is just 1 of the 11 franchises at Disney currently driving more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales. The strong holiday demand for Frozen as well as Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man and Avengers led to the most successful quarter ever for Disney Consumer Products. 
Among media companies, Disney stands out. No one else comes close to our unparalleled collection of strong brands, where our pipeline of great content and our unprecedented ability to leverage creative success and create value across the entire company allows us to adapt to emerging challenges, take advantage of new opportunities and most importantly, innovate for the future. 
For example, who else but ESPN launched the first-ever College Football Playoffs with such enormous and immediate success. The 2 semifinals and the national championship broke previous records to become the 3 most-watched telecasts in the history of cable television, an achievement that speaks to the tremendous potential of this annual event and further strengthens ESPN's undisputed position as the #1 sports brand. 
Our Studio is obviously a key franchise driver, and we have a strong slate of upcoming movies. We started the fiscal year with Disney Animation's Big Hero 6, which has already generated just under $500 million in global box office. It's also been #1 in Japan for 5 weeks and is yet to open in some key markets. And Into the Woods has been both acclaimed by critics and embraced by audiences. 
As I said, next month, one of our most beloved and iconic characters comes to life in Disney's first-ever live-action Cinderella. It's a fresh look in this classic story and it's also stunningly beautiful film. 
Later in the spring, we're looking forward to an original Disney adventure called Tomorrowland starring George Clooney and directed by Brad Bird. 
As every Marvel fan knows, the highly anticipated adventure sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, opens in May. And when the first trailer was released in November, fans viewed it more than 34 million times in just 24 hours. The speed and magnitude of that reaction certainly speaks to the incredible excitement around Avengers. 
Ant Man debuts in July, bringing another great character to the screen with Marvel's trademark blend of action, humor and heart. 
We're also thrilled to have 2 original Pixar movies on the way this year. In June, Inside Out will give audiences an all-access pass into the mind of an 11 year-old girl. And in Thanksgiving, a good dinosaur takes a humorous look at what the world would be like if the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs had actually missed. 
Of course, for millions of Star Wars fans, the first 11 months of this year will be an exciting countdown to the December 18 release of Star Wars: The Force of Awakens. There's a strong emotional connection to this franchise that transcends geography and generations, and the brief teaser trailer released last November has been viewed more than 123 million times. Having been on the set and seen most of the footage, I can definitely say that the excitement is justified. It marks the beginning of the new era of exceptional Star Wars storytelling as well as an opportunity for continued growth across all of our businesses. 
As a truly global company, we've talked a lot about the importance of developing local content, and the success of the film PK in India is a perfect example. It's now India's highest-grossing movie of all time, with almost $107 million in global box office. It's also Bollywood's most successful movie ever. Co-produced and released by our Indian subsidiary, UTV, PK will soon be on 3,500 screens across China. 
This is also a dynamic and exciting time for our Parks and Resorts with another very strong performance in Q1 and plenty to look forward to, including the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort. I was in China the week before last and saw amazing progress. We just topped off our signature Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, and we're nearing completion on iconic features throughout the park, including the largest castle we've ever built. And we're getting ready to start casting hundreds of performers we'll need to entertain our guests. It's thrilling to see Shanghai Disney Resort rapidly coming to life. The artistry, complexity and magnitude of the detail, it's all quite astonishing.
As you recall, after we broke ground on this incredible resort, we announced an $800 million expansion, significantly increasing both the size of the park and the number of attractions available to our guests on opening day. Even with that expansion, we will complete major construction by the end of this calendar year, and we're planning a spectacular grand opening in spring of 2016, which we believe is the optimal time to showcase the full grandeur of this world-class destination. 
Obviously, we're proud of our performance and our record of creating significant value for our company and our shareholders, and we're very optimistic about our future. 
And now I'm going to turn the call over to Jay to take you through the details of our Q1 performance, and then we'll take questions. Jay?"

Fiscal 2015 is off to a great start as we delivered another strong quarter of financial results. 
Earnings per share were up 23%, driven by record revenue, up 9% over last year, and 17% growth in segment operating income. The results this quarter, which I'll go over with more detail in a moment, are further evidence that our strategy of investing in high-quality content drives significant long-term value across our businesses. 
At Consumer Products, our broad content portfolio fueled incredibly strong financial results. Segment operating income was up 46% on revenue growth of 22%. Margins expanded by 720 basis points, reflecting strength in both our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses. 
Growth in Licensing was driven by Frozen, and to a lesser extent, Disney Channel properties, Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man and Avengers, partly offset by a higher revenue share with the Studio. On a comparable basis, earned Licensing revenue in the first quarter was up an impressive 23% over last year and just particularly notable given the size of our Licensing business. 
Higher results in our Retail business were primarily due to the continued demand for Frozen merchandise, which drove double-digit growth in same-store sales in North America, Europe and Japan as well as higher online sales in those regions. 
At the Studio, the success of our fiscal 2014 theatrical slate continued to drive financial benefits in the first quarter. Operating income was up 33% over last year due to increases in home entertainment, higher revenue share of Consumer Products and an increase in television distribution. While we were very pleased with the worldwide box office performance of Big Hero 6, theatrical results were lower in the first quarter, reflecting a record-breaking performance of Frozen last year. 
The increase in home entertainment was primarily driven by higher unit sales of Guardians of the Galaxy, Frozen and Maleficent compared to Monsters University and The Lone Ranger in Q1 last year. The increase in television distribution in the first quarter was due to better performance of Q1 titles, including The Avengers, Captain America 2 and Frozen, compared to last year's titles. 
The Studio recognized a higher revenue share from Consumer Products in the first quarter due to strong sales of Frozen merchandise. 
The Parks and Resorts segment had another great quarter. Operating income was up 20% on revenue growth of 9% due to continued strength at our domestic operations. Despite lower results at our international operations, total segment margins were up 190 basis points, with major new initiatives accounting for 80 basis points of the year-over-year increase. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our recent major investments that they have contributed nicely to the robust growth of the domestic-based business. In the first quarter, growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs. 
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 7%, with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort each setting an all-time attendance record for any quarter. Per capita spending in our domestic parks was up 4% on higher ticket prices, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 8 percentage points to 89%, and per room was up 4%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 4%. 
Turning to Media Networks. Segment revenue was up 11% and operating income was up 3% as higher results at Broadcasting were partially offset by lower results at cable due primarily to higher programming and production costs at ESPN. 
Broadcasting operating income increased 35%, driven by higher affiliate revenue and higher program sales, partially offset by lower ad revenue. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as higher rates in new affiliate agreements. 
Program sales were up in the first quarter due to sales of ABC Studios shows, including Criminal Minds, Scandal and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the network was down in the quarter, as a result of fewer primetime units sold, partially offset by higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 10% above upfront levels. 
Cable segment results were down modestly as lower operating income at ESPN was partially offset by increases at worldwide Disney Channels and ABC Family. Lower results at ESPN were primarily due to higher programming and production costs, and to a lesser extent, higher marketing costs related to the College Football Playoffs and the launch of the SEC Network. This quarter's results reflect ESPN's continued investment in what is already the deepest and broadest portfolio of sports rights. 
As a result, programming and production expenses were up mid-teens percent during the first quarter due to higher expenses for NFL rights, and this is the first year of ESPN's new 8-year contract and additional sports rights for the SEC Network. 
As we discussed in the past, we expect growth in cable programming costs to be in the low teens, and that increase will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect cable programming costs to be up about 25% in the first half of the fiscal year and relatively flat in the second half. The cost increased this quarter, and what we expect in Q2 are consistent with the first half and full year outlook. 
ESPN has long-term agreements in place for the most valuable sports rights. While the first year of new contracts may result in above-trend cost increases and adversely affect results in the short term, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow ESPN over the long term. 
During the first quarter, we entered into a major affiliate distribution deal, marking the completion of new agreements with our 10 largest affiliate partners. Due to contractual provisions in ESPN's new affiliate agreements, ESPN will no longer defer a portion of its affiliate revenue for most of its contracts, as was previously the case. 
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 20% in the quarter, reflecting the benefits of new affiliate agreements, lower deferred revenue at ESPN and the launch of the SEC Network. The 20% increase in affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $136 million as ESPN deferred $136 million in affiliate revenue in Q1 last year compared to no deferred affiliate revenue in Q1 this year. Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenues at ESPN, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double digits. And revenue at ESPN was down 2% in the first quarter. 
While total day ratings were up, ad revenue was lower as ratings for certain key programs were down compared to last year, partially offset by higher rates. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales were pacing up 18% on the strength of the first College Football Playoff, which aired last month. 
The increase at Worldwide Disney Channels was due to higher affiliate revenue at the domestic channel and higher advertising revenue at international channels, partially offset by higher programming costs. The increase at ABC Family was driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenues, reflecting an increase in units sold. 
At Interactive, operating income increased 36% in the quarter, driven by higher results from our global games business due to the continued success of Tsum Tsum as well as lower product development costs, partially offset by lower results at our console gaming business. Lower console game performance reflected higher per unit costs driven by Disney Infinity, lower unit sales and higher marketing costs. The decrease in unit sales was driven by lower sales of catalog titles and Disney Infinity figures, partially offset by higher sales of Disney Infinity starter packs. 
We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation while investing for the long-term sustainable growth while returning meaningful capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased 15 million shares for about $1.3 billion and increased our dividend by 34% from $0.86 per share to $1.15 per share. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 15.5 million shares for about $1.4 billion. 
Overall, we feel great about this quarter. As we look across our businesses, there's a lot to be excited about in 2015 and beyond. But we are not taking anything for granted as we recognize we have a lot of work ahead of us. We believe the strength in our brands, coupled with the integrated nature of our company, can create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

And so far, what we're hearing from them is overwhelmingly positive. Basically, the percentage that rate it is excellent is significant. So what that basically tells us and what we actually have seen is that it is serving the purpose that we set out to serve, which is to essentially make the experience more seamless, basically make it easier to give people an opportunity to enjoy what they do when they visit Orlando or Walt Disney World even more than they used to or to make them enjoy more of it, meaning experience more. Just to give you -- for instance, there were days during the holiday season where we were entertaining 250,000 guests at a time on property. And when you just consider how many guests you have to flow-through the gates when the park opens in the morning, the fact that you have a band that enables you to basically walk right in, touch the band to a kiosk and keep going instead of handing a ticket to cast member, making sure the ticket is right and then going in, that's obviously creating a huge improvement, meaning much quicker entrants into the park. And what this all adds up to is our ability to manage more people at a time without, in any way, diminishing guest experience. We did see in the quarter a positive impact to the bottom line from MyMagic+, just the beginnings of it. We will continue to see more of that.

Bob, your comments on Sling TV and not having data on the customers sit squarely on the question I wanted to ask you, which is with the broadband-only non-pay TV market growing in size, I would think it becomes ever more interesting for Disney to address that. And I think the default is to generally support the existing pay-TV bundle and highlight Hulu and Sling as dipping your toe in the water. But I was hoping you'd address whether there's a potentially superior business model for Disney to capture the distribution margin yourself benefit from dynamic advertising targeted, of course, and having that direct relationship with the consumer that you've been seeking. And I'll just throw Jay's question in there now as well. You've been asked a lot of questions on recent calls about ESPN's top line. I wanted to refocus on margin. So with the March 2015 quarter, the company is finishing long and expensive build-out of sports rights. It seems like the rest of the decade, you've only got a couple of tough quarters when the NBA hits. Are we thinking about that correctly, that even if ESPN revenue growth might moderate a bit, cost growth is also moderating? Any reason to think that margin shouldn't generally be flat to up going forward x those NBA quarters?"

And that's the subscriber that we're trying to reach with the Sling -- or the DISH is trying to reach with the Sling package. And we believe that it's a worthwhile experiment or a worthy attempt to try to convince young people -- or younger people to sign up to cable when they either wouldn't have signed up for it at all or they might have waited, Michael's comment aside. There is definitely an opportunity not just for ESPN but for other Disney brands to ultimately put products in the marketplace that reach consumers directly. We think we have that opportunity with Disney-branded service. We may have an opportunity to bring out a Marvel-type product and possibly even Star Wars. But we also are mindful of the value of the expanded basic bundle to this company. And we do not believe that there is any reason for us to attempt to take out some of these product, particularly ESPN, quickly or right now. In other words, there is time. If we see that the market dynamics are changing in such a way that it's better for us as a company to take the product out directly and to not only improve our margins by taking out the middleman but to create a closer relationship with the consumer that can be mined for other revenue-generating purposes, then we'll do that. But we think if we were to do that now, it would be somewhat precipitous of us and there doesn't seem to be any reason to be that way."

First of all, there are only a couple of bumps left, big upticks in the ESPN programming cost base over the next, let's call it, 4 or 5 years.

And the second big one down the road in '17 is the beginning of our new NBA deal. Other than those bumps, which as I said, one we're in the middle of, in fact, we gave you some guidance on costs this year that we would be experiencing very heavy ESPN programming costs in the first half of the year and much lighter in the second. I can tell you that those numbers looks like about 25% in the first half of the year and only a 1 -- flat to 1% increase in the second half of the year. And then there's '17 when the NBA deal sticks in -- kicks in. So we've told you many, many times, of course, I'm talking about overall cable margins because that's all we speak of.

And then we've got Avengers in May and then, of course, 2 Pixar films in calendar 2015, although we don't know that any one of them will drive significant Consumer Products, and then Star Wars, as you mentioned, Alexia, the end of the year. We're not going to predict whether there'll be a ramp-up of buying ahead of Star Wars except that we believe because of the strength of the franchise and the buzz around the movie, which we saw certainly was the case when we put the teaser trailer out just around Christmas time, that we're likely to see some buying in advance of the movie of Consumer Products. The other thing that I wanted to mention because we've talked a lot about Frozen, you didn't mention it, is that we're coming out on March 13, attached to Cinderella, was the 7-minute Frozen short. That's just great. That has all the key players, both the voice talent and the character talent and -- or the characters and a great song.

So to recap, scatter pricing was up in the market, and overall ad sales, as you said, were down as ABC sold fewer units this year compared to last year. And the lower unit sales can be attributed to a number of factors, and I think the combination is -- a combination of those factors had an impact on this quarter, making the advertising sales numbers lower. And those are related to the length of the show, how the shows are written, the number of promotional spots we put in the shows as opposed to sold spots, the number of ads we insert into the programs and how we use inventory in the quarter to manage our make-good liability. And that -- those all combined to deliver notwithstanding the ratings we had, the relative ratings we had this season, to slightly depress our advertising revenue. So I think ABC is extremely well positioned this year relative to its peers. We expect a tightening of inventory as the year progresses.

That's slated to open sometime in 2017. We have a fair amount of design and development work going on right now to greatly increase, this is no surprise, Star Wars presence in multiple locations around the world. And we'll have more details probably about that later on in 2015. The plans are ambitious, and so it's going to take some time for them to actually be built and opened. But let's just say that we've got big plans for it and huge belief in that franchise as the park's experience. I think it's also likely that you'll see an expansion at Hong Kong and at Shanghai. Obviously, Shanghai has yet to open. So maybe it sounds somewhat premature. But the size of the land that we have there, the expansion opportunities in a market that we think is just perfect for the Disneyland experience suggests that once we open, it's just the beginning in terms of the size and the variety of offerings that we'll be able to provide. And then, of course, going back to, well, the franchise that we talked about earlier, which is Frozen. But I think that actually says a lot about other franchises, too. There are clearly more opportunities to mine some of these great franchises across the parks. And when you go to Imagineering, there's an embarrassment of riches, so to speak, in terms of stories and characters that the Imagineers have to draw from to create great park experiences. And I think one of the things that we're seeing now in our parks and one of the reasons why the results were so strong across the board, Christmas time, is that there is definitely a halo effect that consumers have for Disney based on all of these franchises. And it's not just what exists in the parks. I think you have to include Marvel and you have to include Star Wars as well. The brand's strength has never been stronger. The array of franchises has never been greater. We said we've got 11 franchises that are going to generate $1 billion this year in retail sales. And that just, I think, results in an enthusiasm for the brand and an enthusiasm for the park experience that we provide. It gives us not only ample opportunities to create from all of that but for consumers to basically engage with us in more ways and more places than ever before."

So look, I don't think that we can underestimate the impact that Frozen has had across our company and in all of our businesses, but I don't think it would be right to take from that the implication that even our Consumer Products business was overly dominated by the Frozen franchise this quarter. You asked whether we think Frozen has -- to put words in your mouth, we think Frozen has legs. We absolutely believe that this is the beginning of a long-term franchise for the company, and that will reflect itself in all of our divisions, Consumer Products certainly not the least of which. But even if you look at the last quarter, many other franchisors -- franchises were contributors to the success of the Consumer Products division. By the way, not the least of which was Mickey and Minnie, the Disney Channel franchises. And we like what Frozen delivered. But it's not -- it's certainly not the one and only for us. We have 11 franchises that now retail at over $1 billion as of the last year. So our Consumer Products business really has a lot of breadth in addition to depth, and we're only beginning this year to see what the Avengers and overall Marvel franchises are going to deliver, which is -- has also been a huge contributor. And I think if you look down the road, you can imagine that we'll be adding Star Wars to that pantheon in a very, very significant way with the release of that film. so it's a broad-based business, and I think that Frozen will continue to play a big part in it. But I wouldn't make the mistake of thinking that it is a dominant force that you have to worry about repeating year-on-year in the Consumer Products business. In terms of margin, obviously, the licensing business is incredibly highly leveraged. But I think the real margin story for this past quarter has been the Disney stores business, where we saw increases both in the physical brick-and-mortar stores in all of the 3 regions we operate, which is Japan, Europe and North America, as well as the online business in those 3 regions. So we've -- I would venture to say, and I think I'm right about this, we have historic margins in that business this past quarter and it was a big contributor to the margin story for Consumer Products.

But we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, as we have been, through dividends and buybacks. You know this year, we announced a very significant increase in our dividend of 34%, bringing it up to $1.15, and that happened in this quarter. And I wouldn't focus too much on the first couple of weeks of this fiscal quarter as an indicator or any kind of guidance as to where we will wind up on the entire fiscal year relative to buybacks. So I don't have any big news for you. Our dividend is almost $2 billion that we paid out in quarter 2. And I think you have to look at return to -- capital return to shareholders in aggregate, which is the way we think about it. Your second question on arrivals. So I don't think that we know or have seen an impact on international arrivals due to exchange rates. I've said for many, many quarters, the overall range of our international business is between 18% and 22% of total attendance at our domestic parks. Q1 is usually on the low end of that range. It was again on the low end of that range this year. And I think that if there's going to be an effect of the varying exchange rates around the world, it will take a while. And if those exchange rates affect the economies from which our international business is sourced, we might see an impact, but as of yet, we have not seen that. And actually, quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year, there wasn't a huge change in our international business between fiscal '14 and fiscal '15."

Jay, on the Broadcasting segment, this has been 4 straight quarters of operating income growth. In addition to the ratings resurgence at ABC, presumably retrans and affiliate comp are a big part of that growth. So I wonder if you could help us with the shape of the trajectory of retrans or reverse comp over the next 2 or 3 years, and maybe even as part of that, give us an update as to what you're annualizing on that either in '15 or on an annual basis. And then for Bob, just on acquisitions, when Disney first made the acquisition of Maker Studios, you said that you saw it, first and foremost, as a distribution platform. And at a high level, I'm just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on vertical integration -- or your updated thoughts, particularly vertical integration in digital. How does a more vertically integrated acquisition like Maker compare strategically for you to more horizontal acquisition in content like Lucas or Marvel?"

On the overall Broadcast business, I think that we've been saying for many, many years that our play in this business is to be the creator and owner of great shows. And those shows pay back in the aftermarket when we sell them either to other networks into syndication or increasingly sell them to other distributors. And that's what you're seeing in our Broadcast results this quarter. It is exactly strategically where we want to be in this business. And the fact that we have shows on the network today that are being incredibly well received have legs and are rating well is a very good indication for where we can be in this business."

And what",444,"To respond to the question about vertical versus horizontal acquisitions and Maker, first of all, Maker's results in terms of consumption, a number of videos streamed since the time that we bought them has been up substantially, just huge growth. And what that tells us is really what our instinct was when we bought them, and that is that we were really interested in and compelled by substantial increase in consumption of short-form video and digital platforms. We had consumption of short-form video on our own digital platforms like ESPN.com, disney.com, ABC. But we didn't have the kind of traction or the kind of traffic that Maker had. And we thought this would be a great opportunity for us to distribute much more effectively in the short form -- in short form. It also was entrée into a world of creativity that we thought we could tap into, particularly when we allowed those that are creating in that space access to our franchises and our brands. It was kind of a combination of things. It was just distribution expertise that we did not have as much as we thought we should, and certainly, production and creative expertise that we thought we could use. And it was, I think, a unique acquisition opportunity for us again given all the growth in short-form consumption. I don't think it necessarily suggests the direction in terms of where we're heading as a company overall. The power of this company largely is in its brands, its storytelling and creativity that runs across platforms and is often distributed by third parties, whether they are movie theater owners, big box retailers or MVPDs, to name a few, or new platforms like Netflix and Amazon and Hulu. So I think the primary thrust of the company is going to continue to be investing in its brands and its creativity and selling as broadly as we possibly can, but we like being in new spaces as well. And one last thing, because I think this is going to loom larger and larger in terms of Disney's future, and we touched upon it a little bit earlier today, is that I think this company needs to focus more on creating a tighter or a closer relationship to its customers for a variety of reasons, not only to mine customer data and usage and obviously create revenue opportunities from that but to provide customers with experiences that they want and demand basically to be even more user-friendly, more customizable, more personalized. That's really important in terms of the long-term future of this company, and you'll see various initiatives that are aimed at achieving just that."

We obviously were embarking on a very large, fairly complicated project, one of the largest we've ever engaged in, probably one of the largest ever in China. After we opened, we decided that the opportunity existed in China and specifically in Shanghai to build something even bigger with more tractions and basically more capacity so that we could handle more guests. And so not only did we design but we agreed with our partners to build approximately $800 million more in capacity, which obviously added to the scale of what we're building. So now that we are well into construction and we released a great photo today of the Disneyland Hotel, which gives you an idea how far along we are, we believe that targeting the -- not the spring, actually, it was more than targeting, we plan to open in the spring of 2016, is much more opportune for us given the size of what we are doing -- what we are building and the complexity of it and given the fact that the weather is better in the spring. And as you said, David, it is after the Chinese New Year where we expect there will be huge demand and it's been easier to open after that than right before. And I might have misspoken. I meant after we broke ground, we decided that we'll build larger, not after we open. And so we've got a great project unfolding. I was there the week before last, and every time I go, I'm just amazed at the scale of it and the variety and the uniqueness of this. And I continue to believe heavily in the opportunity that we've got to bring a great Disneyland experience to the most populous country in the world. And my enthusiasm has only grown for it, but because we're building something bigger and we like spring versus winter, then the spring of '16 it is. And we probably will be more specific about an opening date, I'm guessing, sometime in the middle of this year."

I'm very pleased to announce The Walt Disney Company had another incredibly strong quarter with diluted earnings per share up 23% to $1.27. These results were driven by solid performance across all of our businesses and once again demonstrate the strength of our brands and content and a proven franchise strategy that will drive long-term value.
And Frozen is a great example of this strategy. On March 13, along with Cinderella, we're premiering a new 7-minute short Frozen Fever, bringing back all the beloved characters and voices and introducing a great new song. This time last year, we were excited about the box office success of Frozen, which went on to win the Oscar and become the highest-grossing animated feature of all time. Now a full year after its release, we're seeing the true impact of Frozen across our entire company. 
Overall, retail toy sales in North America were up 4% in 2014. And according to a leading market research firm, much of the credit for that growth belongs to Frozen, which was both the biggest and fastest-growing toy property of the year. It's also enormously popular in our Parks and Resorts. It's showcased in a successful mobile game, and it gave a significant boost to our home entertainment business for the quarter along with Maleficent and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. And Frozen is just 1 of the 11 franchises at Disney currently driving more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales. The strong holiday demand for Frozen as well as Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man and Avengers led to the most successful quarter ever for Disney Consumer Products. 
Among media companies, Disney stands out. No one else comes close to our unparalleled collection of strong brands, where our pipeline of great content and our unprecedented ability to leverage creative success and create value across the entire company allows us to adapt to emerging challenges, take advantage of new opportunities and, most importantly, innovate for the future. 
For example, who else but ESPN, who launched the first-ever College Football Playoffs with such enormous and immediate success. The 2 semifinals and the national championship broke previous records to become the 3 most-watched telecasts in the history of cable television, an achievement that speaks to the tremendous potential of this annual event and further strengthens ESPN's undisputed position as the #1 sports brand. 
Our studio is obviously a key franchise driver, and we have a strong slate of upcoming movies. We started the fiscal year with Disney Animation's Big Hero 6, which has already generated just under $500 million in global box office. It's also been #1 in Japan for 5 weeks and is yet to open in some key markets. And Into the Woods has been both acclaimed by critics and embraced by audiences. 
As I said, next month, one of our most beloved and iconic characters comes to life in Disney's first-ever live-action Cinderella. It's a fresh look in this classic story, and it's also a stunningly beautiful film. 
Later in the spring, we're looking forward to an original Disney adventure called Tomorrowland starring George Clooney and directed by Brad Bird. 
As every Marvel fan knows, the highly anticipated adventure sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, opens in May. And when the first trailer was released in November, fans viewed it more than 34 million times in just 24 hours. The speed and magnitude of that reaction certainly speaks to the incredible excitement around Avengers. 
Ant Man debuts in July, bringing another great character to the screen with Marvel's trademark blend of action, humor and heart. 
We're also thrilled to have 2 original Pixar movies on the way this year. In June, Inside Out will give audiences an all-access pass into the mind of an 11 year-old girl. And at Thanksgiving, The Good Dinosaur takes a humorous look at what the world would be like if the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs had actually missed. 
Of course, for millions of Star Wars fans, the first 11 months of this year will be an exciting countdown to the December 18 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. There's a strong emotional connection to this franchise that transcends geography and generations, and the brief teaser trailer released last November has been viewed more than 123 million times. Having been on the set and seen most of the footage, I can definitely say their excitement is justified. It marks the beginning of a new era of exceptional Star Wars storytelling as well as an opportunity for continued growth across all of our businesses. 
As a truly global company, we've talked a lot about the importance of developing local content, and the success of the film PK in India is a perfect example. It's now India's highest-grossing movie of all time with almost $107 million in global box office. It's also Bollywood's most successful movie ever. Coproduced and released by our Indian subsidiary, UTV, PK will soon be on 3,500 screens across China. 
This is also a dynamic and exciting time for our Parks and Resorts with another very strong performance in Q1 and plenty to look forward to, including the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort. I was in China the week before last and saw amazing progress. We just topped off our signature Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, and we're nearing completion on iconic features throughout the park, including the largest castle we've ever built. And we're getting ready to start casting hundreds of performers we'll need to entertain our guests. It's thrilling to see Shanghai Disney Resort rapidly coming to life. The artistry, complexity and magnitude of the detail, it's all quite astonishing.
As you recall, after we broke ground on this incredible resort, we announced an $800 million expansion, significantly increasing both the size of the park and the number of attractions available to our guests on opening day. Even with that expansion, we will complete major construction by the end of this calendar year, and we're planning a spectacular grand opening in the spring of 2016, which we believe is the optimal time to showcase the full grandeur of this world-class destination. 
Obviously, we're proud of our performance and our record of creating significant value for our company and our shareholders, and we're very optimistic about our future. 
And now I'm going to turn the call over to Jay to take you through the details of our Q1 performance, and then we'll take questions. Jay?"

Fiscal 2015 is off to a great start as we delivered another strong quarter of financial results. 
Earnings per share were up 23% driven by record revenue, up 9% over last year, and 17% growth in segment operating income. The results this quarter, which I'll go over with more detail in a moment, are further evidence that our strategy of investing in high-quality content drives significant long-term value across our businesses. 
At Consumer Products, our broad content portfolio fueled incredibly strong financial results. Segment operating income was up 46% on revenue growth of 22%. Margins expanded by 720 basis points, reflecting strength in both our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses. 
Growth in Licensing was driven by Frozen, and to a lesser extent, Disney Channel properties, Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man and Avengers, partly offset by a higher revenue share with the studio. On a comparable basis, earned Licensing revenue in the first quarter was up an impressive 23% over last year, which is particularly notable given the size of our Licensing business. 
Higher results in our Retail business were primarily due to the continued demand for Frozen merchandise, which drove double-digit growth in same-store sales in North America, Europe and Japan as well as higher online sales in those regions. 
At the studio, the success of our fiscal 2014 theatrical slate continued to drive financial benefits in the first quarter. Operating income was up 33% over last year due to increases in home entertainment, higher revenue share of Consumer Products and an increase in television distribution. While we were very pleased with the worldwide box office performance of Big Hero 6, theatrical results were lower in the first quarter, reflecting a record-breaking performance of Frozen last year. 
The increase in home entertainment was primarily driven by higher unit sales of Guardians of the Galaxy, Frozen and Maleficent compared to Monsters University and The Lone Ranger in Q1 last year. The increase in television distribution in the first quarter was due to better performance of Q1 titles, including The Avengers, Captain America 2 and Frozen compared to last year's titles. 
The studio recognized a higher revenue share from Consumer Products in the first quarter due to strong sales of Frozen merchandise. 
The Parks and Resorts segment had another great quarter. Operating income was up 20% on revenue growth of 9% due to continued strength at our domestic operations. Despite lower results at our international operations, total segment margins were up 190 basis points with major new initiatives accounting for 80 basis points of the year-over-year increase. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our recent major investments because they have contributed nicely to the robust growth of the domestic-based business. In the first quarter, growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs. 
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 7% with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort each setting an all-time attendance record for any quarter. Per capita spending in our domestic parks was up 4% on higher ticket prices, merchandise, and food and beverage spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 8 percentage points to 89%, and per-room spending was up 4%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are up 4%. 
Turning to Media Networks. Segment revenue was up 11%, and operating income was up 3% as higher results at Broadcasting were partially offset by lower results at cable due primarily to higher programming and production costs at ESPN. 
Broadcasting operating income increased 35% driven by higher affiliate revenue and higher program sales, partially offset by lower ad revenue. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as higher rates in new affiliate agreements. 
Program sales were up in the first quarter due to sales of ABC Studio shows, including Criminal Minds, Scandal and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the network was down in the quarter as a result of fewer primetime units sold, partially offset by higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 10% above upfront levels. 
Cable segment results were down modestly as lower operating income at ESPN was partially offset by increases at worldwide Disney Channels and ABC Family. Lower results at ESPN were primarily due to higher programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, higher marketing costs related to the College Football Playoff and the launch of the SEC Network. This quarter's results reflect ESPN's continued investment in what is already the deepest and broadest portfolio of sports rights. 
As a result, programming and production expenses were up mid-teens percent during the first quarter due to higher expenses for NFL rights, and this is the first year of ESPN's new 8-year contract and additional sports rights for the SEC Network. 
As we discussed in the past, we expect growth in cable programming costs to be in the low teens, and that increase will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect cable programming costs to be up about 25% in the first half of the fiscal year and relatively flat in the second half. The cost increase this quarter and what we expect in Q2 are consistent with the first half and full year outlook. 
ESPN has long-term agreements in place for the most valuable sports rights. While the first year of new contracts may result in above-trend cost increases and adversely affect results in the short term, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow ESPN over the long term. 
During the first quarter, we entered into a major affiliate distribution deal, marking the completion of new agreements with our 10 largest affiliate partners. Due to contractual provisions in ESPN's new affiliate agreements, ESPN will no longer defer a portion of its affiliate revenue for most of its contracts as was previously the case. 
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 20% in the quarter, reflecting the benefits of new affiliate agreements, lower deferred revenue at ESPN and the launch of the SEC Network. The 20% increase in affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $136 million as ESPN deferred $136 million in affiliate revenue in Q1 last year compared to no deferred affiliate revenue in Q1 this year. Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenues at ESPN, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double digits, and revenue at ESPN was down 2% in the first quarter. 
While total day ratings were up, ad revenue was lower as ratings for certain key programs were down compared to last year, partially offset by higher rates. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales were pacing up 18% on the strength of the first College Football Playoff, which aired last month. 
The increase at Worldwide Disney Channels was due to higher affiliate revenue at the domestic channel and higher advertising revenue at international channels, partially offset by higher programming costs. The increase at ABC Family was driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenues, reflecting an increase in units sold. 
At Interactive, operating income increased 36% in the quarter, driven by higher results from our global games business due to the continued success of Tsum Tsum as well as lower product development costs, partially offset by lower results at our console games business. Lower console game performance reflected higher per-unit costs driven by Disney Infinity, lower unit sales and higher marketing costs. The decrease in unit sales was driven by lower sales of catalog titles and Disney Infinity figures, partially offset by higher sales of Disney Infinity starter packs. 
We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation while investing for the long-term sustainable growth while returning meaningful capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased 15 million shares for about $1.3 billion and increased our dividend by 34% from $0.86 per share to $1.15 per share. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 15.5 million shares for about $1.4 billion. 
Overall, we feel great about this quarter. As we look across our businesses, there's a lot to be excited about in 2015 and beyond. But we are not taking anything for granted as we recognize we have a lot of work ahead of us. We believe the strength in our brands coupled with the integrated nature of our company can create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

Just to give you -- for instance, there were days during the holiday season where we were entertaining 250,000 guests at a time on property. And when you just consider how many guests you have to flow through the gates when the park opens in the morning, the fact that you have a band that enables you to basically walk right in, touch the band to a kiosk and keep going instead of handing a ticket to a cast member, making sure the ticket is right and then going in, that's obviously creating a huge improvement, meaning much quicker entrance into the park. And what this all adds up to is our ability to manage more people at a time without in any way diminishing guest experience.

Bob, your comments on Sling TV at not having data on the customers hit squarely on the question I wanted to ask you, which is with the broadband-only nonpay TV market growing in size, I would think it becomes ever more interesting for Disney to address that. And I think the default is to generally support the existing pay-TV bundle and highlight Hulu and Sling as dipping your toe in the water. But I was hoping you'd address whether there's a potentially superior business model for Disney to capture the distribution margin yourself benefit from dynamic advertising targeted, of course, and having that direct relationship with the consumer that you've been seeking. And I'll just throw Jay's question in there now as well. You've been asked a lot of questions on recent calls about ESPN's top line. I wanted to refocus on margin. So with the March 2015 quarter, the company is finishing long and expensive build-out of sports rights. It seems like the rest of the decade, you've only got a couple of tough quarters when the NBA hits. Are we thinking about that correctly, that even if ESPN revenue growth might moderate a bit, cost growth is also moderating? Any reason to think that margin shouldn't generally be flat to up going forward x those NBA quarters?"

And you're right, there are 12 million right now subscribers to broadband-only service. And that's the subscriber that we're trying to reach with this Sling -- or that DISH is trying to reach with this Sling package. And we believe that it's a worthwhile experiment or a worthy attempt to try to convince young people -- or younger people to sign up to cable when they either wouldn't have signed up for it at all or they might have waited, Michael's comment aside. There is definitely an opportunity not just for ESPN but for other Disney brands to ultimately put product in the marketplace that reach consumers directly. We think we have that opportunity with Disney-branded service. We may have an opportunity to bring out a Marvel-type product and possibly even Star Wars. But we also are mindful of the value of the expanded basic bundle to this company. And we do not believe that there is any reason for us to attempt to take out some of this product, particularly ESPN, quickly or right now. In other words, there's time. If we see that the market dynamics are changing in such a way that it's better for us as a company to take the product out directly and to not only improve our margins by taking out the middleman but to create a closer relationship with the consumer that can be mined for other revenue-generating purposes, then we'll do that. But we think if we were to do that now, it would be somewhat precipitous of us, and there doesn't seem to be any reason to be that way."

First of all, there are only a couple of bumps left, big upticks in the ESPN programming cost base over the next, let's call it, 4 or 5 years.

And the second big one down the road in '17 is the beginning of our new NBA deal. Other than those bumps, which as I said, one we're in the middle of, in fact, we gave you some guidance on cost this year that we would be experiencing very heavy ESPN programming costs in the first half of the year and much lighter in the second. I can tell you that those numbers looks like about 25% in the first half of the year and only a 1 -- flat to 1% increase in the second half of the year.

And then we've got Avengers in May, and then, of course, 2 Pixar films in calendar 2015, although we don't know that any one of them will drive significant Consumer Products, and then Star Wars, as you mentioned, Alexia, the end of the year. We're not going to predict whether there'll be a ramp-up of buying ahead of Star Wars except that we believe because of the strength of the franchise and the buzz around the movie, which we saw certainly was the case when we put the teaser trailer out just around Christmas time, that we're likely to see some buying in advance of the movie of Consumer Products. The other thing that I wanted to mention because we've talked a lot about Frozen, you didn't mention it, is that we're coming out on March 13, attached to Cinderella, with a 7-minute Frozen short that's just great. It has all the key players, both the voice talent and the character talent and -- or the characters and a great song.

And the lower unit sales can be attributed to a number of factors, and I think the combination is -- a combination of those factors had an impact on this quarter making the advertising sales numbers lower. And those are related to the length of the show, how the shows are written, the number of promotional spots we put in the shows as opposed to sold spots, the number of ads we insert into the programs and how we use inventory in the quarter to manage our make-good liability. And that -- those all combined to deliver notwithstanding the ratings we had, the relative ratings we had this season to slightly depress our advertising revenue. But I think ABC is extremely well positioned this year relative to its peers. We expect a tightening of inventory as the year progresses.

And then the second follow-up, Jay, if you could just remind us how you're thinking about leverage with all the growth in EBITDA and cash flow. I don't think you've issued much debt lately. So just remind us how you think about leverage as you move through the year."

We have a fair amount of design and development work going on right now to greatly increase -- this is no surprise, Star Wars presence in multiple locations around the world. And we'll have more details probably about that later on in 2015. The plans are ambitious, and so it's going to take some time for them to actually be built and open. But let's just say that we've got big plans for it and 
[Audio Gap] 
Hong Kong and at Shanghai. Obviously, Shanghai has yet to open. So maybe it would sound somewhat premature. But the size of the land that we have there, the expansion opportunities in a market that we think is just perfect for the Disneyland experience suggests that, once we open, it's just the beginning in terms [indiscernible] variety of offerings that we'll be able to provide. And then, of course, [indiscernible] to, well, the franchise that we talked about earlier, which is Frozen. But I think that actually says a lot about other franchises, too. There are clearly more opportunities to mine some of these great franchises across the parks. And when you go to Imagineering there's an embarrassment of riches, so to speak, in terms of stories and characters that the Imagineers have to draw from to create great park experiences. And I think one of the things that we're seeing now in our parks and one of the reasons why the results were so strong across the board -- Christmas time, is that there is definitely a halo effect that consumers have for Disney based on all of these franchises. And it's not just what exists in the parks. I think you have to include Marvel and you have to include Star Wars as well. The brand's strength has never been stronger. The array of franchises has never been greater. We said we've got 11 franchises that are going to generate $1 billion this year in retail sales. And that just, I think, results in an enthusiasm for the brand and an enthusiasm for the park experience that we provide. It gives us not only ample opportunities to create from all of that but for consumers to basically engage with us in more ways and more places than ever before."

So I think in general, I don't expect -- you shouldn't expect a radical change in that strategy. It doesn't mean we won't be in the debt markets this year, but I would expect that you'll continue to see a balance sheet that reflects kind of the strategic use of not being -- strategic positioning of not being over-leveraged on the operation of our company and our ability to go to the capital markets."

So look, I don't think that we can underestimate the impact that Frozen has had across our company and in all of our businesses, but I don't think it would be right to take from that the implication that even our Consumer Products business was overly dominated by the Frozen franchise this quarter. You asked whether we think Frozen has -- to put words in your mouth, do we think Frozen has legs. We absolutely believe that this is the beginning of a long-term franchise for the company, and that will reflect itself in all of our divisions, Consumer Products certainly not the least of which. But even if you look at the last quarter, many other franchisors -- franchises were contributors to the success of the Consumer Products division. By the way, not the least of which was Mickey and Minnie, the Disney Channel franchises. And we like what Frozen delivered. But it's not -- it's certainly not the one and only for us. We have 11 franchises that now retail at over $1 billion as of the last year. So our Consumer Products business really has a lot of breadth in addition to depth, and we're only beginning this year to see what the Avengers and overall Marvel franchises are going to deliver, which is -- has also been a huge contributor. And I think if you look down the road, you can imagine that we'll be adding Star Wars to that pantheon in a very, very significant way with the release of that film. so it's a broad-based business, and I think that Frozen will continue to play a big part in it. But I wouldn't make the mistake of thinking that it is a dominant force that you have to worry about repeating year-on-year in the Consumer Products business. In terms of margin, obviously, the Licensing business is incredibly highly leveraged. But I think the real margin story for this past quarter has been the Disney stores business, where we saw increases both in the physical brick-and-mortar stores in all of the 3 regions we operate, which is Japan, Europe and North America, as well as the online business in those 3 regions. So we've -- I would venture to say, and I think I'm right about this, we had historic margins in that business this past quarter, and it was a big contributor to the margin story for Consumer Products.

So I don't have any big news for you. Our dividend is almost $2 billion that we paid out in quarter 2. And I think you have to look at return to -- capital return to shareholders in aggregate, which is the way we think about it. Your second question on arrivals. So I don't think that we know or have seen an impact on international arrivals due to exchange rates. I've said for many, many quarters, the overall range of our international business is between 18% and 22% of total attendance at our domestic parks. Q1 is usually on the low end of that range. It was again on the low end of that range this year. And I think that if there's going to be an effect of the varying exchange rates around the world, it'll take a while. And if those exchange rates affect the economies from which our international business is sourced, we might see an impact, but as of yet, we have not seen that. And actually, quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year, there wasn't a huge change in our international business between fiscal '14 and fiscal '15."

And at a high level, I'm just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on vertical integration -- or your updated thoughts, particularly vertical integration in digital.

We will be there comfortably, but I'm not going to update any further than that. On the overall Broadcast business, I think that we've been saying for many, many years that our play in this business is to be the creator and owner of great shows. And those shows pay back in the aftermarket when we sell them either to other networks into syndication or increasingly sell them to other distributors. And that's what you're seeing in our Broadcast results this quarter. It is exactly strategically where we want to be in this business. And the fact that we have shows on the network today that are being incredibly well received, have legs and are rating well is a very good indication for where we can be in this business."

And wh",446,"To respond to the question about vertical versus horizontal acquisitions and Maker, first of all, Maker's results in terms of consumption, the number of videos streamed since the time that we bought them has been up substantially, just huge growth. And what that tells us is really what our instinct was when we bought them, and that is that we were really interested in and compelled by substantial increase in consumption of short-form video and digital platforms. We had consumption of short-form video on our own digital platforms like ESPN.com, disney.com, ABC. But we didn't have the kind of traction or the kind of traffic that Maker had. And we thought this would be a great opportunity for us to distribute much more effectively in the short form -- in short form. It also was entrée into a world of creativity that we thought we could tap into, particularly when we allowed those that are creating in that space access to our franchises and our brands. It was kind of a combination of things. It was just distribution expertise that we did not have as much as we thought we should, and certainly, production and creative expertise that we thought we could use. And it was, I think, a unique acquisition opportunity for us again given all the growth in short-form consumption. I don't think it necessarily suggests a direction in terms of where we're heading as a company overall. The power of this company largely is in its brands, its storytelling and the creativity that runs cross-platforms and is often distributed by third parties, whether they are movie theater owners, big box retailers or MVPDs, to name a few, or new platforms like Netflix and Amazon and Hulu. So I think the primary thrust of the company is going to continue to be investing in its brands and its creativity and selling as broadly as we possibly can, but we like being in new space as well. And one last thing, because I think this is going to loom larger and larger in terms of Disney's future, and we touched upon it a little bit earlier today, is that I think this company needs to focus more on creating a tighter or a closer relationship to its customers for a variety of reasons, not only to mine customer data and usage and obviously create revenue opportunities from that but to provide customers with experiences that they want and demand basically to be even more user friendly, more customizable, more personalized. That's really important in terms of the long-term future of this company and you'll see in various initiatives that are aimed at achieving just that."

We obviously were embarking on a very large, fairly complicated project, one of the largest we've ever engaged in, probably one of the largest ever in China. After we opened, we decided that the opportunity existed in China and specifically in Shanghai to build something even bigger with more attractions and basically more capacity so that we could handle more guests. And so not only did we design but we agreed with our partners to build approximately $800 million more in capacity, which obviously added to the scale of what we're building. So now that we are well into construction and we released a great photo today of the Disneyland Hotel, which gives you an idea how far along we are, we believe that targeting the -- not the spring, actually, it was more than targeting, we plan to open in the spring of 2016, is much more opportune for us given the size of what we are doing -- what we are building and the complexity of it and given the fact that the weather is better in the spring. And as you said, David, it is after the Chinese New Year where we expect there will be huge demand and it's been easier to open after that than right before. And I might have misspoken. I meant after we broke ground, we decided that we'll build larger, not after we open. And so we've got a great project unfolding. I was there the week before last, and every time I go, I'm just amazed at the scale of it and the variety and the uniqueness of this. And I continue to believe heavily in the opportunity that we've got to bring a great Disneyland experience to the most populous country in the world. And my enthusiasm has only grown for it, but because we're building something bigger and we like spring versus winter, then the spring of '16 it is. And we probably will be more specific about an opening date, I'm guessing, sometime in the middle of this year."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your flexibility and your understanding. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter Q2, with adjusted EPS of $1.23, up 11% over the prior year. Our results once again reflect the strength of our brands and the quality of our content. These key elements are evident with the nominal opening of Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron, released in about 70% of international market so far. The movie opened #1 in every single market and in the process broke a number of box office records. As of this morning, the movie has surpassed $650 million in global box office, which speaks to the popularity of these characters, the enduring connection that millions of people have with them. In fact, the 3 top movies with the highest grossing opening weekends of all time :Marvel's Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3. Of course, when it comes to franchises that inspire tremendous fan devotion, Star Wars certainly sets the standard. We unveiled the second teaser trailer for the Star Wars: The Force Awakens a couple of weeks ago, and the reaction was unprecedented. The excitement around this movie is unlike anything we've ever seen before. The new trailer had more than 88 million news in the first 24 hours, and now has more than 200 million views to date. So that gives you some sense of the tremendous interest and excitement around this film, which is only intensify when we get closer to the December 18 release date.

With my move back to a corporate well, we're pleased to have Bob running Parks and Resorts. He's been working his way around the world to get an in-depth understanding of the business takes off to a great start continued with continued strong performance. Later this month he'll help us officially kick off the celebration of Disneyland's 60th anniversary. The park that started it all and we plan to market this historic milestone in true Disney style, including a fantastic new parade, the new World of Color show, a new firework spectacular among other features.
Looking ahead, we have plenty of reason for excitement across the entire company, starting with incomparable slate of upcoming movies. In addition to the one that Bob mentioned, We also have Disney's Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney, in theaters later this month. Paul Rudd takes on the role of Marvel's Ant-Man in July. We're. We are also thrilled to have 2 new Pixar movies coming to theaters this year. Inside Out opens on June 19. It's also already generating a lot of [indiscernible] and excitement. And we're looking forward to even more great Pixar story telling when the Good Dinosaur opens at Thanksgiving.
Our Media Networks group, home of some of the strongest brands and content in the business, which consistently drives demand and value in the market. ESPN continues to invest extraordinary programming and innovation to super serves sport fans. In Q2 this unparalleled sports coverage drove double-digit audience growth on ESPN, ESPN2, and the total average audience across ESPN's compelling suite of sports networks was up 9% for the quarter. 
On the Broadcast side, ABC has 7 of the top 20 series this season, including 3 of the top 5 dramas. And it's also achieved greater growth with key primetime audience of adults 18 to 49 than any other major network. In the recent survey, media buyers and [indiscernible] identified ABC as the network having the most impressive year. A good sign as the network kicks off the upfront sale season next week.
We're also extremely pleased with the instant success of Daredevil, the first of 4 live action series produced for Netflix by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, which further demonstrates the power, breadth and value of the Marvel universe. Just 2 weeks after the first 13 episodes launched great acclaim and strong demand, Netflix [indiscernible] to second season. This initial success bodes well for the 3 other upcoming serialized programs for Netflix: Marvel's Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage, as well as planned mini series event uniting all these characters with a shared story line. 
Our Consumer Products business also had a great quarter, driven by the continued popularity of our strong franchises, especially Frozen and Avengers. Retail sales for Frozen merchandise so far this year were more than 10x higher than the same period last year. And sales of new merchandise for Avengers: Age of Ultron indicate a strong global demand. We expect the release of The Force Awakens to accelerate growth of the Star Wars franchise. As we just announced we're planning global event at September 4 to launch new merchandise inspired by the upcoming movie, with 3 jedis [ph] around the world and online kicking off sales at midnight with unique celebrations of all things Star Wars.
We're also very excited about the November release of Star Wars Battle Front, with incredible new action title from EA for core gamers based on epic Star Wars battles set new landscapes featured in The Force Awakens. This game, and other upcoming initiatives, demonstrates Star Wars, like Marvel, represents that the storytelling universe cut across platforms and mediums throughout our businesses and a profound effect on our growth and profitability for years to come. Obviously we have a lot to look forward to throughout the rest of this year and beyond. 
We're pleased with our results in Q2 and remain confident that our proven strategies continue to drive value and opportunity well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay to walk you through the details of the quarter."
191564,288890151,804091,"The Walt Disney Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Second quarter earnings per share adjusted for items affecting comparability, were up a solid 11% driven by a 7% increase in revenue.

Second quarter earnings per share adjusted for items affecting comparability, were up a solid 11% driven by a 7% increase in revenue. Media Networks revenue was up 13% and operating income was down 2% as lower operating income at Cable more than offsets strong results at Broadcasting.
At Cable, while total revenue was up 11% due to strong growth in affiliate and advertising revenues, operating income was down 9%. This decline was driven by higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to the College Football Playoff and NFL Wildcard Game at the SEC Network. As you know, fiscal 2015 is the first year of the new College Football Playoff, and the first time ESPN had aired an NFL Wildcard Game. So as we expected, cable programming and production costs were up significantly in the second quarter. We continue to expect relatively flat programming and production costs in the second half of the year, so our full year outlook is unchanged. We still expect programming and production costs to be up low teen percentage points for fiscal 2015.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low-double digits in Q2, benefiting from contractual rate increases, the SEC network and lower deferred affiliate revenue at ESPN. The increase in domestic cable affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of about [ph] $40 million and ESPN did not defer any affiliate revenue in the second quarter this year compared to $40 million in Q2 last year. Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenue, domestic cable affiliate revenue was still up 10%.
And just to remind you, ESPN didn't defer any revenue during either Q1 or Q2, resulting in an aggregate year-over-year affiliate revenue benefit of $176 million for the first half of the year compared to the prior year. This benefit will be reversed during Q3, which means ESPN will recognize $176 million less deferred revenue in Q3 compared to last year. And for those of you who have followed us for many years, you will be happy to know that Q3 will be the last quarter in which we need to discuss programming covenants and their impact on revenue recognition. Due to contractual provisions of ESPN's new affiliate agreements, ESPN is no longer required to defer a portion of its affiliate revenue.
Turning to advertising. ESPN ad revenue was up 18% in the second quarter due to higher rates and increase in unit sold. Ad revenue at ESPN benefited from the strong interest in first-ever College Football Playoffs and our NFL Wildcard Playoff Game. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales were phasing down a few percentage points compared to prior year. Now keep in mind that ad revenue in Q3 of last year benefited from the World Cup.
Broadcasting operating income increased 90%, driven by an increase in affiliate revenue. Higher program sales and an increase in ad revenue, partially offset by higher marketing costs at ABC Network. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as new contracts. Program sales were up in the second quarter driven by the sale of Marvel's Daredevil and by higher sales of ABC studio shows, including Lost and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up mid-single digits in the quarter as a result of higher primetime ratings and higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the network is running low-single digits above upfront levels.
At Parks and Results, operating income was up 24% on revenue growth of 6% due to higher results at our domestic operations, which were partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Total segment margins were up 230 [ph] basis points.
During the second quarter, growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic markets. Sales of vacation club units at Disney's Polynesian Villas and Bungalows and higher pricing at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs. For the quarter, [indiscernible] domestic parks was up 2% and per capita spending was up to 7% on higher ticket prices and an increase in spending on food and beverage merchandise.
Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 2.5 percentage points to 89% and per-room spending was up 6%.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are phasing up 7% compared to prior year levels while book rates are up 2%.
At Studio Entertainment, revenue and operating income were down in the second quarter, given very difficult comps due to the impact of Frozen in the prior year. We continue to be very pleased to the performance of the studio slate as Q2 was one of the best quarters in the studio's history. Lower operating income at the studio was driven by decreases in domestic home entertainment and international theatrical distribution, both of which reflect the record-breaking performance of Frozen in the prior year compared to Big Hero 6 this year, partially offset by higher revenue share from Consumer Products. Consumer Products segment operating income was up 32% on revenue growth of 10%, which is net of Consumer Products revenue share for studio. Margins were up over 600 basis point in Q2, reflecting continued strength in Merchandise Licensing, which was driven by Frozen and to a lesser extent, Avengers. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the second quarter was up 23% over last year, which underscores the strength, depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio.
At interactive, higher operating income in the second quarter was due to lower marketing and product and development costs, driven by fewer titles in development and higher results from our mobile games business, which continues to benefit from the success of Tsum Tsum. These increases were partially offset by lower performance of Infinity.
During the second quarter, we returned an aggregate $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders, consisting of $485 million for share buyback and a dividend of close to $2 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we've returned about $3.9 billion to our shareholders via dividends and buybacks including roughly $2 billion per share of repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell. We'll be happy to take questions."

As you'd expect, when we look at these new offerings, we look at a couple of factors, namely, do they have strategic value to the company? And are they beneficial to us financially? We also like to analyze the packages in terms of what we believe they offer customers because we happen to believe that navigation has become really critical. On that note, by the way, the reason we like the navigation is the better the navigation, usually, the better the consumption. Poor navigation usually leads to less consumption. In the Verizon case, we were simply asking them to adhere to the contract that they had negotiated with us. In general as it relates to skinny packages, we've been, for the most part, at the forefront of offering consumers more choice because we happen to think that we've entered into an era where the consumer has more authority, and therefore, is going to demand more flexibility and more customization. But it's also clear that price value relationship is important. Consumers still want a lot of choice at the right price. Slink's case was mostly of interest to us because their strategy was to go after the roughly 12 million broadband-only households in the United States, with a skinny or a less expensive package, so we thought there was value there from a strategic and financial perspective. In the Sony case, I don't have to get into many details, but simply put, it wasn't to our advantage financially. But again, overall, we think the new entrants into the distribution marketplace, good for us. I will say that I have not seen many so-called skinny packages except for the sling package that I think is particularly attractive to consumers in terms of the price-to-value relationships. And I think the last thing that needs to be said is, and I know that some of you have written about this, is that when you unbundle, particularly your broadband service, there are going to be hidden costs, or there are hidden costs. For instance, you buy an expanded basic bundle, you get broadband with it. You buy a skinny package you have to pay extra for broadband, and that cost goes up substantially. So I think one of the questions that is yet to be answered is what savings -- or how large does the savings have to be for the consumer to essentially abandon the expanded basic package and the choice that if it gives for some less expensive package with far less choice. And are there other costs ramifications like the ones that I just cited. The jury a lot of this. No question that there are changes going on in the media landscape although we do not see a disturbing trend as it relates to the expanded basic bundle. And we're going to continue to evaluate these things based on the criteria I just mentioned."

We've got roughly half of our guests now are in the parks with MagicBands and the response from those guests has been overwhelmingly positive. So we very pleased with that. My MagicBands -- or MyMagic+ as a driver going forward I think is -- it will still be a factor but perhaps not with great an impact as we've seen just in this quarter. Again, as it becomes even more integrated into the basic experience. Looking forward, I think that we're most excited about what we see in terms of the prospects outside the United States, and the -- with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next year and that should drive growth well into the future. Having said that though, we saw strong international attendance this year. Domestic parks is no question that those results have been strong. And the top line growth, coupled with that group close money in the expense line has resulted in strong growth, and we hope to see our results continue there."

I think first of all, you have to understand that this is already a very strong franchise, but a film has not been released in 10 years. And so first of all, while we're not treating this as something that is brand new, we're mindful of the fact that there's a whole generation of people out there that were not as deeply of the Star Wars lore, and not as in effect in love with a franchise as an older generation. So we're -- and there are markets around the world that weren't as developed back 10 years ago and beyond that. China is probably the best example. It's now the #2 movie market in the world. Obviously when the last Star Wars film released, it was barely a market from a movie perspective. We are managing all this with great care as well in that while we are mindful of the fact that we need to market this and go after this new generation and new territories, we also want to be careful that the demand does not create almost too much in the marketplace too soon. And so everything that we have done to date has been extremely deliver deliberate, and we have an extremely carefully constructed and deliberate plan going forward in terms of what we roll out in the marketplace, both in terms of product and in terms of market. As a release of the 6 films digitally is probably a good example of that, we did that in April to at least make it available for the first time on a digital platform on a worldwide basis, and that's been, I think, helpful. We've already got some increased product in the marketplace, but the real ramp-up from a Consumer Products perspective won't come just until just a few months prior to the release. We have already talked about some games that will come into the marketplace. EA had an announcement in Star Wars' celebration for instance. You can expect that they'll will be more game-related activity between now and the release. And then I think generally speaking, you're going to see us release in a very, very careful way certain elements of the film as part of a marketing -- a very carefully designed marketing plan, again, as we get much closer to the film. I will say we've been overwhelmed with interest. We knew when we purchased this that there was great interest in value. But so far, it has well-exceeded our expectations. The reaction to be 2 teaser trailers is I think one example of that, over 80 million hits on this last teaser trailer in 24 hours, and hundreds of millions since. Quite amazing. We're pleased with what we've seen so far in the film, and we can't wait to show it to the world. I think we've got something here that is very, very special that's going to create value for the company for many, many years to come across the world. Two other things I want to mention is we have 3 films that are going to come into the marketplace between now and May of '17. Star Wars 7 The Force Awakens in December, Rogue 1, a standalone film a year later, and then May of '17, we're going to have Star Wars 8, and all 3 are in varying stages of development and production. And then Tom mentioned Parks and Resorts. We've got a huge opportunity there. We've had single attractions, Star Tours in multiple places around the world that remain successful and some Jedi training academy related shows here and there. But the opportunity here in the United States and in other places around the world is tremendous. And we're doing some development work on it. But over time, it has great potential there too."

And we know that there's still treatment a traditional approach to this, and that is still greatest interest in the 18 to 49 audience and to a lesser extent, 25 to 54, great interest in women 18 to 49 and probably going interest in people 18 to 34. We do know that I'll call it secondary viewing, which is either viewing on the DVR or an SVOD is increasing. And ABC is doing extremely well in that category with shows that seem to be performing both in the SVOD and in the DVR playback world in multiple shows, for instance. And by the way, ABC had a good season this season. They were the only network that was up and well, that's due to adding new shows to the schedule like a Blackish and How to Get Away with Murder and Fresh Off the Boat, for instance. So they've had a decent season. We're also mindful of the fact that addressable advertising is going to grow and the ability to create opportunities for advertisers to reach consumers in a more specifically designed way is only going to grow. And they're also going to continue to emphasize the output of their own studio. We've been very successful in putting more ABC own shows on the network. That should be the case in this of the scheduling season as well, and we have the ability as a company to create programs for television platforms. I think the Netflix Marvel deal was a great example of that. So as we look at the television environment, we think the network's well-positioned. We think the growth in, what I'll call, new media, is only going to continue and we're going to take advantage of that. And generally speaking, we think the advertising or the upfront is going to be just fine for our network and for our company. The last thing I want to say is that there's no question that we're seeing a new advertising reality here, because many definitely has migrated out of traditional media into new media, which is one of the reasons why we've shown such an interest in new media. And the last thing I'll say is as a company, about 16% of our revenue this year is advertising generated. So it's still a substantial amount of money, but our exposure to these changes is less than a lot of the other media companies."

It's a follow-up really on Michael's earlier question. And I'd put it in your context of, I think Disney has embraced rather than fought change in the evolving ecosystem about as much as it possibly could, pretty much every step of the way over the past decade. So we have hopefully been one of those people who have done some analysis on that lighter OTP bundle. And if you assume that cost had some relationship with value added to the consumer, the vast majority of value in a product like Sling is really coming from a Disney bundle, probably more specifically ESPN. So when you think about it, the way we look at it, Disney really has the ability to mirror the general entertainment content, in the same level contained in Sling, outside the ESPN product, we think you could probably replicate what's in sling. So if that goes well, why would you launch your own Direct-To-Consumer product. If the idea is to target broadband-only homes, you could sort of do that yourself, you could build the best interface.

They've already spent significant amount of money and capital to create their platforms and they managed the relationship with the consumer, whether it's billing or technology or whatever, fairly effectively. And so they create value for us. And they also help us market. So I think there's a balance here. And I think what I'm saying is that as long as the current distribution ecosystem or the one that seems to be emerging continues to create value for us, then we'll rely on it to distribute our product when we believe that our opportunity to distribute directly is bigger than or better than the opportunity for others to distribute, then we're going into that business more aggressively. And I don't think any of the company is positioned as well as we are to do that because of the strength of those plans. l thought your analysis, by the way, David, was really well done. I read most of it. It was lengthy, by the way. But I thought it was really well done, provocative in some cases and actually, the comment that I meant earlier about unbundling broadband, I actually got from that analysis. So I appreciate it. I think we're entering into a pretty interesting world where technology is, for the most part, a friend of high-quality media, because it's going to give us more opportunities to reach customers either directly or through third parties. So we're viewing this as kind of a new world order in many ways because of, I think, the impact of technology on media, but one that is going to be very beneficial for this company."

Bob, I'm curious on your thoughts on virtual MVPDs and how you think about their influence in the ecosystem longer term in one particular regard. So Sony View and Apple TV could run their virtual bundles at little to no margins as a sort of user software to drive their core hardware business. So the good news is they could pay you more and charge consumers less for the same bundle. Longer-term though, they're not running those businesses for profit, because their long-term interests diverge from programmers and with a Sony or Apple game negotiate and leverage over programmers that traditional distributors have not had recently? So I know it's early days but you're always very forward thinking on the digital stuff. And for Tom and Jay, the Star Wars franchise and Shanghai Disneyland both being difficult to forecast, at least not finding them to be difficult.

And whether they run them as loss leaders or not, I don't think that really has much of an impact on us. And I think that generally, new entrants into the marketplace are going to create new opportunities, either because they attract more consumers or they offer an experience to consumer a price-to-value relationship that's more attractive than the existing distributors. So I just think it's a good dynamic for us. I also mentioned earlier navigation, if the product comes forward that is more robust in terms of user interface, that's great for us. If our product can be found more readily, used more readily, enjoyed more readily, I think that it will increase consumption.

And clearly, with the hand that we've got, Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars, our discussions in terms of the rates that we get paid or the splits have factored in the films that we released. But I do not want to get specific about how much more we could get or what the nature of the discussions are. So I want to emphasize, again, the investment of this company has made in its motion pictures and the results are evident in terms of the value creation proposition to the theater owners. In terms of the strategy and the impact that Alan Horn has had, we've said about to do early on was to focus on core brands and then to acquire others that we thought had similar characteristics. So we focused on Disney, and we worked to strengthen the Disney output, particularly in animation. We purchased Pixar in part to do that. And we bought Marvel because we really believe in that brand and movie business, and obviously, Star Wars. And Alan's charge is to help manage those brands at the Motion Pictures side and to make sure that as a studio, we're focused on quality. And I think the results since he joined us had been steady. He has a tremendous movie executive. He not only knows the business well but he manages our business extremely well. And I think the results that we've seen in that business in these last few years are in part the result of what he's brought to the studio from a experience and from a talent perspective. So we're very focused on those brands. We're focused on improving the quality of the product in a relentless way. We're focused on delivering value, not just to the Disney shareholders, but to the distributors worldwide. And I think the growth that we've seen in that business these last few years is as a result of all of that, and we believe that, that should continue. When you look at what we have in the pipeline, whether it's in Marvel films, including Ant-Man this summer and Captain America and 2 more avengers films and diversifying to Black Panther and Captain Marvel or what you know we have -- I mentioned earlier on the Star Wars front or what's going on in animation from both Pixar and Disney animation, we've got a tremendous original film from Pixar this summer called Inside Out, another one called Good Dinosaur later in the year. First time in a calendar year we've ever released 2 Pixar films. And then we've got Toy Story 4, Incredibles, and Cars and Finding Dory, which is a sequel to Nemo, tremendous names. So I think you're going to see over the next, I don't know, 5 to 10 years, certainly 5 years, a real growth for the studio because of all of that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your flexibility and your understanding. We're very pleased with our performance in Q2 with adjusted EPS of $1.23, up 11% over the prior year. Our results once again reflect the strength of our brands and the quality of our content. These key elements are evident: phenomenal opening of Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron. Released in about 70% of international markets so far, the movie opened #1 in every single market and in the process broke a number of box office records. As of this morning, the movie has surpassed $650 million in global box office, which speaks to the popularity of these characters, the enduring connection that millions of people have with them. In fact, the 3 top movies with the highest grossing opening weekends of all time: Marvel's Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3. 
Of course, when it comes to franchises that inspire tremendous fan devotion, Star Wars certainly sets the standard. We unveiled the second teaser trailer for the Star Wars: The Force Awakens a couple of weeks ago. The reaction was unprecedented. The excitement around this movie is unlike anything we've ever seen before. New trailer had more than 88 million views in the first 24 hours and now has more than 200 million views to date. So that gives you some sense of the tremendous interest and excitement around this film, which should only intensify when we get closer to the December 18 release date.
We're also looking forward to the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, which is just about a year away. We've been very selective about sharing specifics so far, but this summer we'll unveil a number of details that will give everyone a true sense of how spectacular this authentically Disney, distinctly Chinese destination will be. I am looking forward to seeing our progress when Tom and I go back to Shanghai in just a few weeks.
And speaking of Tom, this is our first earnings call since he was named Chief Operating Officer. Before Jay covers the financial details, I'd like to ask him to take you through some of the highlights across our business. Tom?"

Later this month, he'll help us officially kick off the celebration of Disneyland's 60th anniversary, the park that started it all. And we plan to market this historic milestone in true Disney style, including a fantastic new parade, a new World of Color show, a new firework spectacular among other features.
Looking ahead, we have plenty of reason for excitement across the entire company, starting with incomparable slate of upcoming movies. In addition to the one that Bob mentioned, We also have Disney's Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney, in theaters later this month. Paul Rudd takes on the role of Marvel's Ant-Man in July. We're also thrilled to have 2 new Pixar movies coming to theaters this year. Inside Out opens on June 19. It's also already generating a lot of well-deserved buzz and excitement. And we're looking forward to even more great Pixar storytelling when The Good Dinosaur opens at Thanksgiving.
Our Media Networks group is home to some of the strongest brands and content in the business, which consistently drives demand and value in the market. ESPN continues to invest extraordinary programming and innovation to superserve sports fans. In Q2, this unparalleled sports coverage drove double-digit audience growth on ESPN, ESPN2, and the total average audience across ESPN's compelling suite of sports networks was up 9% for the quarter. 
On the broadcast side, ABC has 7 of the top 20 series this season, including 3 of the top 5 dramas. And it's also achieved greater growth in the key prime time audience of adults 18 to 49 than any other major network. In a recent survey, media buyers and planners identified ABC as the network having the most impressive year. A good sign as the network kicks off the upfront sale season next week.
We're also extremely pleased with the instant success of Daredevil, the first of 4 live action series produced for Netflix by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, which further demonstrates the power, breadth and value of the Marvel Universe. Just 2 weeks after the first 13 episodes launched great acclaim and strong demand, Netflix ordered the second season. This initial success bodes well for the 3 other upcoming serialized programs on Netflix: Marvel's Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage, as well as planned miniseries events uniting all these characters into a shared story line. 
Our Consumer Products business also had a great quarter, driven by the continued popularity of our strong franchises, especially Frozen and Avengers. Retail sales for Frozen merchandise so far this year were more than 10x higher than the same period last year. And sales of new merchandise for Avengers: Age of Ultron, indicate a strong global demand. We expect the release of The Force Awakens to accelerate growth of the Star Wars franchise. As we just announced, we're planning a global event at September 4 to launch new merchandise inspired by the upcoming movie, with retailers around the world and online, kicking off sales of the new line at midnight with a unique celebration of all things Star Wars.
We're also very excited about the November release of Star Wars: Battle Front, an incredible new action title from EA for core gamers based on epic Star Wars battle set new landscapes featured in The Force Awakens. This game and other upcoming initiatives demonstrate Star Wars, like Marvel, represent the storytelling universe that can cut across platforms and mediums throughout our businesses and a have a profound effect on our growth and profitability for years to come. 
Obviously, we have a lot to look forward to throughout the rest of this year and beyond. We're pleased with our results in Q2 and remain confident that our proven strategy can continue to drive value and opportunity well into the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay to walk you through the details of the quarter."
191564,288890151,804446,"The Walt Disney Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone.

Second quarter earnings per share adjusted for items affecting comparability were up a solid 11%, driven by a 7% increase in revenue. Media Networks revenue was up 13% and operating income was down 2% as lower operating income at Cable more than offsets strong results at Broadcasting.
At Cable, while total revenue was up 11% due to strong growth in affiliate and advertising revenues, operating income was down 9%. This decline was driven by higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to the College Football Playoff and NFL wild card game at the SEC Network. As you know, fiscal 2015 is the first year of the new College Football Playoff, and the first time ESPN had aired an NFL wild card game. So as we expected, cable programming and production costs were up significantly in the second quarter. We continue to expect relatively flat programming and production costs in the second half of the year, so our full year outlook is unchanged. We still expect programming and production costs to be up low teen percentage points for fiscal 2015.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double-digits in Q2, benefiting from contractual rate increases, the SEC Network, and lower deferred affiliate revenue at ESPN. The increase in domestic cable affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $40 million, as ESPN did not defer any affiliate revenue in the second quarter this year compared to $40 million in Q2 last year. Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenue, domestic cable affiliate revenue was still up 10%.
And just to remind you, ESPN didn't defer any revenue during either Q1 or Q2, resulting in an aggregate year-over-year affiliate revenue benefit of $176 million for the first half of the year compared to the prior year. This benefit will be reversed during Q3, which means ESPN will recognize $176 million less deferred revenue in Q3 compared to last year. And for those of you who have followed us for many years, you will be happy to know that Q3 will be the last quarter in which we need to discuss programming covenants and their impact on revenue recognition. Due to contractual provisions of ESPN's new affiliate agreements, ESPN is no longer required to defer a portion of its affiliate revenue.
Turning to advertising. ESPN ad revenue was up 18% in the second quarter due to higher rates and increase in units sold. Ad revenue at ESPN benefited from the strong interest in the first-ever College Football Playoffs and our NFL wild card playoff game. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales were facing down a few percentage points compared to prior year. Now keep in mind that ad revenue in Q3 of last year benefited from the World Cup.
Broadcasting operating income increased 90%, driven by an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales, and an increase in ad revenue, partially offset by higher marketing costs at ABC Network. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as new contracts. Program sales were up in the second quarter driven by the sale of Marvel's Daredevil and by higher sales of ABC Studios shows, including Lost and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up mid-single-digits in the quarter as a result of higher prime time ratings and higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the network is running low-single-digits above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, operating income was up 24% on revenue growth of 6% due to higher results at our domestic operations, which were partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Total segment margins were up 230 basis points.
During the second quarter, growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks, sales of Vacation Club units at Disney's Polynesian Villas & Bungalows, and higher pricing at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% and per capita spending was up 7% on higher ticket prices and an increase in spending on food and beverage merchandise.
Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 2.5 percentage points to 89% and per-room spending was up 6%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 7% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 2%.
At Studio Entertainment, revenue and operating income were down in the second quarter, given very difficult comps due to the impact of Frozen in the prior year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Studio's slate as Q2 was one of the best quarters in the studio's history. Lower operating income at the Studio was driven by decreases in domestic home entertainment and international theatrical distribution, both of which reflect the record-breaking performance of Frozen in the prior year compared to Big Hero 6 this year, partially offset by higher revenue share from Consumer Products. 
Consumer Products segment operating income was up 32% on revenue growth of 10%, which is net of Consumer Products revenue share from the Studio. Margins were up over 600 basis point in Q2, reflecting continued strength in Merchandise Licensing, which was driven by Frozen and, to a lesser extent, Avengers. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the second quarter was up 23% over last year, which underscores the strength, depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio.
At interactive, higher operating income in the second quarter was due to lower marketing and product and development costs, driven by newer titles in development and higher results from our Mobile Games business, which continued to benefit from the success of Tsum Tsum. These increases were partially offset by lower performance of the Infinity.
During the second quarter, we returned an aggregate $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders, consisting of $485 million for share buyback and a dividend of almost $2 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've returned about $3.9 billion to our shareholders via dividends and buybacks, including roughly $2 billion of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell. We'll be happy to take questions."

As you'd expect, when we look at these new offerings, we look at a couple of factors, namely, do they have strategic value to the company, and are they beneficial to us financially? We also like to analyze the packages in terms of what we believe they offer customers, because we happen to believe that navigation has become really critical. On that note, by the way, the reason we like navigation is the better the navigation, usually, the better the consumption. Poor navigation usually leads to less consumption. In the Verizon case, we were simply asking them to adhere to the contract that they had negotiated with us. In general, as it relates to skinny packages, we've been, for the most part, at the forefront of offering consumers more choice because we happen to think that we've entered into an era where the consumer has more authority and therefore is going to demand more flexibility and more customization. But it's also clear that price value relationship is important. Consumers still want a lot of choice at the right price. Sling's case was mostly of interest to us because their strategy was to go after the roughly 12 million broadband-only households in the United States with a skinny or a less expensive package, so we thought there was value there from a strategic and a financial perspective. In the Sony case, I don't have to get into many details, but simply put, it wasn't to our advantage financially. But again, overall, we think new entrants into the distribution marketplace, good for us. I will say that I have not seen many so-called skinny packages, except for the Sling package, that I think is particularly attractive to consumers in terms of the price-to-value relationship. And I think the last thing I think needs to be said is, and I know that some of you have written about this, is that when you unbundle, particularly your broadband service, there are going to be hidden costs, or there are hidden costs. For instance, you buy an expanded basic bundle, you get broadband with it. You buy a skinny package you have to pay extra for broadband, and that cost goes up substantially. So I think one of the questions that is yet to be answered is, what savings -- or how large does the savings have to be for the consumer to essentially abandon the expanded basic package and the choice that it gives for some less expensive package with far less choice. And are there other cost ramifications like the one that I just cited. So again, the jury is still out on a lot of this. No question that there are changes going on in the media landscape, although we do not see a disturbing trend as it relates to the expanded basic bundle. And we're going to continue evaluate these things based on the criteria I just mentioned."

So it's difficult to say just how much it contributed because it's so integrated, but it clearly was a contributor to results. We've got roughly half of our guests now enter the parks with MagicBands and the response from those guests has been overwhelmingly positive. So we're very pleased with that. My MagicBand -- or MyMagic+ as a driver going forward I think is -- it will still be a factor but perhaps not with as great an impact as we've seen just in this quarter. Again, as it becomes even more integrated into the base experience. Looking forward, I think that we're most excited about what we see in terms of the prospects outside the United States, the -- with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next year, and that should drive growth well into the future. Having said that, though, we saw strong international attendance this year at our domestic parks. There's no question that those results have been strong. And the top line growth, coupled with the close minding of  the expense line, has resulted in strong growth; and we hope to see our results continue there."

I think first of all, you have to understand that this is already a very strong franchise, but a film has not been released in 10 years. And so while we're not treating this as something that is brand new, we're mindful of the fact that there's a whole generation of people out there that were not as deep in the Star Wars lore and not as, in effect, in love with the franchise as an older generation. So we're -- and there are markets around the world that weren't as developed back 10 years ago and beyond that. China is probably the best example. It's now the #2 movie market in the world. Obviously, when the last Star Wars film released, it was barely a market from a movie perspective. We are managing all this with great care as well in that while we are mindful of the fact that we need to market this and go after this new generation and new territories, we also want to be careful that the demand does not create almost too much in the marketplace too soon. And so everything that we have done to date has been extremely deliberate and we have an extremely careful -- a carefully constructed and deliberate plan going forward in terms of what we roll out in the marketplace, both in terms of product and in terms of market. The release of the 6 films digitally is probably a good example of that. We did that in April to at least make it available for the first time on a digital platform on a worldwide basis, and that's been, I think, helpful. We've already got some increased product in the marketplace, but the real ramp-up from a Consumer Products perspective won't come until just a few months prior to the release. We have already talked about some games that will come into the marketplace. EA had an announcement at Star Wars' celebration, for instance. You can expect that there'll be more game-related activity between now and the release. And I think, generally speaking, you're going to see us release in a very, very careful way certain elements of the film as part of a marketing -- a very carefully designed marketing plan, again, as we get much closer to the film. I will say we've been overwhelmed with interest. We knew when we purchased this that there was great interest in value. But so far, it has well-exceeded our expectations. The reaction to the 2 teaser trailers, I think, is one example of that, over 80 million hits on this last teaser trailer in 24 hours and hundreds of millions since. Quite amazing. We're pleased with what we've seen so far in the film and we can't wait to show it to the world. I think we've got something here that is very, very special that's going to create value for the company for many, many years to come across the world. Two other things I want to mention is, we have 3 films that are going to come into the marketplace between now and May of '17: Star Wars VII or The Force Awakens in December; Rogue One, a standalone film a year later; and then May of '17, we're going to have Star Wars VIII, and all 3 are in varying stages of development and production. And then Tom mentioned Parks and Resorts. We've got a huge opportunity there. We've had single attractions, Star Tours, in multiple places around the world that remain successful and some Jedi Training Academy-related shows here and there. But the opportunity here in the United States and in other places around the world is tremendous. And we're doing some developmental work on it but, over time, it has great potential there too."

And we know that there's still a traditional approach to this and that there's still great interest in -- the greatest interest in the 18 to 49 audience and, lesser extent, 25 to 54; great interest in women 18 to 49, and probably growing interest in people 18 to 34. We do know that, I'll call it, secondary viewing, which is either viewing on the DVR or an SVOD, is increasing. And ABC is doing extremely well in that category with shows that seem to be performing, both in the SVOD and in the DVR playback world, in multiple shows for instance. And by the way, ABC had a good season this season. They were the only network that was up, and well, that's due to adding new shows to the schedule like Black-ish and How to Get Away with Murder and Fresh Off the Boat, for instance. So they've had a decent season. They're also mindful of the fact that addressable advertising is going to grow and the ability to create opportunities for advertisers to reach consumers in more specifically designed way is only going to grow. And they're also going to continue to emphasize the output of their own studio. We've been very successful at putting more ABC-owned shows on the network. That should be the case in this upcoming scheduling season as well. And we have the ability as a company to create programs for television platforms. I think the Netflix Marvel deal is a great example of that. So as we look at the television environment, we think the network is well positioned. We think the growth in, what I'll call, new media is only going to continue and we're going to take advantage of that. And generally speaking, we think the advertising or the upfront is going to be just fine for our network and for our company. The last thing I want to say is that there's no question that we're seeing a new advertising reality here, because money definitely has migrated out of traditional media into new media, which is one of the reasons why we've shown such an interest in new media. And the last thing I'll say is, as a company, about 16% of our revenue this year is advertising-generated. So it's still a substantial amount of money, but our exposure to these changes is less than a lot of the other media companies."

And I'd put it in the context of, I think Disney has embraced rather than fought change in the evolving ecosystem about as much as it possibly could, pretty much every step of the way over the past decade. So we have hopefully been one of those people who have done some analysis on that lighter OTT bundle. And if you assume that cost had some relationship with value added to the consumer, the vast majority of value in a product, like Sling, is really coming from the Disney bundle, probably most specifically ESPN. So when you think about it, the way we look at it, Disney really has the ability to mirror the general entertainment content, in the same level contained in Sling, outside of the ESPN product. We think you could probably replicate what's in Sling. So if that goes well, why wouldn't you launch your own direct-to-consumer product? If the idea is to target broadband-only homes, you could sort of do that yourself, you could build the best interface. When is the time to do that?"

In terms of ability, we have said that with these channels and these brands, ESPN, ABC, Disney, maybe even down the road something related to Star Wars and Marvel, we do have the ability as a company to take product, specifically filmed entertainment, television, movies directly to consumers. And we've got some development underway to do just that. That said, the distributors, whether it's cable or satellite or even some of the new platforms, create real value for us, too. They already are in the customer acquisition business. They've already spent significant amount of money and capital to create their platforms and they managed the relationship with the consumer, whether it's billing or technology or whatever, fairly effectively. And so they create value for us. And they also help us market. So I think there's a balance here. And I think what I'm saying is that, as long as the current distribution ecosystem or the one that seems to be emerging continues to create value for us, then we'll rely on it to distribute our product. When we believe that our opportunity to distribute directly is bigger than or better than the opportunity for others to distribute, then we'll go into that business more aggressively. And I don't think any other company is positioned as well as we are to do that because of the strength of those brands. I thought your analysis, by the way, David, was really well done. I read most of it. It was lengthy, by the way. But I thought it was really well done, provocative in some cases, and actually, the comment that I made earlier about unbundling broadband, I actually got from that analysis. So I appreciate it. I think we're entering into a pretty interesting world where technology is, for the most part, a friend of high-quality media, because it's going to give us many more opportunities to reach customers, either directly or through third parties.

Bob, I'm curious your thoughts on virtual MVPDs and how you think about their influence in the ecosystem longer term in one particular regard, right? So Sony Vue and Apple TV could run their virtual bundles at little to no margins as a sort of user software to drive their core hardware business. So the good news is they could pay you more and charge consumers less for the same bundle. Longer term though, if they're not running those businesses for profit, because their long-term interests diverge from programmers and would a Sony or Apple game negotiate and leverage over programmers that traditional distributors have not had recently? So I know it's early days, but you're always very forward thinking on the digital stuff. And for Tom and Jay, the Star Wars franchise and Shanghai Disneyland both seem difficult to forecast, at least I find them to be difficult.

And whether they run them as loss leaders or not, I don't think that really has much of an impact on us. And I think that, generally, new entrants into the marketplace are going to create new opportunities, either because they attract more consumers or they offer an experience to consumer or price-to-value relationship that's more attractive than the existing distributors. I just think it's a good dynamic for us. I also mentioned earlier navigation. If a product comes forward that is more robust in terms of user interface, that's great for us. If our product can be found more readily, used more readily, enjoyed more readily, I think that it will increase consumption.

I wonder, Bob, if you could talk about what you've done and what Alan has done at the studio to drive cost down or margins up. And then, should we be thinking that you guys are going to get 60% splits with the exhibitors for these large tent-pole films as discussed in The Journal today? Because that has a 10-point improvement from the standard 50, has a pretty profound impact on the profitability of these films. And is there any implication for the international splits where they're always typically lower? Are you able to exert similar leverage on the international front?"

And clearly, with the hand that we've got, Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars, our discussions in terms of the rates that we get paid or the splits have factored in the films that we released. But I do not want to get specific about how much more we could get or what the nature of the discussions are. So I want to emphasize, again, the investment this company has made in its motion pictures and the results are evident in terms of the value creation proposition to the theater owners. In terms of the strategy and the impact that Alan Horn has had, what we set about to do early on was to focus on our core brands and then to acquire others that we thought had similar characteristics. So we focused on Disney and we worked to strengthen the Disney output, particularly in animation. We purchased Pixar in part to do that. And we bought Marvel because we really believe in that brand in the movie business, and obviously, Star Wars. And Alan's charge is to help manage those brands on the motion picture side and to make sure that, as a studio, we're focused on quality. And I think the results, since he joined us, had been stunning. He is a tremendous movie executive. He not only knows the business well, but he manages our business extremely well. And I think the results that we've seen in that business in these last few years are in part the result of what he's brought to the studio from an experience and from a talent perspective. So we're very focused on those brands. We're focused on improving the quality of the product in a relentless way. We're focused on delivering value, not just to the Disney shareholders, but to the distributors worldwide. And I think the growth that we've seen in that business these last few years is as a result of all of that, and we believe that, that should continue. When you look at what we have in the pipeline, whether it's in Marvel films, including Ant-Man this summer and Captain America and 2 more Avengers films and diversifying to Black Panther and Captain Marvel, or what you know, we have it. I mentioned earlier on the Star Wars front or what's going on in animation from both Pixar and Disney animation. We've got a tremendous original film from Pixar this summer called Inside Out, another one called Good Dinosaur later in the year. First time in a calendar year we've ever released 2 Pixar films. And then we've got Toy Story 4, Incredibles, and Cars and Finding Dory, which is a sequel to Nemo, tremendous hand. So I think you're going to see over the next, I don't know, 5 to 10 years, certainly 5 years, a real growth from the Studio because of all of that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your flexibility and your understanding. We're very pleased with our performance in Q2 with adjusted EPS of $1.23, up 11% over the prior year. Our results once again reflect the strength of our brands and the quality of our content. These key elements are evident: phenomenal opening of Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron. Released in about 70% of international markets so far, the movie opened #1 in every single market and in the process broke a number of box office records. As of this morning, the movie has surpassed $650 million in global box office, which speaks to the popularity of these characters, the enduring connection that millions of people have with them. In fact, the 3 top movies with the highest grossing opening weekends of all time: Marvel's Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3. 
Of course, when it comes to franchises that inspire tremendous fan devotion, Star Wars certainly sets the standard. We unveiled the second teaser trailer for the Star Wars: The Force Awakens a couple of weeks ago. The reaction was unprecedented. The excitement around this movie is unlike anything we've ever seen before. New trailer had more than 88 million views in the first 24 hours and now has more than 200 million views to date. So that gives you some sense of the tremendous interest and excitement around this film, which should only intensify when we get closer to the December 18 release date.
We're also looking forward to the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, which is just about a year away. We've been very selective about sharing specifics so far, but this summer we'll unveil a number of details that will give everyone a true sense of how spectacular this authentically Disney, distinctly Chinese destination will be. I am looking forward to seeing our progress when Tom and I go back to Shanghai in just a few weeks.
And speaking of Tom, this is our first earnings call since he was named Chief Operating Officer. Before Jay covers the financial details, I'd like to ask him to take you through some of the highlights across our business. Tom?"

With my move back to a corporate role, we're pleased to have Bob Chapek running Parks and Resorts. He's been working his way around the world to get an in-depth understanding of the business, and he's off to a great start to continue its strong performance. Later this month, he'll help us officially kick off the celebration of Disneyland's 60th anniversary, the park that started it all. And we plan to market this historic milestone in true Disney style, including a fantastic new parade, a new World of Color show, a new firework spectacular among other features.
Looking ahead, we have plenty of reason for excitement across the entire company, starting with incomparable slate of upcoming movies. In addition to the one that Bob mentioned, We also have Disney's Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney, in theaters later this month. Paul Rudd takes on the role of Marvel's Ant-Man in July. We're also thrilled to have 2 new Pixar movies coming to theaters this year. Inside Out opens on June 19. It's also already generating a lot of well-deserved buzz and excitement. And we're looking forward to even more great Pixar storytelling when The Good Dinosaur opens at Thanksgiving.
Our Media Networks group is home to some of the strongest brands and content in the business, which consistently drives demand and value in the market. ESPN continues to invest extraordinary programming and innovation to superserve sports fans. In Q2, this unparalleled sports coverage drove double-digit audience growth on ESPN, ESPN2, and the total average audience across ESPN's compelling suite of sports networks was up 9% for the quarter. 
On the broadcast side, ABC has 7 of the top 20 series this season, including 3 of the top 5 dramas. And it's also achieved greater growth in the key prime time audience of adults 18 to 49 than any other major network. In a recent survey, media buyers and planners identified ABC as the network having the most impressive year. A good sign as the network kicks off the upfront sale season next week.
We're also extremely pleased with the instant success of Daredevil, the first of 4 live action series produced for Netflix by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, which further demonstrates the power, breadth and value of the Marvel Universe. Just 2 weeks after the first 13 episodes launched great acclaim and strong demand, Netflix ordered the second season. This initial success bodes well for the 3 other upcoming serialized programs on Netflix: Marvel's Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage, as well as planned miniseries events uniting all these characters into a shared story line. 
Our Consumer Products business also had a great quarter, driven by the continued popularity of our strong franchises, especially Frozen and Avengers. Retail sales for Frozen merchandise so far this year were more than 10x higher than the same period last year. And sales of new merchandise for Avengers: Age of Ultron, indicate a strong global demand. We expect the release of The Force Awakens to accelerate growth of the Star Wars franchise. As we just announced, we're planning a global event at September 4 to launch new merchandise inspired by the upcoming movie, with retailers around the world and online, kicking off sales of the new line at midnight with a unique celebration of all things Star Wars.
We're also very excited about the November release of Star Wars: Battle Front, an incredible new action title from EA for core gamers based on epic Star Wars battle set new landscapes featured in The Force Awakens. This game and other upcoming initiatives demonstrate Star Wars, like Marvel, represent the storytelling universe that can cut across platforms and mediums throughout our businesses and have a profound effect on our growth and profitability for years to come. 
Obviously, we have a lot to look forward to throughout the rest of this year and beyond. We're pleased with our results in Q2 and remain confident that our proven strategy can continue to drive value and opportunity well into the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay to walk you through the details of the quarter."
191564,288890151,804577,"The Walt Disney Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone.

Second quarter earnings per share adjusted for items affecting comparability were up a solid 11%, driven by a 7% increase in revenue. Media Networks revenue was up 13% and operating income was down 2% as lower operating income at Cable more than offsets strong results at Broadcasting.
At Cable, while total revenue was up 11% due to strong growth in affiliate and advertising revenues, operating income was down 9%. This decline was driven by higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to the College Football Playoff and NFL wild card game at the SEC Network. As you know, fiscal 2015 is the first year of the new College Football Playoff, and the first time ESPN had aired an NFL wild card game. So as we expected, cable programming and production costs were up significantly in the second quarter. We continue to expect relatively flat programming and production costs in the second half of the year, so our full year outlook is unchanged. We still expect programming and production costs to be up low teen percentage points for fiscal 2015.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double-digits in Q2, benefiting from contractual rate increases, the SEC Network, and lower deferred affiliate revenue at ESPN. The increase in domestic cable affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $40 million, as ESPN did not defer any affiliate revenue in the second quarter this year compared to $40 million in Q2 last year. Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenue, domestic cable affiliate revenue was still up 10%.
And just to remind you, ESPN didn't defer any revenue during either Q1 or Q2, resulting in an aggregate year-over-year affiliate revenue benefit of $176 million for the first half of the year compared to the prior year. This benefit will be reversed during Q3, which means ESPN will recognize $176 million less deferred revenue in Q3 compared to last year. And for those of you who have followed us for many years, you will be happy to know that Q3 will be the last quarter in which we need to discuss programming covenants and their impact on revenue recognition. Due to contractual provisions of ESPN's new affiliate agreements, ESPN is no longer required to defer a portion of its affiliate revenue.
Turning to advertising. ESPN ad revenue was up 18% in the second quarter due to higher rates and increase in units sold. Ad revenue at ESPN benefited from the strong interest in the first-ever College Football Playoffs and our NFL wild card playoff game. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales were facing down a few percentage points compared to prior year. Now keep in mind that ad revenue in Q3 of last year benefited from the World Cup.
Broadcasting operating income increased 90%, driven by an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales, and an increase in ad revenue, partially offset by higher marketing costs at the ABC Network. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as new contracts. Program sales were up in the second quarter driven by the sale of Marvel's Daredevil and by higher sales of ABC Studios shows, including Lost and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up mid-single-digits in the quarter as a result of higher prime time ratings and higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the network is running low-single-digits above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, operating income was up 24% on revenue growth of 6% due to higher results at our domestic operations, which were partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Total segment margins were up 230 basis points.
During the second quarter, growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks, sales of Vacation Club units at Disney's Polynesian Villas & Bungalows, and higher pricing at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% and per capita spending was up 7% on higher ticket prices and an increase in spending on food and beverage merchandise.
Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 2.5 percentage points to 89% and per-room spending was up 6%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 7% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 2%.
At Studio Entertainment, revenue and operating income were down in the second quarter, given very difficult comps due to the impact of Frozen in the prior year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Studio's slate as Q2 was one of the best quarters in the studio's history. Lower operating income at the Studio was driven by decreases in domestic home entertainment and international theatrical distribution, both of which reflect the record-breaking performance of Frozen in the prior year compared to Big Hero 6 this year, partially offset by higher revenue share from Consumer Products. 
Consumer Products segment operating income was up 32% on revenue growth of 10%, which is net of Consumer Products revenue share from the Studio. Margins were up over 600 basis point in Q2, reflecting continued strength in Merchandise Licensing, which was driven by Frozen and, to a lesser extent, Avengers. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the second quarter was up 23% over last year, which underscores the strength, depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio.
At interactive, higher operating income in the second quarter was due to lower marketing and product and development costs, driven by newer titles in development and higher results from our Mobile Games business, which continued to benefit from the success of Tsum Tsum. These increases were partially offset by lower performance of the Infinity.
During the second quarter, we returned an aggregate $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders, consisting of $485 million for share buyback and a dividend of almost $2 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've returned about $3.9 billion to our shareholders via dividends and buybacks, including roughly $2 billion of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell. We'll be happy to take questions."

As you'd expect, when we look at these new offerings, we look at a couple of factors, namely, do they have strategic value to the company, and are they beneficial to us financially? We also like to analyze the packages in terms of what we believe they offer customers, because we happen to believe that navigation has become really critical. On that note, by the way, the reason we like navigation is the better the navigation, usually, the better the consumption. Poor navigation usually leads to less consumption. In the Verizon case, we were simply asking them to adhere to the contract that they had negotiated with us. In general, as it relates to skinny packages, we've been, for the most part, at the forefront of offering consumers more choice because we happen to think that we've entered into an era where the consumer has more authority and therefore is going to demand more flexibility and more customization. But it's also clear that price value relationship is important. Consumers still want a lot of choice at the right price. Sling's case was mostly of interest to us because their strategy was to go after the roughly 12 million broadband-only households in the United States with a skinny or a less expensive package, so we thought there was value there from a strategic and a financial perspective. In the Sony case, I don't have to get into many details, but simply put, it wasn't to our advantage financially. But again, overall, we think new entrants into the distribution marketplace, good for us. I will say that I have not seen many so-called skinny packages, except for the Sling package, that I think is particularly attractive to consumers in terms of the price-to-value relationship. And I think the last thing I think needs to be said is, and I know that some of you have written about this, is that when you unbundle, particularly your broadband service, there are going to be hidden costs, or there are hidden costs. For instance, you buy an expanded basic bundle, you get broadband with it. You buy a skinny package you have to pay extra for broadband, and that cost goes up substantially. So I think one of the questions that is yet to be answered is, what savings -- or how large does the savings have to be for the consumer to essentially abandon the expanded basic package and the choice that it gives for some less expensive package with far less choice. And are there other cost ramifications like the one that I just cited. So again, the jury is still out on a lot of this. No question that there are changes going on in the media landscape, although we do not see a disturbing trend as it relates to the expanded basic bundle. And we're going to continue evaluate these things based on the criteria I just mentioned."

So it's difficult to say just how much it contributed because it's so integrated, but it clearly was a contributor to results. We've got roughly half of our guests now enter the parks with MagicBands and the response from those guests has been overwhelmingly positive. So we're very pleased with that. My MagicBand -- or MyMagic+ as a driver going forward I think is -- it will still be a factor but perhaps not with as great an impact as we've seen just in this quarter. Again, as it becomes even more integrated into the base experience. Looking forward, I think that we're most excited about what we see in terms of the prospects outside the United States, the -- with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next year, and that should drive growth well into the future. Having said that, though, we saw strong international attendance this year at our domestic parks. There's no question that those results have been strong. And the top line growth, coupled with the close minding of the expense line, has resulted in strong growth; and we hope to see our results continue there."

I think first of all, you have to understand that this is already a very strong franchise, but a film has not been released in 10 years. And so while we're not treating this as something that is brand new, we're mindful of the fact that there's a whole generation of people out there that were not as steeped in the Star Wars lore and not as, in effect, in love with the franchise as an older generation. So we're -- and there are markets around the world that weren't as developed back 10 years ago and beyond that. China is probably the best example. It's now the #2 movie market in the world. Obviously, when the last Star Wars film released, it was barely a market from a movie perspective. We are managing all this with great care as well in that while we are mindful of the fact that we need to market this and go after this new generation and new territories, we also want to be careful that the demand does not create almost too much in the marketplace too soon. And so everything that we have done to date has been extremely deliberate and we have an extremely careful -- a carefully constructed and deliberate plan going forward in terms of what we roll out in the marketplace, both in terms of product and in terms of market. The release of the 6 films digitally is probably a good example of that. We did that in April to at least make it available for the first time on a digital platform on a worldwide basis, and that's been, I think, helpful. We've already got some increased product in the marketplace, but the real ramp-up from a Consumer Products perspective won't come until just a few months prior to the release. We have already talked about some games that will come into the marketplace. EA had an announcement at Star Wars' celebration, for instance. You can expect that there'll be more game-related activity between now and the release. And I think, generally speaking, you're going to see us release in a very, very careful way certain elements of the film as part of a marketing -- a very carefully designed marketing plan, again, as we get much closer to the film. I will say we've been overwhelmed with interest. We knew when we purchased this that there was great interest and value. But so far, it has well-exceeded our expectations. The reaction to the 2 teaser trailers, I think, is one example of that, over 80 million hits on this last teaser trailer in 24 hours and hundreds of millions since. Quite amazing. We're pleased with what we've seen so far in the film and we can't wait to show it to the world. I think we've got something here that is very, very special that's going to create value for the company for many, many years to come across the world. Two other things I want to mention is, we have 3 films that are going to come into the marketplace between now and May of '17: Star Wars VII or The Force Awakens in December; Rogue One, a standalone film a year later; and then May of '17, we're going to have Star Wars VIII, and all 3 are in varying stages of development and production. And then Tom mentioned Parks and Resorts. We've got a huge opportunity there. We've had single attractions, Star Tours, in multiple places around the world that remain successful and some Jedi Training Academy-related shows here and there. But the opportunity here in the United States and in other places around the world is tremendous. And we're doing some developmental work on it but, over time, it has great potential there too."

And we know that there's still a traditional approach to this and that there's still great interest in -- the greatest interest in the 18 to 49 audience and, lesser extent, 25 to 54; great interest in women 18 to 49, and probably growing interest in people 18 to 34. We do know that, I'll call it, secondary viewing, which is either viewing on the DVR or an SVOD, is increasing. And ABC is doing extremely well in that category with shows that seem to be performing, both in the SVOD and in the DVR playback world, in multiple shows for instance. And by the way, ABC had a good season this season. They were the only network that was up, and well, that's due to adding new shows to the schedule like Black-ish and How to Get Away with Murder and Fresh Off the Boat, for instance. So they've had a decent season. They're also mindful of the fact that addressable advertising is going to grow and the ability to create opportunities for advertisers to reach consumers in more specifically designed way is only going to grow. And they're also going to continue to emphasize the output of their own studio. We've been very successful at putting more ABC-owned shows on the network. That should be the case in this upcoming scheduling season as well. And we have the ability as a company to create programs for television platforms. I think the Netflix Marvel deal is a great example of that. So as we look at the television environment, we think the network is well positioned. We think the growth in, what I'll call, new media is only going to continue and we're going to take advantage of that. And generally speaking, we think the advertising or the upfront is going to be just fine for our network and for our company. The last thing I want to say is that there's no question that we're seeing a new advertising reality here, because money definitely has migrated out of traditional media into new media, which is one of the reasons why we've shown such an interest in new media. And the last thing I'll say is, as a company, about 16% of our revenue this year is advertising-generated. So it's still a substantial amount of money, but our exposure to these changes is less than a lot of the other media companies."

And I'd put it in the context of, I think Disney has embraced rather than fought change in the evolving ecosystem about as much as it possibly could, pretty much every step of the way over the past decade. So we have hopefully been one of those people who have done some analysis on that lighter OTT bundle. And if you assume that cost had some relationship with value added to the consumer, the vast majority of value in a product, like Sling, is really coming from the Disney bundle, probably most specifically ESPN. So when you think about it, the way we look at it, Disney really has the ability to mirror the general entertainment content, in the same level contained in Sling, outside of the ESPN product. We think you could probably replicate what's in Sling. So if that goes well, why wouldn't you launch your own direct-to-consumer product? If the idea is to target broadband-only homes, you could sort of do that yourself, you could build the best interface. When is the time to do that?"

In terms of ability, we have said that with these channels and these brands, ESPN, ABC, Disney, maybe even down the road something related to Star Wars and Marvel, we do have the ability as a company to take product, specifically filmed entertainment, television, movies directly to consumers. And we've got some development underway to do just that. That said, the distributors, whether it's cable or satellite or even some of the new platforms, create real value for us, too. They already are in the customer acquisition business. They've already spent significant amount of money and capital to create their platforms and they managed the relationship with the consumer, whether it's billing or technology or whatever, fairly effectively. And so they create value for us. And they also help us market. So I think there's a balance here. And I think what I'm saying is that, as long as the current distribution ecosystem or the one that seems to be emerging continues to create value for us, then we'll rely on it to distribute our product. When we believe that our opportunity to distribute directly is bigger than or better than the opportunity for others to distribute, then we'll go into that business more aggressively. And I don't think any other company is positioned as well as we are to do that because of the strength of those brands. I thought your analysis, by the way, David, was really well done. I read most of it. It was lengthy, by the way. But I thought it was really well done, provocative in some cases, and actually, the comment that I made earlier about unbundling broadband, I actually got from that analysis. So I appreciate it. I think we're entering into a pretty interesting world where technology is, for the most part, a friend of high-quality media, because it's going to give us many more opportunities to reach customers, either directly or through third parties. So we're viewing this as kind of a new world order in many ways because of, I think, the impact of technology on media, but one that's going to be very beneficial for this company."

So Sony Vue and Apple TV could run their virtual bundles at little to no margins as a sort of user software to drive their core hardware business. So the good news is they could pay you more and charge consumers less for the same bundle. Longer term though, if they're not running those businesses for profit, because their long-term interests diverge from programmers and would a Sony or Apple game negotiate and leverage over programmers that traditional distributors have not had recently? So I know it's early days, but you're always very forward thinking on the digital stuff.

And whether they run them as loss leaders or not, I don't think that really has much of an impact on us. And I think that, generally, new entrants into the marketplace are going to create new opportunities, either because they attract more consumers or they offer an experience to consumer or price-to-value relationship that's more attractive than the existing distributors. I just think it's a good dynamic for us. I also mentioned earlier navigation. If a product comes forward that is more robust in terms of user interface, that's great for us. If our product can be found more readily, used more readily, enjoyed more readily, I think that it will increase consumption.

I wonder, Bob, if you could talk about what you've done and what Alan has done at the studio to drive cost down or margins up. And then, should we be thinking that you guys are going to get 60% splits with the exhibitors for these large tent-pole films as discussed in The Journal today?

And clearly, with the hand that we've got, Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars, our discussions in terms of the rates that we get paid or the splits have factored in the films that we released. But I do not want to get specific about how much more we could get or what the nature of the discussions are. So I want to emphasize, again, the investment this company has made in its motion pictures and the results are evident in terms of the value creation proposition to the theater owners. In terms of the strategy and the impact that Alan Horn has had, what we set about to do early on was to focus on our core brands and then to acquire others that we thought had similar characteristics. So we focused on Disney and we worked to strengthen the Disney output, particularly in animation. We purchased Pixar in part to do that. And we bought Marvel because we really believe in that brand in the movie business, and obviously, Star Wars. And Alan's charge is to help manage those brands on the motion picture side and to make sure that, as a studio, we're focused on quality. And I think the results, since he joined us, had been stunning. He is a tremendous movie executive. He not only knows the business well, but he manages our business extremely well. And I think the results that we've seen in that business in these last few years are in part the result of what he's brought to the studio from an experience and from a talent perspective. So we're very focused on those brands. We're focused on improving the quality of the product in a relentless way. We're focused on delivering value, not just to the Disney shareholders, but to the distributors worldwide. And I think the growth that we've seen in that business these last few years is as a result of all of that, and we believe that, that should continue. When you look at what we have in the pipeline, whether it's in Marvel films, including Ant-Man this summer and Captain America and 2 more Avengers films and diversifying to Black Panther and Captain Marvel, or what you know, we have it. I mentioned earlier on the Star Wars front or what's going on in animation from both Pixar and Disney animation. We've got a tremendous original film from Pixar this summer called Inside Out, another one called Good Dinosaur later in the year. First time in a calendar year we've ever released 2 Pixar films. And then we've got Toy Story 4, Incredibles, and Cars and Finding Dory, which is a sequel to Nemo, tremendous hand. So I think you're going to see over the next, I don't know, 5 to 10 years, certainly 5 years, a real growth from the Studio because of all of that."

Now turning to the quarter. We're very pleased with our performance in Q3, with record net income and earnings per share. Diluted EPS increased 13% to $1.45, and revenue was up 5% to more than $13 billion with strong results across the board.
Since our last earnings call, we had the pleasure of unveiling the exciting details of Shanghai Disneyland, and with a 60-year history of relentless innovation, fantastic storytelling and extraordinary experiences, we're creating a truly one-of-a-kind, world-class destination. Shanghai Disneyland will have 6 theme lands, featuring the best of what everyone knows and loves about Disney parks. As well as a number of amazing, original attractions, created specifically for Shanghai, resulting in an authentically Disney, distinctly Chinese Disneyland. 
I'm happy to say that since we unveiled the detail, the response in China has been tremendous, with nearly 150 million people expressing their excitement on the country's top social media platforms. This investment represents one of the biggest creative endeavors undertaken by the company, and with an opening plan for spring of 2016, we're truly excited by the potential of the world's most populous market. 
For those of you who haven't seen the great images and details of Shanghai Disneyland, you can view them online at shanghaidisneyresort.com. And I think you'll be impressed.
Before Tom takes you through the highlights of our businesses, I'd like to address an issue that has been receiving a fair amount of interest and attention these days, and that's the rapidly changing media landscape, especially as it relates to ESPN.
We're realists about the business and about the impact technology has had on how product is distributed, marketed and consumed. We're also quite mindful of potential trends among younger audiences in particular, many of whom consume television in very different ways than the generation before them. Economics have also played a part in change in both cost and value are under a consumer microscope. All of this has, and will continue, to put pressure on the multichannel ecosystem, which has seen to declining overall households as well as growth in so-called skinny or cable-like packages. ESPN's experienced some modest sub losses, though those have been less than reported by one of the prominent research firms. And the vast majority of them, 80%, were due to decreases in multichannel households with only a small percentage due to skinny packages. 
Overall though, we believe the expanded basic package will remain the dominant package of choice for some years to come because of the quality and variety it represents for a price that is generally considered fair and appropriate. 
We also see the continued development of new platforms with smaller channel offerings, which we see as a positive trend for us, since ESPN is a must-have brand as part of the initial service offering for these new packages. And we all know why this is. ESPN is the #1 brand in sports media. They're one of the most valuable brand in all of sports and among the most popular, respected and valuable brands in media by consumers, advertisers and distributors. This is supported by the fact that in the first calendar quarter of this year alone, 83% of all multichannel households turn to ESPN at some point. 
ESPN is the most significant collection of sports program packages in the industry and has license agreements with each sports typically run into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA and major league baseball. This coverage of college sports is unparalleled, particularly football and basketball, and the first of the college football playoff and national championship was an enormous success. ESPN's rights to this fantastic package have 11 years to run.
And we all know how valuable live programming has become and ESPN is the leader in live programming. 96% of all sports programming is watched live and this is particularly valuable in today's rapidly challenging advertising marketplace. This year's upfront provided ample proof. ESPN enjoyed both increased demand and sell-through rates as well as pricing increases.
And ESPN has embraced technology better than anyone in traditional media, reaching its fans and engaging with them in more meaningful ways online and on mobile devices, with its linear channels as well as with an array of additional programming, sports information, commentary conversation and very rich social media features. All of this adds up to a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN's future, no matter how technology disrupts the media business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tom to take you through the highlights across the rest of our businesses. Tom?"

The core part of our strategy and a key source of sustained advantage for Disney is developing and leveraging our powerful branding franchises across our many lines of business and distribution channel. Our investments in Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm underscore and dramatically enhance that advantage. 
Benefit of our strategy evident in this quarter's results as our branded content led the healthy increases in operating income in our Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products segment. Parks and Resorts had their highest quarter ever in Q3 in terms of both revenue and operating income. We've seen remarkable excitement for Disneyland's 60th Anniversary Diamond celebration, which features a new show, electrifying nighttime parade and reimagined World of Color's spectacular, resulting in the highest attendance and profit for any quarter in the resorts history. At Walt Disney World, attendance hit a record for Q3 while also delivering the highest profit for any previous quarter for that location. The Studio continues to execute extremely well in our branded tenfold strategy by delivering high-quality, immensely creative and broadly appealing theatrical entertainment. 3 of the top 6 films in the U.S. this year are from Disney: Cinderella, Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron and Disney Pixar's Inside Out, and all 3 helped drive our strong results in the quarter. Inside Out has grossed $330 million in the U.S. and more than $600 million worldwide, with more overseas markets yet to open. Avengers: Age of Ultron is now the sixth highest grossing film of all-time with $1.4 billion at the box office. Ant Man, the newest character to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, spent its first 2 weeks at #1 and has already grossed nearly $300 million worldwide, with multiple overseas markets yet to open. And we're extremely pleased with another great original Disney Pixar film, The Good Dinosaur, coming this Thanksgiving. 
Of course, we're all counting the days till December 18 when Star Wars: The Force Awakens makes its much anticipated debut. That's just about 135 days and 10 hours from now, in case you're wondering. 
To give you a sense of excitement for this film, a single Star Wars panel at ComiCon this year drove 1.6 billion social and editorial impression. Following The Force Awakens, we'll release the first standalone Star Wars film, Rogue One, which is in currently production and will be released December 16, 2016. It will be followed by Episode 8: The Star Wars Saga in May of 2017. We'll be back in 2018, with a standalone film about Young Han Solo and then Episode 9 will hit theaters in 2019. And that's the theatrical lineup. 
On August 30, we'll launch the Star Wars theme Disney Infinity 3.0 edition, followed by an unprecedented Consumer Products global event called Force Friday on September 4. Stores around the world will open their doors at 12:01 a.m. to unveil an amazing array of merchandise inspired by Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of course, Star Wars is already a strong contributor among our broad array of powerful franchises for the Consumer Products business, where profits were up substantially the quarter, led me collective strength of Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars.
Our Cable Networks benefited from strong original programming at Disney Channel and ABC Family with both contributing nicely to cable income growth in the quarter.
In Broadcasting, ABC was the only TV network with year-to-year prime time ratings growth this past season, thanks to the success of our lineup of returning and new hit shows, including Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, Black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat. ABC also received the most Emmy nominations of any broadcast network this year, 42 in all, including 10 for the critically acclaimed series, American Crime.
Looking ahead, we're optimistic about ABC's fall lineup to which advertisers have responded by agreeing to give ABC industry-leading pricing gains in our just completed upfront. 
As Bob said, we're pleased with our results in Q3. We remain confident in our ability to create significant value for our shareholders. We have a lot to look forward to across all of our businesses in both the near-term and the years ahead. 
With that, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Christine to her new role and turn the call over to her to take you through additional details for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call and I look forward to working with many of you more closely in the near future. With 3 quarters of the fiscal year behind us, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing. Third quarter earnings per share increased 13% to a record $1.45, driven by strength across our businesses.
At Media Networks, growth in operating income was due to higher results at Cable, partially offset by lower results at Broadcasting. Cable operating income was higher in the third quarter due to growth at Disney Channel, ABC Family and ESPN. Disney Channel and ABC Family results benefited from program sales and higher affiliate revenue, while growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenue.
The decrease in ad revenue at ESPN was due to a difficult comparison with the men's World Cup in Q3 last year, which more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q3 this year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up a little over a little over 5% when you exclude the impact of these events. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year. Programming and production costs at cable were relatively flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectation, and we still expect these costs to be up low teen percentage points for the full year.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter as a result of contractual rate increases and the addition of the SEC Network, which launched in August of last year. These increase were partially offset by lower deferred revenue recognition at ESPN. If you recall, ESPN recognized $176 million in previously deferred revenue during Q3 last year, and there was no deferred revenue recognized in the third quarter this year. Excluding the effect of the deferred revenue recognition last year, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 12%.
Broadcasting operating income was lower in the third quarter, as higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue more than offset increases in affiliate revenue and higher program sales. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to new contracts contract and higher contractual rates.
Program sales were up in the quarter, driven by the sale of a number of shows, including Grey's Anatomy, America's Funniest Home Video and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down low-single digits, as lower news and daytime ratings were partially offset by higher rates. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the network is pacing modestly above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which saw gains in both attendance and guest spending, partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Margins were up 100 basis points to over 22%.
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% and per capita spending was up 2% in the third quarter due to increased spending on food and beverage and merchandise. Occupancy at our domestic resorts was up 5 percentage points to 87%, and per room spending was up 4%.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations, excluding the 53rd week, are pacing up 4% compared to prior year levels while booked rates are up 6%.
International operations were lower in the third quarter due to a decline in attendance in occupied room nights at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. Results at Disneyland Paris were comparable to prior year. The weakness of the euro compared to prior year resulted in about $100 million adverse impact to Disneyland Paris' revenue. However, there was a corresponding benefit to expenses of roughly the same amount.
At Studio Entertainment, we delivered another strong quarter with operating income up 15% over prior year, driven by increases in theatrical distribution, reflecting the strong performance of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Cinderella and Inside Out, partially offset by the performance of Tomorrowland.
Studio results also benefited from higher revenue share from Consumer Products and growth in international television distribution. Home entertainment results were lower in the quarter as a result of a difficult comparison with the performance of Frozen in the prior year.
Our Consumer Products business continues to benefit from the depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio. Segment operating income was up 27% on revenue growth of 6%, and margins were up over 600 basis points. Growth in operating income in the quarter was due to higher results and merchandise licensing, which was driven by Frozen, The Avengers and Star Wars. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the third quarter was up 20% over last year. 
At Interactive, results reflected lower performance of Disney Infinity, partially offset by higher results from our mobile games business.
We feel great about our third quarter results and with the end of fiscal 2015 less than 2 months away, I now want to take a moment to give you an early look into fiscal 2016.
As we look ahead to 2016, there are 2 items I want to address: First, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus a number of key foreign currencies is expected to adversely impact our operating income 2016 by approximately $500 million; second, in April of last year, we told you that we expected to grow both domestic cable affiliate revenue and cable operating income by high single-digits on a compounded annual basis between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016. Due to the lower subscriber levels Bob discussed earlier, we now expect domestic cable affiliate revenue to fall of bit short of our previous expectation, though still in the high single-digit range. We now expect this lower affiliate revenue and the multiyear impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate our cable operating income growth to mid-single-digits during the fiscal 2013 to 2016 period.
We are disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and continue to take a balanced approach between investing in existing businesses, making strategic acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders. Our financial results over the past several years, including the record quarter we just reported, are evidence our capital allocation strategy have delivered and continues to deliver tangible results.
Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy. Last month, the board declared a dividend of $0.66 for the first half of this fiscal year, which represents an increase of 15% on an annualized basis. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends on a semi-annual basis.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $1 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 32.4 million shares for $3.2 billion, which, coupled with $3.1 billion in dividends paid this year, represents approximately $6.3 billion in capital returned to our shareholders so far in fiscal 2015. And given our outlook for next year, we currently expect to increase our level of share repurchase to between $6 million and $8 billion in fiscal 2016.
Before I turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A, I want to take a moment to say how honored I am to be the CFO of this company and I look forward to the delivered over that so many great colleagues here at Disney, as well as many of you in the near future."

Back in the summer of 2014, when the U.S. dollar started strengthening, we were mostly hedged for fiscal '15. With the continued dollar strength that we saw in this current year, 2015, as we layered into additional hedges for fiscal '16, they were at less favorable rates.

And I guess ultimately on that same point, your over-the-top platforms expands, do you think it's just a share shift from linear TV or do you think it can actually expand the reach of the market for ESPN?"

One, you can think is as in terms of the overall television landscape and the linear MVPD expanded basic business versus the growth in so-called over-the-top businesses, or you can look at it specifically with regard to ESPN. I guess I'll take the broader sort of market look first. First of all, I think while there has been a lot said about what's going on in the multichannel universe, and as I said in my comments, it's still a dominant form of television viewing. And it is the dominant form clearly for sports viewing as well. And we mentioned 83% statistic, 83% of all U.S. households watch ESPN -- U.S. multichannel households watched ESPN in the first quarter. So you're still looking at significant amount of consumption through the multichannel universe. We also look at that business and we look at it as a consumer offering, and we see huge variety of programming, a lot of live or kind of topical programming that's on. Meaning you don't have to wait a year to watch Library, as for instance. I mentioned significant amount of variety and quality obviously for a price that's generally considered reasonable and price that's often bundled with broadband and in some cases with telephony. So when we look at that universe, we don't really see dramatic declines over the next, say, 5 years or so. And therefore, we're not taking, what I'd call radical steps to move our product into over-the-top businesses to disrupt that business because we don't think right now that it's necessary the greatest opportunity. We just don't think it's necessary. That said, there are new platforms that are launching, some multichannel and some other types of platforms, that on the multichannel front, they all want our programming. They want ABC, they want Disney Channel, they want to want to ESPN. There's a one that's talked about launching without coming to us suggesting a desire to have us. And we're going to obviously -- because we believe that's in our best interest, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities and at the right price under the right circumstances, license our linear channels to those platforms. In addition to that, you have the growth of platforms like Netflix or SVOD, that's interesting as well. Because while one could argue that for all the right reasons that starting to incentivize or maybe incentivizing people including millenials the cord cut, it's also providing us opportunities because Netflix has become a really important partner to us in buying our off-network product, buying original programming for us, the Marvel deal is a good example and then our film library kicks in the output deal for the 16 slate kicks in. So we look at Netflix actually right now as more a friend than foe because they become an aggressive customer of ours. I also think that products like Netflix are pretty attractive because they offer a very user-friendly, efficient and oftentimes and much less expensive way for people to watch television. I'm going to say one more thing. I realize I'm getting wordy, but the average American's watching about 5.5 hours of TV a day, and we see that going up to about 6 hours. The reason they're watching 5.5 hours of TV a day is because what I just described. There's huge value in the multichannel product for customers, and it's popular and the reason we believe it's going to increase from 5.5 hours to 6 is because the advent of new technology-driven platforms, whether they're over-the-top, whether it's SVOD, whether it's new, smaller services. So it's a long way around my saying that we actually believe that with Disney, ABC, ESPN, our other products, we're really well-positioned. We've been among the first, if not the first to offer our product on new platforms even if it's somewhat disruptive. We still believe in expanded basic service for years to come, but we're going to take advantage of opportunities. And it's just hard to say when something even feels too disruptive too fast or not. But when we see it, we'll tell you about it."

For the kind of movies that we make which are largely what I'll call -- tentpole films, we actually believe that the theatrical window is incredibly important to us. And at the moment, we don't really see any need to aggressively compress it. We time our -- I'll call it the home video product that goes into the marketplace very carefully, mostly to track the retail opportunities that we have as a company. Retail opportunities to both sell the movie into that window and retail opportunities to take advantage of the consumer product sales that we generally get at retail from a lot of the movies that we make.

First of all, on the foreign exchange, Christine talked about that in terms of next year. But in terms of international attendance right now, the -- overall we haven't seen dramatic impact on the currency rate in terms of the total attendance. Now if we look at it, the correlation with where the economies around the world are weakest, we also see that in the attendance. So, for example, the U.K. was relatively strong this past quarter, Brazil was a bit lower. And so that economic status, coupled probably with some change in the exchange rate, does have an impact. But if you look at international attendance for Q3 as an example, Q3, by the way, is for probably the lower of the quarters in terms of the national attendance percentage wise, it was in the range that we normally experience. So we don't discern a very big impact there. With regards to the 60th, there's no question that people have responded well to the 60th, and there's obviously there's a lot of attachment to Disneyland and that has led what we talked about, which is the best quarter ever for the Disneyland Resort in terms of attendance and profitability. And so I would say that the 60th is one of the key drivers there. But it's really the new content and the product that we put in around the 60th that drives it.

And so I guess I'm hoping for a little more color as we sit on the eve, I think we have a framework for the box office, but is there any sense or sort of incremental order of magnitude you could talk to us about aside from the Force Friday impact on consumer products. Like what's the an order of magnitude on the income statement? And for Shanghai, can you give us kind of a basic sense of impact on that first 12 months. Is it in a breakeven? Is it earnings drag? Is it earnings lift? Anything -- any incremental color on those 2 events in the income statement would be really, really helpful."

Anything that moves gets a lot of attention and anticipation is obviously huge. And we've seen some examples already of Star Wars product going to the marketplace on the consumer products front, including in markets like China, that are very, very encouraging. That said, as enthusiastic as we are for what we know of the film, we've not seen a Star Wars film, any original ones since 2005, and there are markets around the world that are less familiar with Star Wars than say, the United States, for instance. So while the enthusiasm is I think rather apparent, we just want to be careful that the world doesn't get ahead of us too much in terms of the estimates. And we've seen them as well. We're making, at this point, no estimates whatsoever in terms of what we believe the film will do. We know we have probably the most valuable film franchise that ever existed. We know we have the ability as a company to leverage it in very, very compelling ways, whether it's in Disney Infinity, whether it's at Parks, Tom cited, very on the Consumer Products front or on the TV front. And we fully expect that the success of this film will reverberate throughout the company, not only in 2016 but in the years beyond because we obviously have a rich slate of Star Wars films coming. So we just want to be careful here that the market doesn't get too far ahead of us, or ahead of itself even on this. Let's all continue to anticipate the movie and be optimistic about it. But we have to take a wait-and-see approach in terms of what it will do. On the Shanghai front, I'm going to Tom talk about the economic impact in '16. But there are two, like Star Wars in many ways, there's huge anticipation. As I mentioned in my comments, the reaction to what we revealed a couple of weeks ago in Shanghai was extraordinary, not just in terms of the level of interest the level of enthusiasm and the positive reaction to the fact that we're building a park that was of such a scale and was so unique in many ways, particularly in its blend of what I'll call traditional Disney theme park experiences and a lot of things that are both original and very, very specifically tailored for the Chinese market."

That number, of course, has gone up in 2015, which is part of what you see the international theme park results, and then will ramp even further in 2016. And you should anticipate that roughly half of the total preopening expenses for the project, we'll see in 2016. And so the net result of that is Shanghai won't contribute to profitability in 2016 based on our best assumption right now. But then in future years, you'll see the real impact and the financial returns, which we continue to believe will be quite attractive."

And so it was a legitimate home video market, never quite developed there. That said, there are a number new platforms that have launched or that are expected to launch. And we're in a number of conversations, none that we can discuss because we're not ready to announce it, with some of them about output deals for our films, and we feel good about essentially digital delivery of these films into a window that's likely to be lucrative for us over a long period of time.

ESPN in particular, the FX issue there is separate and distinct from the $500 million that we talked about. The foreign exchange impact for ESPN is over that 3-year period. And when we talked back in 2014 at the Investor Day for that outlook, right at that point in time, the U.S. dollar had not started its significant strengthening. That was in the summer of '14.

In ESPN's case, as we've said before, they package their ad sales across all their platforms. They're -- basically they're linear, more and analog platforms as well as all their digital platforms. And platforms like radio and ESPN's and even their magazine. But we think that there's going to be tremendous growth from a percentage basis of digital and we are going to continue to work with advertisers and with the research firms that are out there to work to not only get more creative but to provide more details, essentially more consumption research so that we can grow the business even more. The demand is clearly there. What you see in the advertising community, not only do you see more opportunity for, I'll call, addressable advertising, but you see a huge demand from the advertising community as well. By the way, while we're on the subject of ESPN because we've been on it a lot, so why not? I want to make one other point about it. First of all, we've said a number of times. When you think ESPN, you have to think about the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, the best package available in College Football, College Football championships, college basketball, events like them Wimbledon, U.S. Open, et cetera. The other thing you have to consider is that in many of these cases, we're only the beginning or in some cases, not even at the beginning like the NBA, of new deals that kick in. Those new deals all provide for our programming, more opportunity for content on digital platforms, which will enable us to increase consumption on digital platforms and grow that business even more, and generally, more flexibility in terms of how we distribute this product. So the NBA is a great example. You're going to have a huge increase in essentially inventory on ESPN across its platforms. So while there's definitely increase in cost, there's huge increase in terms of opportunity as well to reach more people, to serve advertisers more effectively and to grow our digital platforms."

Now turning to the quarter. We're very pleased with our performance in Q3, with record net income and earnings per share. Diluted EPS increased 13% to $1.45, and revenue was up 5% to more than $13 billion, with strong results across the board.
Since our last earnings call, we had the pleasure of unveiling the exciting details of Shanghai Disneyland. And with a 60-year history of relentless innovation, fantastic storytelling and extraordinary experiences, we're creating a truly one-of-a-kind, world-class destination. Shanghai Disneyland will have 6 theme lands, featuring the best of what everyone knows and loves about Disney parks as well as a number of amazing, original attractions, created specifically for Shanghai, resulting in an authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese Disneyland.
I'm happy to say that since we unveiled the details, the response in China has been tremendous, with nearly 150 million people expressing their excitement on the country's top social media platforms. This investment represents one of the biggest creative endeavors undertaken by the company, and with an opening plan for spring of 2016, we're truly excited by the potential in the world's most populous market.
For those of you who haven't seen the great images and details of Shanghai Disneyland, you can view them online at shanghaidisneyresort.com. And I think you'll be impressed.
Before Tom takes you through the highlights of our businesses, I'd like to address an issue that has been receiving a fair amount of interest and attention these days, and that's the rapidly changing media landscape, especially as it relates to ESPN.
We're realists about the business and about the impact technology has had on how product is distributed, marketed and consumed. We're also quite mindful of potential trends among younger audiences in particular, many of whom consume television in very different ways than the generation before them. Economics have also played a part in change in both cost and value are under a consumer microscope. All of this has, and will continue to, put pressure on the multichannel ecosystem, which has seen the decline in overall households as well as growth in so-called skinny or cable-light packages. ESPN has experienced some modest sub losses, though those have been less than reported by one of the prominent research firms. And the vast majority of them, 80%, were due to decreases in multichannel households with only a small percentage due to skinny packages.
Overall though, we believe the expanded basic package will remain the dominant package of choice for some years to come because of the quality and variety it represents for a price that is generally considered fair and appropriate.
We also see the continued development of new platforms with smaller channel offerings, which we see as a positive trend for us since ESPN is a must-have brand as part of the initial service offering for these new packages. And we all know why this is. ESPN is the #1 brand in sports media. They're one of the most valuable brands in all of sports and among the most popular, respected and valuable brands in media by consumers, advertisers and distributors. This is supported by the fact that in the first calendar quarter of this year alone, 83% of all multichannel households turn to ESPN at some point.
ESPN has the most significant collection of sports program packages in the industry and has license agreements for these sports typically run into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball. This coverage of college sports is unparalleled, particularly football and basketball, and the first year of the College Football Playoff and National Championship was an enormous success. ESPN's rights to this fantastic package have 11 years to run.
Now we all know how valuable live programming has become, and ESPN is the leader in live programming. 96% of all sports programming is watched live, and this is particularly valuable in today's rapidly changing advertising marketplace. This year's upfront provided ample proof. ESPN enjoyed both increased demand and sell-through rates as well as pricing increases.
And ESPN has embraced technology better than anyone in traditional media, reaching its fans and engaging with them in more meaningful ways online and on mobile devices, with its linear channels as well as with an array of additional programming, sports information, commentary conversation and very rich social media features. All of this adds up to a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN's future no matter how technology disrupts the media business.
Now I'll turn it over to Tom to take you through the highlights across the rest of our businesses. Tom?"

The core part of our strategy and the key source of sustained advantage for Disney is developing and leveraging our powerful brands and franchises across our many lines of business and distribution channel. Our i",733,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. The core part of our strategy and the key source of sustained advantage for Disney is developing and leveraging our powerful brands and franchises across our many lines of business and distribution channel. Our investments in Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm underscore and dramatically enhance that advantage. 
Benefit of our strategy is evident in this quarter's results as our branded content led the healthy increases in operating income in our Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products segment. Parks and Resorts had their highest quarter ever in Q3 in terms of both revenue and operating income. We've seen remarkable excitement for Disneyland's 60th anniversary Diamond Celebration, which features a new fireworks show, an electrifying nighttime parade and a reimagined World of Color spectacular, resulting in the highest attendance and profit for any quarter in the resort's history. At Walt Disney World, attendance hit a record level for Q3 while also delivering the highest profit for any previous quarter for that location.
The Studio continues to execute extremely well in our branded tenfold strategy by delivering high-quality, immensely creative and broadly appealing theatrical entertainment. 3 of the top 6 films in the U.S. this year are from Disney: Cinderella, Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron and Disney Pixar's Inside Out. And all 3 helped drive our strong results in the quarter. Inside Out has grossed $330 million in the U.S. and more than $600 million worldwide, with more overseas markets yet to open. Avengers: Age of Ultron is now the sixth highest grossing film of all time with $1.4 billion at the box office. Ant Man, the newest character to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, spent its first 2 weekends at #1 and has already grossed nearly $300 million worldwide, with multiple overseas markets yet to open. And we're extremely pleased with another great original Disney/Pixar film, The Good Dinosaur, coming this Thanksgiving. 
Of course, we're all counting the days till December 18 when Star Wars: The Force Awakens makes its much anticipated debut. That's just about 135 days and 10 hours from now, in case you're wondering.
To give you a sense of excitement for this film, a single Star Wars panel at Comic-Con this year drove 1.6 billion social and editorial impressions. Following The Force Awakens, we'll release the first standalone Star Wars film, Rogue One, which is currently in production and will be released December 16, 2016. It will be followed by Episode VIII in The Star Wars saga in May of 2017. We'll come back in 2018 with a standalone film about young Han Solo, and then Episode IX will hit theaters in 2019. And that's just the theatrical lineup. 
On August 30, we'll launch the Star Wars themed Disney Infinity 3.0 edition, followed by an unprecedented Consumer Products global event called Force Friday on September 4. Stores around the world will open their doors at 12:01 a.m. to unveil an amazing array of merchandise inspired by Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of course, Star Wars is already a strong contributor among our broad array of powerful franchises for Consumer Products business, where profits were up substantially the quarter, led by the collective strength of Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars.
Our Cable Networks benefited from strong original programming at the Disney Channel and ABC Family with both contributing nicely to Cable operating income growth in the quarter.
In Broadcasting, ABC was the only TV network with year-to-year prime time ratings growth this past season, thanks to the success of our lineup of returning and new hit shows, including Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, Black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat. ABC also received the most Emmy nominations of any broadcast network this year, 42 in all, including 10 for the critically acclaimed series, American Crime.
Looking ahead, we're optimistic about ABC's fall lineup to which advertisers have responded by agreeing to give ABC industry-leading pricing gains in our just completed upfront.
As Bob said, we're pleased with our results in Q3. We remain confident in our ability to create significant value for our shareholders. We have a lot to look forward to across all of our businesses in both the near term and the years ahead.
With that, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Christine to her new role and turn the call over to her to take you through additional details for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call, and I look forward to working with many of you more closely in the near future.
With 3 quarters of the fiscal year behind us, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing. Third quarter earnings per share increased 13% to a record $1.45, driven by strength across our businesses.
At Media Networks, growth in operating income was due to higher results at Cable, partially offset by lower results at Broadcasting. Cable operating income was higher in the third quarter due to growth at Disney Channel, ABC Family and ESPN. Disney Channel and ABC Family results benefited from program sales and higher affiliate revenue, while growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenue.
The decrease in ad revenue at ESPN was due to a difficult comparison with the men's World Cup in Q3 last year, which more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q3 this year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up a little over a little over 5% when you exclude the impact of these events. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year. Programming and production costs at cable were relatively flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectation, and we still expect these costs to be up low teen percentage points for the full year.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter as a result of contractual rate increases and the addition of the SEC Network, which launched in August of last year. These increases were partially offset by lower deferred revenue recognition at ESPN. If you recall, ESPN recognized $176 million in previously deferred revenue during Q3 last year, and there was no deferred revenue recognized in the third quarter this year. Excluding the effect of the deferred revenue recognition last year, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 12%.
Broadcasting operating income was lower in the third quarter as higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue more than offset increases in affiliate revenue and higher program sales. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to new contracts and higher contractual rates.
Program sales were up in the quarter, driven by the sale of a number of shows, including Grey's Anatomy, America's Funniest Home Videos and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down low single digits as lower news and daytime ratings were partially offset by higher rates. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the network is pacing modestly above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which saw gains in both attendance and guest spending, partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Margins were up 100 basis points to over 22%.
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4%, and per capita spending was up 2% in the third quarter due to increased spending on food and beverage and merchandise. Occupancy at our domestic resorts was up 5 percentage points to 87%, and per room spending was up 4%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations, excluding the 53rd week, are pacing up 4% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 6%.
International operations were lower in the third quarter due to a decline in attendance and occupied room nights at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. Results at Disneyland Paris were comparable to prior year. The weakness of the euro compared to prior year resulted in about $100 million adverse impact to Disneyland Paris' revenue. However, there was a corresponding benefit to expenses of roughly the same amount.
At Studio Entertainment, we delivered another strong quarter with operating income up 15% over prior year, driven by increases in theatrical distribution, reflecting the strong performance of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Cinderella and Inside Out, partially offset by the performance of Tomorrowland.
Studio results also benefited from higher revenue share from Consumer Products and growth in international television distribution. Home entertainment results were lower in the quarter as a result of a difficult comparison with the performance of Frozen in the prior year.
Our Consumer Products business continues to benefit from the depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio. Segment operating income was up 27% on revenue growth of 6%, and margins were up over 600 basis points. Growth in operating income in the quarter was due to higher results in merchandise licensing, which was driven by Frozen, The Avengers and Star Wars. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the third quarter was up 20% over last year.
At Interactive, results reflected lower performance of Disney Infinity, partially offset by higher results from our mobile games business.
We feel great about our third quarter results, and with the end of fiscal 2015 less than 2 months away, I now want to take a moment to give you an early look into fiscal 2016.
As we look ahead to 2016, there are 2 items I want to address. First, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus a number of key foreign currencies is expected to adversely impact our operating income 2016 by approximately $500 million; Second, in April of last year, we told you that we expected to grow both domestic cable affiliate revenue and cable operating income by high single digits on a compounded annual basis between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016. Due to the lower subscriber levels Bob discussed earlier, we now expect domestic cable affiliate revenue to fall a bit short of our previous expectation though still in the high single-digit range. We now expect this lower affiliate revenue and the multiyear impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate our cable operating income growth to mid-single digits during the fiscal 2013 to 2016 period.
We are disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and continue to take a balanced approach between investing in existing businesses, making strategic acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders. Our financial results over the past several years, including the record quarter we just reported, are evidence our capital allocation strategy has delivered and continues to deliver tangible results.
Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy. Last month, the board declared a dividend of $0.66 for the first half of this fiscal year, which represents an increase of 15% on an annualized basis. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends on a semi-annual basis.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $1 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 32.4 million shares for $3.2 billion, which, coupled with $3.1 billion in dividends paid this year, represents approximately $6.3 billion in capital returned to our shareholders so far in fiscal 2015. And given our outlook for next year, we currently expect to increase our level of share repurchase to between $6 million and $8 billion in fiscal 2016.
Before I turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A, I want to take a moment to say how honored I am to be the CFO of this company, and I look forward to continue working with so many great colleagues here at Disney as well as many of you in the near future."

One, you can think at it in terms of the overall television landscape and the linear MVPD expanded basic business versus the growth in so-called over-the-top businesses, or you can look at specifically with regard to ESPN. I guess I'll take the broader sort of market look first. First of all, I think while there has been a lot said about what's going on in the multichannel universe, and as I said in my comments, it's still a dominant form of television viewing. And it is the dominant form clearly for sports viewing as well. And we mentioned 83% statistic, 83% of all U.S. households watch ESPN -- U.S. multichannel households watched ESPN in the first quarter. So you're still looking at a significant amount of consumption through the multichannel universe. We also look at that business, and we look at it as a consumer offering. And we see huge variety of programming, a lot of live or kind of topical programming that's on, meaning you don't have to wait a year to watch Library [ph], for instance. I mentioned significant amount of variety and quality, obviously, for a price that's generally considered reasonable and a price that's often bundled with broadband and in some cases with telephony. So when we look at that universe, we don't really see dramatic declines over the next, say, 5 years or so. And therefore, we're not taking what I'll call radical steps to move our product into over-the-top businesses to disrupt that business because we don't think right now that it's necessarily the greatest opportunity. We just don't think it's necessary. That said, there are new platforms that are launching, some multichannel and some other types of platforms, that on the multichannel front, they all want our programming. They want ABC. They want Disney Channel. They want ESPN. There's one that has talked about launching without coming to us suggesting a desire to have us. And we're going to obviously -- because we believe that's in our best interest, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities, and at the right price under the right circumstances, license our linear channels to those platforms. In addition to that, you have the growth of platforms like Netflix or SVOD. That's interesting as well because while one could argue that for all the right reasons that starting to incentivize or maybe incentivizing people including millenials to cord cut, it's also providing us opportunities because Netflix has become a really important partner to us in buying our off-network product, buying original programming for us, the Marvel deal is a good example, and then our film library kicks in and the output deal for the 16 slate kicks in. So we look at Netflix actually right now as more a friend than foe because they've become an aggressive customer of ours. I also think that products like Netflix are pretty attractive because they offer a very user-friendly, efficient and oftentimes less -- and much less expensive way for people to watch television. I'm going to say one more thing. I realize I'm getting wordy, but the average American is watching about 5.5 hours of TV a day, and we see that going up to about 6 hours. The reason they're watching 5.5 hours of TV a day is because of what I just described. There's huge value in the multichannel product for customers, and it's popular. And the reason we believe it's going to increase from 5.5 hours to 6 is because of the advent of new technology-driven platforms, whether they're over-the-top, whether it's SVOD, whether it's new, smaller services. So it's a long way around my saying that we actually believe that with Disney, ABC, ESPN, our other products, we're really well positioned. We've been among the first, if not the first, to offer our product on new platforms even if it's somewhat disruptive. We still believe in the expanded basic service for years to come, but we're going to take advantage of opportunities. And it's just hard to say when something either feels too disruptive, too fast or not. But when we see it, we'll tell you about it."

A lot of that is obviously due to the #1 growth market in the world in terms of grosses, and that's China, where we've seen just massive increase in moviegoing over the last 2 -- even 2 to 3 years. I know a lot's been said about the window and whether technology and the opportunities to view under high-quality circumstances in the home is going to compress the theatrical window. For the kind of movies that we make, which are largely what I'll call tentpole films, we actually believe the theatrical window is incredibly important to us. And at the moment, we don't really see any need to aggressively compress it. We time our, I'll call it, the home video product that goes into the marketplace very carefully, mostly to track the retail opportunities that we have as a company, retail opportunities to both sell the movie into that window and retail opportunities to take advantage of the consumer product sales that we generally get at retail from a lot of the movies that we make. So we think that, generally, motion picture consumption is increasing in the world. It's been relatively flat in the United States, by the way. I don't think that's going to change. And for at least us, we don't really see taking steps to decrease the most -- the theatrical window because frankly, it's working for us."

First of all, on the foreign exchange, Christine talked about that overall impact for next year. But in terms of looking at international attendance right now, the -- overall, we haven't seen dramatic impact on the currency rate in terms of the total attendance. Now if we look at it, the correlation with where the economies around the world are weakest, we also see that in the attendance. So for example, the U.K. was relatively strong this past quarter. Brazil was a bit lower. And so that economic status, coupled probably with some change in the exchange rate, does have an impact. But if you look at international attendance for Q3 as an example, Q3, by the way, is perennially the lower of the quarters in terms of the national attendance percentage-wise. It was in the range that we normally experience. So we don't discern a very big impact there. With regard to the 60th, there's no question that people have responded well to the 60th. And there's obviously a lot of attachment to Disneyland, and that has led to what we talked about, which is the best quarter ever for the Disneyland Resort in terms of attendance and profitability. And so I would say that the 60th is one of the key drivers there. But it's really the new content and the product that we put in around the 60th that drives it. So at Disneyland, we expect to continue to do well going forward. And then with regard to Star Wars, as we've said, we're excited about Star Wars across the company, and Parks is no exception. So I would say stay tuned for more specifics about our plans there."

I think we have a framework for the box office, but is there any sense of sort of incremental order of magnitude you could talk to us about aside from the Force Friday impact on Consumer Products?

Anything that moves gets a lot of attention, and anticipation is obviously huge. And we've seen some examples already of Star Wars product going to the marketplace on the Consumer Products front, including in markets like China, that are very, very encouraging. That said, as enthusiastic as we are for what we know of the film, we've not seen a Star Wars film, any original ones since 2005, and there are markets around the world that are less familiar with Star Wars than, say, the United States, for instance. So while the enthusiasm is, I think, rather apparent, we just want to be careful that the world doesn't get ahead of us too much in terms of the estimates. And we've seen them as well. We're making, at this point, no estimates whatsoever in terms of what we believe the film will do. We know we have probably the most valuable film franchise that ever existed. We know we have the ability as a company to leverage it in very, very compelling ways, whether it's in Disney Infinity, whether it's at Parks, Tom cited, whether it's on the Consumer Products front or on the TV front. And we fully expect that the success of this film will reverberate throughout the company not only in 2016 but in the years beyond because we obviously have a rich slate of Star Wars films coming. So we just want to be careful here that the market doesn't get too far ahead of us or ahead of itself even on this. Let's all continue to anticipate the movie and be optimistic about it. But we have to take a wait-and-see approach in terms of what it will do. On the Shanghai front, I'm going to let Tom talk about the economic impact in '16. But there, too, like Star Wars in many ways, there's huge anticipation. As I mentioned in my comments, the reaction to what we revealed a couple of weeks ago in Shanghai was extraordinary not just in terms of the level of interest but the level of enthusiasm and the positive reaction to the fact that we're building a park that was of such scale and was so unique in many ways, particularly in its blend of what I'll call traditional Disney theme park experiences and a lot of things that are both original and very, very specifically tailored for the Chinese market."

We've actually had about 13 million folks who use the MagicBands, and they've overwhelmingly called it an excellent experience. So we're very pleased there. We intend to return -- all of those metrics that we look at are pointed in the right direction. And MyMagic+ actually was a contributor to the results positively in the quarter.

But right now, the hedges that we have in place for '17, albeit more modest than where we are for '16, they -- they're with -- they're -- right now, they look like they would benefit us in a strong dollar market. ESPN in particular, the FX issue there is separate and distinct from the $500 million that we talked about. The foreign exchange impact for ESPN is over that 3-year period. And when we talked back in 2014 at the Investor Day for that outlook, right at that point in time, the U.S. dollar had not started its significant strengthening. That was in the summer of '14.

The demand is clearly there. What you see in the advertising community, not only do you see more opportunity for, I'll call, addressable advertising, but you see a huge demand from the advertising community as well. By the way, while we're on the subject of ESPN, because we've been on it a lot, so why not, I want to make one other point about it. First of all, we've said a number of times. When you think ESPN, you have to think about the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, the best package available in college football, college football championships, college basketball, events like them Wimbledon, U.S. Open, et cetera. The other thing you have to consider is that in many of these cases, we're only at the beginning or in some cases, not even at the beginning like the NBA, of new deals that kick in. Those new deals all provide for more programming, more opportunity for content on digital platforms, which will enable us to increase consumption on digital platforms and grow that business even more and generally more flexibility in terms of how we distribute this product. So the NBA is a great example. You're going to have a huge increase in essentially inventory on ESPN across its platforms. So while there's definitely increase in cost, there's huge increase in terms of opportunity as well to reach more people, to serve advertisers more effectively and to grow our digital platforms."

And at the same time, we're maintaining financial strength and flexibility."

She's highly respected in the financial community, and her strong leadership and keen financial acumen make her ideal for the role of CFO. I'm sure you'll all have the opportunity to get to know her, and you'll be hearing from her a little later.
Now turning to the quarter. We're very pleased with our performance in Q3, with record net income and earnings per share. Diluted EPS increased 13% to $1.45, and revenue was up 5% to more than $13 billion, with strong results across the board.
Since our last earnings call, we had the pleasure of unveiling the exciting details of Shanghai Disneyland. And with a 60-year history of relentless innovation, fantastic storytelling and extraordinary experiences, we're creating a truly one-of-a-kind, world-class destination. Shanghai Disneyland will have 6 theme lands, featuring the best of what everyone knows and loves about Disney parks as well as a number of amazing, original attractions, created specifically for Shanghai, resulting in an authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese Disneyland.
I'm happy to say that since we unveiled the details, the response in China has been tremendous, with nearly 150 million people expressing their excitement on the country's top social media platforms. This investment represents one of the biggest creative endeavors undertaken by the company, and with an opening plan for spring of 2016, we're truly excited by the potential in the world's most populous market.
For those of you who haven't seen the great images and details of Shanghai Disneyland, you can view them online at shanghaidisneyresort.com. And I think you'll be impressed.
Before Tom takes you through the highlights of our businesses, I'd like to address an issue that has been receiving a fair amount of interest and attention these days, and that's the rapidly changing media landscape, especially as it relates to ESPN.
We're realists about the business and about the impact technology has had on how product is distributed, marketed and consumed. We're also quite mindful of potential trends among younger audiences in particular, many of whom consume television in very different ways than the generation before them. Economics have also played a part in change and both cost and value are under a consumer microscope. All of this has, and will continue to, put pressure on the multichannel ecosystem, which has seen the decline in overall households as well as growth in so-called skinny or cable-light packages. ESPN has experienced some modest sub losses, though those have been less than reported by one of the prominent research firms. And the vast majority of them, 80%, were due to decreases in multichannel households with only a small percentage due to skinny packages.
Overall though, we believe the expanded basic package will remain the dominant package of choice for some years to come because of the quality and variety it represents for a price that is generally considered fair and appropriate.
We also see the continued development of new platforms with smaller channel offerings, which we see as a positive trend for us since ESPN is a must-have brand as part of the initial service offering for these new packages. And we all know why this is. ESPN is the #1 brand in sports media. They're one of the most valuable brands in all of sports and among the most popular, respected and valuable brands in media by consumers, advertisers and distributors. This is supported by the fact that in the first calendar quarter of this year alone, 83% of all multichannel households turn to ESPN at some point.
ESPN has the most significant collection of sports program packages in the industry and has license agreements for these sports typically run into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball. This coverage of college sports is unparalleled, particularly football and basketball, and the first year of the College Football Playoff and National Championship was an enormous success. ESPN's rights to this fantastic package have 11 years to run.
Now we all know how valuable live programming has become, and ESPN is the leader in live programming. 96% of all sports programming is watched live, and this is particularly valuable in today's rapidly changing advertising marketplace. This year's upfront provided ample proof. ESPN enjoyed both increased demand and sell-through rates as well as pricing increases.
And ESPN has embraced technology better than anyone in traditional media, reaching its fans and engaging with them in more meaningful ways online and on mobile devices, with its linear channels as well as with an array of additional programming, sports information, commentary, conversation and very rich social media features. All of this adds up to a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN's future no matter how technology disrupts the media business.
Now I'll turn it over to Tom to take you through the highlights across the rest of our businesses. Tom?"

Our",734,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. The core part of our strategy and the key source of sustained advantage for Disney is developing and leveraging our powerful brands and franchises across our many lines of business and distribution channels. Our investments in Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm underscore and dramatically enhance that advantage. 
Benefit of our strategy is evident in this quarter's results as our branded content led the healthy increases in operating income in our Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products segment. Parks and Resorts had their highest quarter ever in Q3 in terms of both revenue and operating income. We've seen remarkable excitement for Disneyland's 60th anniversary Diamond Celebration, which features a new fireworks show, an electrifying nighttime parade and a reimagined World of Color spectacular, resulting in the highest attendance and profit for any quarter in the resort's history. At Walt Disney World, attendance hit a record level for Q3 while also delivering the highest profit for any previous quarter for that location.
The Studio continues to execute extremely well in our branded tent pole strategy by delivering high-quality, immensely creative and broadly appealing theatrical entertainment. 3 of the top 6 films in the U.S. this year are from Disney: Cinderella, Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron and Disney Pixar's Inside Out. And all 3 helped drive our strong results in the quarter. Inside Out has grossed $330 million in the U.S. and more than $600 million worldwide, with more overseas markets yet to open. Avengers: Age of Ultron is now the sixth highest grossing film of all time with $1.4 billion at the box office. Ant Man, the newest character to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, spent its first 2 weekends at #1 and has already grossed nearly $300 million worldwide, with multiple overseas markets yet to open. And we're extremely pleased with another great original Disney/Pixar film, The Good Dinosaur, coming this Thanksgiving. 
Of course, we're all counting the days till December 18 when Star Wars: The Force Awakens makes its much anticipated debut. That's just about 135 days and 10 hours from now, in case you're wondering.
To give you a sense of excitement for this film, a single Star Wars panel at Comic-Con this year drove 1.6 billion social and editorial impressions. Following The Force Awakens, we'll release the first standalone Star Wars film, Rogue One, which is currently in production and will be released December 16, 2016. It will be followed by Episode VIII in The Star Wars saga in May of 2017. We'll come back in 2018 with a standalone film about young Han Solo, and then Episode IX will hit theaters in 2019. And that's just the theatrical lineup. 
On August 30, we'll launch the Star Wars themed Disney Infinity 3.0 edition, followed by an unprecedented Consumer Products global event called Force Friday on September 4. Stores around the world will open their doors at 12:01 a.m. to unveil an amazing array of merchandise inspired by Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of course, Star Wars is already a strong contributor among our broad array of powerful franchises for Consumer Products business, where profits were up substantially the quarter, led by the collective strength of Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars.
Our Cable Networks benefited from strong original programming at the Disney Channel and ABC Family with both contributing nicely to Cable operating income growth in the quarter.
In Broadcasting, ABC was the only TV network with year-to-year prime time ratings growth this past season, thanks to the success of our lineup of returning and new hit shows, including Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, Black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat. ABC also received the most Emmy nominations of any broadcast network this year, 42 in all, including 10 for the critically acclaimed series, American Crime.
Looking ahead, we're optimistic about ABC's fall lineup to which advertisers have responded by agreeing to give ABC industry-leading pricing gains in our just completed upfront.
As Bob said, we're pleased with our results in Q3. We remain confident in our ability to create significant value for our shareholders. We have a lot to look forward to across all of our businesses in both the near term and the years ahead.
With that, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Christine to her new role and turn the call over to her to take you through additional details for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call, and I look forward to working with many of you more closely in the near future.
With 3 quarters of the fiscal year behind us, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing. Third quarter earnings per share increased 13% to a record $1.45, driven by strength across our businesses.
At Media Networks, growth in operating income was due to higher results at Cable, partially offset by lower results at Broadcasting. Cable operating income was higher in the third quarter due to growth at Disney Channel, ABC Family and ESPN. Disney Channel and ABC Family results benefited from program sales and higher affiliate revenue, while growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenue.
The decrease in ad revenue at ESPN was due to a difficult comparison with the men's World Cup in Q3 last year, which more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q3 this year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up a little over a little over 5% when you exclude the impact of these events. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year. Programming and production costs at cable were relatively flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectation, and we still expect these costs to be up low teen percentage points for the full year.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter as a result of contractual rate increases and the addition of the SEC Network, which launched in August of last year. These increases were partially offset by lower deferred revenue recognition at ESPN. If you recall, ESPN recognized $176 million in previously deferred revenue during Q3 last year, and there was no deferred revenue recognized in the third quarter this year. Excluding the effect of the deferred revenue recognition last year, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 12%.
Broadcasting operating income was lower in the third quarter as higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue more than offset increases in affiliate revenue and higher program sales. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to new contracts and higher contractual rates.
Program sales were up in the quarter, driven by the sale of a number of shows, including Grey's Anatomy, America's Funniest Home Videos and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down low single digits as lower news and daytime ratings were partially offset by higher rates. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the network is pacing modestly above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which saw gains in both attendance and guest spending, partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Margins were up 100 basis points to over 22%.
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4%, and per capita spending was up 2% in the third quarter due to increased spending on food and beverage and merchandise. Occupancy at our domestic resorts was up 5 percentage points to 87%, and per room spending was up 4%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations, excluding the 53rd week, are pacing up 4% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 6%.
International operations were lower in the third quarter due to a decline in attendance and occupied room nights at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. Results at Disneyland Paris were comparable to prior year. The weakness of the euro compared to prior year resulted in about $100 million adverse impact to Disneyland Paris' revenue. However, there was a corresponding benefit to expenses of roughly the same amount.
At Studio Entertainment, we delivered another strong quarter with operating income up 15% over prior year, driven by increases in theatrical distribution, reflecting the strong performance of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Cinderella and Inside Out, partially offset by the performance of Tomorrowland.
Studio results also benefited from higher revenue share from Consumer Products and growth in international television distribution. Home entertainment results were lower in the quarter as a result of a difficult comparison with the performance of Frozen in the prior year.
Our Consumer Products business continues to benefit from the depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio. Segment operating income was up 27% on revenue growth of 6%, and margins were up over 600 basis points. Growth in operating income in the quarter was due to higher results in merchandise licensing, which was driven by Frozen, The Avengers and Star Wars. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the third quarter was up 20% over last year.
At Interactive, results reflected lower performance of Disney Infinity, partially offset by higher results from our mobile games business.
We feel great about our third quarter results, and with the end of fiscal 2015 less than 2 months away, I now want to take a moment to give you an early look into fiscal 2016.
As we look ahead to 2016, there are 2 items I want to address. First, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus a number of key foreign currencies is expected to adversely impact our operating income in 2016 by approximately $500 million; Second, in April of last year, we told you that we expected to grow both domestic cable affiliate revenue and cable operating income by high single digits on a compounded annual basis between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016. Due to the lower subscriber levels Bob discussed earlier, we now expect domestic cable affiliate revenue to fall a bit short of our previous expectation though still in the high single-digit range. We now expect this lower affiliate revenue and the multiyear impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate our cable operating income growth to mid-single digits during the fiscal 2013 to 2016 period.
We are disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and continue to take a balanced approach between investing in existing businesses, making strategic acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders. Our financial results over the past several years, including the record quarter we just reported, are evidence our capital allocation strategy has delivered and continues to deliver tangible results.
Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy. Last month, the board declared a dividend of $0.66 for the first half of this fiscal year, which represents an increase of 15% on an annualized basis. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends on a semi-annual basis.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $1 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 32.4 million shares for $3.2 billion, which, coupled with $3.1 billion in dividends paid this year, represents approximately $6.3 billion in capital returned to our shareholders so far in fiscal 2015. And given our outlook for next year, we currently expect to increase our level of share repurchase to between $6 million and $8 billion in fiscal 2016.
Before I turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A, I want to take a moment to say how honored I am to be the CFO of this company, and I look forward to continue working with so many great colleagues here at Disney as well as many of you in the near future."

One, you can think at it in terms of the overall television landscape and the linear MVPD expanded basic business versus the growth in so-called over-the-top businesses, or you can look at specifically with regard to ESPN. I guess I'll take the broader sort of market look first. First of all, I think while there has been a lot said about what's going on in the multichannel universe, and as I said in my comments, it's still a dominant form of television viewing. And it is the dominant form clearly for sports viewing as well. And we mentioned 83% statistic, 83% of all U.S. households watch ESPN -- U.S. multichannel households watched ESPN in the first quarter. So you're still looking at a significant amount of consumption through the multichannel universe. We also look at that business, and we look at it as a consumer offering. And we see huge variety of programming, a lot of live or kind of topical programming that's on, meaning you don't have to wait a year to watch Library [ph], for instance. I mentioned significant amount of variety and quality, obviously, for a price that's generally considered reasonable and a price that's often bundled with broadband and in some cases with telephony. So when we look at that universe, we don't really see dramatic declines over the next, say, 5 years or so. And therefore, we're not taking what I'll call radical steps to move our product into over-the-top businesses to disrupt that business because we don't think right now that it's necessarily the greatest opportunity. We just don't think it's necessary. That said, there are new platforms that are launching, some multichannel and some other types of platforms, that on the multichannel front, they all want our programming. They want ABC. They want Disney Channel. They want ESPN. There's one that has talked about launching without coming to us suggesting a desire to have us. And we're going to obviously -- because we believe that's in our best interest, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities, and at the right price under the right circumstances, license our linear channels to those platforms. In addition to that, you have the growth of platforms like Netflix or SVOD. That's interesting as well because while one could argue that for all the right reasons that starting to incentivize or maybe incentivizing people including millenials to cord cut, it's also providing us opportunities because Netflix has become a really important partner to us in buying our off-network product, buying original programming for us, the Marvel deal is a good example, and then our film library kicks in and the output deal for the 16 slate kicks in. So we look at Netflix actually right now as more a friend than foe because they've become an aggressive customer of ours. I also think that products like Netflix are pretty attractive because they offer a very user-friendly, efficient and oftentimes less -- and much less expensive way for people to watch television. I'm going to say one more thing. I realize I'm getting wordy, but the average American is watching about 5.5 hours of TV a day, and we see that going up to about 6 hours. The reason they're watching 5.5 hours of TV a day is because of what I just described. There's huge value in the multichannel product for customers, and it's popular. And the reason we believe it's going to increase from 5.5 hours to 6 is because of the advent of new technology-driven platforms, whether they're over-the-top, whether it's SVOD, whether it's new, smaller services. So it's a long way around my saying that we actually believe that with Disney, ABC, ESPN, our other products, we're really well positioned. We've been among the first, if not the first, to offer our product on new platforms even if it's somewhat disruptive. We still believe in the expanded basic service for years to come, but we're going to take advantage of opportunities. And it's just hard to say when something either feels too disruptive, too fast or not. But when we see it, we'll tell you about it."

A lot of that is obviously due to the #1 growth market in the world in terms of grosses, and that's China, where we've seen just massive increase in moviegoing over the last 2 -- even 2 to 3 years. I know a lot's been said about the window and whether technology and the opportunities to view under high-quality circumstances in the home is going to compress the theatrical window. For the kind of movies that we make, which are largely what I'll call tentpole films, we actually believe the theatrical window is incredibly important to us. And at the moment, we don't really see any need to aggressively compress it. We time our, I'll call it, the home video product that goes into the marketplace very carefully, mostly to track the retail opportunities that we have as a company, retail opportunities to both sell the movie into that window and retail opportunities to take advantage of the consumer product sales that we generally get at retail from a lot of the movies that we make. So we think that, generally, motion picture consumption is increasing in the world. It's been relatively flat in the United States, by the way. I don't think that's going to change. And for at least us, we don't really see taking steps to decrease the most -- the theatrical window because frankly, it's working for us."

First of all, on the foreign exchange, Christine talked about that overall impact for next year. But in terms of looking at international attendance right now, the -- overall, we haven't seen dramatic impact on the currency rate in terms of the total attendance. Now if we look at it, the correlation with where the economies around the world are weakest, we also see that in the attendance. So for example, the U.K. was relatively strong this past quarter. Brazil was a bit lower. And so that economic status, coupled probably with some change in the exchange rate, does have an impact. But if you look at international attendance for Q3 as an example, Q3, by the way, is perennially the lower of the quarters in terms of  international attendance percentage-wise. It was in the range that we normally experience. So we don't discern a very big impact there. With regard to the 60th, there's no question that people have responded well to the 60th. And there's obviously a lot of attachment to Disneyland, and that has led to what we talked about, which is the best quarter ever for the Disneyland Resort in terms of attendance and profitability. And so I would say that the 60th is one of the key drivers there. But it's really the new content and the product that we put in around the 60th that drives it. So at Disneyland, we expect to continue to do well going forward. And then with regard to Star Wars, as we've said, we're excited about Star Wars across the company, and Parks is no exception. So I would say stay tuned for more specifics about our plans there."

I think we have a framework for the box office, but is there any sense of sort of incremental order of magnitude you could talk to us about aside from the Force Friday impact on Consumer Products?

Anything that moves gets a lot of attention, and anticipation is obviously huge. And we've seen some examples already of Star Wars product going to the marketplace on the Consumer Products front, including in markets like China, that are very, very encouraging. That said, as enthusiastic as we are for what we know of the film, we've not seen a Star Wars film, any original ones since 2005, and there are markets around the world that are less familiar with Star Wars than, say, the United States, for instance. So while the enthusiasm is, I think, rather apparent, we just want to be careful that the world doesn't get ahead of us too much in terms of the estimates. And we've seen them as well. We're making, at this point, no estimates whatsoever in terms of what we believe the film will do. We know we have probably the most valuable film franchise that ever existed. We know we have the ability as a company to leverage it in very, very compelling ways, whether it's in Disney Infinity, whether it's at Parks, Tom cited, whether it's on the Consumer Products front or on the TV front. And we fully expect that the success of this film will reverberate throughout the company not only in 2016 but in the years beyond because we obviously have a rich slate of Star Wars films coming. So we just want to be careful here that the market doesn't get too far ahead of us or ahead of itself even on this. Let's all continue to anticipate the movie and be optimistic about it. But we have to take a wait-and-see approach in terms of what it will do. On the Shanghai front, I'm going to let Tom talk about the economic impact in '16. But there, too, like Star Wars in many ways, there's huge anticipation. As I mentioned in my comments, the reaction to what we revealed a couple of weeks ago in Shanghai was extraordinary not just in terms of the level of interest but the level of enthusiasm and the positive reaction to the fact that we're building a park that was of such scale and was so unique in many ways, particularly in its blend of what I'll call traditional Disney theme park experiences and a lot of things that are both original and very, very specifically tailored for the Chinese market."

We've actually had about 13 million folks who use the MagicBands, and they've overwhelmingly called it an excellent experience. So we're very pleased there. We intend to return -- all of those metrics that we look at are pointed in the right direction. And MyMagic+ actually was a contributor to the results positively in the quarter.

So if there were changes in different directions during the year, we would continue layering in, during '16, for '17. But right now, the hedges that we have in place for '17, albeit more modest than where we are for '16, they -- they're with -- they're -- right now, they look like they would benefit us in a strong dollar market. ESPN in particular, the FX issue there is separate and distinct from the $500 million that we talked about. The foreign exchange impact for ESPN is over that 3-year period. And when we talked back in 2014 at the Investor Day for that outlook, right at that point in time, the U.S. dollar had not started its significant strengthening. That was in the summer of '14. So during that period, the dollar has significantly strengthened across a number of key currencies for our cable nets, including the yen, the euro, the pound as well as the Brazilian real.

In ESPN's case, as we've said before, they package their ad sales across all of their platforms. They're -- basically they're linear, more analog platforms as well as all their digital platforms. And platforms like radio and even their magazine. But we think that there's going to be tremendous growth from a percentage basis of digital, and we are going to continue to work with advertisers and with the research firms that are out there to work to not only get more creative but to provide more details, essentially more consumption research so that we can grow the business even more. The demand is clearly there. What you see in the advertising community, not only do you see much more opportunity for, I'll call, addressable advertising, but you see a huge demand from the advertising community as well. By the way, while we're on the subject of ESPN, because we've been on it a lot, so why not, I want to make one other point about it. First of all, we've said a number of times. When you think ESPN, you have to think about the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, the best package available in college football, college football championships, college basketball, events like them Wimbledon, U.S. Open, et cetera. The other thing you have to consider is that in many of these cases, we're only at the beginning or in some cases, not even at the beginning like the NBA, of new deals that kick in. Those new deals all provide for more programming, more opportunity for content on digital platforms, which will enable us to increase consumption on digital platforms and grow that business even more and generally more flexibility in terms of how we distribute this product. So the NBA is a great example. You're going to have a huge increase in essentially inventory on ESPN across its platforms. So while there's definitely increase in cost, there's huge increase in terms of opportunity as well to reach more people, to serve advertisers more effectively and to grow our digital platforms."

We're very pleased with our results in Q4, with adjusted EPS of $1.20, up 35% over the prior year. The strong performance capped our fifth consecutive year of record results, including historic revenue and net income and adjusted EPS up 19% to an all-time high of $5.15. These results reflect the collective talent and commitment of our employees and cast members around the world, and I'm both proud of their achievements and grateful for their contributions.
Our performance continues to demonstrate the incredible strength of our brands and franchises, the extraordinary quality and robust pipeline of our creative content, our commitment to constant evolution as we adapt to emerging consumer trends and technology and our unique, proven ability to leverage creative assets across our entire company to drive significant long-term value.
And Star Wars is an obvious example. We're still 6 weeks away from releasing the first new film in a decade, but you can already see the impact and value of that franchise in various businesses. We have Star Wars products in numerous Retail categories, especially Toys & Games, and the huge global response to the brief glimpse of new merchandise we revealed on Force Friday in September, suggest that demand will only grow with the release of new movies. A new generation is connecting with Star Wars through Disney XD's animated series Star Wars Rebels, and fans and gamers around the world are anxiously amazing awaiting the November 17 release of the highly anticipated Star Wars: Battlefront. From EA, praised as the ultimate Star Wars gaming experience. 
We're expanding the franchise in our Parks and Resorts, adding Star Wars theme lands in Disneyland and Disney World and we're also using digital platforms to familiarize global consumers with the franchise and to market the film in truly innovative ways.
And of course, we're very excited about the December 18 of release of Star Wars The Force Awakens. And as the reaction to the trailers and ticket presales are any indication, we're not the only ones. J.J. Abrams and his cast and crew have delivered in truly epic adventure, but what's even more excited to watch is that this movie is only the beginning of a new generation of phenomenal Star Wars storytelling. We'll have 3 new Star Wars films in theaters between now and the end of 2017, with even more to come.
One of our greatest strengths is our willingness to embrace change and adapt to new trends and technology to create extraordinary experiences that are relevant to consumers. That's especially true in the media space. From our perspective, there are 3 key elements that are essential for success in media today: first, you have to have a quality product, preferably high-quality, branded product; next, you need to create a fantastic user experience with incredible interface and navigation, you have to make the service easy to use and the content easy to find; and the third essential element is mobility. Consumers now dictate where they want to access media and it's essential for legacy distributors to crack the mobile code. The demand for great content is stronger than ever when consumers are demanding a better user experience and they're migrating to platforms and services that deliver it. 
Because of our great brands and franchises, we're uniquely positioned to use new platforms to reach more people, and to do so in more compelling ways. And we intend to use these platforms to augment distribution and connect with consumers more directly.
In Disney Live, our new Direct-To-Consumer service in the U.K. is a perfect example. Launching later this month, Disney Live will give users unprecedented access to the vast universe of Disney storytelling, including hundreds of movies and thousands of TV episodes, as well as music, books and more. It delivers a great experience with an incredible degree of personalization, including the ability to watch and read in several different languages. The Disney branded content is fantastic. The user-friendly interface is very Interactive and intuitive and it's designed to be mobile, with apps for iOS and Android. So we're 3 for 3. 
We're very proud of this product. It definitely speaks to where we're going as a company and we see opportunities to grow the concept across other markets and perhaps other brands in the future. We're proud of our results this year and believe our continued strong performance validates our long-term strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. 
Tom will take you through some of the highlights, and then we'll turn it over to Christine to walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and talk about some trends going forward. Tom?"

As the media landscape continues to evolve, our uniquely valuable collection of in-demand brands and content puts us in a great position to deliver extraordinary experiences across platforms in ways that Bob just discussed. By doing so, we have the opportunity to increase our engagement and deepen our connection with consumers. 
ESPN is a perfect example. The brand is stronger than ever, thanks to largest array of sports properties in the industry and ESPN's well-earned reputation among sports fans for consistently overdelivering especially when it comes to live sports. In fiscal 2015, ESPN was the #1 full-time cable network in all major demos, delivering more than half of the year's top 50 cable telecasts. ESPN's first College Football Playoff actually delivered the biggest audiences in cable history, as well as an 83% ratings increase over the prior year's world championship series.
In addition to having the best portfolio of sports rights in the business, ESPN has been a multiplatform pioneer for years, leveraging technology to keep fans connected to the best in sports wherever they are. Watch ESPN remains one of the most elegant and user-friendly mobile services in the market today. And ESPN continues to innovate, creating enhancing a very robust suite of services that are praised by sports fans across the country.
At September alone, 94.4 million fans 10.3 billion minutes engaging with ESPN on digital platforms, setting a new record for unique visitors and engagement in the sports category. 
The demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is incredibly strong and no matter how they choose to engage, sports fans continue to trust ESPN to provide the best overall best overall experience and the marquee events that matter most.
Turning to our studios, our strategic focus on high-quality branded movies continues to drive value across our businesses. Since the respective acquisitions by Disney, Pixar released an average roughly $660 million in global box office, and Marvel Films has averaged $820 million, and that success continues. The global box office receipts for Pixar's Inside Out are over $845 million to date. And Marvel's Ant Man has totaled $515 million worldwide so far, exceeding the global box office totals on original films for both Thor and Captain America. 
In addition to Star Wars movies Bob mentioned, we have is a spectacular slate of releases scheduled for 2016, representing our full array of fantastic brands, starting with the release of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur later this month. Disney Animation's Zootopia opens next March, followed by Disney's live-action adventure, The Jungle Book in April. In May, we'll release Marvel's Captain America:  Civil War. And later that month, Johnny Depp returns as the mad Hatter in Alice: Through the Looking Glass. Then with Pixar's Finding Nemo will finally get their wish for a sequel when Finding Dory opens in June. 
We've successfully introduced some fantastic but lesser-known superheroes into the Marvel cinematic universe with last year's Guardians of the Galaxy and again, with Ant Man this year. And we're looking forward to doing the same with Doctor Strange next year. 
We also have another great movie in Disney Animation, Moana, which will be in theaters for families to enjoy about  year from now. 
I've been with Disney a long time and I can't remember a movie slate that comes close to this one. It truly reflects the strength of the unprecedented pipeline of extraordinary content being generated under unparalleled portfolio of brands.
One of things we're mostly -- in 2016, of course, is the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next spring. We're well down the road to the construction of this spectacular, world-class destination in the most populous city and the most populous country on earth. 
As Bob has said, we committed ourselves to making this resort authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese. We were just there last week and it's extremely gratifying to see how well we're delivering on that promise. The park features some of the best in Disney storytelling and innovation we've ever achieved and our collaboration with Chinese cultural experts, creative talent and artisans is apparent throughout. 
At this point of construction, all the major structures and landmarks are in place. You'd really get a sense of the phenomenal experience in store for our guests when they walk through the gates of the spectacular destination next spring. From the grand scale to the smallest detail, it's absolutely extraordinary and it's something only the Walt Disney Company could create. 
We begun holding a number of job fairs in China to find the talent we need to deliver the world-class experience guests expect from Disney. And response had been overwhelmingly positive. There's a palpable excitement in China by Shanghai Disney, one with a great deal of pride all of which we share. 
And now Christine will talk you through the details of our performance, then we'll take your questions. Christine?"

Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.20, an increase of 35% over last year and for the full year, were a record $5.15. Fourth quarter and full year results benefited",1500,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.20, an increase of 35% over last year and for the full year, were a record $5.15. Fourth quarter and full year results benefited from an additional week of operations and our fiscal calendar this year. Our fiscal 2015 earnings represent a record for the company, even after excluding the estimated effect of the 53rd week. The financial results this quarter and for the full year demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail and then I'll highlight some factors that will impact our results in fiscal 2016.
Studio Entertainment had another record year, with almost $2 billion in operating income in fiscal 2015, 27% higher than last year. This is a business that only 2 years ago generated less than $700 million in operating income, so the growth demonstrates the power of the investments we've and our ability to execute against our strategy. The success of the studio has been broad-based due to an unrivaled portfolio of film properties and our unique ability to take this great content and monetize it across multiple windows and businesses. 
Studio operating income more than doubled in the fourth quarter compared to last year due to growth in television distribution and higher worldwide theatrical results. Theatrical results reflected the performance of Inside Out and Ant Man in the fourth quarter compared to the performance of prior year releases, which included Guardians of the Galaxy and Maleficent. Studio operating income also benefited from lower impairments in the quarter compared to prior year. 
At Media Networks, growth in operating income in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in cable, while Broadcasting results were in line with the prior year quarter.
Growth in cable operating income was driven by ESPN and to a lot lesser extent, worldwide Disney Channel and higher equity income from A&E. The increase at ESPN was driven by the benefit of the 53rd week and higher affiliate and advertising revenue. 
Programming costs were relatively flat in the quarter as higher costs for a full quarter of the SEC Network, additional U.S. Open Tennis rights and contractual increases for Major League Baseball and the NFL were offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR. 
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 17% in the quarter and up 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the quarter. Two factors affect the comparability of ESPN's ad growth in the quarter: the 53rd week; and the absence of the men's World Cup. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% when you exclude the net impact of these 2 factors. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up significantly compared to last year, reflecting a very strong advertising marketplace for sports and the timing of key college football ballgames. The 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff ballgame including the 2 semifinal games will air in the first fiscal quarter this year, whereas these games aired during the fiscal second quarter last year.
Broadcasting operating income was comparable to the prior year quarter as higher affiliate and advertising revenue were largely offset by larger higher programming costs and increasing equity losses driven by Hulu and lower income from program sales compared to the prior year. 
Programming costs were higher in the quarter due to an extra week of programming as well as an increase in marketing spend to support the launch of the fall season. The extra week had minimal impact to Broadcasting's operating income for the quarter as the extra week of ad sales was roughly equal to the incremental programming spend.
Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up midteens percent in the fourth quarter. Excluding the extra week, ad revenue was up mid-single-digit. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 16% above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, the investments we've made in our domestic parks continue to drive higher guest visitation. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 15% in the quarter and up 7% excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. Disneyland in particular saw very strong attendance growth due to tremendous excitement for the 60th anniversary celebration. Per capita spending was up 1% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7% and occupancy was up one percentage point to 84%.
Operating income growth at our domestic operations was due to the benefit of an additional week along with higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic theme parks, partially offset by higher costs.
Operating income at our international operations was lower in the quarter due to a decline at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher preopening expenses for Shanghai Disney Resort. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 5% compared to prior year levels while book rates are up 8%.
At Consumer Products, operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as a result of growth in our licensing business, partially offset by higher marketing costs. Growth in licensing was driven by sales of Star Wars Classic, Avengers and Frozen merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 9%. Licensing revenue and the 9% earned licensing revenue growth I just mentioned, do not reflect the revenue from Q4 sales of Star Wars: Episode VII merchandise, which we cannot recognize until the film is released.
During the fourth quarter, the market presented us with an opportunity to repurchase our shares at very attractive levels. We repurchased almost 31 million shares for $3.3 billion in the quarter, bringing our fiscal 2015 share repurchase to about 60 million shares for approximately $6.1 billion.
We've talked for a long time about the benefit of having a strong balance sheet. Our ability to significantly increase our pace of repurchase this quarter is a great example of this. Over the past 5 years, we have been able to repurchase about $25 billion of our stock at an average price of roughly $58 per share, and we have accomplished this while actively investing for future growth and without compromising the strength of our balance sheet and the financial flexibility it provides. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to buying back our stock and we still expect to repurchase between $6 billion to $8 billion during fiscal 2016.
Turning to fiscal 2016, I now want to highlight a couple of time and comparability items and also provides an insight into our CapEx plan for the year. In fiscal 2016, ESPN does not have any major new sports rights contract kicking in, so we expect total cable programming and production cost to be up low to mid-single digits for the year. Earlier, I mentioned that the 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff ballgames will air in fiscal Q1 this year compared to fiscal Q2 last year. As a result, the costs associated with these games will shift into Q1, so we expect total cable programming and production cost to be up high teens in Q1 and to be down high teens in Q2. 
At Parks and Resorts, quarterly results will be impacted by a shift in the timing of the New Year and Easter holiday period due to our fiscal calendar. The entire New Year's holiday period will fall in Q1 in fiscal 2016, whereas about a week of the holiday period fell in Q2 last year. We estimate this will shift about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in Q2 last year. 
The Easter holiday period will fall during the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, we will recognize about $90 million in operating income in Q2 this year that we recognized in Q3 last year. 
We have demonstrated our ability to deploy capital profitably across the company, including at Parks and Resorts. We have announced a number of new Parks and Resorts projects that will be underway during fiscal 2016. As a result, these projects will collectively drive an increase in total company CapEx of about $800 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
As Tom discussed, we are very excited to open Shanghai Disney Resort later this fiscal year. As we've said in the past, preopening expenses will ramp-up considerably, and we estimate these preopening expenses to be a little under $300 million in 2016.
Fiscal 2015 was another great year for the company. Given the strength of our brand and a relentless focus on creativity and innovation, we will continue to execute against our strategy, which should benefit shareholders in 2016 and in the years to come. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A."

Well, regarding your first question, there's nothing that I will either retract or any way change. To just reiterate what we did, we updated guidance that we have given in 2014 about ESPN's sub fees, and that guidance holds today. We also did say it to be candid, I think maybe refreshingly so, about what the industry was experiencing in terms of sub losses during roughly the last period. And we feel that there certainly should be reason to panic over comments like that. The fact remains that we're in an environment today that's definitely changing, it's different than the environment before. There's a lot more competition for people's time. With that, interestingly enough, we have an opportunity to distribute our content in many different ways than we ever have before -- in more different place than we ever had before. So there's not only a silver lining but there's a glass half-full perspective on this and that's what we have. We also know, specifically related to ESPN, that not only is the brand strong, which is evident by the way of the ratings, 50 of the top cable shows in fiscal 2015 -- of the 50 top cable shows in fiscal 2015, 26 were ESPN's. And in addition to that, live television and live sports in particular is incredibly strong in this environment. Demand for it's probably be greater interestingly enough. So that's I guess a long way around my saying that we don't have anything to really add to the comments that we made.We feel bullish about ESPN and ESPN's business. We like the environment because we think long term, it gives us more opportunities. I should also add that ESPN has been at the forefront of using technology to create more compelling product for its consumers and to be present on more platforms. In terms of your second question, Michael, we really don't comment specifically about aspects of the negotiations or the deals that we have with the multichannel distributors. I can only say specifically related to your question that, that article was not factually correct."

far more rich and textured and a better user interface, which is really important. I'm going to come back to that, Alexia. It has hundreds of movies, thousands of TV shows, songs, books and games. And we like the concept from a consumer proposition perspective, we believe there will be other opportunities outside of the U.K. and we believe there'll be other opportunities that for some of our other brands, but we're not rushing into that right now. I also think what you're seeing in the multichannel environment is you're probably seeing some attrition, which is always the case, from current large bundle subscribers. Most of that is due to economic factors. At the same time, we think it's possible that young people are not signing up as quickly as they once did, and we think that points to a pretty interesting dynamic, and that relates to cost and user experience. And we think that the primary ingredients for success in media today is, one, you got to have great product. We certainly have that. The user interface has to be great, and that means easy-to-find, easy-to-use product, and we challenge all the legacy distributors to distribute -- to deliver that because we think that could be one of the factors in terms of why young people aren't signing up. And the third thing is mobility. People want to watch these channels and these programs on mobile devices. And frankly, the experience, when you try to do that as a multichannel subscriber, is not as easy or as good as it needs to be. So they're being challenged by these new entrants. And we're seizing the opportunity to basically distribute that content with these new entrants because we think we deliver better user experiences. And the price to value relationship, particularly for some of the smaller bundles that are out there, also tends to be attractive to younger people. So we're going to continue to continue to look for opportunities. We like the trend. We think that the more, the merrier in terms of new platforms. And it's clear also and Sony View is a great example of that, that these platforms cannot launch successfully without the array of channels that he provides a. And they came to was to negotiate a deal launch because it was clear that the product they had launched was not getting -- was not penetrating the marketplace as much as I think they expected, and they needed ESPN, Disney and ABC.

We continue to be impressed with the buzz that we see whenever we go to China. And you're right, we were there last week and 3 weeks before that. And it is, in fact, the talk of the town, and we think for good reason. Not only is it highly anticipated as a product, but interest in Disney is significantly higher now than it's ever been, thanks in part to the growth in the movie industry. So we think this is a big event. We love what it represents in many levels. More than anything else, we think it's a great opportunity for us to grow our business in Asia and particularly in China.

One, it's a strong Disney market, huge affinity for the Disney brand, and so we wanted to test this in a market where there was already strong brand affinity. Second, we looked carefully at what was available to us to put on this platform because we obviously have to factor in, speaking of flexibility, by the way, deals that already exist that encumber us from getting access to the product to sell on our own. And we had an opportunity to bring this to market in a manner that worked in relation to the product available and the deal that we have mostly with Sky in the U.K. And we're doing this because when you look at technology today, and I know that Apple referred to this when it announced its Apple TV product, the app experience is -- I'll call it 3D experience versus the 2D experience that linear television offers. Because you can go to an app and you can choose from a menu of multiple choices in terms of media, and you can essentially use it in ways that we think are far more compelling and typically a better user experience. And I mentioned that earlier. I can't emphasize that enough. I think today's consumer when they're faced with the user experience that is subpar where, they just can't find anything, they can't navigate things or they find them and they don't -- they just don't work well, you don't keep the consumer. It used to be you don't keep a consumer happy. Now it's you don't keep the consumer because they have other choices. So we like the app-based experience. We're also very interested in taking product directly to consumers as a company. If you look at the profile of this company, outside of the Disney Stores and our theme park business, the customers that buy Disney typically buy through third parties. There's nothing wrong with that, by the way. We do great business with movie theater chains and big box retailers and multichannel distributors. But given the way that the world is and what technology makes available and given the passion that our customers have for our brands: Marvel, Disney, Pixar, ESPN, Star Wars, we have an opportunity to reach the consumer directly in ways that our competitors can't come close to doing. So it is a competitive advantage and it is an opportunity that technology is providing us and it's something ultimately that you'll see more of, both from a consumer proposition perspective and from a company perspective. The pricing, we debated a lot about. We're going to market with a price that we think reflects the value of the product that we're offering and the experience that we're offering. I can't tell you that you're absolutely certain it's the right price. It's a price that we decided to take it out to the market with. And we have -- what we do know is we've created an elegant product, it's a really good user experience. We love the look, the feel, the navigation. And we'll see. It also has the ability to provide the content in multi-languages for instance, and so you can imagine the opportunities in terms of other markets both in Europe and the rest of the world. And it is also a technology we can use for those other brands."

The first live streaming cable app, the first streaming broadcast network app, the first iTunes episodic content deal, probably the first to sign a light domestic streaming in cable product. Now the first to do with direct consumer branded subscription product in the U.K. So clearly, you're comfortable with this. I guess the question is does thought leadership and flexibility though mean at some point you're going to have the ability to move in the opposite direction, right? And that all of these things that have worked so well for you have essentially allowed you to sell what you already have for more money? An authenticated app, you're sort of making more money and you're not breaking up the bundle. Do you think we're at a point where the sale of SVOD content, given the way it fragments the audience, could ultimately be damaging the ecosystem such as that you might use flexibly to pull content back from that platform?

I'll comment on that and then I'll comment on to the real -- the crux of the matter or the question. I would -- I'm struck with something that Steve Jobs once said when he was asked about technology and how he complementing how he developed it. And he said that he starts with a consumer and he works backward to technology. And we're actually doing that, too. We're thinking about the consumer. And the consumer today is a different consumer than before. They don't just want to sit in their the living room on a couch and watch our product on a fixed screen on the wall with a remote control in their hand. They want to do it in many more ways, and they have the authority, thanks to technology, to make those decisions. So we're starting with what we believe the consumer wants. Every one of those examples that you used, which sounds like a strategic initiative for the company, is actually a strategic initiative for the consumer. That's -- it's really that simple. And this is a company that has been consumer-facing from the start. And I think actually when you look at what we do with our parks, it's a great example of that. And all of these things that we're doing we have the -- we're trying to take a very, very expansive look at the consumer today and for that consumer is going, particularly the younger consumer. So second, as it relates to -- well, maybe in a strange way, flexibility. All of these things are designed to obviously create product that we think ultimately benefits the shareholders of The Walt Disney Company but also to learn from. And if we take product out that may work in a given time but long term have a negative impact on brand -- on businesses or business models that can continue to create more value for us, then we'll retract and we'll cut back. We don't want to -- look, we've got a lot of the good things going for rest. And in reality, the multichannel business model, while facing more competition than ever before, is still a huge driver of value for this company. What we ultimately would want to do would be to do whatever we can work withing with the distributors to make that product more compelling, more consumer facing than it ever has been. That's really the biggest goal. As it relates to SVOD and those things, I think we can get to a point where off-net network programs, both in-season and prior season are bundled with the channels that the programs were originally on. And that may be a feature that offered to multichannel subscribers that's designed as a means to perpetuate that business model or make that business model more consumer friendly. So I'm not going to suggest that we're set in our ways or stuck in the business model of the future to the point where it damages the former business model in ways that are either aren't necessary or that are premature."

You know that you're making too much when either your quality is going down or the marketplace is telling you that they've -- they're fatigued and they've had enough. We don't see that in any of the products that we're making or that you cited. Pixar had one of its most successful releases ever with Inside Out and its most original this past year, and we're really excited about The Good Dinosaur and, of course, we have Finding Dory, the sequel to Nemo next year as for instance. Marvel, obviously, Avengers 2. Age of Ultron did extremely well over $1.4 billion in global revenue, in global box office. And we've got Captain America 3: Civil War coming up this year and a pretty rich pipeline thereafter. Of both sequels, things, things like Dora and Captain America as I mentioned, and Ant Man but also original like Dr. Strange, for instance, we like that balance. Star Wars, we're just getting into. Obviously premature. But we're basically planning a Star Wars release a year for the next 6 years, 3 of them part of the saga, 7, 8 and 9. 3 will be standalone films. I think we've only announced 2 of those 3, Rogue One being the first, which comes out in December of '16. So we don't think we're oversaturated. If anything, we think that we're very, very well-balanced in terms of taking these products to market. In terms of products that -- or franchises that we don't own, obviously not going to comment on that except that I can see that with Disney, which is also never been stronger, by the way, just look at the Oscars that we've won for Frozen and Big Hero 6, the box office, the excitement about this movie Zootopia that's coming out, which I think is going to be a sleeper hit. And that's been coming up in actually first quarter -- end of the first calendar quarter, rather of '16. I think with Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Lucas' Star Wars, we don't really have much of a need. Our pipeline is pretty rich. The richest ever for us. But we'll be opportunistic. If we see something that we feel is as attractive as these others have been, that's leverageable across markets, across businesses over long periods of time, which is what we consider a franchise, then we certainly have the capital structure to be able to take advantage of the opportunity."

And as we indicated earlier, the program availability will likely be augmented over time. Bob talked about the possibility of in season stacking being offered through the program services that we offer. So I think you'll just see the bundle continue to evolve and I think you're going to see the industry, programmers and distributors alike, respond to the consumer department with increasingly strong product.

We're very pleased with our results in Q4, with adjusted EPS of $1.20, up 35% over the prior year. The strong performance capped our fifth consecutive year of record results, including historic revenue and net income and adjusted EPS up 19% to an all-time high of $5.15. These results reflect the collective talent and commitment of our employees and cast members around the world, and I'm both proud of their achievements and grateful for their contributions.
Our performance continues to demonstrate the incredible strength of our brands and franchises, the extraordinary quality and robust pipeline of our creative content, our commitment to constant evolution as we adapt to emerging consumer trends and technology and our unique, proven ability to leverage creative assets across our entire company to drive significant long-term value.
And Star Wars is an obvious example. We're still 6 weeks away from releasing the first new film of the decade, but you can already see the impact and value of that franchise in various businesses. We have Star Wars products in numerous Retail categories, especially toys and games, and a huge global response to the brief glimpse of new merchandise we revealed on Force Friday in September suggests the demand will only grow with the release of new movies. A new generation is connecting with Star Wars through Disney XD's animated series, Star Wars Rebels, and fans and gamers around the world are anxiously amazing awaiting the November 17 release of the highly anticipated Star Wars: Battlefront. From EA, praised as the ultimate Star Wars gaming experience. 
We're expanding the franchise in our Parks and Resorts, adding Star Wars theme lands in Disneyland and Disney World and we're also using digital platforms to familiarize global consumers with the franchise and to market the film in truly innovative ways.
And of course, we're very excited about the December 18 of release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And as the reaction to the trailers and ticket presales are any indication, we're not the only ones. J.J. Abrams and his cast and crew have delivered a truly epic adventure, but what's even more exciting to watch is that this movie is only the beginning of a new generation of phenomenal Star Wars storytelling. We'll have 3 new Star Wars films in theaters between now and the end of 2017, with even more to come.
One of our greatest strengths is our willingness to embrace change and adapt to new trends and technology to create extraordinary experiences that are relevant to consumers. That's especially true in the media space. From our perspective, there are 3 key elements that are essential for success in media today: first, you have to have a quality product, preferably high-quality, branded product; next, you need to create a fantastic user experience with incredible interface and navigation, you have to make the service easy to use and the content easy to find; and the third essential element is mobility. Consumers now dictate where they want to access media and it's essential for legacy distributors to crack the mobile code. The demand for great content is stronger than ever when consumers are demanding a better user experience and they're migrating to platforms and services that deliver it. 
Because of our great brands and franchises, we're uniquely positioned to use new platforms to reach more people, and to do so in more compelling ways. And we intend to use these platforms to augment distribution and connect with consumers more directly.
In DisneyLife, our new direct-to-consumer service in the U.K., is a perfect example. Launching later this month, DisneyLife will give users unprecedented access to the vast universe of Disney storytelling, including hundreds of movies and thousands of TV episodes as well as music, books and more. It delivers a great experience with an incredible degree of personalization, including the ability to watch and read in several different languages. The Disney branded content is fantastic. The user-friendly interface is very interactive and intuitive and it's designed to be mobile, with apps for iOS and Android. So we're 3 for 3. 
We're very proud of this product. It definitely speaks to where we're going as a company, and we see opportunities to grow the concept across other markets and perhaps other brands in the future. We're proud of our results this year and believe our continued strong performance validates our long-term strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. 
Tom will take you through some of the highlights, and then we'll turn it over to Christine to walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and talk about some trends going forward. Tom?"

As the media landscape continues to evolve, our uniquely valuable collection of in-demand brands and content puts us in a great position to deliver extraordinary experiences across platforms in the ways that Bob just discussed. By doing so, we have the opportunity to increase our engagement and deepen our connection with consumers. 
ESPN is a perfect example. The brand is stronger than ever, thanks to the largest array of sports properties in the industry and ESPN's well-earned reputation among sports fans for consistently overdelivering especially when it comes to live sports. In fiscal 2015, ESPN was the #1 full-time cable network in all major demos, delivering more than half of the year's top 50 cable telecasts. ESPN's first College Football Playoff actually delivered the 3 biggest audiences in cable history as well as an 83% ratings increase over the prior year's world championship series.
In addition to having the best portfolio of sports rights in the business, ESPN has been a multiplatform pioneer for years, leveraging technology to keep fans connected to the best in sports wherever they are. WatchESPN remains one of the most elegant and user-friendly mobile services in the market today. And ESPN continues to innovate, creating, enhancing a very robust suite of services that are praised by sports fans across the country.
At September alone, 94.4 million fans spent 10.3 billion minutes engaging with ESPN on digital platforms, setting a new record for unique visitors and engagement in the sports category. 
The demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is incredibly strong and no matter how they choose to engage, sports fans continue to trust ESPN to provide the best overall experience and the marquee events that matter most.
Turning to our studios. Our strategic focus on high-quality branded movies continues to drive value across our businesses. Since the respective acquisitions by Disney, Pixar released an average roughly $660 million in global box office, and Marvel Films has averaged $820 million, and that success continues. The global box office receipts for Pixar's Inside Out are over $845 million to date. And Marvel's Ant Man has totaled $515 million worldwide so far, exceeding the global box office totals on original films for both Thor and Captain America. 
In addition to Star Wars movies Bob mentioned, we have a spectacular slate of releases scheduled for 2016, representing our full array of fantastic brands, starting with the release of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur later this month. Disney Animation's Zootopia opens next March, followed by Disney's live-action adventure, The Jungle Book in April. In May, we'll release Marvel's Captain America: Civil War. And later that month, Johnny Depp returns as the mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass. Then with Pixar's Finding Nemo will finally get their wish for a sequel when Finding Dory opens in June. 
We've successfully introduced some fantastic but lesser-known superheroes into the Marvel cinematic universe with last year's Guardians of the Galaxy and again, with Ant Man this year. And we're looking forward to doing the same with Doctor Strange next year. 
We also have another great movie in Disney Animation, Moana, which will be in theaters for families to enjoy about year from now. 
I've been with Disney a long time and I can't remember a movie slate that comes close to this one. It truly reflects the strength of the unprecedented pipeline of extraordinary content being generated under our unparalleled portfolio of brands.
One of the things we're most looking forward to in 2016, of course, is the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next spring. We're well down the road of the construction of this spectacular, world-class destination in the most populous city and the most populous country on earth. 
As Bob has said, we committed ourselves to making this resort authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese. We were just there last week and it's extremely gratifying to see how well we're delivering on that promise. The park features some of the best in Disney storytelling and innovation we've ever achieved and our collaboration with Chinese cultural experts, creative talent and artisans is apparent throughout. 
At this point of construction, all the major structures and landmarks are in place. You'll really get a sense of the phenomenal experience in store for our guests when they walk through the gates of this spectacular destination next spring. From the grand scale to the smallest detail, it's absolutely extraordinary and it's something only the Walt Disney Company could create. 
We begun holding a number of job fairs in China to find the talent we need to deliver the world-class experience guests expect from Disney, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. There's a palpable excitement in China by Shanghai Disney, one with a great deal of pride all of which we share. 
And now Christine will talk you through the details of our performance, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"

Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.20, an increase of 35% over last year and for the full year, were a record $5.15. Fourth quarter and full year results benefited",1505,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.20, an increase of 35% over last year and for the full year, were a record $5.15. Fourth quarter and full year results benefited from an additional week of operations and our fiscal calendar this year. Our fiscal 2015 earnings represent a record for the company, even after excluding the estimated effect of the 53rd week. The financial results this quarter and for the full year demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail and then I'll highlight some factors that will impact our results in fiscal 2016.
Studio Entertainment had another record year, with almost $2 billion in operating income in fiscal 2015, 27% higher than last year. This is a business that only 2 years ago generated less than $700 million in operating income. So the growth demonstrates the power of the investments we've made and our ability to execute against our strategy. The success of the studio has been broad-based due to an unrivaled portfolio of film properties and our unique ability to take this great content and monetize it across multiple windows and businesses. 
Studio operating income more than doubled in the fourth quarter compared to last year due to growth in television distribution and higher worldwide theatrical results. Theatrical results reflected the performance of Inside Out and Ant Man in the fourth quarter compared to the performance of prior year releases, which included Guardians of the Galaxy and Maleficent. Studio operating income also benefited from lower impairments in the quarter compared to prior year. 
At Media Networks, growth in operating income in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in cable, while Broadcasting results were in line with the prior year quarter.
Growth in cable operating income was driven by ESPN and to a lot lesser extent, worldwide Disney Channels and higher equity income from A&E. The increase at ESPN was driven by the benefit of the 53rd week and higher affiliate and advertising revenue. 
Programming costs were relatively flat in the quarter as higher costs for a full quarter of the SEC Network, additional U.S. Open tennis rights and contractual increases for Major League Baseball and the NFL were offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR. 
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 17% in the quarter and up 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the quarter. Two factors affected the comparability of ESPN's ad growth in the quarter: the 53rd week; and the absence of the men's World Cup. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% when you exclude the net impact of these 2 factors. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up significantly compared to last year, reflecting a very strong advertising marketplace for sports and the timing of key college football bowl games. The 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl game, including the 2 semifinal games, will air in the first fiscal quarter this year, whereas these games aired during the fiscal second quarter last year.
Broadcasting operating income was comparable to the prior year quarter as higher affiliate and advertising revenue were largely offset by larger higher programming costs and increasing equity losses driven by Hulu and lower income from program sales compared to the prior year. 
Programming costs were higher in the quarter due to an extra week of programming as well as an increase in marketing spend to support the launch of the fall season. The extra week had minimal impact to Broadcasting's operating income for the quarter as the extra week of ad sales was roughly equal to the incremental programming spend.
Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up midteens percent in the fourth quarter. Excluding the extra week, ad revenue was up mid-single digits. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 16% above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, the investments we've made in our domestic parks continue to drive higher guest visitation. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 15% in the quarter and up 7%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. Disneyland in particular saw very strong attendance growth due to tremendous excitement for the 60th anniversary celebration. Per capita spending was up 1% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7% and occupancy was up one percentage point to 84%.
Operating income growth at our domestic operations was due to the benefit of an additional week along with higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic theme parks, partially offset by higher costs.
Operating income at our international operations was lower in the quarter due to a decline at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher preopening expenses for Shanghai Disney Resort. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 5% compared to prior year levels while booked rates are up 8%.
At Consumer Products, operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as a result of growth in our licensing business, partially offset by higher marketing costs. Growth in licensing was driven by sales of Star Wars classic, Avengers and Frozen merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 9%. Licensing revenue and the 9% earned licensing revenue growth I just mentioned, do not reflect the revenue from Q4 sales of Star Wars: Episode VII merchandise, which we cannot recognize until the film is released.
During the fourth quarter, the market presented us with an opportunity to repurchase our shares at very attractive levels. We repurchased almost 31 million shares for $3.3 billion in the quarter, bringing our fiscal 2015 share repurchase to about 60 million shares for approximately $6.1 billion.
We've talked for a long time about the benefit of having a strong balance sheet. Our ability to significantly increase our pace of repurchase this quarter is a great example of this. Over the past 5 years, we've been able to repurchase about $25 billion of our stock at an average price of roughly $58 per share, and we've accomplished this while actively investing for future growth and without compromising the strength of our balance sheet and the financial flexibility it provides. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to buying back our stock and we still expect to repurchase between $6 billion to $8 billion during fiscal 2016.
Turning to fiscal 2016. I now want to highlight a couple of timing and comparability items and also provide some insight into our CapEx plan for the year. In fiscal 2016, ESPN does not have any major new sports rights contracts kicking in, so we expect total cable programming and production cost to be up low to mid-single digits for the year. Earlier, I mentioned that the 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl games will air in fiscal Q1 this year compared to fiscal Q2 last year. As a result, the costs associated with these games will shift into Q1, so we expect total cable programming and production cost to be up high teens in Q1 and to be down high teens in Q2. 
At Parks and Resorts, quarterly results will be impacted by a shift in the timing of the New Year and Easter holiday periods due to our fiscal calendar. The entire New Year's holiday period will fall in Q1 in fiscal 2016, whereas about a week of the holiday period fell in Q2 last year. We estimate this will shift about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in Q2 last year. 
The Easter holiday period will fall during the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, we will recognize about $90 million in operating income in Q2 this year that we recognized in Q3 last year. 
We have demonstrated our ability to deploy capital profitably across the company, including at Parks and Resorts. We have announced a number of new Parks and Resorts projects that will be underway during fiscal 2016. As a result, these projects will collectively drive an increase in total company CapEx of about $800 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
As Tom discussed, we are very excited to open Shanghai Disney Resort later this fiscal year. As we've said in the past, preopening expenses will ramp up considerably, and we estimate these preopening expenses to be a little under $300 million in 2016.
Fiscal 2015 was another great year for the company. Given the strength of our brands and a relentless focus on creativity and innovation, we will continue to execute against our strategy, which should benefit shareholders in 2016 and in the years to come. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A."

Well, regarding your first question, there's nothing that I will either retract or any way change. To just reiterate what we did, we updated guidance that we had given in 2014 about ESPN's sub fees, and that guidance holds today. We also decided to be candid, I think maybe refreshingly so, about what the industry was experiencing in terms of sub losses during roughly the last period. And we feel that there certainly should be no reason to panic over comments like that. The fact remains that we're in an environment today that's definitely changing, it's different than the environment before. There's a lot more competition for people's time. With that, interestingly enough, we have an opportunity to distribute our content in many different ways than we ever have before -- in more different ways than we ever had before. So there's not only a silver lining but there's a glass half-full perspective on this and that's what we have. We also know, specifically related to ESPN, that not only is the brand strong, which is evidenced, by the way, in the ratings, 50 of the top cable shows in fiscal 2015 -- of the 50 top cable shows in fiscal 2015, 26 were ESPN's. And in addition to that, live television and live sports in particular is incredibly strong in this environment. Demand for it's probably never been greater interestingly enough. So that's, I guess, a long way around my saying that we don't have anything to really add to the comments that we made. We feel bullish about ESPN and ESPN's business. We like the environment because we think long term, it gives us more opportunities. I should also add that ESPN has been at the forefront of using technology to create more compelling product for its consumers and to be present on more platforms. In terms of your second question, Michael, we really don't comment specifically about aspects of the negotiations or the deals that we have with the multichannel distributors. I can only say specifically related to your question that, that article was not factually correct."

We believe that we're seizing these opportunities to augment what is still a primary form of us delivering content to consumers on the TV side, and that's the multichannel
[Audio Gap]
tends to be far more rich and textured and a better user interface, which is really important. I'm going to come back to that, Alexia. It has hundreds of movies, thousands of TV shows, songs, books and games. And we like the concept from a consumer proposition perspective, we believe there will be other opportunities outside of the U.K. and we believe there'll be other opportunities like that for some of our other brands, but we're not rushing into that right now. I also think what you're seeing in the multichannel environment is you're probably seeing some attrition, which is always the case, from current large bundle subscribers. Most of that is due to economic factors. At the same time, we think it's possible that young people are not signing up as quickly as they once did, and we think that points to a pretty interesting dynamic, and that relates to cost and user experience. And we think that the primary ingredients for success in media today is, one, you got to have great product. We certainly have that. The user interface has to be great, and that means easy-to-find, easy-to-use product, and we challenge all the legacy distributors to distribute -- to deliver that because we think that could be one of the factors in terms of why young people aren't signing up. And the third thing is mobility. People want to watch these channels and these programs on mobile devices. And frankly, the experience, when you try to do that as a multichannel subscriber, is not as easy or as good as it needs to be. So they're being challenged by these new entrants. And we're seizing the opportunity to basically distribute our content with these new entrants because we think they deliver better user experiences. And the price to value relationship, particularly for some of the smaller bundles that are out there, also tends to be attractive to younger people. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities. We like the trend. We think that the more, the merrier in terms of new platforms. And it's clear also and Sony View [ph] is a great example of that, that these platforms cannot launch successfully without the array of channels that we provide. And they came to us to negotiate a deal because it was clear that the product that they had launched was not getting -- was not penetrating the marketplace as much as I think they expected, and they needed ESPN, Disney and ABC.

And we're guessing that sometime between now and the end of this calendar year, we'll announce an opening date. We feel great about what we're building, and we still feel great about the market. We continue to be impressed with the buzz that we see whenever we go to China. And you're right, we were there last week and 3 weeks before that. And it is, in fact, the talk of the town, and we think for good reason. Not only is it highly anticipated as a product, but interest in Disney is significantly higher now than it's ever been, thanks in part to the growth in the movie industry. So we think this is a big event. We love what it represents in many levels. More than anything else, we think it's a great opportunity for us to grow our business in Asia and particularly in China.

They've been extremely aggressive buyers of our content. A movie deal kicks in starting in '16, and they bought both original programming, the Marvel program is a good example, and a lot of off network programming from us. And those decisions were all made to monetize our content at the highest levels. In fact, again, as I've said, we've never seen greater demand for our content than we're seeing today. I think it's really important for us, I can't speak for the whole industry, to maintain flexibility because it's a dynamic marketplace, continues to change. And that essentially means that when we made these decisions to sell these shows to Netflix, those decisions made the most sense for us in terms of the economics. Longer term, it's possible that we'll make different decisions based on other factors.

And so we wanted to test this in a market where there was already strong brand affinity. Second, we looked carefully at what was available to us to put on this platform because we obviously have to factor in, speaking of flexibility, by the way, deals that already exist that encumber us from getting access to the product to sell on our own. And we had an opportunity to bring this to market in a manner that worked in relation to the product available and the deal that we have mostly with Sky in the U.K. And we're doing this because when you look at technology today, and I know that Apple referred to this when it announced its Apple TV product, the app experience is -- I'll call it 3D experience versus the 2D experience that linear television offers. Because you can go to an app and you can choose from a menu of multiple choices in terms of media, and you can essentially use it in ways that we think are far more compelling and typically a better user experience. I mentioned that earlier. I can't emphasize that enough. I think today's consumer, when they're faced with a user experience that is subpar where they just can't find anything, they can't navigate things or they find them and they don't -- they just don't work well, you don't keep a consumer. It used to be you don't keep a consumer happy, now it's you don't keep the consumer because they have other choices. So we like the app-based experience. We're also very interested in taking product directly to consumers as a company. If you look at the profile of this company, outside of the Disney Stores and our theme park business, the customers that buy Disney typically buy through third parties. There's nothing wrong with that, by the way. We do great business with movie theater chains and big box retailers and multichannel distributors. But given the way that the world is and what technology makes available and given the passion that our customers have for our brands: Marvel, Disney, Pixar, ESPN, Star Wars, we have an opportunity to reach the consumer directly in ways that our competitors can't come close to doing. So it is a competitive advantage and it is an opportunity the technology is providing us. And it's something ultimately that you'll see more of, both from a consumer proposition perspective and from a company perspective. The pricing, we debated a lot about. We're going to market with a price that we think reflects the value of the product that we're offering and the experience that we're offering. I can't tell you that you're absolutely certain it's the right price. It's the price that we decided to take it out to the market with. And we have -- what we do know is we've created an elegant product, it's a really good user experience. We love the look, the feel of the navigation. And we'll see. It also has the ability to provide the content in multi-languages, for instance. And so you can imagine the opportunities in terms of other markets both in Europe and the rest of the world. And it is also a technology we can use for those other brands."

The first live streaming cable app, the first streaming broadcast network app, the first iTunes episodic content deal, probably the first to sign a light domestic streaming cable product. Now the first to do a direct consumer branded subscription product in the U.K. So clearly, you're comfortable with this. I guess the question is does thought leadership and flexibility though mean at some point you kind of have the ability to move in the opposite direction, right? And that all these things that have worked so well for you have essentially allowed you to sell what you already have for more money? An authenticated app, you're sort of making more money and you're not breaking up the bundle. Do you think we're at a point where the sale of SVOD content, given the way it fragments the audience, could ultimately be damaging the ecosystem such that you might use flexibly to pull content back from that kind of platform?

I'll comment on that and then I'll comment on to the real -- the crux of the matter or the question. I would -- I'm struck with something that Steve Jobs once said when he was asked about technology and how he developed it, and he said that he starts with the consumer and he works backward to technology. And we're actually doing that, too. We're thinking about the consumer. And the consumer today is a different consumer than before. They don't just want to sit in a living room on a couch and watch our product on a fixed screen on the wall with a remote control in their hand. They want to do it in many more ways, and they have the authority, thanks to technology, to make those decisions. So we're starting with what we believe the consumer wants. Every one of those examples that you used, which sounds like a strategic initiative for the company, is actually a strategic initiative for the consumer. That's -- it's really that simple. And this is a company that has been consumer-facing from the start. And I think actually when you look at what we do with our parks, it's a great example of that. And all of these things that we're doing we have the -- we're trying to take a very, very expansive look at the consumer today and where that consumer is going, particularly the younger consumer. So second, as it relates to, well, maybe in a strange way, flexibility. All of these things are designed to obviously create product that we think ultimately benefits the shareholders of The Walt Disney Company but also to learn from. And if we take product out that may work in a given time but long term have a negative impact on brand -- on businesses or business models that can continue to create more value for us, then we'll retract and we'll cut back. We don't want to -- look, we've got a lot of the good things going for us. And in reality, the multichannel business model, while facing more competition than ever before, is still a huge driver of value for this company. What we ultimately would want to do would be to do whatever we can working with the distributors to make that product more compelling, more consumer-facing than it ever has been. That's really the biggest goal. As it relates to SVOD and those things, I think we can get to a point where off-network programs, both in-season and prior season are bundled with the channels that the programs were originally on. And that may be a feature that's offered to multichannel subscribers that's designed as a means to perpetuate that business model or make that business model more consumer friendly. So I'm not going to suggest that we're set in our ways or stuck in the business model of the future to the point where it damages the former business model in ways that either aren't necessary or that are premature."

So let's talk about foreign exchange, as we did give that information last quarter. And the -- as we mentioned at the time, we were fully hedged going into fiscal '16 so that estimate that we gave you of about a $500 million impact year-over-year is still the right estimate looking forward to the year. So there's no change on that. And the impact for fiscal '15, there was a modest negative impact from what was originally given but that's only because some of our businesses outperformed. So once again, we were fully hedged based on the estimates as we're going into a fiscal year. On the cable affiliate growth, we updated our 3-year affiliate guidance on the last earnings call and we don't intend to update it again. We also aren't -- we don't give annual guidance on affiliate revenue growth. But I will remind you that the fiscal '15 did benefit from the launch of the SEC Network, and that is something that we will be comping against in fiscal '16."

You know that you're making too much when either your quality is going down or the marketplace is telling you that they've -- there's fatigue or they've had enough. We don't see that in any of the products that we're making or that you cited. Pixar had one of its most successful releases ever with Inside Out and it's most original this past year, and we're really excited about The Good Dinosaur and, of course, we have Finding Dory, the sequel to Nemo, next year as for instance. Marvel, obviously, Avengers 2. Age of Ultron did extremely well in over $1.4 billion in global revenue, in global box office. And we've got Captain America 3, Civil War, coming up this year and a pretty rich pipeline thereafter. Of both sequels, things, things like Thor and Captain America, as I mentioned, and Ant Man, but also original like Dr. Strange, for instance, we like that balance. Star Wars, we're just getting into. Obviously premature. But we're basically planning roughly a Star Wars release a year for the next 6 years, 3 of them part of the saga, 7, 8 and 9. 3 will be standalone films. I think we've only announced 2 of those 3, Rogue One being the first, which comes out in December of '16. So we don't think we're oversaturated. If anything, we think that we're very, very well-balanced in terms of taking these products to market. In terms of products that -- or franchises that we don't own, obviously not going to comment on that except I can see that with Disney, which is also never been stronger, by the way, just look at the Oscars that we've won for Frozen and Big Hero 6, the box office, the excitement about this movie Zootopia that's coming up, which I think is going to be a real sleeper hit. And that's coming up in actually first quarter -- end of the first calendar quarter, rather of '16. I think with Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Lucas' Star Wars, we don't really have much of a need. Our pipeline is pretty rich, the richest ever for us. But we'll be opportunistic. If we see something that we feel is as attractive as these others have been that's leverageable across markets, across businesses over long periods of time, which is what we really consider a franchise, then we certainly have the capital structure to be able to take advantage of the opportunity."

We're very pleased with our results in Q4, with adjusted EPS of $1.20, up 35% over the prior year. The strong performance capped our fifth consecutive year of record results, including historic revenue and net income and adjusted EPS up 19% to an all-time high of $5.15. These results reflect the collective talent and commitment of our employees and cast members around the world, and I'm both proud of their achievements and grateful for their contributions.
Our performance continues to demonstrate the incredible strength of our brands and franchises, the extraordinary quality and robust pipeline of our creative content, our commitment to constant evolution as we adapt to emerging consumer trends and technology and our unique, proven ability to leverage creative assets across our entire company to drive significant long-term value.
And Star Wars is an obvious example. We're still 6 weeks away from releasing the first new film in a decade, but you can already see the impact and value of that franchise in various businesses. We have Star Wars products in numerous Retail categories, especially toys and games, and a huge global response to the brief glimpse of new merchandise we revealed on Force Friday in September suggests the demand will only grow with the release of new movies. A new generation is connecting with Star Wars through Disney XD's animated series, Star Wars Rebels, and fans and gamers around the world are anxiously awaiting the November 17 release of the highly anticipated Star Wars: Battlefront from EA, praised as the ultimate Star Wars gaming experience. 
We're expanding the franchise in our Parks and Resorts, adding Star Wars theme lands in Disneyland and Disney World, and we're also using digital platforms to familiarize global consumers with the franchise and to market the film in truly innovative ways.
And of course, we're very excited about the December 18 of release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And if the reaction to the trailers and ticket presales are any indication, we're not the only ones. J.J. Abrams and his cast and crew have delivered a truly epic adventure, but what's even more exciting to watch is that this movie is only the beginning of a new generation of phenomenal Star Wars storytelling. We'll have 3 new Star Wars films in theaters between now and the end of 2017, with even more to come.
One of our greatest strengths is our willingness to embrace change and adapt to new trends and technology to create extraordinary experiences that are relevant to consumers. That's especially true in the media space. From our perspective, there are 3 key elements that are essential for success in media today: first, you have to have a quality product, preferably high-quality, branded product; next, you need to create a fantastic user experience with incredible interface and navigation, you have to make the service easy to use and the content easy to find; and the third essential element is mobility. Consumers now dictate where they want to access media and it's essential for legacy distributors to crack the mobile code. The demand for great content is stronger than ever when consumers are demanding a better user experience and they're migrating to platforms and services that deliver it. 
Because of our great brands and franchises, we're uniquely positioned to use new platforms to reach more people, and to do so in more compelling ways. And we intend to use these platforms to augment distribution and connect with consumers more directly.
And DisneyLife, our new direct-to-consumer service in the U.K., is a perfect example. Launching later this month, DisneyLife will give users unprecedented access to the vast universe of Disney storytelling, including hundreds of movies and thousands of TV episodes as well as music, books and more. It delivers a great experience with an incredible degree of personalization, including the ability to watch and read in several different languages. The Disney branded content is fantastic. The user-friendly interface is very interactive and intuitive and it's designed to be mobile, with apps for iOS and Android. So we're 3 for 3. 
We're very proud of this product. It definitely speaks to where we're going as a company, and we see opportunities to grow the concept across other markets and perhaps other brands in the future. We're proud of our results this year and believe our continued strong performance validates our long-term strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. 
Tom will take you through some of the highlights, and then we'll turn it over to Christine to walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and talk about some trends going forward. Tom?"

As the media landscape continues to evolve, our uniquely valuable collection of in-demand brands and content puts us in a great position to deliver extraordinary experiences across platforms in the ways that Bob just discussed. By doing so, we have the opportunity to increase our engagement and deepen our connection with consumers. 
ESPN is a perfect example. The brand is stronger than ever, thanks to the largest array of sports properties in the industry and ESPN's well-earned reputation among sports fans for consistently overdelivering especially when it comes to live sports. In fiscal 2015, ESPN was the #1 full-time cable network in all major demos, delivering more than half of the year's top 50 cable telecasts. ESPN's first College Football Playoff actually delivered the 3 biggest audiences in cable history as well as an 83% ratings increase over the prior year's bowl championship series.
In addition to having the best portfolio of sports rights in the business, ESPN has been a multiplatform pioneer for years, leveraging technology to keep fans connected to the best in sports wherever they are. WatchESPN remains one of the most elegant and user-friendly mobile services in the market today. And ESPN continues to innovate, creating and enhancing a very robust suite of services that are embraced by sports fans across the country.
In September alone, 94.4 million fans spent 10.3 billion minutes engaging with ESPN on digital platforms, setting a new record for unique visitors and engagement in the sports category. 
The demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is incredibly strong and no matter how they choose to engage, sports fans continue to trust ESPN to provide the best overall experience and the marquee events that matter most.
Turning to our studios. Our strategic focus on high-quality branded movies continues to drive value across our businesses. Since their respective acquisitions by Disney, Pixar movies have averaged roughly $660 million in global box office, and Marvel Films have averaged $820 million, and that success continues. The global box office receipts for Pixar's Inside Out are over $845 million to date. And Marvel's Ant Man has totaled $515 million worldwide so far, exceeding the global box office totals on original films for both Thor and Captain America. 
In addition to Star Wars movies Bob mentioned, we have a spectacular slate of releases scheduled for 2016, representing our full array of fantastic brands, starting with the release of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur later this month. Disney Animation's Zootopia opens next March, followed by Disney's live-action adventure, The Jungle Book, in April. In May, we'll release Marvel's Captain America: Civil War. And later that month, Johnny Depp returns as the Mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass. Fans of Pixar's Finding Nemo will finally get their wish for a sequel when Finding Dory opens in June. 
We've successfully introduced some fantastic but lesser-known superheroes into the Marvel cinematic universe with last year's Guardians of the Galaxy and again, with Ant Man this year. And we're looking forward to doing the same with Doctor Strange next year. 
We also have another great movie in Disney Animation, Moana, which will be in theaters for families to enjoy about a year from now. 
I've been at Disney a long time and I can't remember a movie slate that comes close to this one. It truly reflects the strength of the unprecedented pipeline of extraordinary content being generated under our unparalleled portfolio of brands.
One of the things we're most looking forward to in 2016, of course, is the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next spring. We're well down the road of the construction of this spectacular, world-class destination in the most populous city in the most populous country on earth. 
As Bob has said, we committed ourselves to making this resort authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese. We were just there last week and it's extremely gratifying to see how well we're delivering on that promise. The park features some of the best in Disney storytelling and innovation we've ever achieved and our collaboration with Chinese cultural experts, creative talent and artisans is apparent throughout. 
At this point in the construction, all the major structures and landmarks are in place. You'll really get a sense of the phenomenal experience in store for our guests when they walk through the gates of this spectacular destination next spring. From the grand scale to the smallest detail, it's absolutely extraordinary and it's something only the Walt Disney Company could create. 
We begun holding a number of job fairs in China to find the talent we need to deliver the world-class experience guests expect from Disney, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. There's a palpable excitement in China by Shanghai Disney, one with a great deal of pride all of which we share. 
And now Christine will talk you through the details of our performance, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?"

Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.20, an increase of 35% over last year and for the full year, were a record $5.15. Fourth quarter and full year results benefited",1503,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.20, an increase of 35% over last year and for the full year, were a record $5.15. Fourth quarter and full year results benefited from an additional week of operations in our fiscal calendar this year. Our fiscal 2015 earnings represent a record for the company, even after excluding the estimated effect of the 53rd week. The financial results this quarter and for the full year demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail and then I'll highlight some factors that will impact our results in fiscal 2016.
Studio Entertainment had another record year, with almost $2 billion in operating income in fiscal 2015, 27% higher than last year. This is a business that only 2 years ago generated less than $700 million in operating income. So the growth demonstrates the power of the investments we've made and our ability to execute against our strategy. The success of the studio has been broad-based due to an unrivaled portfolio of film properties and our unique ability to take this great content and monetize it across multiple windows and businesses. 
Studio operating income more than doubled in the fourth quarter compared to last year due to growth in television distribution and higher worldwide theatrical results. Theatrical results reflected the performance of Inside Out and Ant Man in the fourth quarter compared to the performance of prior year releases, which included Guardians of the Galaxy and Maleficent. Studio operating income also benefited from lower impairments in the quarter compared to prior year. 
At Media Networks, growth in operating income in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in cable, while Broadcasting results were in line with the prior year quarter.
Growth in cable operating income was driven by ESPN and to a lesser extent, worldwide Disney Channels and higher equity income from A&E. The increase at ESPN was driven by the benefit of the 53rd week and higher affiliate and advertising revenue. 
Programming costs were relatively flat in the quarter as higher costs for a full quarter of the SEC Network, additional U.S. Open tennis rights and contractual increases for Major League Baseball and the NFL were offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR. 
Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 17% in the quarter and up 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the quarter. Two factors affected the comparability of ESPN's ad growth in the quarter: the 53rd week; and the absence of the men's World Cup. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% when you exclude the net impact of these 2 factors. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up significantly compared to last year, reflecting a very strong advertising marketplace for sports and the timing of key college football bowl games. The 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl game, including the 2 semifinal games, will air in the first fiscal quarter this year, whereas these games aired during the fiscal second quarter last year.
Broadcasting operating income was comparable to the prior year quarter as higher affiliate and advertising revenue were largely offset by higher programming costs and increasing equity losses driven by Hulu and lower income from program sales compared to the prior year. 
Programming costs were higher in the quarter due to an extra week of programming as well as an increase in marketing spend to support the launch of the fall season. The extra week had minimal impact to Broadcasting's operating income for the quarter as the extra week of ad sales was roughly equal to the incremental programming spend.
Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up midteens percent in the fourth quarter. Excluding the extra week, ad revenue was up mid-single digits. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 16% above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, the investments we've made in our domestic parks continue to drive higher guest visitation. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 15% in the quarter and up 7%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. Disneyland in particular saw very strong attendance growth due to tremendous excitement for the 60th anniversary celebration. Per capita spending was up 1% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7% and occupancy was up 1 percentage point to 84%.
Operating income growth at our domestic operations was due to the benefit of an additional week along with higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic theme parks, partially offset by higher costs.
Operating income at our international operations was lower in the quarter due to a decline at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher preopening expenses for Shanghai Disney Resort. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 5% compared to prior year levels while booked rates are up 8%.
At Consumer Products, operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as a result of growth in our licensing business, partially offset by higher marketing costs. Growth in licensing was driven by sales of Star Wars classic, Avengers and Frozen merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 9%. Licensing revenue and the 9% earned licensing revenue growth I just mentioned, do not reflect the revenue from Q4 sales of Star Wars: Episode VII merchandise, which we cannot recognize until the film is released.
During the fourth quarter, the market presented us with an opportunity to repurchase our shares at very attractive levels. We repurchased almost 31 million shares for $3.3 billion in the quarter, bringing our fiscal 2015 share repurchase to about 60 million shares for approximately $6.1 billion.
We've talked for a long time about the benefit of having a strong balance sheet. Our ability to significantly increase our pace of repurchase this quarter is a great example of this. Over the past 5 years, we've been able to repurchase about $25 billion of our stock at an average price of roughly $58 per share, and we've accomplished this while actively investing for future growth and without compromising the strength of our balance sheet and the financial flexibility it provides. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to buying back our stock and we still expect to repurchase between $6 billion to $8 billion during fiscal 2016.
Turning to fiscal 2016. I now want to highlight a couple of timing and comparability items and also provide some insight into our CapEx plan for the year. In fiscal 2016, ESPN does not have any major new sports rights contracts kicking in, so we expect total cable programming and production cost to be up low to mid-single digits for the year. Earlier, I mentioned that the 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl games will air in fiscal Q1 this year compared to fiscal Q2 last year. As a result, the costs associated with these games will shift into Q1, so we expect total cable programming and production cost to be up high teens in Q1 and to be down high teens in Q2. 
At Parks and Resorts, quarterly results will be impacted by a shift in the timing of the New Year and Easter holiday periods due to our fiscal calendar. The entire New Year's holiday period will fall in Q1 in fiscal 2016, whereas about a week of the holiday period fell in Q2 last year. We estimate this will shift about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in Q2 last year. 
The Easter holiday period will fall during the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, we will recognize about $90 million in operating income in Q2 this year that we recognized in Q3 last year. 
We have demonstrated our ability to deploy capital profitably across the company, including at Parks and Resorts. We have announced a number of new Parks and Resorts projects that will be underway during fiscal 2016. As a result, these projects will collectively drive an increase in total company CapEx of about $800 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
As Tom discussed, we are very excited to open Shanghai Disney Resort later this fiscal year. As we've said in the past, preopening expenses will ramp up considerably, and we estimate these preopening expenses to be a little under $300 million in 2016.
Fiscal 2015 was another great year for the company. Given the strength of our brands and a relentless focus on creativity and innovation, we will continue to execute against our strategy, which should benefit shareholders in 2016 and in the years to come. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A."

Well, regarding your first question, there's nothing that I will either retract or any way change. To just reiterate what we did, we updated guidance that we had given in 2014 about ESPN's sub fees, and that guidance holds today. We also decided to be candid, I think maybe refreshingly so, about what the industry was experiencing in terms of sub losses during roughly the last period. And we feel that there certainly should be no reason to panic over comments like that. The fact remains that we're in an environment today that's definitely changing, it's different than the environment before. There's a lot more competition for people's time. With that, interestingly enough, we have an opportunity to distribute our content in many different ways than we ever have before -- in more different ways than we ever had before. So there's not only a silver lining but there's a glass half-full perspective on this and that's what we have. We also know, specifically related to ESPN, that not only is the brand strong, which is evidenced, by the way, in the ratings, 50 of the top cable shows in fiscal 2015 -- of the 50 top cable shows in fiscal 2015, 26 were ESPN's. And in addition to that, live television and live sports in particular is incredibly strong in this environment. Demand for it's probably never been greater, interestingly enough. So that's, I guess, a long way around my saying that we don't have anything to really add to the comments that we made. We feel bullish about ESPN and ESPN's business. We like the environment because we think long term, it gives us more opportunities. I should also add that ESPN has been at the forefront of using technology to create more compelling product for its consumers and to be present on more platforms. In terms of your second question, Michael, we really don't comment specifically about aspects of the negotiations or the deals that we have with the multichannel distributors. I can only say specifically related to your question that, that article was not factually correct."

[Audio Gap]
tends to be far more rich and textured and a better user interface, which is really important. I'm going to come back to that, Alexia. It has hundreds of movies, thousands of TV shows, songs, books and games. And we like the concept from a consumer proposition perspective, we believe there will be other opportunities outside of the U.K. and we believe there'll be other opportunities like that for some of our other brands, but we're not rushing into that right now. I also think what you're seeing in the multichannel environment is you're probably seeing some attrition, which is always the case, from current large bundle subscribers. Most of that is due to economic factors. At the same time, we think it's possible that young people are not signing up as quickly as they once did, and we think that points to a pretty interesting dynamic, and that relates to cost and user experience. And we think that the primary ingredients for success in media today is, one, you got to have great product. We certainly have that. The user interface has to be great, and that means easy-to-find, easy-to-use product, and we challenge all the legacy distributors to distribute -- to deliver that because we think that could be one of the factors in terms of why young people aren't signing up. And the third thing is mobility. People want to watch these channels and these programs on mobile devices. And frankly, the experience, when you try to do that as a multichannel subscriber, is not as easy or as good as it needs to be. So they're being challenged by these new entrants. And we're seizing the opportunity to basically distribute our content with these new entrants because we think they deliver better user experiences. And the price to value relationship, particularly for some of the smaller bundles that are out there, also tends to be attractive to younger people. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities. We like the trend. We think that the more, the merrier in terms of new platforms. And it's clear also and Sony Vue is a great example of that, that these platforms cannot launch successfully without the array of channels that we provide. And they came to us to negotiate a deal because it was clear that the product that they had launched was not getting -- was not penetrating the marketplace as much as I think they expected, and they needed ESPN, Disney and ABC. You want to handle the Consumer Products question and Star Wars?"

We continue to be impressed with the buzz that we see whenever we go to China. And you're right, we were there last week and 3 weeks before that. And it is, in fact, the talk of the town, and we think for good reason. Not only is it highly anticipated as a product, but interest in Disney is significantly higher now than it's ever been, thanks in part to the growth in the movie industry. So we think this is a big event. We love what it represents in many levels. More than anything else, we think it's a great opportunity for us to grow our business in Asia and particularly in China.

They've been extremely aggressive buyers of our content.

I think it's really important for us, I can't speak for the whole industry, to maintain flexibility because it's a dynamic marketplace, continues to change.

Longer term, it's possible that we'll make different decisions based on other factors.

And so we wanted to test this in a market where there was already strong brand affinity. Second, we looked carefully at what was available to us to put on this platform because we obviously have to factor in, speaking of flexibility, by the way, deals that already exist that encumber us from getting access to the product to sell on our own. And we had an opportunity to bring this to market in a manner that worked in relation to the product available and the deal that we have mostly with Sky in the U.K. And we're doing this because when you look at technology today, and I know that Apple referred to this when it announced its Apple TV product, the app experience is -- I'll call it a 3D experience versus the 2D experience that linear television offers. Because you can go to an app and you can choose from a menu of multiple choices in terms of media, and you can essentially use it in ways that we think are far more compelling and typically a better user experience. I mentioned that earlier. I can't emphasize that enough. I think today's consumer, when they're faced with a user experience that is subpar where they just can't find anything, they can't navigate things or they find them and they don't -- they just don't work well, you don't keep a consumer. It used to be you don't keep a consumer happy, now it's you don't keep a consumer because they have other choices. So we like the app-based experience. We're also very interested in taking product directly to consumers as a company. If you look at the profile of this company, outside of the Disney Stores and our theme park business, the customers that buy Disney typically buy through third parties. There's nothing wrong with that, by the way. We do great business with movie theater chains and big box retailers and multichannel distributors. But given the way the world is and what technology makes available and given the passion that our customers have for our brands: Marvel, Disney, Pixar, ESPN, Star Wars, we have an opportunity to reach the consumer directly in ways that our competitors can't come close to doing. So it is a competitive advantage and it is an opportunity the technology is providing us. And it's something ultimately that you'll see more of, both from a consumer proposition perspective and from a company perspective. The pricing, we debated a lot about. We're going to market with a price that we think reflects the value of the product that we're offering and the experience that we're offering. I can't tell you that we're absolutely certain it's the right price. It's the price that we decided to take it out to the market with. And we have -- what we do know is we've created an elegant product, it's a really good user experience. We love the look, the feel of the navigation. And we'll see. It also has the ability to provide the content in multi-languages, for instance. And so you can imagine the opportunities in terms of other markets both in Europe and the rest of the world. And it is also a technology we can use for those other brands."

Now the first to do a direct consumer branded subscription product in the U.K. So clearly, you're comfortable with this.

And that all these things that have worked so well for you have essentially allowed you to sell what you already have for more money? An authenticated app, you're sort of making more money and you're not breaking up the bundle.

They don't just want to sit in a living room on a couch and watch our product on a fixed screen on the wall with a remote control in their hand. They want to do it in many more ways, and they have the authority, thanks to technology, to make those decisions. So we're starting with what we believe the consumer wants.

So second, as it relates to, well, maybe in a strange way, flexibility. All of these things are designed to obviously create product that we think ultimately benefits the shareholders of The Walt Disney Company but also to learn from. And if we take product out that may work in a given time but long term have a negative impact on brand -- on businesses or business models that can continue to create more value for us, then we'll retract and we'll cut back. We don't want to -- look, we've got a lot of good things going for us. And in reality, the multichannel business model, while facing more competition than ever before, is still a huge driver of value for this company. What we ultimately would want to do would be to do whatever we can working with the distributors to make that product more compelling, more consumer-facing than it ever has been. That's really the biggest goal. As it relates to SVOD and those things, I think we can get to a point where off-network programs, both in-season and prior season, are bundled with the channels that the programs were originally on. And that may be a feature that's offered to multichannel subscribers that's designed as a means to perpetuate that business model or make that business model more consumer friendly. So I'm not going to suggest that we're set in our ways or stuck in the business model of the future to the point where it damages the former business model in ways that either aren't necessary or that are premature."

And the -- as we mentioned at the time, we were fully hedged going into fiscal '16 so that estimate that we gave you of about a $500 million impact year-over-year is still the right estimate looking forward to the year. So there's no change on that. And the impact for fiscal '15, there was a modest negative impact from what was originally given but that's only because some of our businesses outperformed. So once again, we were fully hedged based on the estimates as we're going into a fiscal year. On the cable affiliate growth, we updated our 3-year affiliate guidance on the last earnings call and we don't intend to update it again. We also aren't -- we don't give annual guidance on affiliate revenue growth. But I will remind you that the fiscal '15 did benefit from the launch of the SEC Network, and that is something that we will be comping against in fiscal '16."

You know that you're making too much when either your quality is going down or the marketplace is telling you that they've -- there's fatigue or they've had enough. We don't see that in any of the products that we're making or that you cited. Pixar had one of its most successful releases ever with Inside Out and it's most original this past year, and we're really excited about The Good Dinosaur and, of course, we have Finding Dory, the sequel to Nemo, next year as a for instance. Marvel, obviously, Avengers 2: Age of Ultron did extremely well in over $1.4 billion in global revenue, in global box office. And we've got Captain America 3: Civil War, coming up this year and a pretty rich pipeline thereafter. Of both sequels, things like Thor and Captain America, as I mentioned, and Ant Man, but also original like Doctor Strange, for instance, we like that balance. Star Wars, we're just getting into. Obviously premature. But we're basically planning roughly a Star Wars release a year for the next 6 years, 3 of them part of the saga, 7, 8 and 9. 3 will be standalone films. I think we've only announced 2 of those 3, Rogue One being the first, which comes out in December '16. So we don't think we're oversaturated. If anything, we think that we're very, very well-balanced in terms of taking these products to market. In terms of products that -- or franchises that we don't own, obviously not going to comment on that except I can say that with Disney, which is also never been stronger, by the way, just look at the Oscars that we've won for Frozen and Big Hero 6, the box office, the excitement about this movie Zootopia that's coming up, which I think is going to be a real sleeper hit. And that's coming up in actually first quarter -- end of the first calendar quarter, rather, of '16. I think with Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Lucas' Star Wars, we don't really have much of a need. Our pipeline is pretty rich, the richest ever for us. But we'll be opportunistic. If we see something that we feel is as attractive as these others have been that's leverageable across markets, across businesses over long periods of time, which is what we really consider a franchise, then we certainly have the capital structure to be able to take advantage of the opportunity."

So on the last call, you acknowledged that there is a modicum of decline, whether it's 1% or 2%, something like that, seems to be the industry numbers. But it would seem to me that, that decline is unlikely to go on in perpetuity, that there is a sticking point, there is a group of people who won't -- are not likely to cancel pay-TV because among other things, they like sports and they're average sports fans and you can't get that very easily outside of pay-TV. And other reasons, maybe economic reasons are driving the cancellations. Have you guys done research that would suggest to you where these declines in subs might end? If we're down 1% for a couple of years, does it stop then? What are your learnings telling you about where the sticking point is on declines?"

At the end of the day, we talked about the subs in the terms that we've had, and generally what we're seeing is consistent with what we've talked about last quarter. Having said that, as Bob indicated earlier, this market's going to continue to evolve and one of the things that we're going to see is that there's room for optimizing the bundle of programming that people receive, there are opportunities to increase the price value relationship as well as the user experience of those. And as we indicated earlier, the program availability will likely be augmented over time. Bob talked about the possibility of in-season stacking being offered through the programming services that we offer. So I think you're going to see the bundle continue to evolve and I think you're going to see the industry, programmers and distributors alike, respond to the consumer empowerment with increasingly strong product. And at the end of the day, we feel really good about the positioning of our major branded services: ESPN, Disney, ABC, to play a vital role in that optimization of the bundle. So I think that this is going to play out over a long period of time.
