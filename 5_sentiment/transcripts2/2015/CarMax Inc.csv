As you saw by now, we had both a record fourth quarter and a record fiscal year. During the year, total revenues grew to more than $14 billion and we sold nearly 1 million total vehicles, more than 591,000 retail cars and 376,000 wholesale cars through our in-store auctions. Here's some of the key highlights for the year.
Used unit comps up 4% and total used units grew by over 10%. Wholesale vehicle gross profit, up 16%, driven by a 10% increase in units sold and an increase in wholesale growth gross profit per unit of $54 per car.
Cap income, up 9% to more than $367 million. Tom will give some more details on that in a moment. Excluding the items we highlighted in the press release, net income for the fiscal year increased 16% and EPS grew 21%.
Our data indicates that for the calendar year 2014, we increased our share of the 0 to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 5%. We continue -- we also continue to focus on returning value to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2015, we bought back 17.5 million shares at a cost of a little over $900 million. Since we began the program in fiscal 2013, we have purchased more than 30 million shares.
Now on to some of the key drivers for the fourth quarter. Used unit comps, up 7%, driven by an increase in traffic, as well as an improvement in conversion. Total used units grew by 12%. Also, growth gross profit up 22%, reflecting a 12% increase in units sold and an increase of $83 in gross profit per unit. Cap quarterly income, up 12% to $90 million and again, excluding the items we shared in the press release, net income for the fourth quarter increased 20% and earnings per share up 28%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom and he'll give you some details around CAF. Tom?"

CAF recorded another solid year with 9% income growth to $367 million and growth in average managed receivables of 19%. As Tom mentioned, in the fourth quarter, CAF income was $90.4 million, up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and Q4 average managed receivables grew 18% to $8.3 billion.
CAF's weighted average contract rate, that rate that we charge to customers was flat for last year's fourth quarter at 72.2% [ph]. This rate continue to be relatively stable at around 7% for the last couple of years. The allowance for loan losses grew to about $82 million. This represents 1% of managed receivables, which is relatively consistent with last year, but during the quarter and the year, CAF income did benefit from favorable loss experience.
CAF net penetration was 40.9% compared to  40.1% in last year's fourth quarter. This figure includes originations from our subprime test and to get back on those originations, this quarter's penetration would have been 40.2%, which is similar to last year.
Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 16% [ph] to $1.2 billion, due to a combination of CarMax's unit sales growth, our modestly higher penetration and a small increase in the average amount financed.
Finally, we intend to continue with our subprime test. Recall that our primary goal for this investment was to gain knowledge regarding the space and we expect these learnings would prove invaluable. While performance to date is in line with our expectations. We believe the receivables to see them deeper into their life, including maturing through a full tax season will better equip us to assess our long term strategy.
On average, the term of these contracts nearly 70 months and the fiscal year-end, the average term in our books for the loan is less than 7 months. We're comfortable continuing to originate at the current target volume, which is 5% of CarMax's subprime sales or a little less than 2% of CAF originations.

SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 11% to $330 million, contributing to this growth was the addition of 18 stores since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year and a $9 million increase in share-based compensation expense.
On a per-unit basis, SG&A decreased $23 to $21.86 compared to 2,209 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '14. During the fourth quarter, we opened 1 store in our new Cleveland market, in Katharine's hometown."

The key thing that we're looking at is the quality of their offers and what that translates to, and how many of the customers that receive offers from them, actually convert to a sale. Our subprime partners cannot control the nature of what's coming into them because the Tier 2 lenders are looking at it ahead of time and have the first look at that.

So we've been pretty pleased of what we have done so for  and we'll gauge the results going forward and see how much more aggressive we want to spend. In terms of the relo, that's our Rockville store. Our Rockville store was originally a competitor who built a kind of a copy cat. It's a very small footprint. I think it's only on 5 acres or so and it's been a very successful store for us. This is just a situation where the lease was up for renewal and we took the opportunity to move. We're really only moving a short distance away from that store to a much bigger facility and that store's been very successful for us, but was really undersized the whole time we had it.

In terms of customer-facing, it's something that we continue to invest in and we'll continue to invest in more going forward. We want to make sure that we can communicate with our customers, however, it is if they want to communicate with us. I've talked in the past about being a little bit behind in terms of Marbella. We'll continue to invest there. We've made lots of improvements over time to our pictures and the quality of our pictures. We used to take 1 then 9, we're up to around 40. We have high definition pictures. We have zoom capability. We've adjusted our landing Pages to be more personalized and we'll continued to mix some  efforts in that regard as well. And I think you'll see us do a lot more stuff at as it relates to mobile. And touchscreen, it's more than 50% of our total hits to our website are now coming from either a mobile device or a tablet and it's something that we need to make sure that the customer has a fantastic experience if they want to communicate with us in that format. So those are the kinds of things we continue to invest in and we've testbed online capabilities, which is a lot -- you see a lot of niche type things from various, whether they're competitors or people who enable our competitors'. Things such as online credit applications, which we're testing. The ability to transfer a car from one location to another without speaking to sales consultant. The ability to put a credit card payment down to have those cars transferred, which we're doing. You can go online and put a car on hold, you can make an appointment with our sales consultants, so we've done a lot of stuff to make sure our customers can do more and more of the process from home. They can fill out a good chunk of the paperwork before they show up at our store.
But all of these things are the types of stuff that we need to continue to invest in. But I think we've made a lot of nice progress, but we got a long way to go."

We've always been 0 to 10, so it's a much broader spectrum of vehicle than you stayed in there. That number did change over time as I stated in my comments, 0 to 4-year old cars represent 75% of our results. That was 70% just a couple of years ago, so it's moved by about 5 points, but you kind of have to look at a much broader spectrum of inventory to look at total sales for CarMax and it does look like you would see a supply movement in 0 to 4 just based on movement and Star, and as I've said, before we have historically had higher share in the 0 to 4-year old segment. So is there a potential tailwind? Probably, but there's -- another factor in there is consumer behavior and they will trade out as cars as much as they used to when you have population growth and new drivers and things like that. So there's lots of different variables and factors, and I don't think you can just say that we expect whatever the number you said, 20% or 10 -- i forgot what number you said there, but I don't think we can just expect that as an increase in sales. In terms of how did the stores handle it, we've been deliver exceptionally high volumes on of some pretty limited space on our stores and all comp sales are more profitable than sales wants you've cleared all of your expenses. So it's very, very profitable for the company to continue to deliver comp sales out of existing facilities because a lot of your fixed overhead remains constant. You really just have to add some favorable overheads. So we're really pleased with the comps we delivered over the last couple of years. I think it's one of the great parts of our business model is that our stores continue to grow. As I said, we gained 5% sure during the year, that's on top of the 17% share gain in the year prior. But once again, that silver, 0 to 10-year old cars, so I think our stores are well primed to take advantage of supply increases if that translates to sales and then they're well positioned to turn that into better than average profits because they're all on top of base that's already covered and fixed overhead."

Increased the company size from 90-ish stores to 145 or so. So and we opened 13 this year and we plan on opening 14 next year. So it's right in the -- just kind of in the of what we delivered.

So a lot of times when you look, when we're in a build mode, when we get a car done and saleable, we make it salable in the store that finished it, so some stores have elevated inventory in anticipation of the store opening when we shipped the cars over to the new store. So if you look at our total sales increase for the quarter, I think it was 12%. And you would expect inventory to go up kind of commensurate with that number and then we have another during the quarter, 7% of comps and I know inventory is slightly higher than when we add those 2 things together, but that I think is more of a reflection of, we're a little behind where we wanted to be last year.

CAF income, up 9% to more than $367 million. Tom will give some more details on that in a moment. Excluding the items we highlighted in the press release, net income for the fiscal year increased 16% and EPS grew 21%.
Our data indicates that for the calendar year 2014, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year-old used vehicle market by approximately 5%. We continue to -- we also continue to focus on returning value to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2015, we bought back 17.5 million shares at a cost of a little over $900 million. Since we began the program in fiscal 2013, we have purchased more than 30 million shares.
Now on to some of the key drivers for the fourth quarter. Used unit comps, up 7%, driven by an increase in traffic as well as an improvement in conversion. Total used units grew by 12%. Wholesale growth -- gross profit, up 22%, reflecting a 12% increase in units sold and an increase of $83 in gross profit per unit. CAF quarterly income, up 12% to $90 million. And again, excluding the items we shared in the press release, net income for the fourth quarter increased 20% and earnings per share, up 28%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom and he'll give you some details around CAF. Tom?"

CAF recorded another solid year with 9% income growth to $367 million and growth in average managed receivables, 19%. As Tom mentioned, in the fourth quarter, CAF income was $90.4 million, up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. And Q4 average managed receivables grew 18% to $8.3 billion.
CAF's weighted average contract rate, that rate that we charge to customers, was flat for last year's fourth quarter at 7.2%. This rate continued to be relatively stable at around 7% for the past couple of years. The allowance for loan losses grew to about $82 million. This represents 1% of managed receivables, which is relatively consistent with last year. But during the quarter and the year, CAF income did benefit from favorable loss experience.
CAF net penetration was 40.9% compared to 40.1% in last year's fourth quarter. This figure includes originations from our subprime test. And if you back up those originations, this quarter's penetration would have been 40.2%, which is similar to last year. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 16% [ph] to $1.2 billion, due to a combination of CarMax's unit sales growth, our modestly higher penetration and a small increase in the average amount financed.
Finally, we intend to continue with our subprime test. Recall that our primary goal for this investment was to gain knowledge regarding the space, and we expect these learnings would prove invaluable. While performance to date is in line with our expectations, we believe allowing the receivables to season deeper into their life, including maturing through a full tax season, will better equip us to assess our long-term strategy.
On average, the term of these contracts is nearly 70 months, and at fiscal year-end, the average term on our books for the loans is less than 7 months. We're comfortable continuing to originate at the current target volume, which is 5% of CarMax's subprime sales or a little less than 2% of CAF originations.

SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 11% to $330 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 18 stores since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year and a $9 million increase in share-based compensation expense.

The key thing that we're looking at is the quality of their offers, and what that translates into is how many of customers that receive offers from them actually convert to a sale. Our subprime partners cannot control the nature of what's coming into them because the Tier 2 lenders are looking at it ahead of time and have the first look at that. So on the basis of conversion of offers, we see their behavior to be very consistent and we're very happy with their performance."

So first of all, over our history, we've constantly spent capital on keeping our stores up-to-date and renovating them over time. Since we launched the next-gen concept, I forget, 4, 5 years ago now, we've now gone back in and we're applying some of those technology changes with some more digital screens and some digital capabilities in the stores as well as open seating, which we really had prior to next gen, but we think it's a much more efficient use of floor space. And so the conversions are a little more extensive than they have been, because we're doing a combination of technology and converting, whether it's cubes or offices into floor space. We just finished converting our Richmonde store. It looks fantastic, and that be all the store in the chain. I think we completed 3 or 4 full -- of these types of convergence and they're a little bit more expensive than the money that would have been spent, so we just thought we would call it out and we plan to do another 17 this year. 
In terms of the operational changes, it doesn't change much operationally, but I think it provides a better experience for our customers and a better working environment for our associates as well. So we've been pretty pleased with what we've done so for and we'll gauge the results going forward and see how much more aggressively we want to spend. 
In terms of the relo, that's our Rockville store. Our Rockville store was originally a competitor who built a kind of a copy cat. It's a very small footprint. I think it's only on 5 acres or so and it's been a very successful store for us. This is just a situation where the lease was up for renewal and we took the opportunity to move. We're really only moving a short distance away from that store to a much bigger facility. And that store's been very successful for us, but was really undersized the whole time we had it. At this time, we don't have any other plans for relos. This one was just more opportunistic as the lease came up."

So as far as liquidity goes, I mean, we're in an environment where if you feel pretty good about our banks' willingness to step up live up to their commitments on our revolving credit facility, we have a $1 billion facility, we'll managed to some amount of liquidity that we can run the business with. But I think the decline of the cash balance was planned and deliberate, and the business is still generating a lot of cash. And if you look kind of closely at it, it reflects that."

So I think we've done a pretty good job of utilizing technology in our stores so that our associates can deliver a great customer experience. 
In terms of customer facing, it's something that we continue to invest in and we'll continue to invest in more going forward. We want to make sure that we can communicate with our customers, however it is that they want to communicate with us. I've talked in the past about being a little bit behind in terms of mobile. We'll continue to invest there. We've made lots of improvements over time to our pictures and the quality of our pictures. We used to take 1 then 9. We're up to around 40. We have high-definition pictures. We have zoom capability. We've adjusted our landing pages to be more personalized and we'll continue to make some efforts in that regard as well. And I think you'll see us do a lot more stuff as it relates to mobile and touchscreen. It's more than 50% of our total hits to our website are now coming from either a mobile device or a tablet and it's something that we need to make sure that the customer has a fantastic experience if they want to communicate with us in that format. So those are the kinds of things we continue to invest in. 
And we've tested online capabilities, which is a lot -- you see a lot of nichey-type things from various -- whether they're competitors or people who enable our competitors. Things such as online credit applications, which we're testing. The ability to transfer a car from one location to another without speaking to a sales consultant, the ability to put a credit card payment down to have those cars transferred, which we're doing. You can go online and put a car on hold. You can make an appointment with our sales consultants. So we've done a lot of stuff to make sure our customers can do more and more of the process from home. They can fill out a good chunk of the paperwork before they show up at our store. But all these things are the types of stuff that we need to continue to invest in.

Can you just comment on that at all, about maybe what some of the risks are to that? Or is there something that I'm missing?

We've always been 0 to 10, so it's a much broader spectrum of vehicles than you stated there. That number did change over time. As I stated in my comments, 0- to 4-year-old cars represent 75% of our sales. That was 70% just a couple of years ago, so it's moved by about 5 points. But you kind of have to look at a much broader spectrum of inventory to look at total sales for CarMax. And it does look like you would see a supply movement in 0 to 4, just based on movement and SAR [ph]. And as I've said, before we have historically had higher share in the 0- to 4-year-old segment. So is there a potential tailwind? Probably, but there's -- the other factor in there is consumer behavior and will they trade out a car as much as they used to when you have population growth and new drivers and things like that. So there's lots of different variables and factors, and I don't think you can just say we expect whatever the number you said, 20% or -- I forgot what number you said there. But I don't think we can just expect that as an increase in sales. 
In terms of how did the stores handle it. We've been able to deliver exceptionally high volumes out of some pretty limited space in our stores and all comp sales are more profitable than sales, once you've cleared all of your expenses. So it's very, very profitable for the company to continue to deliver comp sales out of existing facilities because a lot of your fixed overhead remains constant. You really just have to add some favorable overheads. 
So we're really pleased with the comps we delivered over the last couple of years. I think it's one of the great parts of our business model, is that our stores continue to grow. As I said, we gained 5% share during the year. That's on top of the 17% share gain in the year prior. But once again, that's over 0- to 10-year-old cars. So I think our stores are well primed to take advantage of supply increases, if that translates to sales. And then they're well positioned to turn that into better-than-average profits because they're all on top of a base that's already covering fixed overhead."

Because it's new to us, we're willing to be patient and ensure that we understand it completely before we do anything else. It does not rule out us doing a larger amount in the future. 
But if you remember, when we rolled this out 1 year ago, we said that there was 3 things we're looking for: one is learning, which we're definitely gaining on that. I think it's going to benefit our business, whether or not we're in this space. But the other was a risk diversification play, and we have 3 partners in the subprime space who are doing an awesome job. Any decisions we make will be contemplating the impact on them, and I would not expect us to ever intend to be the sole player in this space like we are in the prime space. That's probably as much color as I can give you about what where our intentions would go."

Over the last 12 months, we've seen emergence of a few peer-to-peer used vehicle platforms that try to pass on SG&A savings to customers.

One could argue that, that's where those sales would come from since they're already happening and it's just such a giant piece. It's by far the biggest piece of -- the biggest percentage of cars sold are sold from peer-to-peer already. 
A lot of what do in our -- when we make a cash offer to every customer on every single car, I think we probably have tapped into that as well as anybody, by getting some of those cars that maybe would've been sold peer to peer.

As we continue to get more data in existing markets, it gives us more comfort with going back into those markets, but we have a healthy mix of new markets as well. And one thing to take into account, when we go into a metro market like Philadelphia, Minneapolis or this year will be entering Boston, those are intentionally multiyear plays for us to really grow out the market. So when you see us go back into Philly with the Turnersville, New Jersey store this year, that's just part of the long-term Philadelphia plan. It looks like a skew towards an existing market, but those are existing markets that are clearly under-stored and we're not where we expect to be long term. So I expect it to be a mix going forward. 
Some of the big ones that we have coming in the next 3 years or so: Boston, San Francisco and Seattle are places where we have no presence. And it's taken us, I don't know, 15 years to get to 10 stores in LA. And you'll see us continue to learn more, figure out places where we're -- zip codes where we're missing, and then try to figure out the best storing pattern to go into those bigger metro markets. So I don't read too much into that because some of -- as I said, some of it is just planned because the markets are bigger and more stores are required to fill them out."

As you saw by now, we had both a record fourth quarter and a record fiscal year. During the year, total revenues grew to more than $14 billion and we sold nearly 1 million total vehicles, more than 591,000 retail cars and 376,000 wholesale cars through our in-store auctions. Here's some -- here are some of the key highlights for the year.
Used unit comps, up 4%, and total used units grew by over 10%. Wholesale vehicle gross profit, up 16%, driven by a 10% increase in units sold and an increase in wholesale growth -- gross profit per unit of $54 per car.
CAF income, up 9% to more than $367 million. Tom will give some more details on that in a moment. Excluding the items we highlighted in the press release, net income for the fiscal year increased 16% and EPS grew 21%.
Our data indicates that for the calendar year 2014, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year-old used vehicle market by approximately 5%. We continue to -- we also continue to focus on returning value to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2015, we bought back 17.5 million shares at a cost of a little over $900 million. Since we began the program in fiscal 2013, we have purchased more than 30 million shares.
Now on to some of the key drivers for the fourth quarter. Used unit comps, up 7%, driven by an increase in traffic as well as an improvement in conversion. Total used units grew by 12%. Wholesale growth -- gross profit, up 22%, reflecting a 12% increase in units sold and an increase of $83 in gross profit per unit. CAF quarterly income, up 12% to $90 million. And again, excluding the items we shared in the press release, net income for the fourth quarter increased 20% and earnings per share, up 28%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom and he'll give you some details around CAF. Tom?"

CAF recorded another solid year with 9% income growth to $367 million and growth in average managed receivables of 19%. As Tom mentioned, in the fourth quarter, CAF income was $90.4 million, up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. And Q4 average managed receivables grew 18% to $8.3 billion.
CAF's weighted average contract rate, that rate that we charge to customers, was flat to last year's fourth quarter at 7.2%. This rate continued to be relatively stable at around 7% for the past couple of years. The allowance for loan losses grew to about $82 million. This represents 1% of managed receivables, which is relatively consistent with last year. But during the quarter and the year, CAF income did benefit from favorable loss experience.
CAF net penetration was 40.9% compared to 40.1% in last year's fourth quarter. This figure includes originations from our subprime test. And if you back out those originations, this quarter's penetration would have been 40.2%, which is similar to last year. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 16% to $1.2 billion, due to a combination of CarMax's unit sales growth, our modestly higher penetration and a small increase in the average amount financed.
Finally, we intend to continue with our subprime test. Recall that our primary goal for this investment was to gain knowledge regarding the space, and we expect these learnings will prove invaluable. While performance to date is in line with our expectations, we believe allowing the receivables to season deeper into their life, including maturing through a full tax season, will better equip us to assess our long-term strategy.
On average, the term of these contracts is nearly 70 months, and at fiscal year-end, the average term on our books for the loans is less than 7 months. We're comfortable continuing to originate at the current target volume, which is 5% of CarMax's subprime sales or a little less than 2% of CAF originations.

SG&A for the quarter increased approximately 11% to $330 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 18 stores since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year and a $9 million increase in share-based compensation expense.
On a per-unit basis, SG&A decreased $23 to $2,186 compared to $2,209 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '14. During the fourth quarter, we opened 1 store in our new Cleveland market and Katharine's hometown."

We expect the small-format stores to be a part of our store openings going forward. Of our 14 store openings in fiscal '16, there will be 3 small format, including our first small-format front store with production -- full production capability in the back, and that will be in Gainesville, Florida.
Also, we now plan to open between 13 and 16 stores annually over the next 3 years. Store traffic was up once again in the quarter, and our web traffic also continued to expand. For the fourth quarter, average monthly web visits grew over 9% compared to last year's fourth quarter to over 14.5 million visits.

The key thing that we're looking at is the quality of their offers, and what that translates into is how many of those customers that receive offers from them actually convert to a sale. Our subprime partners cannot control the nature of what's coming into them because the Tier 2 lenders are looking at it ahead of time and have the first look at that. So on the basis of conversion of offers, we see their behavior to be very consistent and we're very happy with their performance."

So first of all, over our history, we've constantly spent capital on keeping our stores up-to-date and renovating them over time. Since we launched the next-gen concept, I forget, 4, 5 years ago now, we've now gone back in and we're applying some of those technology changes with some more digital screens and some digital capabilities in the stores as well as open seating, which we really had prior to next gen, but we think it's a much more efficient use of floor space. And so the conversions are a little more extensive than they have been, because we're doing a combination of technology and converting, whether it's cubes or offices, into floor space. We just finished converting our Richmond store. It looks fantastic, and that's the oldest store in the chain. I think we completed 3 or 4 full -- of these types of convergence, and they're a little bit more expensive than the money that would have been spent so we just thought we would call it out, and we plan to do another 17 this year. 
In terms of the operational changes, it doesn't change much operationally, but I think it provides a better experience for our customers and a better working environment for our associates as well. So we've been pretty pleased with what we've done so for, and we'll gauge the results going forward and see how much more aggressively we want to spend. 
In terms of the relo, that's our Rockville store. Our Rockville store was originally a competitor who built a kind of a copy cat. It's a very small footprint. I think it's only on 5 acres or so and it's been a very successful store for us. This is just a situation where the lease was up for renewal and we took the opportunity to move. We're really only moving a short distance away from that store to a much bigger facility. And that store's been very successful for us, but was really undersized the whole time we had it. At this time, we don't have any other plans for relos. This one was just more opportunistic as the lease came up."

We have a $1 billion facility. We'll manage to some amount of liquidity that we can run the business with. But I think the decline of the cash balance was planned and deliberate, and the business is still generating a lot of cash. And if you look kind of closely at it, it reflects that."

In terms of customer facing, it's something that we continue to invest in and we'll continue to invest in more going forward. We want to make sure that we can communicate with our customers, however it is that they want to communicate with us. I've talked in the past about being a little bit behind in terms of mobile. We'll continue to invest there. We've made lots of improvements over time to our pictures and the quality of our pictures. We used to take 1 then 9. We're up to around 40. We have high-definition pictures. We have zoom capability. We've adjusted our landing pages to be more personalized, and we'll continue to make some efforts in that regard as well. And I think you'll see us do a lot more stuff as it relates to mobile and touchscreen. It's -- more than 50% of our total hits to our website are now coming from either a mobile device or a tablet, and it's something that we need to make sure that the customer has a fantastic experience if they want to communicate with us in that format. So those are the kinds of things we continue to invest in. 
And we've tested online capabilities, which is a lot -- you see a lot of nichey-type things from various -- whether they're competitors or people who enable our competitors. Things such as online credit applications, which we're testing. The ability to transfer a car from one location to another without speaking to a sales consultant, the ability to put a credit card payment down to have those cars transferred, which we're doing. You can go online and put a car on hold. You can make an appointment with our sales consultants. So we've done a lot of stuff to make sure our customers can do more and more of the process from home. They can fill out a good chunk of the paperwork before they show up at our store. But all these things are the types of stuff that we need to continue to invest in.

Can you just comment on that at all, about maybe what some of the risks are to that? Or is there something that I'm missing?

We've always been 0 to 10, so it's a much broader spectrum of vehicles than you stated there. That number did change over time. As I stated in my comments, 0- to 4-year-old cars represent 75% of our sales. That was 70% just a couple of years ago, so it's moved by about 5 points. But you kind of have to look at a much broader spectrum of inventory to look at total sales for CarMax. And it does look like you would see a supply movement in 0 to 4, just based on movement in SAAR. And as I've said, before we have historically had higher share in the 0- to 4-year-old segment. So is there a potential tailwind? Probably, but there's -- the other factor in there is consumer behavior and will they trade out of cars as much as they used to, and you have population growth and new drivers and things like that. So there's lots of different variables and factors, and I don't think you can just say we expect whatever the number you said, 20% or 10%. I forget what number you said there. But I don't think we can just expect that as an increase in sales. 
In terms of how do the stores handle it, we've been able to deliver exceptionally high volumes out of some pretty limited space in our stores. And all comp sales are more profitable than sales, once you've cleared all of your expenses. So it's very, very profitable for the company to continue to deliver comp sales out of existing facilities because a lot of your fixed overhead remains constant. You really just have to add some variable overhead. 
So we're really pleased with the comps we delivered over the last couple of years. I think it's one of the great parts of our business model, is that our stores continue to grow. As I said, we gained 5% share during the year. That's on top of the 17% share gain in the year prior. But once again, that's over 0- to 10-year-old cars. So I think our stores are well primed to take advantage of supply increases, if that translates to sales. And then they're well positioned to turn that into better-than-average profits because they're all on top of a base that's already covering fixed overhead."

And what we've seen in the past -- and we've been at this for 20 years. And we've seen lease percentages in the 30s and we've seen lease percentages in the teens. What ends up happening is eventually, those cars end up available for purchase and we've done a nice job figuring out how to have access to them."

But if you remember, when we rolled this out 1 year ago, we said that there was 3 things we're looking for. One is learning, which we're definitely gaining on that. I think it's going to benefit our business, whether or not we're in this space. But the other was a risk diversification play, and we have 3 partners in the subprime space who are doing an awesome job. Any decisions we make will be contemplating the impact on them, and I would not expect us to ever intend to be the sole player in this space like we are in the prime space.

One could argue that that's where those sales would come from since they're already happening, and it's just such a giant piece. It's by far the biggest piece of -- the biggest percentage of cars sold are sold from peer to peer already. 
A lot of what we do in our -- when we make a cash offer to every customer on every single car, I think we probably have tapped into that as well as anybody, by getting some of those cars that maybe would've been sold peer to peer.

As we continue to get more data in existing markets, it gives us more comfort with going back into those markets, but we have a healthy mix of new markets as well. And one thing to take into account, when we go into a metro market like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, or this year we'll be entering Boston, those are intentionally multiyear plays for us to really grow out the market. So when you see us go back into Philly with the Turnersville, New Jersey, store this year, that's just part of the long-term Philadelphia plan. It looks like a skew towards an existing market, but those are existing markets that are clearly under-stored and we're not where we expect to be long term. So I expect it to be a mix going forward. 
Some of the big ones that we have coming in the next 3 years or so: Boston, San Francisco and Seattle, are places where we have no presence. And it's taken us, I don't know, 15 years to get to 10 stores in L.A. And you'll see us continue to learn more, figure out places where we're -- zip codes where we're missing, and then try to figure out the best storing pattern to go into those bigger metro markets.

Gross profit per unit relatively flat at $2,200 compared to $2,220 in the first quarter of last year.

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 15% compared to first quarter fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 17% to $8.7 billion.

The weighted average contract rate, the rate we charge to the customers was 7.4%, up slightly from last year's first quarter at 7.2%. Our allowance for loan losses grew to about $84 million or 0.94% of managed receivables. CAF net penetration was 42.2% [ph], half a point of that came from loans originated under our subprime test and that compares with 41.3% in last year's first quarter. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 10% to $1.4 billion, unit combination of CarMax unit sales growth and CAF's modestly higher penetration.

We plan to open one more store in the second quarter in Tallahassee, Florida, which will be a new market for us.

And as we talked about the last couple of quarters to move our capital structures to ones with a little bit more leverage in it. And that is something we're committed to do over the medium- to long-term. In any given quarter, we might see some bounce around because rather than having a trading mentality, we're trying to take a programmatic approach to buying back stock. We set a program and we let it run for a period of time. That program is going to have a guideline in it that allows for more share repurchase at lower stock prices. And dialing it back as the stock goes up. So we just kind of look at it from a longer-term perspective. We'll adjust those parameters as appropriate going forward, but that's pretty much as much as I could say. We have a program in place that dialed back at higher stock prices.

We think about it over a very long period of time. If you look at it over a long period of time it has essentially grown with unit sales. We're not worried at all that it grew 5%. I'm glad that it grew 5%. It's a very, very big business for us, it's a profitable business for us, it requires an incredible amount of effort in the stores. You think about every time we open up a new production store and even in a new market, we got to run another business within it. We have to have great customer service, we have to attract dealers to our auctions everyday, and we have to give those, it was a great experience because they have other choices and they can go in other places. So again, it's a big business. It grew 5% in the quarter, not quite where the retail growth was, but you've been following us for a long time. You've seen that number dramatically in the other direction as well sometimes. So we're really thinking about that business over the long haul. And also as you know, that business is now an independent business. It's attached to retail. Almost all the cars sold in wholesale are direct acquisitions from consumers, many of those who are buying cars from us, so we have to make sure that we're competitive. So I was very pleased with the quarter for wholesale."

If you look at the average of all the publicly traded new car dealers, used comps during the first quarter were at 5%, so about in line with where we were. Within that is where you see the growth in CPOs. So there is a distinction there that you have to make. Lease percentage right now I think in the new car industry, it's somewhere around 30% and when you see that supply coming back it is really 2 or 3 years later after you see a high lease percentage. So I'm not sure that we've seen much of it yet, but it's never been a problem for us to source cars. And when cars are at a high lease percentage, when you look out 2 and 3 years later, generally, they're more organized at the auction, so it's a little easier for us actually to buy those cars when we see them come back to the marketplace. But we really haven't seen lease percentage change our ability to source cars over time, and we've been at this for over 20 years.

We spend a lot of time trying to figure that out and we don't have a lot of success. So I'd say it comes from all kinds of different areas. There's an argument that people are more prepared when they show up in the store because they spend more time in the website. There's an argument for more inventory for selection for the customer. You can clearly see impacts from movements in credit. That impact conversion as well. We have extensive training programs going on in our stores in all areas of the company, which I think helped conversion, of course. We can buy cars a little bit better, have the right selection in individual  stores even without having more cars. So we always say around here, conversions is a very big word and it includes lots of things. So I really can't attribute specific points to any one of them."

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 15% compared to first quarter fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 17% to $8.7 billion.

The weighted average contract rate, that rate we charge to the customers, was 7.4%, up slightly from last year's first quarter at 7.2%. Our allowance for loan losses grew to about $84 million or 0.94% of managed receivables.

And that is something we're committed to do over the medium to long term. In any given quarter, we might see some bouncing around because rather than having a trading mentality, we're trying to take a programmatic approach to buying back stock. We set up a program and we let it run for a period of time. That program is going to have a guideline in it that allows for more share repurchase at lower stock prices and dialing it back if the stock goes up. So we just kind of look at it from a longer-term perspective. We'll adjust those parameters as appropriate going forward, but that's pretty much as much as I can say about it. We have a program in place that dial back at higher stock prices. We saw the stock price increase significantly over the last several months. And as time goes forward, we'll adjust it as appropriate, but keeping an eye on the fact that we do want to keep making progress towards more leveraging the capital structure."

So we've identified right now at least 80 markets that meet that criteria and that'll be part of our regular growth program going forward. Last month, the store that I mentioned in Gainesville, Florida is getting a little bit of a hybrid. It has a small format front end, which means we operate it with the overhead structure that we've created for the small-format stores, but we have a full production shop in the back. So we're always going to be working on our formats and try to find out what's the most efficient way to run a store at various volumes. And we have incredible variation and incredible capabilities as a company to be able to go after just about any market now.

We think about it over a very long period of time. If you look at it over a long period of time, it has essentially grown with unit sales. We're not worried at all that it grew 5%. I'm glad that it grew 5%. It's a very, very big business for us, it's a profitable business for us, it requires an incredible amount of effort in the stores. You think about every time we open up a new production store, and even in a new market, we got to run another business within it. We have to have great customer service, we have to attract dealers to our auctions every day, and we have to give those dealers a great experience because they have other choices and they can go to other places. So again, it's a big business. It grew 5% in the quarter, not quite what the retail growth was. But you've been following us for a long time, you've seen that number dramatically in the other direction as well sometimes. So we're really thinking about that business over the long haul. And also as you know, that business is now an independent business. It's attached to retail. Almost all the cars sold in wholesale are direct acquisitions from consumers, many of those who are buying cars from us, so we have to make sure that we're competitive.

So if you think about what's entailed in the finance business, there's a lot of activity contacting customers. If you're in an environment where people are less delinquent and there's fewer losses and fewer people not paying, which we are today, that means you're making less calls. It probably needs less resource to do that. If the world changes and got to pay more attention and be making more calls, that will have an impact on your cost. But I think the team down at CAF has done a great job of getting more efficient in both those types of environments and will try to continue to do so. And as far as Tier 3, as we roll that out to the extent we roll that out, I mean you would expect that it's a more high-touch business and it would have some impact on CAF's overhead costs, but we're not at a point where we can forecast that for you."

If you look at the average of all these publicly traded new car dealers, used comps during the first quarter were at 5%, so about in line with where we were. Within that is where you see the growth in CPOs. So there is a distinction there that you have to make. Lease percentage right now, I think, in the new car industry it's somewhere around 30%. And when you see that supply coming back, it's really 2 and 3 years later after you see a high lease percentage. So I'm not sure that we've seen much of it yet, but it's never been a problem for us to source cars. And when cars are at a high lease percentage, when you look out 2 and 3 years later, generally they're more organized at the auctions, so it's a little easier for us actually to buy those cars when we see them come back to the marketplace. But we really haven't seen lease percentage change our ability to source cars over time and we've been at this for over 20 years. So we actually think it's not a bad thing at all that there's a higher percentage of leases right now, and over the next 2 or 3 years, that'll give us more access to those cars."

We had a great first quarter driven by strong performance in all our key business areas and with the continuation of our store opening plan. 
I'll give you some of the highlights for the quarter. Used unit comps increased by 4.9% and total used units grew by 9.3%. Gross profit per unit, relatively flat at $2,200 compared to $2,220 in the first quarter of last year. Total wholesale units grew by 4.7% and gross profit per wholesale unit of $1,032 was similar to $1,046 in the first quarter of last year.

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 15% compared to first quarter fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 17% to $8.7 billion. 
As mentioned in the release, results for this quarter were again positively impacted by favorable loss experience at CAF. The weighted average contract rate, that rate we charge to the customers, was 7.4%, up slightly from last year's first quarter at 7.2%. Our allowance for loan losses grew to about $84 million or 0.94% of managed receivables. CAF net penetration was 42.2%; 0.5 point of that came from loans originated under our subprime test and that compares with 41.3% in last year's first quarter. 
Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 10% to $1.4 billion due to the combination of CarMax unit sales growth and CAF's modestly higher penetration. 
And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for about $120 million. That's down from the pace in recent quarters reflecting the increase in stock price. Tom?"

On a per-unit basis, SG&A increased $51 to $2,098 compared to $2,047 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, $39 of which was related to the stock-based compensation expense. 
During the first quarter we opened 3 stores, 2 in new markets for CarMax, Minneapolis and Gainesville, Florida. We also opened our third store in the Philadelphia market. After the first quarter ended, we opened our third and fourth stores in the Denver market, that was actually yesterday, and added a second store in the Providence market. We plan to open one more store in the second quarter in Tallahassee, Florida, which will be a new market for us. 
Our comp unit sales were driven by improved conversion and continued growth in customer traffic. 
Our web traffic was up almost 10% compared to the same period last year. Monthly web visits grew to nearly 16 million. And now over 60% of our visits are coming from something other than a laptop and a desktop, so either a mobile device through our app or on a tablet.

And that is something we're committed to do over the medium to long term. In any given quarter, we might see some bouncing around because rather than having a trading mentality, we're trying to take a programmatic approach to buying back stock. We set up a program and we let it run for a period of time. That program is going to have a guideline in it that allows for more share repurchase at lower stock prices and dialing it back if the stock goes up. So we're just kind of looking at it from a longer-term perspective. We'll adjust those parameters as appropriate going forward, but that's pretty much as much as I can say about it. We have a program in place that dials back at higher stock prices. We saw the stock price increase significantly over the last several months.

Last month, the store that I mentioned in Gainesville, Florida is -- it's a little bit of a hybrid. It has a small format front end, which means we operate it with the overhead structure that we've created for the small-format stores, but we have a full production shop in the back. So we're always going to be working on our formats and try to find out what's the most efficient way to run a store at various volumes. And we have incredible variation and incredible capabilities as a company to be able to go after just about any market now. We can open a market with selling as few as 75 cars a month and we can run stores that sell as many as 1,000 cars a month. So I'm really proud of what we've accomplished in being able to address all kinds of different market sizes."

We think about it over a very long period of time. If you look at it over a long period of time, it has essentially grown with unit sales. We're not worried at all that it grew 5%. I'm glad that it grew 5%. It's a very, very big business for us, it's a very profitable business for us, it requires an incredible amount of effort in the stores. You think about every time we open up a new production store, and even in a new market, we got to run another business within it. We have to have great customer service, we have to attract dealers to our auctions every day, and we have to give those dealers a great experience because they have other choices and they can go other places. So again, it's a big business. It grew 5% in the quarter, not quite what the retail growth was. But you've been following us for a long time, you've seen that number dramatically in the other direction as well sometimes. So we're really thinking about that business over the long haul. And also as you know, that business is not an independent business. It's attached to retail. Almost all the cars sold in wholesale are direct acquisitions from consumers, many of those who are buying cars from us, so we have to make sure that we're competitive. So I was very pleased with the quarter for wholesale."

If you look at the average of all these publicly traded new car dealers, used comps during the first quarter were at 5%, so about in line with where we were.

And when you see that supply coming back, it's really 2 and 3 years later after you see a high lease percentage. So I'm not sure that we've seen much of it yet, but it's never been a problem for us to source cars. And when cars are at a high lease percentage, when you look out 2 and 3 years later, generally they're more organized at the auctions, so it's a little easier for us actually to buy those cars when we see them come back to the marketplace.

And I've always felt that, over time, we would get our comp sales improvement from a combination of traffic and conversion. So there have been quarters where conversion has outpaced traffic and there have been quarters where traffic has outpaced conversion. In this particular quarter, we said it was divided between the 2 to deliver the 5% comp, but there's volatility in both of those things and I expect it to be volatile going forward. But I think over a long period of time, I expect to get improvements out of both. So I'm not sure that really answers your question, but I can tell you we've had quarters where conversion improvement has been higher than this quarter, but we've had some quarters where we've been flat or behind as well. So it's really you have to look over a much longer period of time, I don't think one quarter is a good proxy for the long term, although in this quarter we got a little from both."

You can clearly see impacts from movements in credit that impact conversion as well. We have extensive training programs going on in our stores in all areas of the company, which I think helped conversion, of course.

It was up 18%. A good portion of the difference between those 2 is we actually have ad production during the quarter and we did not have ad production during the quarter last year, and that's a big chunk of it. Another big chunk of it as was we outsourced our media buying so some of those dollars have just moved from 1 bucket to the other when we used to have that not in SG&A but in corporate overhead. So there's really not much to read into in terms of this quarter. In terms of the affiliations with sports games, we have gotten bigger, we are adding som big metro markets, but none of that expense would have really shown up in the second quarter because they're only starting now. We have a big launch in Denver. As you know, we have 2 stores that we had prior to this year. We added 2 more, we have a fifth store in Colorado Springs. That's a big market for us. In terms of New England and the Boston market, we have 2 stores in the Hartford market, we have 2 stores in the Providence, Rhode Island market. In December of this year, we'll launch Boston officially and we'll have 3 stores, 1 in Danvers, 1 in Norwood and 1 in West Borough. We're continuing to look at sites. We own a site in Portland, Maine, we're looking at Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire. So when we think about New England as a broad market, we have a huge investment coming there over the next several years. And as you know, Matt, Boston's a little bit of a sports town, and you really have to try and connect with your customer base. And I think that affiliating yourself with at least one of the sports teams is something you need to do. And then we also just announced a partnership with University of Minnesota as we open up the Minneapolis market, where we opened up our second store there. So we've done some sports marketing in the past. I think this got a little bit more press, because it was a little bit more bigger, but as a company, we got a lot bigger too."

It's a big market and what we're trying to do is make sure our customers can do as much of the transaction as they want to do from home, and we definitely seen this sentiment shift where customers are looking to do more and more research, more and more pieces of the transaction from home and in some cases, the entire transaction from home. Our current capabilities are our customer can obviously do all kinds of inventory searches. We have 50,000 cars online. I think that's a huge competitive advantage for us is the selection of inventory and the ability to transfer our cars at the customer's request. As you know, Aram, that's about 1/3 of our total sales. We also give this I think the ability to put a car on hold, we give the customer a ability to transfer a car. If it's a paid transfer, they can do it with a credit card without speaking to anybody and have that car transferred to the store of their choice. They can fill out a big chunk of the paperwork from home. We have tested online credit applications, and we are continuing to enhance our capabilities there. We've seen some startups and some smaller competitors that are doing kind of beginning to end transactions online, I don't think anybody's in a better position than we are to be able to do those things and those are some of the things that we'll continue to work on and continue to evaluate as our business grows. But I think we have a bunch of significant competitive advantage. The one I mentioned which I think is the most significant is the selection of inventory that we have and the ability to transfer it. As a company last year, we moved 2 million cars. We sold 600,000 but cars moving from store to store and moving from auction to store, we moved over 2 million cars. We have a very extensive network and ability to move cars very quickly at the customer's request. But I think we need to keep working on our app. We need to keep working on our capabilities and we need to make sure we stay out in front of the consumer and give them the capability to what they want to do from home."

I don't remember exactly because remember the supply comes back 2, 3 years after the lease rate is at wherever it is. Right now, it's pretty high. I think it's in the high 20s as a percent of new car sales. I've always said before, cars tend to come back, whether they are leased or sold, not totally predictable, but at somewhat predictable rate as the years roll forward. Lease -- when it's a very high lease percentage, it's kind of more predictable. So if there's a bunch of leases going out now, if it's almost 30% of new car sales, 2 years out, 3 years out, we're going to see a lot of leases coming back. They tend to be a lot more organized at the auction, maybe even a little bit easier for us to have access to. In terms of our capabilities, we're much more organized today than we were 10 years ago. We're much more analytical about the way we approach car buying at the auction, and I think we're in a better position today to optimize the inventory that we acquire at the auction because of all of the analytics that we put into it and all the digital capabilities that we've given our buyers. Our buyers are now all using tablets at the auctions. We're tracking every single car that a buyer at CarMax looks at in the auction and deciding whether or not that car's worthy and the next time a buyer goes to the auction, they don't have to look at that same car and we're saving an enormous amount of time in evaluating cars at the auction. We have all the auctions on a program where the CarMax buyers are buying under one kind of generic car and we can analytically decide where those cars go later. If you back up 10 or 15 years, we used to buy on a store by store basis. So I'm really pleased with the progress we've made and our ability to analyze and purchase inventory, and then I think I really do think that leasing provides a more organized way because you'll see a lot of the big leasing companies will run hundreds and hundreds of cars a week on a very regular basis at the auction, and it's pretty predictable and we have the ability to look at inventory in advance and decide which ones we are or not going to bid on."

We are very focused on making operational improvements in our existing stores and growing store base as well. And we don't want to do one at the expense of the other. Some of the markets that we're opening and some of the stores that we're opening in the next couple of years are very big and very complicated. When you think about us opening a big production store in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, all markets which we have construction coming in the next few years, they're not just a store that opens themselves a few hundred cars a month. They're also reconditioned in some cases, 2,000 cars a month and then run an 800 or 1,000 car a week auction. So we're starting up really a business within a business when you think about the auctions and then building a giant reconditioning center, in some cases, attached. So it really 1 store for us in some cases is very, very complicated. And if you look at, as I said, our opening plan over the next several years, we're going through some pretty big metro markets, building some pretty big complicated stores, and what we don't want to do is accelerate the growth base and say, oh, we opened 2 more extra stores this year, but the ones that we did open, we didn't open as well and we lost the ability to improve execution. So I don't know exactly what the right number is, but I can tell you that at this pace of about a store a month, I feel like it's a pretty aggressive store base, and I'm really comfortable that we're growing the business effectively and at the same time, not losing track of maybe the most important thing which is improving existing store execution."

We are constantly testing both up and down in different pockets of the business to make sure we're optimizing what we have available for the business, and we're going to manage to spread whatever the market will allow us. So hopefully I try to answer, but I think the answer is both. If the market -- if rates go up and we're not able to raise APRs, we'll continue to see some compression. If the market allows us to keep that spread there, we'll do that, but we'll absolutely going to be a competitive lender and be providing excellent opportunities for our customers from a financial perspective."

And we also believe that could use a little leverage to our capital structure. We talked about getting back to levels that are closer to where we ran pre-recession than where we are today. We made some progress, we bought back about $1.8 billion since the start of the program or about 15% of the shares are outstanding as of October of 2012. But we still think -- we've made a little bit a progress on the cash balance this past quarter, gone about $250 million. But to get back to the levels we're considering, we would need significantly more debt than we have today. So I think we'd expect to continue on with the program as it is. As far as how aggressive we get, we said at the program with some bumpers in place that essentially govern our buy volume based on stock price and valuation allowance to be a little more aggressive as price and valuation drop and vice versa, as price and valuation are up, we review that on an ongoing basis and we'll adjust it as appropriate. As you saw this quarter, stock price was down. We were a bit up on our volume. Last quarter was the opposite. So you could see -- we do take a bit of a view on what -- how much volume to buy given prices, but remember it's going to be a programmatic approach over time."

Some things to remember is we're in a different -- we are exclusively used cars. We operate almost no new car franchises and actually 2 last as of this quarter, we're down to just 2 Toyota stores, 1 in Baltimore, 1 in Kenosha. And all of -- any repairs that are under warranty which include recalls for us have to be taken to a dealer and done at that location. If there were laws as we have always complied with all the laws. If there was a law passed that required us to fix rate costs, we would absolutely do that. But then everybody would be in the exact same boat, and all others who sell used cars would have to get those repaired at manufacturer's locations. I think the most important thing is to make sure that customers are fully informed of whether or not there's an open recall on the car and also how important it is to register on a manufacturer's website. We may sell them a car and  a week later, a recall may come out. If they haven't registered with the manufacturer, then they won't ever know about that. Every customer that buys a car at CarMax is made aware in several different points of the transaction about recalls. We have a direct link on our website to the database. It is -- automatically populates the [indiscernible] for the customer so they can see exactly what's going on with that individual car, and then at the point of sale our sales consultants are working through with the customer exactly what I just said, whether or not the car has an open recall, and the importance of registering with the manufacturing on their website so they can be notified of the recalls going forward. So we're absolutely committed to transparency. And if there's any changes in the law, obviously, we'll comply with all those laws.

As for our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4 year old vehicles increased by 5% to 79% of our total sales, and SUVs and trucks were down slightly from 24% to 22% compared to last year's second quarter. For SG&A, excluding the $21 million reduction in the last second quarter's SG&A, due to the receipt of legal settlement proceeds, SG&A for this second quarter increased approximately 4% to $331 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 16 stores since the beginning of second quarter last year, partially offset by a decrease of $10.5 million in share-based compensation expense. On a per-unit basis, excluding the settlement gain, SG&A decreased $100 to $2,083. The stock-based compensation expense decrease accounted for 78 of that leverage.

In December of this year, we'll launch Boston officially, and we'll have 3 stores: 1 in Danvers, 1 in Norwood, and 1 in West Borough. We're continuing to look at sites. We own a site in Portland, Maine. We're looking in Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire. So when we think about New England as a broad market, we have a huge investment coming there over the next several years. And as you know, Matt, Boston's a little bit of a sports town, and you really have to try and connect with your customer base. And I think that affiliating yourself with at least one of the sports teams is something you need to do. And then we also just announced a partnership with University of Minnesota, as we're opening up the Minneapolis market, where we opened up our second store there. So we've done some sports marketing in the past. I think this got a little bit more press because it was a little bit more bigger, but as a company, we've gotten a lot bigger too."

It's a big market, and what we're trying to do is make sure our customers can do as much of the transaction as they want to do from home, and we've definitely seen the sentiment shift, where customers are looking to do more and more research, more and more pieces of the transaction from home, and in some cases, the entire transaction from home. Our current capabilities are our customer can, obviously, do all kinds of inventory searches. We have 50,000 cars online. I think that's the huge competitive advantage for us is the selection of inventory and the ability to transfer cars at the customer's request. And as you know, Aram, that's about 1/3 of our total sales. We also give the customer the ability to put a car on hold. We give the customer the ability to transfer a car. If it's a paid transfer, they can do it with a credit card without speaking to anybody, and have that car transferred to the store of their choice. They can fill out a big chunk of the paperwork from home. We have tested online credit applications, and we are continuing to enhance our capabilities there. We've seen some startups and some smaller competitors that are doing kind of beginning to end transactions online. I don't think anybody's in a better position than we are to be able to do those things, and those are some of the things that we'll continue to work on and continue to evaluate as our business grows. But I think we have a bunch of significant competitive advantage. The one I mentioned, which I think is the most significant, is the selection of inventory that we have and the ability to transfer it. As a company last year, we moved 2 million cars. We sold 600,000, but cars moving from store to store, moving from auction to store, we moved over 2 million cars. We have a very extensive network of -- and ability to move cars very quickly at the customer's request, but I think we need to keep working on our app. We need to keep working on our capabilities, and we need to make sure we stay out in front of the consumer, and give them the capability to do what they want to do from home."

I don't remember exactly because remember that the supply comes back 2, 3 years after the lease rate is at whatever it is. Right now, it's pretty high. I think it's in the high-20s as a percent of new car sales. I've always said before, cars tend to come back, whether they are leased or sold, not totally predictable, but at a somewhat predictable rate, as the years roll forward. Lease -- when it's a very high lease percentage, it's kind of more predictable. So if there's a bunch of leases going out now, if it's almost 30% of new car sales, 2 years out, 3 years out, we're going to see a lot of leases coming back. They tend to be a lot more organized at the auction, maybe even a little bit easier for us to have access to. In terms of our capabilities, we are much more organized today than we were 10 years ago. We're much more analytical about the way we approach car buying at the auction, and I think we're in a better position today to optimize the inventory that we acquire at the auction because of all the analytics that we've put into it, and all the digital capabilities that we've given our buyers. Our buyers are now all using tablets at the auctions. We're tracking every single car that a buyer at CarMax looks at, at the auction, and deciding whether or not that car's worthy. And then the next time a buyer goes to the auction, they don't have to look at that same car and we're saving enormous amount of time in evaluating cars at the auction. We have all the auctions on a program where the CarMax buyers are buying under one kind of generic card, and we can analytically decide where those cars go later. If you back up 10 or 15 years, we used to buy on a store-by-store basis. So I'm really pleased with the progress we've made and our ability to analyze and purchase inventory, and then I think -- I really do think that leasing provides a more organized way because you'll see a lot of the big leasing companies will run hundreds and hundreds of cars a week on a very regular basis at the auction, and it's pretty predictable, and we have the ability to look at that inventory in advance, and decide which ones we are or are not going to bid on."

We are very focused on making operational improvements in our existing stores and growing store base as well, and we don't want to do one at the expense of the other. Some of these markets that we're opening and some of the stores that we're opening in the next couple of years are very big and very complicated. When you think about us opening a big production store in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, all markets, which we have construction coming in the next few years, they're not just a store that opens themselves a few hundred cars a month. We also reconditioned in some cases, 2,000 cars a month and then run an 800 or 1,000 car a week auction. So we're starting up really a business within a business when you think about the auctions, and then building a giant reconditioning center, in some cases, attached. So it -- really, one store for us in some cases is very, very complicated. And if you look at, as I said, our opening plan over the next several years, we're going into some pretty big metro markets, building some pretty big complicated stores, and what we don't want to do is accelerate the growth base, and say, ""Oh, we opened 2 more extra stores this year, but the ones that we did open, we didn't open as well and we lost the ability to improve execution."" So I don't know exactly what the right number is, but I can tell you that at this pace of about a store a month, I feel like it's a pretty aggressive growth pace, and I'm really comfortable that we're growing the business effectively, and at the same time, not losing track of maybe the most important thing, which is improving existing store execution."

So hopefully, I tried to answer, but I think -- but the answer is -- if the market -- if rates go up and we're not able to raise APRs, we'll continue to see some compression. If the market allows us to keep that spread there, we'll do that, but we're absolutely going to be a competitive lender and be providing excellent opportunities for our customers from a financing perspective."

We talked about getting back to levels that are closer to where we ran pre-recession than where we are today. We made some progress. We bought back about $1.8 billion since the start of the program or about 15% of the shares are outstanding as of October of 2012, but we still think -- as you've seen, we've made a little bit a progress on the cash balance this past quarter, gone down about $250 million. But to get back to the levels we're considering, we would need significantly more debt than we have today. So I think we'd expect to continue on with the program as is. As far as how aggressive we get, we've stepped up the program with some -- bumpers in place that essentially govern our buy volume based on stock price and valuation, allow us to be a little more aggressive as price and valuation drop and vice versa. As price and valuation are up, we review that on an ongoing basis and we'll adjust it as appropriate. As you saw this quarter, stock price was down. We were a bit up on our volume. Last quarter was the opposite. So you can see -- we do take a bit of a view on what -- how much volume to buy given prices, but remember, it's going to be a programmatic approach over time."

It's something that we're always trying to do what's the most transparent thing that we can do for our customers. Some things to remember is we're in a different -- we are almost exclusively used cars. We operate almost no new car franchises, and actually, 2 last as of this quarter. We're down to just 2 Toyota stores, 1 in Baltimore, 1 in Kenosha, and all of -- any repairs that are under warranty, which include recalls, for us have to be taken to a dealer and done at that location. If there were laws, as we have always complied with all the laws, if there was a law passed that required us to fix recalls, we would absolutely do that. But then everybody would be in the exact same boat, and all others who sell used cars would have to get those repaired at manufacturer's locations. We think the most important thing is to make sure that customers are fully informed of whether or not there's an open recall on the car and also of how important it is to register on a manufacturer's website. We may sell them a car and a week later, a recall may come out, and if they haven't registered with the manufacturer, then they won't ever know about that. Every customer that buys a car at CarMax is made aware in several different points of the transaction about recalls. We have a direct link on our website to the database. It is -- automatically populates the vend for the customer, so they can see exactly what's going on with that individual car. And then at the point of sale, our sales consultants are walking through with the customer exactly what I just said, whether or not the car has an open recall, and the importance of registering with the manufacturer on their website, so they can be notified of recalls going forward. So we're absolutely committed to transparency. And if there's any changes in the law, obviously, we'll comply with all those laws.

As for our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4 year old vehicles increased by 5% to 79% of our total sales, and SUVs and trucks were down slightly from 24% to 22% compared to last year's second quarter. For SG&A, excluding the $21 million reduction in the last second quarter's SG&A, due to the receipt of legal settlement proceeds, SG&A for this second quarter increased approximately 4% to $331 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 16 stores since the beginning of second quarter last year, partially offset by a decrease of $10.5 million in share-based compensation expense. On a per-unit basis, excluding the settlement gain, SG&A decreased $100 to $2,083. The stock-based compensation expense decrease accounted for 78 of that leverage. 
During the second quarter, we opened 4 stores, 3 in existing markets, 1 in Providence and 2 in Denver and a small format store in Tallahassee, which is a new market for CarMax.

So there's really not much to read into in terms of this quarter. In terms of the affiliations with sports games, we have gotten bigger. We are entering some big metro markets, but none of that expense would have really shown up in the second quarter because they're only starting now. We have a big launch in Denver. As you know, we have 2 stores that we had prior to this year. We added 2 more. We have a fifth store in Colorado Springs. That's a big market for us.

It's a big market, and what we're trying to do is make sure our customers can do as much of the transaction as they want to do from home, and we've definitely seen the sentiment shift, where customers are looking to do more and more research, more and more pieces of the transaction from home, and in some cases, the entire transaction from home. Our current capabilities are our customer can, obviously, do all kinds of inventory searches. We have 50,000 cars online. I think that's the huge competitive advantage for us is the selection of inventory and the ability to transfer cars at the customer's request. And as you know, Aram, that's about 1/3 of our total sales. We also give the customer the ability to put a car on hold. We give the customer the ability to transfer a car. If it's a paid transfer, they can do it with a credit card without speaking to anybody, and have that car transferred to the store of their choice. They can fill out a big chunk of the paperwork from home. We have tested online credit applications, and we are continuing to enhance our capabilities there. We've seen some startups and some smaller competitors that are doing kind of beginning to end transactions online. I don't think anybody's in a better position than we are to be able to do those things, and those are some of the things that we'll continue to work on and continue to evaluate as our business grows. But I think we have a bunch of significant competitive advantage. The one I mentioned, which I think is the most significant, is the selection of inventory that we have and the ability to transfer it. As a company last year, we moved 2 million cars. We sold 600,000, but cars moving from store to store, moving from auction to store, we moved over 2 million cars. We have a very extensive network of -- and ability to move cars very quickly at the customer's request, but I think we need to keep working on our app. We need to keep working on our capabilities, and we need to make sure we stay out in front of the consumer, and give them the capability to do what they want to do from home."

I don't remember exactly because remember that the supply comes back 2, 3 years after the lease rate is at whatever it is. Right now, it's pretty high. I think it's in the high-20s as a percent of new car sales. I've always said before, cars tend to come back, whether they are leased or sold, not totally predictable, but at a somewhat predictable rate, as the years roll forward. Lease -- when it's a very high lease percentage, it's kind of more predictable. So if there's a bunch of leases going out now, if it's almost 30% of new car sales, 2 years out, 3 years out, we're going to see a lot of leases coming back. They tend to be a lot more organized at the auction, maybe even a little bit easier for us to have access to. In terms of our capabilities, we are much more organized today than we were 10 years ago. We're much more analytical about the way we approach car buying at the auction, and I think we're in a better position today to optimize the inventory that we acquire at the auction because of all the analytics that we've put into it, and all the digital capabilities that we've given our buyers. Our buyers are now all using tablets at the auctions. We're tracking every single car that a buyer at CarMax looks at, at the auction, and deciding whether or not that car's worthy. And then the next time a buyer goes to the auction, they don't have to look at that same car and we're saving enormous amount of time in evaluating cars at the auction. We have all the auctions on a program where the CarMax buyers are buying under one kind of generic card, and we can analytically decide where those cars go later. If you back up 10 or 15 years, we used to buy on a store-by-store basis. So I'm really pleased with the progress we've made and our ability to analyze and purchase inventory, and then I think -- I really do think that leasing provides a more organized way because you'll see a lot of the big leasing companies will run hundreds and hundreds of cars a week on a very regular basis at the auction, and it's pretty predictable, and we have the ability to look at that inventory in advance, and decide which ones we are or are not going to bid on."

We are very focused on making operational improvements in our existing stores and growing store base as well, and we don't want to do one at the expense of the other. Some of these markets that we're opening and some of the stores that we're opening in the next couple of years are very big and very complicated. When you think about us opening a big production store in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, all markets, which we have construction coming in the next few years, they're not just a store that opens themselves a few hundred cars a month. We also reconditioned in some cases, 2,000 cars a month and then run an 800 or 1,000 car a week auction. So we're starting up really a business within a business when you think about the auctions, and then building a giant reconditioning center, in some cases, attached. So it -- really, one store for us in some cases is very, very complicated. And if you look at, as I said, our opening plan over the next several years, we're going into some pretty big metro markets, building some pretty big complicated stores, and what we don't want to do is accelerate the growth base, and say, ""Oh, we opened 2 more extra stores this year, but the ones that we did open, we didn't open as well and we lost the ability to improve execution."" So I don't know exactly what the right number is, but I can tell you that at this pace of about a store a month, I feel like it's a pretty aggressive growth pace, and I'm really comfortable that we're growing the business effectively, and at the same time, not losing track of maybe the most important thing, which is improving existing store execution."

It's going to be a byproduct of where we -- what customers are demanding what the market is for auto loans and what cost of financing does.

We are constantly testing both up and down in different pockets of the business to make sure we're optimizing what we have available for the customers, and we're going to manage the spread to whatever the market will allow us. So hopefully, I tried to answer, but I think -- but the answer is -- if the market -- if rates go up and we're not able to raise APRs, we'll continue to see some compression. If the market allows us to keep that spread there, we'll do that, but we're absolutely going to be a competitive lender and be providing excellent opportunities for our customers from a financing perspective."

We talked about getting back to levels that are closer to where we ran pre-recession than where we are today. We made some progress. We bought back about $1.8 billion since the start of the program or about 15% of the shares are outstanding as of October of 2012, but we still think -- as you've seen, we've made a little bit a progress on the cash balance this past quarter, gone down about $250 million. But to get back to the levels we're considering, we would need significantly more debt than we have today. So I think we'd expect to continue on with the program as is. As far as how aggressive we get, we've stepped up the program with some -- bumpers in place that essentially govern our buy volume based on stock price and valuation, allow us to be a little more aggressive as price and valuation drop and vice versa. As price and valuation are up, we review that on an ongoing basis and we'll adjust it as appropriate. As you saw this quarter, stock price was down. We were a bit up on our volume. Last quarter was the opposite. So you can see -- we do take a bit of a view on what -- how much volume to buy given prices, but remember, it's going to be a programmatic approach over time."

It's something that we're always trying to do what's the most transparent thing that we can do for our customers. Some things to remember is we're in a different -- we are almost exclusively used cars. We operate almost no new car franchises, and actually, 2 last as of this quarter. We're down to just 2 Toyota stores, 1 in Baltimore, 1 in Kenosha, and all of -- any repairs that are under warranty, which include recalls, for us have to be taken to a dealer and done at that location. If there were laws, as we have always complied with all the laws, if there was a law passed that required us to fix recalls, we would absolutely do that. But then everybody would be in the exact same boat, and all others who sell used cars would have to get those repaired at manufacturer's locations. We think the most important thing is to make sure that customers are fully informed of whether or not there's an open recall on the car and also of how important it is to register on a manufacturer's website. We may sell them a car and a week later, a recall may come out, and if they haven't registered with the manufacturer, then they won't ever know about that. Every customer that buys a car at CarMax is made aware in several different points of the transaction about recalls. We have a direct link on our website to the database. It is -- automatically populates the vend for the customer, so they can see exactly what's going on with that individual car. And then at the point of sale, our sales consultants are walking through with the customer exactly what I just said, whether or not the car has an open recall, and the importance of registering with the manufacturer on their website, so they can be notified of recalls going forward. So we're absolutely committed to transparency. And if there's any changes in the law, obviously, we'll comply with all those laws.

Gross profit per unit was flat at $2,166 compared to $2,173 in the second quarter of last year. Total wholesale units grew by 8.7%, partially driven by 1 more auction date in the quarter compared to last year. Without the additional day of auctions, wholesale units would have grown about 5%.

As for our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4 year old vehicles increased by 5% to 79% of our total sales, and SUVs and trucks were down slightly from 24% to 22% compared to last year's second quarter. For SG&A, excluding the $21 million reduction in the last second quarter's SG&A, due to the receipt of legal settlement proceeds, SG&A for this second quarter increased approximately 4% to $331 million. Contributing to this growth was the addition of 16 stores since the beginning of second quarter last year, partially offset by a decrease of $10.5 million in share-based compensation expense. On a per-unit basis, excluding the settlement gain, SG&A decreased $100 to $2,083. The stock-based compensation expense decrease accounted for 78 of that leverage. 
During the second quarter, we opened 4 stores, 3 in existing markets, 1 in Providence and 2 in Denver and a small format store in Tallahassee, which is a new market for CarMax. After the second quarter ended, we opened 2 more stores, our sixth store in the Houston market and our second store in Minneapolis.

So there's really not much to read into in terms of this quarter. In terms of the affiliations with sports teams, we have gotten bigger. We are entering some big metro markets, but none of that expense would have really shown up in the second quarter because they're only starting now. We have a big launch in Denver. As you know, we have 2 stores that we had prior to this year. We added 2 more. We have a fifth store in Colorado Springs. That's a big market for us. In terms of New England and the Boston market, we have 2 stores in the Hartford market. We have 2 stores in the Providence, Rhode Island market.

We own a site in Portland, Maine. We're looking in Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire. So when we think about New England as a broad market, we have a huge investment coming there over the next several years. And as you know, Matt, Boston's a little bit of a sports town, and you really have to try and connect with your customer base. And I think that affiliating yourself with at least one of the sports teams is something you need to do. And then we also just announced a partnership with University of Minnesota, as we're opening up the Minneapolis market, where we opened up our second store there. So we've done some sports marketing in the past. I think this got a little bit more press because it was a little bit more bigger, but as a company, we've gotten a lot bigger too."

The one I mentioned, which I think is the most significant, is the selection of inventory that we have and the ability to transfer it. As a company last year, we moved 2 million cars. We sold 600,000, but cars moving from store to store, moving from auction to store, we moved over 2 million cars. We have a very extensive network of -- and ability to move cars very quickly at the customer's request. But I think we need to keep working on our app, we need to keep working on our capabilities, and we need to make sure we stay out in front of the consumer, and give them the capability to do what they want to do from home."

I don't remember exactly because remember that the supply comes back 2, 3 years after the lease rate is at whatever it is. Right now, it's pretty high. I think it's in the high-20s as a percent of new car sales. I've always said before, cars tend to come back, whether they are leased or sold, not totally predictable, but at a somewhat predictable rate, as the years roll forward. Lease -- when it's a very high lease percentage, it's kind of more predictable. So if there's a bunch of leases going out now, if it's almost 30% of new car sales, 2 years out, 3 years out, we're going to see a lot of leases coming back. They tend to be a lot more organized at the auction, maybe even a little bit easier for us to have access to. In terms of our capabilities, we're much more organized today than we were 10 years ago. We're much more analytical about the way we approach car buying at the auction, and I think we're in a better position today to optimize the inventory that we acquire at the auction because of all the analytics that we've put into it, and all the digital capabilities that we've given our buyers. Our buyers are now all using tablets at the auctions. We're tracking every single car that a buyer at CarMax looks at, at the auction, and deciding whether or not that car's worthy. And then the next time a buyer goes to the auction, they don't have to look at that same car and we're saving enormous amount of time in evaluating cars at the auction. We have all the auctions on a program where the CarMax buyers are buying under one kind of generic card, and we can analytically decide where those cars go later. If you back up 10 or 15 years, we used to buy on a store-by-store basis. So I'm really pleased with the progress we've made and our ability to analyze and purchase inventory, and then I think -- I really do think that leasing provides a more organized way because you'll see a lot of the big leasing companies will run hundreds and hundreds of cars a week on a very regular basis at the auction, and it's pretty predictable, and we have the ability to look at that inventory in advance, and decide which ones we are or are not going to bid on."

We are very focused on making operational improvements in our existing stores and growing store base as well, and we don't want to do one at the expense of the other. Some of these markets that we're opening and some of the stores that we're opening in the next couple of years are very big and very complicated. When you think about us opening a big production store in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, all markets, which we have construction coming in the next few years, they're not just a store that opens themselves a few hundred cars a month. They also recondition, in some cases, 2,000 cars a month and then run an 800 or 1,000 car a week auction. So we're starting up really a business within a business when you think about the auctions, and then building a giant reconditioning center, in some cases, attached. So it -- really, 1 store for us in some cases is very, very complicated. And if you look at, as I said, our opening plan over the next several years, we're going into some pretty big metro markets, building some pretty big complicated stores, and what we don't want to do is accelerate the growth base, and say, ""Oh, we opened 2 more extra stores this year, but the ones that we did open, we didn't open as well and we lost the ability to improve execution."" So I don't know exactly what the right number is, but I can tell you that at this pace of about a store a month, I feel like it's a pretty aggressive growth pace, and I'm really comfortable that we're growing the business effectively, and at the same time, not losing track of maybe the most important thing, which is improving existing store execution."

It's going to be a byproduct of where we -- what customers are demanding what the market is for auto loans and what cost of financing does. We saw our cost on the last deal tick up about 20 basis points, which we see, in any given period, it's not a big deal, but they actually were up relative to the last 3 deals. We are constantly testing both up and down in different pockets of the business to make sure we're optimizing what we have available for the customers, and we're going to manage the spread to whatever the market will allow us. So hopefully, I tried to answer, but I think -- but the answer is both. If the market -- if rates go up and we're not able to raise APRs, we continue to see some compression. If the market allows us to keep that spread there, we'll do that, but we're absolutely going to be a competitive lender and be providing excellent opportunities for our customers from a financing perspective."

We talked about getting back to levels that are closer to where we ran pre-recession than where we are today. We made some progress. We bought back about $1.8 billion since the start of the program or about 15% of the shares are outstanding as of October of 2012, but we still think -- as you've seen, we've made a little bit a progress on the cash balance this past quarter, it's gone down about $250 million. But to get back to the levels we're considering, we would need significantly more debt than we have today. So I think we'd expect to continue on with the program as is. As far as how aggressive we get, we've setup the program with some -- with bumpers in place that essentially govern our buy volume based on stock price and valuation, allow us to be a little more aggressive as price and valuation drop and vice versa. As price and valuation are up, we review that on an ongoing basis and we'll adjust it as appropriate. As you saw this quarter, stock price was down. We were a bit up on our volume. Last quarter was the opposite. So you can see -- we do take a bit of a view on what -- how much volume to buy at given prices, but remember, it's going to be a programmatic approach over time."

It's something that we're always trying to do what's the most transparent thing that we can do for our customers. Some things to remember is we're in a different -- we're almost exclusively used cars. We operate almost no new car franchises, and actually, 2 last as of this quarter. We're down to just 2 Toyota stores, 1 in Baltimore, 1 in Kenosha, and all of -- any repairs that are under warranty, which include recalls, for us have to be taken to a dealer and done at that location. If there were laws passed -- we have always complied with all the laws, if there was a law passed that required us to fix recalls, we would absolutely do that. But then everybody would be in the exact same boat, and all others who sell used cars would have to get those repaired at manufacturer's locations. We think the most important thing is to make sure that customers are fully informed of whether or not there's an open recall on the car and also of how important it is to register on a manufacturer's website. We may sell them a car and a week later, a recall may come out, and if they haven't registered with the manufacturer, then they won't ever know about that. Every customer that buys a car at CarMax is made aware in several different points of the transaction about recalls. We have a direct link on our website to the database. It is -- automatically populates the VIN for the customer, so they can see exactly what's going on with that individual car. And then at the point of sale, our sales consultants are walking through with the customer exactly what I just said, whether or not the car has an open recall, and the importance of registering with the manufacturer on their website, so they can be notified of recalls going forward. So we're absolutely committed to transparency. And if there's any changes in the law, obviously, we'll comply with all those laws.
Okay. All right, thanks very much for your interest in CarMax, and thanks to all of our associates for all they do every day, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

You saw, we had a challenging third quarter, due primarily to slightly negative used unit comps. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter.
Used unit comps decreased by 0.8%, while total used units grew by 3.2%. Gross profit per unit of $2,160 was in line with gross profit per unit of $2,172 in the third quarter of last year. And total wholesale units grew 3.4%, about the same rate as total retail units. Gross profit per wholesale unit grew by $22 to $949 per car sold. CAF income also grew 3% to approximately $92 million.

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 3% compared to third quarter fiscal '15, and average managed receivables grew by 15% to $9.3 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.3%, up somewhat from last year's third quarter of 7.0%. Our total interest margin declined to 6.0% of average managed receivables from 6.4% in the third quarter of last year and 6.2% last quarter.
We saw some tick-up in charge-offs during the quarter, which resulted in a modest increase in the loss provision. However, at $91 million, our ending allowance for loan losses was 0.97% of managed receivables, consistent with last year's third quarter at 0.98%.
CAF net penetration was 42.9% compared with 41.8% in last year's third quarter. The increase reflects a mix shift towards higher credit applications in the stores. The percent of CAF penetration attributable to our subprime test was unchanged at about 0.5%. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion due to combination of CarMax unit sales growth and higher penetration.
As you saw on the press release, Tier 3 financing, as a percent of sales is 150 basis points lower than in the third quarter 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the mix shift I mentioned with regard to CAF penetration. In Q3, we experienced a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of credit but moderate growth at the higher end.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for about $446 million. We ended the quarter at the low end of our target range for leverage, which is booked debt to capital after backing up the notes in receivables associated with nonrecourse securitizations of 35% to 45%. Going forward, we expect to continue using share repurchase as a means of managing capital structure and return value to shareholders.

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year old cars increased to approximately 81% compared to 75% in the third quarter of last year and 79% in the second quarter. SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were 23%, down from 25% in last year's third quarter but up slightly from 22% in the second quarter.
Our lower used unit comps were primarily the result of modestly lower traffic in our stores, partially offset by conversion. Total web traffic increased by 7% compared to the same period last year. We believe our cost may have been impacted by several factors of note this quarter. First, we've seen a decrease in the supply of 5- to 10-year-old cars, as you would expect. Second, we've seen very aggressive promotions and lease offerings from new vehicles that appear to be pressuring sales of 0- and 1-year-old cars. Wholesale prices of SUVs and trucks have increased, so some don't represent a good value for our customers. And as Tom mentioned, Tier 3 was down about 150 basis points due to lower credit applications. Now despite these factors, we still sold over 154,000 cars during the quarter, which is the most ever in a third quarter for the company. And our average store during the quarter sold 340 cars.
SG&A for the third quarter increased about 7% to $338 million. Contributing to this growth was the 10% increase in our store base since the beginning of the third quarter last year, partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in share-based compensation expense. In addition, our advertising expense grew by about $9 million year-over-year, reflecting the timing of expenses related to our new ad campaign. During the third quarter, we opened 2 stores in existing markets, our sixth store in Houston and our second store in Minneapolis. We also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg. And after the end of the quarter, we entered the Boston market with the opening of 2 stores in Danvers and Norwood.
And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions."

I think the other big variable that's impossible to predict is first, gas prices; and second, the impact of gas prices. I know you remember back in the spring of '08 when gas hit $4, nobody would buy an SUV of any kind. But in October of that same year, gas was below $2 and things kind of went back to where they were. Since then, when we've seen gas prices increase, we haven't seen the same knee-jerk reaction that we saw. So gas prices have been pretty low for a while, and I think it's provided a boost for trucks and SUVs. But it's really hard to say what will happen on Florida. I just think our model is best equipped to take advantage of whatever the market brings. We're not holding to any manufacturer or any type of product, and we want to sell whatever the customer wants to buy."

You saw, we had a challenging third quarter, due primarily to slightly negative used unit comps. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter.
Used unit comps decreased by 0.8%, while total used units grew by 3.2%. Gross profit per used unit of $2,160 was in line with gross profit per unit of $2,172 in the third quarter of last year. And total wholesale units grew 3.4%, about the same rate as total retail units. Gross profit per wholesale unit grew by $22 to $949 per car sold. CAF income also grew 3% to approximately $92 million.

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 3% compared to third quarter fiscal '15, and average managed receivables grew by 15% to $9.3 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.3%, up somewhat from last year's third quarter of 7.0%. Our total interest margin declined to 6.0% of average managed receivables from 6.4% in the third quarter of last year and 6.2% last quarter.
We saw some tick-up in charge-offs during the quarter, which resulted in a modest increase in the loss provision. However, at $91 million, our ending allowance for loan losses was 0.97% of managed receivables, consistent with last year's third quarter at 0.98%.
CAF net penetration was 42.9% compared with 41.8% in last year's third quarter. The increase reflects a mix shift towards higher credit applications in the stores. The percent of CAF penetration attributable to our subprime test was unchanged at about 0.5%. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion due to combination of CarMax unit sales growth and higher penetration.
As you saw on the press release, Tier 3 financing, as a percent of sales is 150 basis points lower than in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the mix shift I mentioned with regard to CAF penetration. In Q3, we experienced a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of credit, but moderate growth at the higher end.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for about $446 million. We ended the quarter at the low end of our target range for leverage, which is book debt-to-capital after backing up the notes in receivables associated with nonrecourse securitizations of 35% to 45%. Going forward, we expect to continue using share repurchase as a means of managing capital structure and returning value to shareholders.

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old cars increased to approximately 81% compared to 75% in the third quarter of last year and 79% in the second quarter. SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were 23%, down from 25% in last year's third quarter, but up slightly from 22% in the second quarter.
Our lower used unit comps were primarily result of modestly lower traffic in our stores, partially offset by better conversion. Total web traffic increased by 7% compared to the same period last year. We believe our cost may have been impacted by several factors of note this quarter. First, we've seen a decrease in the supply of 5- to 10-year-old cars, as you would expect. Second, we've seen very aggressive promotions and lease offerings from new vehicles that appear to be pressuring sales of 0- and 1-year-old cars. Wholesale prices of SUVs and trucks have increased, so some don't represent a good value for our customers. And as Tom mentioned, Tier 3 was down about 150 basis points due to lower credit applications. Now despite these factors, we still sold over 154,000 cars during the quarter, which is the most ever in a third quarter for the company. And our average store during the quarter sold 340 cars.
SG&A for the third quarter increased about 7% to $338 million. Contributing to this growth was the 10% increase in our store base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year, partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in share-based compensation expense. In addition, our advertising expense grew by about $9 million year-over-year, reflecting the timing of expenses related to our new ad campaign. 
During the third quarter, we opened 2 stores in existing markets, our sixth store in Houston and our second store in Minneapolis. We also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg. And after the end of the quarter, we entered the Boston market with the opening of 2 stores in Danvers and Norwood.
And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions."

So there are times during the quarter and we just didn't think it was worth overpaying at the expense of given a great value to the consumer. I think this is probably short lived. Obviously, it has been driven by low gas prices. We've seen bigger increases in new car sales as it relates to SUVs and trucks compared to the used car market increases.

But we are seeing, the highest SAAR we've ever seen and the bigger of the increase of the SAAR is related to trucks and SUVs, if I was thinking about that over a long period of time, that means a couple of years from now, we'll see a lot of trucks and SUVs out in the wholesale market, which if there's demand, then we'll be able to take advantage of that and buy and sell them. I think the other big variable that's impossible to predict is first, gas prices; and then second the impact of gas prices. I know you remember back in the spring of '08 when gas hit $4, nobody would buy an SUV of any kind. But in October of that same year, gas was below $2 and things kind of went back to where they were. Since then, when we've seen gas prices increase, we haven't seen the same knee-jerk reaction that we saw. So gas prices have been pretty low for a while, and I think it's provided a boost for trucks and SUVs. But it's really hard to say what will happen in Florida. I just think our model is best equipped to take advantage of whatever the market brings. We're not holding to any manufacturer or any type of product, and we want to sell whatever the customer wants to buy."

What I feel even -- what I also feel good about is coming out of the recession, we did a really good job of figuring out or sell older cars as well. And I feel like we can do both. So you look at the CarMax consumer offering at 0- to 10-year-old cars, and I think we're pretty good across the spectrum at near new cars and then older cars with higher miles.

I think the number now is around 30%. It's been this high at times before. Generally, what that means is 2, 3 years down the road, those cars will come back to the market in a kind of a more organized way.

And we've been able to take advantage of that in the past. I really look at a high lease environment as a negative for us when you think about supply 2 or 3 years later. If you think about this cycle of people getting out of a new car, if it remains that people get out of their car every 3 to 5 years, it really doesn't make any difference whether it comes back through the lease channel or it comes back as an individual car, eventually they end up in the open market place, and we have an opportunity to buy them."

Historically, as rates have come up, we've been a little bit [Audio Gap] as the market has slower to adjust upward because rates can be sticky and conversely when rates have been coming down, the usual little slow to adjust downward because the market is going to drive that as well, and you see a little bit of a benefit.

I think now that the Fed has given some guidance I think about where they're going with interest rates that stabilized things from the perspective of spread in the asset-backed market. We saw our spreads gap up in the last year versus prior deals even though we are in a lower interest rate environment. But I think some of that was uncertainty around what Fed was going to do."

And I think the same thing is true here. We've been around a long time, we've seen cycles go up and cycles go down and as I mentioned earlier, who knows what happens with gas prices. You see a big spike in gas prices and there's a good chance our SUV mix would go up during that time because those cars would be cheaper and be a better value to our customers. But I did mention it during the quarter. We saw that there was a lot of pressure on SUV pricing."

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 3% compared to third quarter fiscal '15, and average managed receivables grew by 15% to $9.3 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.3%, up somewhat from last year's third quarter of 7.0%. Our total interest margin declined to 6.0% of average managed receivables from 6.4% in the third quarter of last year and 6.2% last quarter.
We saw some tick-up in charge-offs during the quarter, which resulted in a modest increase in the loss provision. However, at $91 million, our ending allowance for loan losses was 0.97% of managed receivables, consistent with last year's third quarter at 0.98%.
CAF net penetration was 42.9% compared with 41.8% in last year's third quarter. The increase reflects a mix shift towards higher credit applications in the stores. The percent of CAF penetration attributable to our subprime test was unchanged at about 0.5%. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion due to a combination of CarMax unit sales growth and higher penetration.
As you saw in the press release, Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales is 150 basis points lower than in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the mix shift I mentioned with regard to CAF penetration. In Q3, we experienced a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of credit, but moderate growth at the higher end.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for about $446 million. We ended the quarter at the low end of our target range for leverage, which is book debt-to-capital after backing out the notes and receivables associated with nonrecourse securitizations of 35% to 45%. Going forward, we expect to continue using share repurchase as a means of managing capital structure and returning value to shareholders.

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old cars increased to approximately 81% compared to 75% in the third quarter of last year and 79% in the second quarter.

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old cars increased to approximately 81% compared to 75% in the third quarter of last year and 79% in the second quarter. SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were 23%, down from 25% in last year's third quarter, but up slightly from 22% in the second quarter.
Our lower used unit comps were primarily a result of modestly lower traffic in our stores, partially offset by better conversion. Total web traffic increased by 7% compared to the same period last year. We believe our comps may have been impacted by several factors of note this quarter. First, we've seen a decrease in the supply of 5- to 10-year-old cars, as you would expect. Second, we've seen very aggressive promotions and lease offerings for new vehicles that appear to be pressuring sales of 0- and 1-year-old cars. Wholesale prices of SUVs and trucks have increased, so some don't represent a good value for our customers. And as Tom mentioned, Tier 3 was down about 150 basis points due to lower credit applications. Now despite these factors, we still sold over 154,000 cars during the quarter, which is the most ever in a third quarter for the company. And our average store during the quarter sold 340 cars.
SG&A for the third quarter increased about 7% to $338 million. Contributing to this growth was the 10% increase in our store base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year, partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in share-based compensation expense. In addition, our advertising expense grew by about $9 million year-over-year, reflecting the timing of expenses related to our new ad campaign. 
During the third quarter, we opened 2 stores in existing markets, our sixth store in Houston and our second store in Minneapolis. We also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg. And after the end of the quarter, we entered the Boston market with the opening of 2 stores in Danvers and Norwood.
And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions."

So there were times during the quarter when we just didn't think it was worth overpaying at the expense of giving a great value to the consumer. I think this is probably short lived. Obviously, it has been driven by low gas prices. We've seen bigger increases in new car sales as it relates to SUVs and trucks compared to the used car market increases.

I think the other big variable that's impossible to predict is first, gas prices, and then second the impact of gas prices. I know you remember back in the spring of '08 when gas hit $4, nobody would buy an SUV of any kind. But in October of that same year, gas was below $2 and things kind of went back to where they were. Since then, when we've seen gas prices increase, we haven't seen the same knee-jerk reaction that we saw. So gas prices have been pretty low for a while, and I think it's provided a boost for trucks and SUVs. But it's really hard to say what will happen going forward.

And quite frankly, you've lived through a lot of obstacles and a lot of other headwinds over the last 20 years. It doesn't seem like there's anything you can't weather. But it seems like this time might be a little different, particularly among the domestic manufacturers, given the propensity to lease. Is there a higher likelihood that some of this new vehicles that are selling on the SUV and truck side go back to dealers rather than hitting the auction market and that -- could that limit your availability of supply in the coming years?

I think the number now is around 30%. It's been this high at times before. Generally, what that means is 2, 3 years down the road, those cars will come back to the market in a kind of a more organized way. And dealers won't be able to absorb the volume that comes back, and a lot of those cars end up at auction. And that's what's happened historically. And we've been able to take advantage of that in the past. I never look at a high lease environment as a negative for us when you think about supply 2 or 3 years later. If you think about this cycle of people getting out of a new car, if it remains that people get out of their car every 3 to 5 years, it really doesn't make any difference whether it comes back through a lease channel or it comes back as an individual car. Eventually, they end up in the open market place, and we have an opportunity to buy them."

Our first goal of CarMax Auto Finance is to a provide a competitive offer to the customer, and we will go where the market dictates we go. That said, we're constantly testing both up and down to make sure we're optimizing CarMax sales and CAF income at the same time. We have seen a little bit of cost of funds increase this year. We have been testing rates upward a little bit. But I really can't give you any kind of forward-looking theory on where that spread will go because it's going to be market rate based. Historically, as rates have come up, we've been a little bit, as the market has, slower to adjust upward because rates tend to be sticky. And conversely when rates have been coming down, they're usual a little slow to adjust downward because the market is going to drive that as well, and you see a little bit of a benefit. But as far as going forward, the market will tell. I think now that the Fed has given some guidance, I think, about where they're going with interest rates that's stabilized things from the perspective of spread in the asset-backed market. We saw our spreads gap up in the last year versus prior deals even though we are in a lower interest rate environment. But I think some of that was uncertainty around what the Fed was going to do."
