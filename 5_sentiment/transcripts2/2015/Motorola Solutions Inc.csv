Our Q4 was a solid quarter for Motorola Solutions and we continued to see signs of recovery in large parts of our business. As I think about the quarter and beyond, there are a few thoughts I'd like to share. First, we continue to see improvement in our North American business. Q4 marked the return to growth and we're encouraged by indicators such as orders, backlog and device sales as we move into 2015. Second, just last week, we secured a contract valued at over $200 million with the country in the Middle East for a nationwide Smart communications network utilizing our public safety LTE solution. This now gives us the 3 largest Public Safety LTE awards to date with the LA Ric contract implementation underway and $100 million deal in another Middle East country that begins deployment this year. It's encouraging to see investments made over the past several years starting to drive associated revenue. And third, our efforts around simplification and rationalizing our cost structure remain on course. We closed the year with more than $200 million in OpEx savings versus full year of 2013 and ended the year with a run rate that should position us well to achieve approximately $150 million of further reductions this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and our outlook."

Q4 2014 revenue was $1.8 billion, a slight increase over Q4 2013 and a reflection of robust order activity and faster-than-expected conversion of certain orders. These results come despite $27 million of currency headwinds in the quarter. GAAP operating earnings were a loss of $1 billion, which included a one-time charge of $1.9 billion due to our pension derisking transaction. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $483 million or 26.5% of sales, up from the year-ago quarter of 21.8%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $4.02 to compared to a gain of $1.12 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.25 compared to $1.37 in the year-ago quarter, which included a $0.42 benefit from the formation of our international holding company in 2013. 
For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Turning to segment results. In products, Q4 sales were a record $1.25 billion, up 3% versus the prior year's [ph] quarter. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for a P25 and PCR device product lines while TETRA devices robustly on a global basis. Q4 Products segment operating income was $394 million or 32% of sales, up from $283 million or 23% of sales in Q4 of 2013. Significant operating leverage provided by our cost-reduction actions drove higher operating income. 
Moving to product backlog. Product segment backlog is $1.2 billion, which has increased for 3 consecutive quarters. Product backlog is up [ph] $53 million versus last year, and up $16 million sequentially despite strong revenues in Q4. The year-over-year increase in backlog is driven by North America and APME. For the full year, operating income was $754 million, o 19.8% of sales, which is up from last year due to cost reduction realized in 2014. 
Turning to services. Q4 services revenue was $577 million. Excluding iDEN, services revenue declined 2%, while declining 5% overall. Q4 integration services revenue was down as expected versus Q4 2013's record quarter, which accompanied strong systems revenue in 2013. Q4 life cycle support services grew modestly overall, and strong demand for our software maintenance contracts and steady demand for our hardware upgrades. Managed Services grew across all regions as increasing complexity and the need for enhanced capabilities to support software-centric IP-based networks continues to drive demand. Services operating income was $89 million, down $24 million to 15.4% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and lower gross margin associated with systems integration mix. Gross margin life cycle management, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety was relatively flat. While we will continue to see project mix related pressure in the first half of 2015, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-30% range going forward for our overall services business.  
Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $431 million, down $86 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter driven by continued cost-reduction activities. G&A and R&D posted the largest year-over-year declines, and we expect significant savings across all major categories again for 2015. 
Q4 other income and expense was a net expense of $39 million compared to $19 million in the year-ago quarter. The difference was primarily driven by ongoing higher interest expense in Q4 of 2014 and gains and investment sales in the prior year quarter. In Q1, we expect OIE of $45 million versus $19 million in Q1 of 2014, driven primarily by higher interest expense.  Other income and expense is expected to be approximately $180 million for 2015. 
With respect to taxes, our Q4 effective tax rate was 35%. Our Q1 and full year 2015 effective tax rate are expected to be approximately 33%. More importantly, we expect our cash tax rates to be approximately 15% for 2015 and continuing through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow from operations was a net use of $700 million, which include $850 million in funding related to the U.S. pension derisking actions, coupled with funding our U.K. plan. For the year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was a net use of $685 million, driven by pension contributions of $1.3 billion. We ended 2014 with $4 billion in total cash and $3.4 billion in debt. In Q4, we repurchased $1.4 billion of stock. For the full year, we repurchased $2.5 billion in stock. We have reduced our net share comp by 36% since the program's inception in Q3 of 2011. In addition, we paid $82 million in dividends during the quarter and $318 million for the year. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%. In constant currency terms, this translates to growth of 1% to 3% versus the prior year. For the year, we expect growth in North America, growth in Latin America, excluding iDEN, growth in the Middle East. We expect to be flat in Asia-Pacific, inclusive of currency headwinds; contraction in Europe & Africa due to currency headwinds and the Norway implementation completion; and a decline in iDEN of between $25 million to $50 million. We also expect OpEx of approximately -- to be down approximately $150 million year-over-year. Significant improvement and profitability with EBITDA in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.36 billion, EPS of $3.15 to $3.35, and operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion for the full year. In Q1, we expect sales to decline 2% to 4%, reflecting better-than-anticipated order conversion in Q4, along with approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. In constant currency terms, we expect revenue to be down 1% to up 1%. This outlook assumes North America growth for the quarter and a contraction in Europe and Asia driven primarily by currency headwinds. We expect Q1 EPS of $0.22 to $0.27. 
I'll now turn it back to Greg."

I'm generally pleased with our Q4 results and more specifically, the improving trends we're seeing in North America. Q4 revenue was up slightly and marked the quarterly record for the company. Despite stronger-than-anticipated end of the year order conversion and currency headwinds, our backlog positions still continue to grow, and we ended Q4 with a higher total backlog, higher product backlog and higher backlog scheduled to ship in 2015. From a regional perspective, our North America business was up 4% in Q4. North America backlog is up $50 million in products and $586 million in services versus last year, which is a positive sign for this region. The Europe & Africa region declined 5% in Q4, which marked the first decline in 9 quarters. Currency headwinds was the key contributed to this decline and is expected to weigh on our full year results in the region. However, I believe, we have, and we'll continue, to execute well relative to the market in this region, and are well positioned for long-term growth as these factors dissipate. 
Turning to the Asia Pac Middle East region, we saw an 8% sales decline in Q4. This decline was driven by Asia Pac, however, sales are starting to stabilize in this region and backlog is up sequentially as we're seeing some improvements in the customer pipeline. Our Middle East business continues to grow and build momentum in both products and services backlog. By the way, these backlog numbers will continue to improve with the addition of the $200 million countrywide Public Safety LTE contract I referenced earlier. 
And finally, our Latin America business in Q4 increased 3%, excluding iDEN, and 1% overall. Backlog in Latin America is up modestly year-over-year and up significantly from a sequential view driven by services. The wind down of iDEN will continue to negatively impact this region disproportionately in 2015. 
Turning to the segment highlights. First in products. We secured several strategic product awards in Q4, that included $148 million with the state of Michigan's to upgrade their state-wide ASTRO network, including over $30 million in services, $20 million with the state local customer in the Northeast, to upgrade to a fully P25 compatible solution with improved coverage and improved interoperability; $12 million with Eastern Chemical to enable their multistate operations. 
Moving to services. I'm Encouraged by Q4 revenue growth in life cycle support and managed services. I think marketplace trends, such as the prevalence of video and social media use in policing, continue to validate our investments in areas such as Real-Time Crime Centers, video and data analytics and CAD integration. Services backlog is up significantly on new multi-year deals despite the currency headwinds. Q4 brought several notable services wins, including a $64 million extension with Prince George’s County to provide full turnkey services and maintaining their mission-critical systems and Smart Public Safety systems while keeping their networks up-to-date with various life cycle products; a 2-year $36 million managed services extension of the Victorian Mobile Data Network in Australia; $31 million with the Las Vegas Metro PD for long-term software and hardware maintenance of radio and CAD systems as well as technical support and life cycle services; and $15 million with Minico in Latin America for multi-year Managed Services contract to include administration and monitoring of their network as well as the maintenance on other devices and the helpdesk for end-users. 
So let me close by saying this was a challenging, but transformational year for our company. We divested our Enterprise business for just under $3.5 billion; significantly improved our risk profile and cash flow through pension derisking actions; achieved more than $200 million OpEx savings, including over $70 million in R&D reductions while simultaneously shifting more investment towards new growth areas; we restructured the company to increase our focuses on services as a line of business; and reaffirmed our commitment to capital return and a more efficient capital structure with $5 billion of additional repurchase authorizations and $2.9 billion of stock buyback and dividends returned in 2014.  As a result of these actions, we're in a better position. We're in a better position to grow, drive significant operating leverage, deliver strong cash flow and drive shareholder value for years to come. 
I'll now turn it over to Shep."

We did, as you referenced, we expect to continue to see some pressure in installation -- in our installation services, margin based on project mix and the projects that we're expected to deploy, continuing from Q4 into Q1, but we do expect that to stabilize and return to normal gross margin rates of 35% -- or approximately 35%.

So we have just talked about Public Safety LTE being about double in 2015 versus our run rate in '14, we still believe that, that's the case, and we feel even better about that amount with the securing of the third contract I talked about in the Middle East. So we remain pretty resolute and expected that, that will occur. A little bit north of $100 million in 2015. I think the option spectrum development recently are a positive, specifically as it relates to the first net, the $44 billion of proceeds by the federal government allows the fully funding of the $7 billion, that's contemplated in the middle-class jobs really word. So at the end of the day here in the U.S., the 2 most important things to facilitate and enable Public Safety LTE to be rolled out are dedicated spectrum and funding. The spectrum has been dedicated, as you know, with the 700 megahertz slice. That remains dedicated to public safety. And the $7 billion is now fully funded with a very successful close of the AWS auction. The only other thing I'd comment is our focus is on continued engagement globally on Public Safety LTE, and there's still a pipeline of opportunities we'll pursue. But I think this year is quite important for us to implement the deals that we have, to implement L.A. Rex to start implementation on the deal we just secured last week, and to implement in the second half of this year the other Middle Eastern country that we referred to with our $100 million deal. And as we continue to compete and win on these deals, we see no chilling or impact on LMR and continue to see LMR purchases and Public Safety LTE to be additive to those purchases. So I think the auctions are positive."

Again, excluding the currency headwinds, which you asked me to do, the pipeline is also good, which was referenced in the comment of Greg saying, he thinks as these factors dissipates, you'll see Europe & Africa return to grow. We also see Africa is a good growth area for us in the future. Latin America, as you mentioned, has been growing. Minus iDEN, we expect that the trend to continue. IDEN will tighten down the overall numbers. But the core business in Latin America continues to grow. Middle East is actually coming off of really strong growth, and we've made some organizational changes to even put greater focus on the Middle East. We've announced the large Public Safety LTE deal today, but we also see good growth in that region. And then we return to Asia, as we talked about for a while, we've been disappointed with our recovery in Asia. But with that being said, we have built backlog. We actually have recognized some large deals, one of which was mentioned about Australia. We got a good short-term pipeline in addition to our backlog. So we see the Asian region stabilizing and be relatively flat, inclusive of currencies, and there would be growth without the currency headwinds. So all in all, to summarize and to answer your final question, we do see international as a growth area. The region, again, modest to large project and modest currency headwinds.

Our Q4 was a solid quarter for Motorola Solutions, and we continue to see signs of recovery in large parts of our business. As I think about the quarter and beyond, there are a few thoughts I'd like to share. First, we continue to see improvement in our North America business. Q4 marked the return to growth, and we're encouraged by indicators such as orders, backlog and device sales as we move into 2015. 
Second, just last week, we secured a contract valued at over $200 million with a country in the Middle East for a nationwide smart communications network utilizing our Public Safety LTE solution. This now gives us the 3 largest Public Safety LTE awards to date, with the LA-RICS contract implementation underway and $100 million deal in another Middle East country that begins deployment this year. It's encouraging to see investments made over the past several years starting to drive associated revenue. 
And third, our efforts around simplification and rationalizing our cost structure remain on course. We closed the year with more than $200 million in OpEx savings versus full year 2013 and ended the year with a run rate that should position us well to achieve approximately $150 million of further reductions this year.

Turning to segment results. In Products, Q4 sales were a record $1.25 billion, up 3% versus the prior year's quarter. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for a P25 and PCR device product lines, while TETRA devices grew robustly on a global basis. Q4 Products segment operating income was $394 million or 32% of sales, up from $283 million or 23% of sales in Q4 of 2013. Significant operating leverage provided by our cost-reduction actions drove higher operating income. 
Moving to product backlog. Product segment backlog is $1.2 billion, which has increased for 3 consecutive quarters. Product backlog is up $53 million versus last year and up $16 million sequentially despite strong revenues in Q4. The year-over-year increase in backlog is driven by North America and APME. For the full year, operating income was $754 million or 19.8% of sales, which is up from last year due to cost reductions realized in 2014. 
Turning to Services. Q4 Services revenue was $577 million. Excluding iDEN, services revenue declined 2% while declining 5% overall. Q4 integration services revenue was down as expected versus Q4 2013's record quarter, which accompanied strong systems revenue in 2013. Q4 lifecycle support services grew modestly overall, and strong demand for our software maintenance contracts and steady demand for our hardware upgrades. Managed Services grew across all regions as increasing complexity and the need for enhanced capabilities to support software-centric IP-based networks continues to drive demand. Services operating income was $89 million, down $24 million to 15.4% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and lower gross margin associated with systems integration mix. Gross margin in lifecycle management, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety was relatively flat. While we will continue to see project mix-related pressure in the first half of 2015, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-30% range going forward for our overall Services business. 
Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $431 million, down $86 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter, driven by continued cost-reduction activities. G&A and R&D posted the largest year-over-year declines, and we expect significant savings across all major categories again for 2015. 
Q4 other income and expense was a net expense of $39 million compared to $19 million in the year-ago quarter. The difference was primarily driven by ongoing higher interest expense in Q4 of 2014 and gains on investment sales in the prior year quarter. In Q1, we expect OIE of $45 million versus $19 million in Q1 of 2014, driven primarily by higher interest expense. 
Other income and expense is expected to be approximately $180 million for 2015. 
With respect to taxes, our Q4 effective tax rate was 35%. Our Q1 and full year 2015 effective tax rate are expected to be approximately 33%. More importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to be approximately 15% for 2015 and continuing through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow from operations was a net use of $700 million, which includes $850 million in funding related to the U.S. pension derisking actions, coupled with funding our U.K. plan. For the year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was a net use of $685 million, driven by pension contributions of $1.3 billion. We ended 2014 with $4 billion in total cash and $3.4 billion in debt. 
In Q4, we repurchased $1.4 billion of stock. For the full year, we repurchased $2.5 billion in stock. We have reduced our net share comp by 36% since the program's inception in Q3 of 2011. In addition, we paid $82 million in dividends during the quarter and $318 million for the year. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%. In constant currency terms, this translates to growth of 1% to 3% versus the prior year. For the year, we expect growth in North America; growth in Latin America, excluding iDEN; growth in the Middle East. We expect to be flat in Asia Pacific, inclusive of currency headwinds; contraction in Europe & Africa due to currency headwinds and the Norway implementation completion; and a decline in iDEN of between $25 million to $50 million. We also expect OpEx to be approximately -- to be down approximately $150 million year-over-year; significant improvement in profitability, with EBITDA in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.36 billion, EPS of $3.15 to $3.35 and operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion for the full year. In Q1, we expect sales to decline 2% to 4%, reflecting better-than-anticipated order conversion in Q4, along with approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. In constant currency terms, we expect revenue to be down 1% to up 1%. This outlook assumes North America growth for the quarter and a contraction in Europe and Asia, driven primarily by currency headwinds. We expect Q1 EPS of $0.22 to $0.27. 
I'll now turn it back to Greg."

I'm generally pleased with our Q4 results and more specifically, the improving trends we're seeing in North America. Q4 revenue was up slightly and marked the quarterly record for the company. Despite stronger-than-anticipated end of the year order conversion and currency headwinds, our backlog positions still continue to grow, and we ended Q4 with a higher total backlog, higher product backlog and higher backlog scheduled to ship in 2015. 
From a regional perspective, our North America business was up 4% in Q4. North America backlog is up $50 million in Products and $586 million in Services versus last year, which is a positive sign for this region. The Europe & Africa region declined 5% in Q4, which marked the first decline in 9 quarters. Currency headwinds was the key contributor to this decline and is expected to weigh on our full year results in the region. However, I believe, we have and will continue to execute well relative to the market in this region and are well positioned for long-term growth as these factors dissipate. 
Turning to the Asia Pac Middle East region. We saw an 8% sales decline in Q4. This decline was driven by Asia Pac. However, sales are starting to stabilize in this region, and backlog is up sequentially as we're seeing some improvements in the customer pipeline. Our Middle East business continues to grow and build momentum in both product and services backlog. By the way, these backlog numbers will continue to improve with the addition of the $200 million countrywide Public Safety LTE contract I referenced earlier. 
And finally, our Latin America business in Q4 increased 3%, excluding iDEN, and 1% overall. Backlog in Latin America is up modestly year-over-year and up significantly from a sequential view, driven by services. The wind down of iDEN will continue to negatively impact this region disproportionately in 2015. 
Turning to the segment highlights. First in Products. We secured several strategic product awards in Q4 that include $148 million with the state of Michigan to upgrade their state-wide ASTRO network, including over $30 million in Services; $20 million with the state and local customer in the Northeast to upgrade to a fully P25-compatible solution with improved coverage and improved interoperability; $12 million with Eastman Chemical to enable their multistate operations. 
Moving to Services. I'm encouraged by Q4 revenue growth in lifecycle support and Managed Services. I think marketplace trends, such as the prevalence of video and social media used in policing, continue to validate our investments in areas such as Real-Time Crime Centers, video and data analytics and CAD integration. Services backlog is up significantly on new multiyear deals despite currency headwinds. Q4 brought several notable services wins, including a $64 million extension with Prince George's County to provide full turnkey services in maintaining their mission-critical systems and Smart Public Safety systems while keeping their networks up-to-date with various lifecycle products; a 2-year $36 million Managed Services extension of the Victorian Mobile Data Network in Australia; $31 million with the Las Vegas Metro PD for long-term software and hardware maintenance of radio and CAD systems as well as technical support and lifecycle services; and $15 million with MiniCo in Latin America for a multiyear Managed Services contract to include administration and monitoring of their network as well as the maintenance on their devices and a help desk for end-users. 
So let me close by saying this was a challenging but transformational year for our company. We divested our Enterprise business for just under $3.5 billion; significantly improved our risk profile and cash flow through pension derisking actions; achieved more than $200 million in OpEx savings, including over $70 million in R&D reductions while simultaneously shifting more investment towards new growth areas; we restructured the company to increase our focuses on services as a line of business; and reaffirmed our commitment to capital return and a more efficient capital structure with $5 billion of additional repurchase authorization and $2.9 billion of stock buyback and dividends returned in 2014. As a result of these actions, we're in a better position. We're in a better position to grow, drive significant operating leverage, deliver strong cash flow and drive shareholder value for years to come. 
I'll now turn it over to Shep."

So we had talked about Public Safety LTE being about double in 2015 versus our run rate in '14. We still believe that that's the case, and we feel even better about that amount with the securing of the third contract I talked about in the Middle East. So we remain pretty resolute and expect that, that will occur, but a little bit north of $100 million in 2015. I think the auction spectrum developments recently are a positive, specifically as it relates to the first net. The $44 billion of proceeds by the federal government allows the fully funding of the $7 billion that's contemplated in the middle-class jobs relief act. So at the end of the day here in the U.S., the 2 most important things to facilitate and enable Public Safety LTE to be rolled out are dedicated spectrum and funding. The spectrum has been dedicated, as you know, with the 700 megahertz slice that remains dedicated to Public Safety. And the $7 billion is now fully funded with a very successful close of the AWS auction. The only other thing I'd comment is our focus is on continued engagement globally on Public Safety LTE, and there's still a pipeline of opportunities we'll pursue. But I think this year is quite important for us to implement the deals that we have, to implement LA-RICS, to start the implementation on the deal we just secured last week and to implement in the second half of this year the other Middle Eastern country that we referred to with our $100 million deal. And as we continue to compete and win on these deals, we see no chilling or impact on LMR and continue to see LMR purchases and Public Safety LTE to be additive to those purchases. So I think the auctions are positive."

As I think about international, I'll kind of give you a little color around the world. I'll start with EA, as you said. If you think of EA minus Norway and minus the currency headwinds, as you said, the demand is still very positive in Norway. Our growth across the business has been good, again, excluding the currency headwinds, which you asked me to do. The pipeline is also good, which was referenced in the comment of Greg saying he thinks as these factors dissipate, you'll see Europe & Africa return to grow. We also see Africa as a good growth area for us in the future. Latin America, as you mentioned, has been growing, minus iDEN. We expect that the trend to continue. IDEN will take down the overall numbers, but the core business in Latin America continues to grow. Middle East is actually coming off of really strong growth, and we've made some organizational changes to even put greater focus on the Middle East. We've announced the large Public Safety LTE deal today, but we also see good growth in that region. And then when we turn to Asia, as we talked about for a while, we've been disappointed with our recovery in Asia. But with that being said, we have built backlog. We actually have recognized some large deals, one of which was mentioned about Australia. We've got a good short-term pipeline in addition to our backlog. So we see the Asia region stabilizing and being relatively flat, inclusive of currencies, and would be growth without the currency headwinds. So all in all, to summarize and to answer your final question, we do see international as a growth area. The region, again, minus the large project and minus currency headwinds, we would expect to grow at a faster rate than North America."

And we're going to continue to do that. I don't think there's a limit or a ceiling. My team knows that, too, so we're pleased. And by the way, when you think about and dimensionalize the $350 million of cost reduction coming off of '13, that more than replaces the earnings that the Enterprise business was contributing that we just monetized to Zebra. So we like that fact, and this business is set up well from an operating leverage standpoint when the top line returns. On LTE in the United States, I think funding and spectrum are enablers. I don't think they're hurdles because they've been achieved. The spectrum that's been dedicated in the funding has now been fully populated at 7 billion. On the political front, you're right. It's the continual battle between federal and state, local control, what kind of architecture in a number of regions. The only thing I would say, Ben, as we work more closely than -- with FirstNet than we've ever done before, and we're committed to their success and working with them, in particular an NTIA to make sure LA-RICS gets rolled out appropriately. So the political side of that will continue to unfold in 2015 and '16.

Q4 was a solid quarter for Motorola Solutions, and we continue to see signs of recovery in large parts of our business. As I think about the quarter and beyond, there are a few thoughts I'd like to share. First, we continue to see improvement in our North America business. Q4 marked the return to growth, and we're encouraged by indicators such as orders, backlog and device sales as we move into 2015. 
Second, just last week, we secured a contract valued at over $200 million with a country in the Middle East for a nationwide smart communications network utilizing our Public Safety LTE solution. This now gives us the 3 largest Public Safety LTE awards to date, with the LA-RICS contract implementation underway and $100 million deal in another Middle East country that begins deployment this year. It's encouraging to see investments made over the past several years starting to drive associated revenue. 
And third, our efforts around simplification and rationalizing our cost structure remain on course. We closed the year with more than $200 million in OpEx savings versus full year 2013 and ended the year with a run rate that should position us well to achieve approximately $150 million of further reductions this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and our outlook."

Q4 2014 revenue was $1.8 billion, a slight increase over Q4 2013 and a reflection of robust order activity and faster-than-expected conversion of certain orders. These results come despite $27 million of currency headwinds in the quarter. 
GAAP operating earnings were a loss of $1 billion, which included a onetime charge of $1.9 billion due to our pension derisking transaction. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $483 million or 26.5% of sales, up from the year-ago quarter of 21.8%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $4.02, compared to a gain of $1.12 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.25, compared to $1.37 in the year-ago quarter, which included a $0.42 benefit from the formation of our international holding company in 2013. For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Turning to segment results. In Products, Q4 sales were a record $1.25 billion, up 3% versus the prior year's quarter. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for our P25 and PCR device product lines, while TETRA devices grew robustly on a global basis. Q4 Products segment operating income was $394 million or 32% of sales, up from $283 million or 23% of sales in Q4 of 2013. Significant operating leverage provided by our cost-reduction actions drove higher operating income. 
Moving to product backlog. Products segment backlog is $1.2 billion, which has increased for 3 consecutive quarters. Product backlog is up $53 million versus last year and up $16 million sequentially despite strong revenues in Q4. The year-over-year increase in backlog is driven by North America and APME. For the full year, operating income was $754 million or 19.8% of sales, which is up from last year due to cost reductions realized in 2014. 
Turning to Services. Q4 Services revenue was $577 million. Excluding iDEN, services revenue declined 2% while declining 5% overall. Q4 integration services revenue was down as expected versus Q4 2013's record quarter, which accompanied strong systems revenue in 2013. Q4 lifecycle support services grew modestly overall, and strong demand for our software maintenance contracts and steady demand for our hardware upgrades. Managed Services grew across all regions, as increasing complexity and the need for enhanced capabilities to support software-centric IP-based networks continues to drive demand. Services operating income was $89 million, down $24 million to 15.4% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and lower gross margin associated with systems integration mix. Gross margin in lifecycle management, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety was relatively flat. While we will continue to see project mix-related pressure in the first half of 2015, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-30% range going forward for our overall Services business. 
Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $431 million, down $86 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter, driven by continued cost-reduction activities. G&A and R&D posted the largest year-over-year declines, and we expect significant savings across all major categories again for 2015. 
Q4 other income and expense was a net expense of $39 million, compared to $19 million in the year-ago quarter. The difference was primarily driven by ongoing higher interest expense in Q4 of 2014 and gains on investment sales in the prior year quarter. In Q1, we expect OIE of $45 million versus $19 million in Q1 of 2014, driven primarily by higher interest expense. 
Other income and expense is expected to be approximately $180 million for 2015. 
With respect to taxes, our Q4 effective tax rate was 35%. Our Q1 and full year 2015 effective tax rate are expected to be approximately 33%. More importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to be approximately 15% for 2015 and continuing through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow from operations was a net use of $700 million, which includes $850 million in funding related to the U.S. pension derisking actions, coupled with funding our U.K. plan. For the year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was a net use of $685 million, driven by pension contributions of $1.3 billion. We ended 2014 with $4 billion in total cash and $3.4 billion in debt. 
In Q4, we repurchased $1.4 billion of stock. For the full year, we repurchased $2.5 billion in stock. We have reduced our net share comp by 36% since the program's inception in Q3 of 2011. In addition, we paid $82 million in dividends during the quarter and $318 million for the year. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%. In constant currency terms, this translates to growth of 1% to 3% versus the prior year. For the year, we expect growth in North America; growth in Latin America, excluding iDEN; growth in the Middle East. We expect to be flat in Asia Pacific, inclusive of currency headwinds; contraction in Europe & Africa due to currency headwinds and the Norway implementation completion; and a decline in iDEN of between $25 million to $50 million. We also expect OpEx to be approximately -- to be down approximately $150 million year-over-year; significant improvement in profitability, with EBITDA in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.36 billion, EPS of $3.15 to $3.35 and operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion for the full year. In Q1, we expect sales to decline 2% to 4%, reflecting better-than-anticipated order conversion in Q4, along with approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. In constant currency terms, we expect revenue to be down 1% to up 1%. This outlook assumes North America growth for the quarter and a contraction in Europe and Asia, driven primarily by currency headwinds. We expect Q1 EPS of $0.22 to $0.27.

I'll now provide some additional color on our Q4 results and outlook. I'm generally pleased with our Q4 results and more specifically, the improving trends we're seeing in North America. Q4 revenue was up slightly and marked a quarterly record for",723,"Thanks. I'll now provide some additional color on our Q4 results and outlook. I'm generally pleased with our Q4 results and more specifically, the improving trends we're seeing in North America. Q4 revenue was up slightly and marked a quarterly record for the company. Despite stronger-than-anticipated end of the year order conversion and currency headwinds, our backlog positions still continue to grow, and we ended Q4 with a higher total backlog, higher product backlog and higher backlog scheduled to ship in 2015. 
From a regional perspective, our North America business was up 4% in Q4. North America backlog is up $50 million in Products and $586 million in Services versus last year, which is a positive sign for this region. The Europe & Africa region declined 5% in Q4, which marked the first decline in 9 quarters. Currency headwinds was the key contributor to this decline and is expected to weigh on our full year results in the region. However, I believe, we have and will continue to execute well relative to the market in this region and are well positioned for long-term growth as these factors dissipate. 
Turning to the Asia Pac Middle East region. We saw an 8% sales decline in Q4. This decline was driven by Asia Pac. However, sales are starting to stabilize in this region, and backlog is up sequentially as we're seeing some improvements in the customer pipeline. Our Middle East business continues to grow and build momentum in both product and services backlog. By the way, these backlog numbers will continue to improve with the addition of the $200 million countrywide Public Safety LTE contract I referenced earlier. 
And finally, our Latin America business in Q4 increased 3%, excluding iDEN, and 1% overall. Backlog in Latin America is up modestly year-over-year and up significantly from a sequential view, driven by Services. The wind down of iDEN will continue to negatively impact this region disproportionately in 2015. 
Turning to the segment highlights. First in Products. We secured several strategic product awards in Q4 that include $148 million with the state of Michigan to upgrade their state-wide ASTRO network, including over $30 million in Services; $20 million with a state and local customer in the Northeast to upgrade to a fully P25-compatible solution with improved coverage and improved interoperability; $12 million with Eastman Chemical to enable their multistate operations. 
Moving to Services. I'm encouraged by Q4 revenue growth in lifecycle support and Managed Services. I think marketplace trends, such as the prevalence of video and social media used in policing, continue to validate our investments in areas such as Real-Time Crime Centers, video and data analytics and CAD integration. Services backlog is up significantly on new multiyear deals despite currency headwinds. Q4 brought several notable services wins, including a $64 million extension with Prince George's County to provide full turnkey services in maintaining their mission-critical systems and Smart Public Safety systems, while keeping their networks up-to-date with various lifecycle products; a 2-year $36 million Managed Services extension of the Victorian Mobile Data Network in Australia; $31 million with the Las Vegas Metro PD for long-term software and hardware maintenance of radio and CAD systems, as well as technical support and lifecycle services; and $15 million with MiniCo in Latin America for a multiyear Managed Services contract to include administration and monitoring of their network, as well as the maintenance on their devices and a help desk for end users. 
So let me close by saying this was a challenging but transformational year for our company. We divested our Enterprise business for just under $3.5 billion; significantly improved our risk profile and cash flow through pension derisking actions; achieved more than $200 million in OpEx savings, including over $70 million in R&D reductions, while simultaneously shifting more investment towards new growth areas. We restructured the company to increase our focuses on Services as a line of business and reaffirmed our commitment to capital return and a more efficient capital structure with $5 billion of additional repurchase authorization and $2.9 billion of stock buyback and dividends returned in 2014. As a result of these actions, we're in a better position. We're in a better position to grow, drive significant operating leverage, deliver strong cash flow and drive shareholder value for years to come. 
I'll now turn it over to Shep."

So constant currency, just taking currency out of it, in Q4, you saw a slight reacceleration, but you're decelerating again in Q1 slightly. I know it's very slight, but I was under the impression that just given the order backlog, the easy comps and visibility in government, LTE, all these things are going to kind of cause revenues to gradually reaccelerate as you went through the year, but you're kind of starting the year off a little bit slow. That's kind of one question on revenues. And on the first quarter earnings guidance, am I right that you're saying that the op margin of the business is going to more than half sequentially? That's a bit worse than the normal seasonal trend. I know, obviously, you have to look at what government used to do, but it seems a lot worse.

So we had talked about Public Safety LTE being about double in 2015 versus our run rate in '14. We still believe that that's the case, and we feel even better about that amount with the securing of the third contract I talked about in the Middle East. So we remain pretty resolute and expect that, that will occur, but a little bit north of $100 million in 2015. I think the auction spectrum developments recently are a positive, specifically as it relates to FirstNet. The $44 billion of proceeds by the federal government allows the fully funding of the $7 billion that's contemplated in the middle-class jobs relief act. So at the end of the day here in the U.S., the 2 most important things to facilitate and enable Public Safety LTE to be rolled out are dedicated spectrum and funding. The spectrum has been dedicated, as you know, with the 700 megahertz slice that remains dedicated to Public Safety. And the $7 billion is now fully funded with a very successful close of the AWS auction. The only other thing I'd comment is our focus is on continued engagement globally on Public Safety LTE, and there's still a pipeline of opportunities we'll pursue. But I think this year is quite important for us to implement the deals that we have, to implement LA-RICS, to start the implementation on the deal we just secured last week and to implement in the second half of this year the other Middle Eastern country that we referred to with our $100 million deal. And as we continue to compete and win on these deals, we see no chilling or impact on LMR and continue to see LMR purchases and Public Safety LTE to be additive to those purchases. So I think the auctions are positive."

So if I understand one of your comments, in Asia, excluding currency, you view it as actually been growing. In South America, the situation looks fairly stable, and that's in Europe & Africa that most of your decline is. So my first question is, Europe & Africa, excluding Norway, excluding currency, how do you feel the year, like 2015, looks like? And then my second question would be, what's like the longer-term outlook for international? Is it a place where you would expect still very solid growth drivers? And would you expect international to actually grow faster than group average beyond this currency headwind, beyond like the tough compare that Norway created for this year?"

As I think about international, I'll kind of give you a little color around the world. I'll start with EA, as you said. If you think of EA minus Norway and minus the currency headwinds, as you said, the demand is still very positive in Norway. Our growth across the business has been good, again, excluding the currency headwinds, which you asked me to do. The pipeline is also good, which was referenced in the comment of Greg saying he thinks as these factors dissipate, you'll see Europe & Africa return to growth. We also see Africa as a good growth area for us in the future. Latin America, as you mentioned, has been growing, minus iDEN. We expect that trend to continue. IDEN will take down the overall numbers, but the core business in Latin America continues to grow. Middle East is actually coming off of really strong growth, and we've made some organizational changes to even put greater focus on the Middle East. We've announced the large Public Safety LTE deal today, but we also see good growth in that region. And then when we turn to Asia, as we talked about for a while, we've been disappointed with our recovery in Asia. But with that being said, we have built backlog. We actually have recognized some large deals, one of which was mentioned about Australia. We've got a good short-term pipeline in addition to our backlog. So we see the Asia region stabilizing and being relatively flat, inclusive of currencies, and would be growth without the currency headwinds. So all in all, to summarize and to answer your final question, we do see international as a growth area. The region, again, minus the large project and minus currency headwinds, we would expect to grow at a faster rate than North America."

And we're going to continue to do that. I don't think there's a limit or a ceiling. My team knows that, too, so we're pleased. And by the way, when you think about and dimensionalize the $350 million of cost reduction coming off of '13, that more than replaces the earnings that the Enterprise business was contributing that we just monetized to Zebra. So we like that fact, and this business is set up well from an operating leverage standpoint when the top line returns. On LTE in the United States, I think funding and spectrum are enablers. I don't think they're hurdles because they've been achieved. The spectrum has been dedicated and the funding has now been fully populated at $7 billion. On the political front, you're right. It's the continual battle between federal and state, local control, what kind of architecture in a number of regions. The only thing I would say, Ben, as we work more closely than -- with FirstNet than we've ever done before, and we're committed to their success and working with them, and in particular and NTIA to make sure LA-RICS gets rolled out appropriately. So the political side of that will continue to unfold in 2015 and '16. And our government affairs team and the business development people and the sales organization are working hand in glove with them, so we are coordinated in achieving the opportunities and the expectations that people have of that network."

Q4 was a solid quarter for Motorola Solutions, and we continue to see signs of recovery in large parts of our business. As I think about the quarter and beyond, there are a few thoughts I'd like to share. First, we continue to see improvement in our North America business. Q4 marked the return to growth, and we're encouraged by indicators such as orders, backlog and device sales as we move into 2015. 
Second, just last week, we secured a contract valued at over $200 million with a country in the Middle East for a nationwide smart communications network utilizing our Public Safety LTE solution. This now gives us the 3 largest Public Safety LTE awards to date, with the LA-RICS contract implementation underway and $100 million deal in another Middle East country that begins deployment this year. It's encouraging to see investments made over the past several years starting to drive associated revenue. 
And third, our efforts around simplification and rationalizing our cost structure remain on course. We closed the year with more than $200 million in OpEx savings versus full year 2013 and ended the year with a run rate that should position us well to achieve approximately $150 million of further reductions this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and our outlook."

Q4 2014 revenue was $1.8 billion, a slight increase over Q4 2013 and a reflection of robust order activity and faster-than-expected conversion of certain orders. These results come despite $27 million of currency headwinds in the quarter. 
GAAP operating earnings were a loss of $1 billion, which included a onetime charge of $1.9 billion due to our pension derisking transaction. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $483 million or 26.5% of sales, up from the year-ago quarter of 21.8%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $4.02 compared to a gain of $1.12 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.25 compared to $1.37 in the year-ago quarter, which included a $0.42 benefit from the formation of our international holding company in 2013. For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Turning to segment results. In Products, Q4 sales were a record $1.25 billion, up 3% versus the prior year's quarter. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for our P25 and PCR device product lines, while TETRA devices grew robustly on a global basis. Q4 Products segment operating income was $394 million or 32% of sales, up from $283 million or 23% of sales in Q4 of 2013. Significant operating leverage provided by our cost-reduction actions drove higher operating income. 
Moving to product backlog. Products segment backlog is $1.2 billion, which has increased for 3 consecutive quarters. Product backlog is up $53 million versus last year and up $16 million sequentially despite strong revenues in Q4. The year-over-year increase in backlog is driven by North America and APME. For the full year, operating income was $754 million or 19.8% of sales, which is up from last year due to cost reductions realized in 2014. 
Turning to Services. Q4 Services revenue was $577 million. Excluding iDEN, services revenue declined 2% while declining 5% overall. Q4 integration services revenue was down as expected versus Q4 2013's record quarter, which accompanied strong systems revenue in 2013. Q4 lifecycle support services grew modestly overall, and strong demand for our software maintenance contracts and steady demand for our hardware upgrades. Managed Services grew across all regions, as increasing complexity and the need for enhanced capabilities to support software-centric IP-based networks continues to drive demand. Services operating income was $89 million, down $24 million to 15.4% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and lower gross margin associated with systems integration mix. Gross margin in lifecycle management, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety was relatively flat. While we will continue to see project mix-related pressure in the first half of 2015, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-30% range going forward for our overall Services business. 
Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $431 million, down $86 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter, driven by continued cost-reduction activities. G&A and R&D posted the largest year-over-year declines, and we expect significant savings across all major categories again for 2015. 
Q4 other income and expense was a net expense of $39 million compared to $19 million in the year-ago quarter. The difference was primarily driven by ongoing higher interest expense in Q4 of 2014 and gains on investment sales in the prior year quarter. In Q1, we expect OIE of $45 million versus $19 million in Q1 of 2014, driven primarily by higher interest expense. 
Other income and expense is expected to be approximately $180 million for 2015. 
With respect to taxes, our Q4 effective tax rate was 35%. Our Q1 and full year 2015 effective tax rate are expected to be approximately 33%. More importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to be approximately 15% for 2015 and continuing through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow from operations was a net use of $700 million, which includes $850 million in funding related to the U.S. pension derisking actions, coupled with funding our U.K. plan. For the year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was a net use of $685 million, driven by pension contributions of $1.3 billion. We ended 2014 with $4 billion in total cash and $3.4 billion in debt. 
In Q4, we repurchased $1.4 billion of stock. For the full year, we repurchased $2.5 billion in stock. We have reduced our net share comp by 36% since the program's inception in Q3 of 2011. In addition, we paid $82 million in dividends during the quarter and $318 million for the year. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%. In constant currency terms, this translates to growth of 1% to 3% versus the prior year. For the year, we expect growth in North America; growth in Latin America, excluding iDEN; growth in the Middle East. We expect to be flat in Asia Pacific, inclusive of currency headwinds; contraction in Europe & Africa due to currency headwinds and the Norway implementation completion; and a decline in iDEN of between $25 million to $50 million. We also expect OpEx to be approximately -- to be down approximately $150 million year-over-year; significant improvement in profitability, with EBITDA in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.36 billion, EPS of $3.15 to $3.35 and operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion for the full year. In Q1, we expect sales to decline 2% to 4%, reflecting better-than-anticipated order conversion in Q4, along with approximately $40 million in currency headwinds. In constant currency terms, we expect revenue to be down 1% to up 1%. This outlook assumes North America growth for the quarter and a contraction in Europe and Asia, driven primarily by currency headwinds. We expect Q1 EPS of $0.22 to $0.27. 
I'll now turn it back to Greg."

I'll now provide some additional color on our Q4 results and outlook. I'm generally pleased with our Q4 results and more specifically, the improving trends we're seeing in North America.

I'm generally pleased with our Q4 results and more specifically, the improving trends we're seeing in North America. Q4 revenue was up slightly and marked a quarterly record for the company. Despite stronger-than-anticipated end of the year order conversion and currency headwinds, our backlog positions still continue to grow, and we ended Q4 with a higher total backlog, higher product backlog and higher backlog scheduled to ship in 2015. 
From a regional perspective, our North America business was up 4% in Q4. North America backlog is up $50 million in Products and $586 million in Services versus last year, which is a positive sign for this region. The Europe & Africa region declined 5% in Q4, which marked the first decline in 9 quarters. Currency headwinds was the key contributor to this decline and is expected to weigh on our full year results in the region. However, I believe, we have and will continue to execute well relative to the market in this region and are well positioned for long-term growth as these factors dissipate. 
Turning to the Asia Pac Middle East region. We saw an 8% sales decline in Q4. This decline was driven by Asia Pac. However, sales are starting to stabilize in this region, and backlog is up sequentially as we're seeing some improvements in the customer pipeline. Our Middle East business continues to grow and build momentum in both product and services backlog. By the way, these backlog numbers will continue to improve with the addition of the $200 million countrywide Public Safety LTE contract I referenced earlier. 
And finally, our Latin America business in Q4 increased 3%, excluding iDEN, and 1% overall. Backlog in Latin America is up modestly year-over-year and up significantly from a sequential view, driven by Services. The wind down of iDEN will continue to negatively impact this region disproportionately in 2015. 
Turning to the segment highlights. First in Products. We secured several strategic product awards in Q4 that include $148 million with the state of Michigan to upgrade their state-wide ASTRO network, including over $30 million in Services; $20 million with a state and local customer in the Northeast to upgrade to a fully P25-compatible solution with improved coverage and improved interoperability; $12 million with Eastman Chemical to enable their multistate operations. 
Moving to Services. I'm encouraged by Q4 revenue growth in lifecycle support and Managed Services. I think marketplace trends, such as the prevalence of video and social media used in policing, continue to validate our investments in areas such as Real-Time Crime Centers, video and data analytics and CAD integration. Services backlog is up significantly on new multiyear deals despite currency headwinds. Q4 brought several notable services wins, including a $64 million extension with Prince George's County to provide full turnkey services in maintaining their mission-critical systems and Smart Public Safety systems, while keeping their networks up-to-date with various lifecycle products; a 2-year $36 million Managed Services extension of the Victorian Mobile Data Network in Australia; $31 million with the Las Vegas Metro PD for long-term software and hardware maintenance of radio and CAD systems as well as technical support and lifecycle services; and $15 million with MiniCo in Latin America for a multiyear Managed Services contract to include administration and monitoring of their network as well as the maintenance on their devices and a help desk for end users. 
So let me close by saying this was a challenging but transformational year for our company. We divested our Enterprise business for just under $3.5 billion; significantly improved our risk profile and cash flow through pension derisking actions; achieved more than $200 million in OpEx savings, including over $70 million in R&D reductions, while simultaneously shifting more investment towards new growth areas. We restructured the company to increase our focuses on Services as a line of business and reaffirmed our commitment to capital return and a more efficient capital structure with $5 billion of additional repurchase authorization and $2.9 billion of stock buyback and dividends returned in 2014. As a result of these actions, we're in a better position. We're in a better position to grow, drive significant operating leverage, deliver strong cash flow and drive shareholder value for years to come.

That's kind of one question on revenues. And on the first quarter earnings guidance, am I right that you're saying that the op margin of the business is going to more than half sequentially? That's a bit worse than the normal seasonal trend. I know, obviously, you have to look at what government used to do, but it seems a lot worse.

So we had talked about Public Safety LTE being about double in 2015 versus our run rate in '14. We still believe that that's the case, and we feel even better about that amount with the securing of the third contract I talked about in the Middle East. So we remain pretty resolute and expect that, that will occur, but a little bit north of $100 million in 2015. I think the auction spectrum developments recently are a positive, specifically as it relates to FirstNet. The $44 billion of proceeds by the federal government allows the fully funding of the $7 billion that's contemplated in the middle-class jobs relief act. So at the end of the day here in the U.S., the 2 most important things to facilitate and enable Public Safety LTE to be rolled out are dedicated spectrum and funding. The spectrum has been dedicated, as you know, with the 700 megahertz slice that remains dedicated to Public Safety. And the $7 billion is now fully funded with a very successful close of the AWS auction. The only other thing I'd comment is our focus is on continued engagement globally on Public Safety LTE, and there's still a pipeline of opportunities we'll pursue. But I think this year is quite important for us to implement the deals that we have, to implement LA-RICS, to start the implementation on the deal we just secured last week and to implement in the second half of this year the other Middle Eastern country that we referred to with our $100 million deal. And as we continue to compete and win on these deals, we see no chilling or impact on LMR and continue to see LMR purchases and Public Safety LTE to be additive to those purchases. So I think the auctions are positive."

And by the way, when you think about and dimensionalize the $350 million of cost reduction coming off of '13, that more than replaces the earnings that the Enterprise business was contributing that we just monetized to Zebra. So we like that fact, and this business is set up well from an operating leverage standpoint when the top line returns. On LTE in the United States, I think funding and spectrum are enablers. I don't think they're hurdles because they've been achieved. The spectrum has been dedicated and the funding has now been fully populated at $7 billion. On the political front, you're right. It's the continual battle between federal and state, local control, what kind of architecture in a number of regions. The only thing I would say, Ben, as we work more closely than -- with FirstNet than we've ever done before, and we're committed to their success and working with them, and in particular and NTIA to make sure LA-RICS gets rolled out appropriately.

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the business overall before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. 
First, Q1 was a solid quarter for us. Revenue was flat, although when adjusting for currency, the business grew 3% with growth in all regions, except Latin America. Additionally, we posted double-digit profitability growth with a 24% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings and a 36% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share.  Second, I'm very pleased with another excellent quarter of growth in North America, which grew 6% on strong product sales. Overall, our business continues to show signs of improvement, including our backlog position at the end of the quarter, which grew 8%.  And third, we continue to drive future growth to important investments in innovation and we're driving an increasingly efficient cost base that positions us well for improved leverage and stronger cash generation. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and our outlook."

First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, flat versus Q1 of 2014, up 3% in constant currency.

First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, flat versus Q1 of 2014, up 3% in constant currency. Additionally, ending backlog was up $442 million or 8% versus last year and up 1% versus Q4, inclusive of a $149 million unfavorable FX adjustment to backlog in Q1. GAAP operating earnings were $119 million, non-GAAP operating earnings were $156 million or 12.8% of sales, a 250 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to $0.33 in the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS grew 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by our cost-savings initiatives. 
For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Turning to the product segment. Q1 sales were $758 million, up 1% versus the prior year and up 3% in constant currency terms. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for our P25 and PCR product lines. Q1 product segment operating income was $90 million, up $38 million to 11.9% of sales versus the prior year quarter, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, up $132 million versus last year and up $43 million sequentially, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia Pac and the Middle East while we also saw an increase in North America. As expected, we saw decrease in Europe related to the continuing deployment of the Norway system. 
Turning to services. Q1 services revenue was $465 million, down 2% as expected. IDEN integration services declined, while key growth areas of Managed Services and Lifecycle Support Services were slightly up compared to last year. Excluding both iDEN and the impact of FX, our services business grew 3%. Services operating income was $66 million, down $8 million to 14.2% of revenue driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and a lower gross margin and integration services. As we stated in our Q4 call, we expect lower service gross margin in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect a return to the mid-30% gross margin range for the second half of the year. Services backlog is $4.6 million, up $310 million or 7% versus last year, and flat sequentially despite a $145 million foreign exchange adjustment in Q1. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $396 million, down $60 million or 13% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities as well as some benefits due to pension expense and a stronger dollar. Our largest decline came in G&A while we also drove reductions in sales and marketing and R&D. As of the end of Q1, we are on a run rate to deliver savings of $150 million to $175 million versus 2014. We are well positioned to deliver solid operating leverage as we move throughout the year. Other income and expense in Q1 was $37 million compared to $18 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 29%. We continue to expect full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $151 million, an increase of $139 million year-over-year. The improvement in cash generation was driven primarily by working capital improvement, specifically accounts receivable. We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $43 million. In Q1, we repurchased $653 million of stock at an average price of 66 12 while paying out $75 million in dividends. 
Now turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q2 to decline 3% to 5%, which includes approximately $45 million in year-over-year currency impact. This outlook also includes approximately $20 million in headwinds in the second quarter related to the temporary delay of the LA-RICS public safety LTE deployment. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.51 and $0.56. Factoring in Q1 results, our first half expectations remain unchanged. 
Moving to the full year. Our revenue outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant currency terms. We now expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. 
I'll now turn it back to Greg."

North America was a particular bright spot, which grew 6% on strong product sales. North America has posted 2 consecutive strong quarters of growth, and we believe the region will return to growth for the full year. Backlog is up in this region over $500 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to the other regions. The Europe & Africa region declined 11% in Q1 due to currency. Adjusting for currency, the region posted 1% growth. Asia Pac saw a 5% sales decline in Q1, or flat, excluding currency. Order activity here has been healthy and aged backlog and Asia Pac is higher than the second half of last year. Our Middle East business, while smaller, is growing quickly, with the large rise in backlog both year-over-year and sequentially as the large Public Safety LTE, when we mentioned last quarter, added over $200 million to the backlog position. Latin America had a challenging quarter due to a strong prior year compare, along with a significant decline in iDEN as expected. Additionally, there's also a number of countries there that are facing difficult macroeconomic conditions, which is tampering our expectations in the region for the full year. 
Turning to segment highlights and initiatives. In our product segment, we're making progress across and against our growth initiatives of driving system upgrades, software enablement, monetizing product enhancements and new product introductions. In the quarter, we earned new business from customers upgrading aged systems and purchasing additional software features and functionality. We also delivered more core innovation within our product portfolio with the specific customer-driven solution such as the APX8000, a P25 portable radio featuring integrated Wi-Fi and quadband radio, all-in one device. The Wi-Fi capability enables more efficient radio management for our customers with a faster broadband connection for software feature and firmware updates. Additionally, this breakthrough technology enables 4 radio bands in 1 device, and allows our Public Safety customers to communicate across borders and between systems using the single device that further improves interoperability. 
From an R&D perspective, the APX8000 incorporates our newest platform development approach that will be fully leveraged on future models in order to minimize cost and drive simplification. Another portfolio enhancement this quarter includes TETRA radio innovations, specific to mission-critical demands. Our new devices have improved ruggedness, coverage, audio and enhanced security features that better serve the specific needs of our Public Safety customers. 
In addition to new and improved device innovation, our North America P25 infrastructure now incorporates WAVE technology, which enables the convergence of LMR and LTE access from any device via an IP connection. Our customers responding to these growth drivers through strategic wins such as the Norway project utilizing WAVE technology to enable secure approve users the ability to monitor and utilize specific talk groups while outside the country or network, the $135 million South Australia network that's a major upgrade of an existing system with new features and functionality; the $46 million win with Hamilton County, Ohio. That's an upgrade over their existing system with integrated voice and data capabilities, that not only improves their network today, but enables continuous upgrades to new features and functionality via software updates going forward. 
Our Services segment revenue was down slightly this quarter due to currency pressure, iDEN and integration services declines. However, we posted increases in the areas of Lifecycle Support Services, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety solutions. Lifecycle wins include a $32 million award with Hamilton County, Ohio for a multi-year hardware and software maintenance agreement on top of the $14 million hardware and system upgrade. It also includes a multi-year hardware and software agreement with the City of Columbus, Georgia for $7.2 million, plus $5.8 million for a multi-year Premier One CAD maintenance agreement, both of these support agreements are on top of a $6 million order for conventional equipment. 
Our Managed Services business earned several notable wins, including $62 million for a multi-year Managed Services contract that was a part of the South Australia Government Radio Network deal, and we also won a multi-year Managed Services deals worth $9 million in Brazil and $8 million in Iraq. 
Finally, our Smart Public Safety Solutions business was bolstered with the acquisitions of Emergency CallWorks and PublicEngines, both companies are leading providers of software-based solutions, solidifying our offerings in command-and-control and next-generation 9-1-1 call centers and intelligent lead leasing solutions. Keywords include a $6 million command and control contract with a country in Africa, $3 million to expand the city of Chicago's video surveillance system and several CAD and Next Generation 9-1-1 wins leveraging our new Emergency CallWorks portfolio. 
So let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a solid start to the year in terms of sales momentum and ending backlog position. We performed particularly well in both North America and the Middle East. Second, we continue to make excellent progress driving further operational efficiencies while also improving speed and execution. We feel confident about delivering on our cost targets, and we'll keep applying the proper rigor to size the business appropriately for the long-term. And finally, we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders. We bought back $653 million of stock and paid $75 million of dividends in Q1. We've returned over $2 billion to shareholders just in the past 2 quarters alone, and we've now moved into a net debt position. And that said, we remain focused on further improving the efficiency of our balance sheet. And I'll now turn it back over to Shep."

Despite the LA-RICS delay and the $20 million headwind in Q2 and the downscoping of that project for the full year, I remind you that we have 3 projects, large ones, that generate probably 90%-plus of the LTE revenue. Even with the headwinds in L.A., and we're pleased that the suspension has been lifted, we're looking forward to completing a successful system. We still believe we can do approximately $100 million in Public Safety LTE revenue this year because there's other puts and takes from the other projects. And in the Maine, we still feel pretty good about the full year in our earlier projections. Last, in terms of LTE. We're focused on completing the awards that have been made, as we mentioned at the Financial Analyst Meeting. We're still engaged with some customers in the Middle East, customers in Latin America, customers in Asia Pac, and we will continue to pace here in the U.S. to the pace of FirstNet. The draft of RFP is out. It is still unclear what final configuration our business model will result in FirstNet. But we continue to work closely with them, and we'd certainly have a number of options that we're planning for contingent upon how ultimately Public Safety LTE gets rolled out in the U.S. So I think we're well prepared from of variety of different option standpoint, and we're still in a good position. And by the way, with the investments we made, we have the best portfolio, and I believe we have at least a 2 year headstart versus our competitors."

The other point deployments that Greg mentioned, quite honestly, even the smaller trials that we've got going, they're primarily infrastructure today. So when you think about the future growth, you also got to think about clearly have devices, applications, additional services. So that's also why it's important for LA-RICS, although the scope to get back started so that we can demonstrate the capabilities, and that will lead to some future growth of those kinds of items as we move forward. On Norway, clearly, the biggest burn off, if you will, of a Norway revenue will happen in the second half, as we indicated earlier. Then we'll see more of a reasonable trend. Obviously, that will put pressure on EA even for next year because we had a strong first half in Norway this year. With that being said though, just like this first quarter, we had growth in constant currency terms. So EA still continues to perform strong. We are out of backlog, as we expected to be, but really because of Norway. We're still working on a number of large deals. Our final and customer activity still pretty healthy. So I do see, as we go into '16 and beyond, we will backfill beyond Norway and begin to move towards growth."

Our view is on change from that perspective. I mean, I can only tell you what customers are telling us and what they're doing, both domestically and internationally. And they continue to buy LMR. By the way, North America be a great example. Reference 4% in Q4, 6% in Q1. The Middle East is another good example. And in the 3 large projects of Public Safety LTE, they are all =either have bought or in the process of buying brand-new LMR systems with multi-year services contract as well. So look, I know there's a lot of noise about this. But at the end of the day, I feel very good about our position and investments in technology. And specifically, Pierre, mission-critical voice and mission-critical data communications. Customers are buying both LMR and Public Safety LTE. Backlog are at the highest levels I can remember, and remember that includes multi-year services, showing the staying power and longevity of our solutions and our platforms. So I know there's a lot of noise in this information, I just don't see it. I see LMR and our core platforms having a long installed life. And I see Public Safety LTE as being additive and eventually, interoperable so you have broadband data, interoperable with narrowband voice. Many countries in Europe continue to buy countrywide TETRA systems. Some of those are also looking at LTE solutions. So I look at it as an overlay. And when you look at the work done in the standards community, and people use labels like mission-critical, but there's mission-critical voice and there's mission-critical voice for public safety, and then you get into a whole host of different attributes in the first layer of the 3GPP standards, the second day of the 3GPP standards, and then the actual network deployment components that are necessary for power generation and redundancy and the device communications in case the site goes down. I think it's the space we know well and I think we know both LMR and LTE well. We absolutely view them as additive, and we view BMS contributing to a very solid growth story for us going forward."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the business overall before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. 
First, Q1 was a solid quarter for us. Revenue was flat. Although when adjusting for currency, the business grew 3% with growth in all regions, except Latin America. Additionally, we posted double-digit profitability growth with a 24% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings and a 36% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. 
Second, I'm very pleased with another excellent quarter of growth in North America, which grew 6% on strong product sales. Overall, our business continues to show signs of improvement, including our backlog position at the end of the quarter, which grew 8%. 
And third, we continue to drive future growth to important investments in innovation and we're driving an increasingly efficient cost base that positions us well for improved leverage and stronger cash generation. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and our outlook."

First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, flat versus Q1 of 2014, up 3% in constant currency.

First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, flat versus Q1 of 2014, up 3% in constant currency. Additionally, ending backlog was up $442 million or 8% versus last year and up 1% versus Q4, inclusive of a $149 million unfavorable FX adjustment to backlog in Q1. GAAP operating earnings were $119 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $156 million or 12.8% of sales, a 250 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to $0.33 in the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS grew 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by our cost-savings initiatives. 
For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Turning to the product segment. Q1 sales were $758 million, up 1% versus the prior year and up 3% in constant currency terms. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for our P25 and PCR product lines. Q1 product segment operating income was $90 million, up $38 million to 11.9% of sales versus the prior year quarter, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, up $132 million versus last year and up $43 million sequentially, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia Pac and the Middle East, while we also saw an increase in North America. As expected, we saw a decrease in Europe related to the continuing deployment of the Norway system. 
Turning to services. Q1 services revenue was $465 million, down 2% as expected. iDEN and integration services declined, while key growth areas of Managed Services and Lifecycle Support Services were slightly up compared to last year. Excluding both iDEN and the impact of FX, our services business grew 3%. 
Services operating income was $66 million, down $8 million to 14.2% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and a lower gross margin in integration services. As we stated in our Q4 call, we expect lower service gross margin in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect a return to the mid-30% gross margin range for the second half of the year. Services backlog is $4.6 million, up $310 million or 7% versus last year and flat sequentially despite a $145 million foreign exchange adjustment in Q1. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $396 million, down $60 million or 13% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities as well as some benefits due to pension expense and a stronger dollar. Our largest decline came in G&A, while we also drove reductions in sales and marketing and R&D. 
As of the end of Q1, we are on a run rate to deliver savings of $150 million to $175 million versus 2014. We are well positioned to deliver solid operating leverage as we move throughout the year. Other income and expense in Q1 was $37 million compared to $18 million in the year ago quarter. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 29%. We continue to expect full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $151 million, an increase of $139 million year-over-year. The improvement in cash generation was driven primarily by working capital improvements, specifically accounts receivable. We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $43 million. In Q1, we repurchased $653 million of stock at an average price of $66.12 while paying out $75 million in dividends. 
Now turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q2 to decline 3% to 5%, which includes approximately $45 million in year-over-year currency impact. This outlook also includes approximately $20 million in headwinds in the second quarter related to the temporary delay of the LA-RICS Public Safety LTE deployment. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.51 and $0.56. Factoring in Q1 results, our first half expectations remain unchanged. 
Moving to the full year. Our revenue outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant currency terms. We now expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. 
I'll now turn it back to Greg."

I'm encouraged by our Q1 results. North America was a particular bright spot, which grew 6% on strong product sales.

North America was a particular bright spot, which grew 6% on strong product sales. North America has posted 2 consecutive strong quarters of growth, and we believe the region will return to growth for the full year. Backlog is up in this region over $500 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to the other regions. The Europe & Africa region declined 11% in Q1 due to currency. Adjusting for currency, the region posted 1% growth. Asia Pac saw a 5% sales decline in Q1, or flat, excluding currency. Order activity here has been healthy in aged backlog and Asia Pac is higher than the second half of last year. Our Middle East business, while smaller, is growing quickly with the large rise in backlog both year-over-year and sequentially as the large Public Safety LTE, when we mentioned last quarter, added over $200 million to the backlog position. 
Latin America had a challenging quarter due to a strong prior year compare, along with a significant decline in iDEN as expected. Additionally, there's also a number of countries there that are facing difficult macroeconomic conditions, which is tampering our expectations in the region for the full year. 
Turning to segment highlights and initiatives. In our product segment, we're making progress across and against our growth initiatives of driving system upgrades, software enablement, monetizing product enhancements and new product introductions. 
In the quarter, we earned new business from customers upgrading aged systems and purchasing additional software features and functionality. We also delivered more core innovation within our product portfolio with the specific customer-driven solution such as the APX8000, a P25 portable radio featuring integrated Wi-Fi and quad-band radio, all in one device. The Wi-Fi capability enables more efficient radio management for our customers with a faster broadband connection for software feature and firmware updates. Additionally, this breakthrough technology enables 4 radio bands in 1 device and allows our Public Safety customers to communicate across borders and between the systems using the single device that further improves interoperability. 
From an R&D perspective, the APX8000 incorporates our newest platform development approach that will be fully leveraged on future models in order to minimize cost and drive simplification. 
Another portfolio enhancement this quarter includes TETRA radio innovations, specific to mission-critical demands. Our new devices have improved ruggedness, coverage, audio and enhanced security features that better serve the specific needs of our Public Safety customers. 
In addition to new and improved device innovation, our North America P25 infrastructure now incorporates WAVE technology, which enables the convergence of LMR and LTE access from any device via an IP connection. Our customers are responding to these growth drivers through strategic wins such as the Norway project utilizing WAVE technology to enable secure approved users; the ability to monitor and utilize specific talk groups while outside the country or network; the $135 million South Australia network that's a major upgrade of an existing system with new features and functionality; the $46 million win with Hamilton County, Ohio. That's an upgrade of their existing system with integrated voice and data capabilities that not only improves their network today, but enables continuous upgrades to new features and functionality via software updates going forward. 
Our Services segment revenue was down slightly this quarter due to currency pressure. iDEN and integration services declines. However, we posted increases in the areas of Lifecycle Support Services, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety Solutions. Lifecycle wins include a $32 million award with Hamilton County, Ohio for a multi-year hardware and software maintenance agreement on top of the $14 million hardware and system upgrade. It also includes a multi-year hardware and software agreement with the City of Columbus, Georgia for $7.2 million plus $5.8 million for a multiyear PremierOne CAD maintenance agreement, both of these support agreements are on top of a $6 million order for conventional equipment. 
Our Managed Services business earned several notable wins, including $62 million for a multiyear Managed Services contract that was a part of the South Australia Government Radio Network deal, and we also won a multiyear Managed Services deals worth $9 million in Brazil and $8 million in Iraq. 
Finally, our Smart Public Safety Solutions business was bolstered with the acquisitions of Emergency CallWorks and Public Engines, both companies are leading providers of software-based solutions, solidifying our offerings in command and control and Next Generation 9-1-1 call centers and intelligent-lead policing [ph] solutions. Key wins include a $6 million command and control contract with a country in Africa, $3 million to expand the city of Chicago's video surveillance system and several CAD and Next Generation 9-1-1 wins, leveraging our new Emergency CallWorks portfolio. 
So let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a solid start to the year in terms of sales momentum and ending backlog position. We performed particularly well in both North America and the Middle East. 
Second, we continue to make excellent progress driving further operational efficiencies, while also improving speed and execution. We feel confident about delivering on our cost targets, and we'll keep applying the proper rigor to size the business appropriately for the long term. 
And finally, we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders. We bought back $653 million of stock and paid $75 million of dividends in Q1. We've returned over $2 billion to shareholders just in the past 2 quarters alone, and we've now moved into a net debt position. And that said, we remain focused on further improving the efficiency of our balance sheet. 
And I'll now turn it back over to Shep."

And does it -- once we get past -- I assume by the end of this year, we'll certainly past the initial decline of Norway, does Europe start growing? And then one of your competitors, Harris, obviously is having some issues. A lot of those share gains by you guys, I'm assuming most of that is North America. Is there any way you can parse out how much of the strength you're seeing North America as share gains from Harris versus how much is underlying market growth? And then lastly, comment on LTE. Obviously, LTE had very rough quarter both at LA-RICS and at FirstNet. What are your thoughts? We saw the guidance for $20 million headwinds from LA in Q2, but what are your thoughts on the $100 million for this year and for next year? And just kind of just walk us through the long-term thoughts in LTE. What are the different reactions that can go in both kind of in a normal bold case, but also in a bare case?

Yes, I think, clearly, that the 4% growth in Q4 led by Jack Moloney's [ph] team as well as the 6% in Q1 really strong performance. Now we don't expect North America to grow for the full year at those levels. But that said, there's no question. We are taking market share from them. I don't know the exact bifurcation of share gain versus overall market lift. What I would say is, though, as for my previous comments, I thought that narrowbanding would largely be behind us by the first half of this year. I would say that, that's still true, given -- not only the North America growth performance, but the device performance specifically within North America. That's first. Second, LTE. Despite the LA-RICS delay and the $20 million headwind in Q2 and the downscoping of that project for the full year, I remind you that we have 3 projects, large ones, that generate probably 90%-plus of the LTE revenue. Even with the headwinds in L.A., and we're pleased that the suspension has been lifted, we're looking forward to completing a successful system. We still believe, Ehud, we can do approximately $100 million in Public Safety LTE revenue this year because there's other puts and takes from the other projects. And in the Maine, we still feel pretty good about the full year in our earlier projections. Last, in terms of LTE. We're focused on completing the awards that have been made, as we mentioned at the Financial Analyst Meeting. We're still engaged with some customers in the Middle East, customers in Latin America, customers in Asia Pac, and we will continue to pace here in the U.S. to the pace of FirstNet. The draft RFP is out. It's still unclear what final configuration or business model will result in FirstNet, but we continue to work closely with them and we'd certainly have a number of options that we're planning for, contingent upon how ultimately Public Safety LTE gets rolled out in the U.S. So I think we're well prepared from of variety of different option standpoint. And we're still in a good position. And by the way, with the investments we made, we have the best portfolio, and I believe at least a 2-year head start versus our competitors."

The other thing to point out on those 3 large deployments that Greg mentioned, quite honestly, even the smaller trials that we've got going, they're primarily infrastructure today. So when you think about future growth, you also got to think about they're clearly add devices, applications, additional services. So that's also why it was important for LA-RICS, although de-scoped to get back started so that we can demonstrate the capabilities and that will lead to some future growth of those kinds of items as we move forward. On Norway, clearly, the biggest burn off, if you will, of the Norway revenue will happen in the second half, as we indicated earlier. Then we'll see more of a reasonable trend. Obviously, that will put pressure on EA even for next year because we had a strong first half in Norway this year. With that being said though, just like this first quarter, we had growth in constant currency terms. So EA still continues to perform strong. We are eating out of backlog as we expected to be, but really because of Norway. We're still working on a number of large deals. Our final and customer activity is still pretty healthy. So I do see, as we go into '16 and beyond, we will backfill beyond Norway and begin to move back towards growth."

By the way, North America being a great example. Reference 4% in Q4, 6% in Q1. The Middle East is another good example. And in the 3 large projects of Public Safety LTE, they are all either have bought or in the process of buying brand-new LMR systems with multiyear services contract as well. So look, I know there's a lot of noise about this. But at the end of the day, I feel very good about our position and investments in technology. And specifically, Pierre, mission-critical voice and mission-critical data communications. Customers are buying both LMR and Public Safety LTE. Backlog are at the highest levels I can remember, and remember that includes multiyear services, showing the staying power and longevity of our solutions and our platforms. So I know there's a lot of noise in this information, I just don't see it. I see LMR and our core platforms having a long installed life. And I see Public Safety LTE as being additive and eventually interoperable, so you have broadband data, interoperable with narrowband voice. Many countries in Europe continue to buy countrywide TETRA systems. Some of those are also looking at LTE solutions. So I look at it as an overlay. And when you look at the work done in the standards community, and people use labels like mission-critical, but there's mission-critical voice and there's mission-critical voice for public safety and you get into a whole host of different attributes in the first layer of the 3GPP standards, the second layer of the 3GPP standards and then the actual network deployment components that are necessary for power generation and redundancy and the device communications in case the site goes down. I think it's the space we know well and I think we know both LMR and LTE well.

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the business overall, before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. 
First, Q1 was a solid quarter for us. Revenue was flat. Although when adjusting for currency, the business grew 3%, with growth in all regions except Latin America. Additionally, we posted double-digit profitability growth with a 24% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings and a 36% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. 
Second, I'm very pleased with another excellent quarter of growth in North America, which grew 6% on strong product sales. Overall, our business continues to show signs of improvement, including our backlog position at the end of the quarter, which grew 8%. 
And third, we continue to drive future growth through important investments in innovation, and we're driving an increasingly efficient cost base that positions us well for improved leverage and stronger cash generation. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and our outlook."

First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, flat versus Q1 of 2014, up 3% in constant currency. Additionally, ending backlog was up $442 million or 8% versus last year and up 1% versus Q4, inclusive of a $149 million unfavorable FX adjustment to backlog in Q1. GAAP operating earnings were $119 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $156 million or 12.8% of sales, a 250-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to $0.33 in the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS grew 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by our cost-savings initiatives. 
For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Turning to the Products segment. Q1 sales were $758 million, up 1% versus the prior year and up 3% in constant currency terms. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for our P25 and PCR product lines. Q1 product segment operating income was $90 million, up $38 million to 11.9% of sales versus the prior-year quarter, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, up $132 million versus last year and up $43 million sequentially, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia Pac and the Middle East, while we also saw an increase in North America. As expected, we saw a decrease in Europe related to the continuing deployment of the Norway system. 
Turning to Services. Q1 Services revenue was $465 million, down 2% as expected. iDEN and integration services declined, while key growth areas of Managed Services and Lifecycle Support Services were slightly up compared to last year. Excluding both iDEN and the impact of FX, our Services business grew 3%. 
Services operating income was $66 million, down $8 million to 14.2% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and a lower gross margin in integration services. As we stated in our Q4 call, we expect lower service gross margin in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect a return to the mid-30% gross margin range for the second half of the year. Services backlog is $4.6 million, up $310 million or 7% versus last year and flat sequentially, despite a $145 million foreign exchange adjustment in Q1. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $396 million, down $60 million or 13% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities as well as some benefits due to pension expense and a stronger dollar. Our largest decline came in G&A, while we also drove reductions in sales and marketing and R&D. 
As of the end of Q1, we are on a run rate to deliver savings of $150 million to $175 million versus 2014. We are well positioned to deliver solid operating leverage as we move throughout the year. Other income and expense in Q1 was $37 million compared to $18 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 29%. We continue to expect full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $151 million, an increase of $139 million year-over-year. The improvement in cash generation was driven primarily by working capital improvements, specifically accounts receivable. We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $43 million. In Q1, we repurchased $653 million of stock at an average price of $66.12 while paying out $75 million in dividends. 
Now turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q2 to decline 3% to 5%, which includes approximately $45 million in year-over-year currency impact. This outlook also includes approximately $20 million in headwinds in the second quarter related to the temporary delay of the LA-RICS Public Safety LTE deployment. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.51 and $0.56. Factoring in Q1 results, our first half expectations remain unchanged. 
Moving to the full year. Our revenue outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant currency terms. We now expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. 
I'll now turn it back to Greg."

North America was a particular bright spot, which grew 6% on strong product sales. North America has posted 2 consecutive strong quarters of growth, and we believe the region will return to growth for the full year. Backlog is up in this region over $500 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to the other regions. The Europe & Africa region declined 11% in Q1 due to currency. Adjusting for currency, the region posted 1% growth. Asia Pac saw a 5% sales decline in Q1, or flat, excluding currency. Order activity here has been healthy in aged backlog and Asia Pac is higher than the second half of last year. Our Middle East business, while smaller, is growing quickly with a large rise in backlog both year-over-year and sequentially, as the large Public Safety LTE win we mentioned last quarter added over $200 million to the backlog position. 
Latin America had a challenging quarter due to a strong prior-year compare, along with a significant decline in iDEN, as expected. Additionally, there's also a number of countries there that are facing difficult macroeconomic conditions, which is tempering our expectations in the region for the full year. 
Turning to segment highlights and initiatives. In our product segment, we're making progress across and against our growth initiatives of driving system upgrades, software enablement, monetizing product enhancements and new product introductions. 
In the quarter, we earned new business from customers upgrading aged systems and purchasing additional software features and functionality. We also delivered more core innovation within our product portfolio with the specific customer-driven solution such as the APX8000, a P25 portable radio featuring integrated Wi-Fi and quad-band radio, all in one device. The Wi-Fi capability enables more efficient radio management for our customers with a faster broadband connection for software feature and firmware updates. Additionally, this breakthrough technology enables 4 radio bands in 1 device and allows our Public Safety customers to communicate across borders and between systems using a single device that further improves interoperability. 
From an R&D perspective, the APX8000 incorporates our newest platform development approach that will be fully leveraged on future models in order to minimize cost and drive simplification. 
Another portfolio enhancement this quarter includes TETRA radio innovations, specific to mission-critical demands. Our new devices have improved ruggedness, coverage, audio and enhanced security features that better serve the specific needs of our Public Safety customers. 
In addition to new and improved device innovation, our North America P25 infrastructure now incorporates WAVE technology, which enables the convergence of LMR and LTE access from any device via an IP connection. Our customers are responding to these growth drivers through strategic wins such as the Norway project utilizing WAVE technology to enable secure approved users; the ability to monitor and utilize specific talk groups while outside the country or network; the $135 million South Australia network that's a major upgrade of an existing system with new features and functionality; the $46 million win with Hamilton County, Ohio. That's an upgrade of their existing system with integrated voice and data capabilities that not only improves their network today, but enables continuous upgrades to new features and functionality via software updates going forward. 
Our Services segment revenue was down slightly this quarter due to currency pressure, iDEN and integration services declines. However, we posted increases in the areas of Lifecycle Support Services, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety Solutions. Lifecycle wins include a $32 million award with Hamilton County, Ohio, for a multi-year hardware and software maintenance agreement on top of the $14 million hardware and system upgrade. It also includes a multi-year hardware and software agreement with the City of Columbus, Georgia, for $7.2 million, plus $5.8 million for a multiyear PremierOne CAD maintenance agreement. Both of these support agreements are on top of a $6 million order for conventional equipment. 
Our Managed Services business earned several notable wins, including $62 million for a multiyear Managed Services contract that was a part of the South Australia Government Radio Network deal. And we also won a multiyear Managed Services deals worth $9 million in Brazil and $8 million in Iraq. 
Finally, our Smart Public Safety Solutions business was bolstered with the acquisitions of Emergency CallWorks and Public Engines. Both companies are leading providers of software-based solutions, solidifying our offerings in command and control and Next Generation 9-1-1 call centers and intelligent-led policing solutions. Key wins include a $6 million command-and-control contract with a country in Africa, $3 million to expand the city of Chicago's video surveillance system and several CAD and Next Generation 9-1-1 wins, leveraging our new Emergency CallWorks portfolio. 
So let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a solid start to the year in terms of sales momentum and ending backlog position. We performed particularly well in both North America and the Middle East. 
Second, we continue to make excellent progress driving further operational efficiencies, while also improving speed and execution. We feel confident about delivering on our cost targets, and we'll keep applying the proper rigor to size the business appropriately for the long term. 
And finally, we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders. We bought back $653 million of stock and paid $75 million of dividends in Q1. We've returned over $2 billion to shareholders just in the past 2 quarters alone, and we've now moved into a net debt position. And that said, we remain focused on further improving the efficiency of our balance sheet. 
And I'll now turn it back over to Shep."

And then one of your competitors, Harris, obviously is having some issues. A lot of those share gains by you guys, I'm assuming most of that is North America. Is there any way you can parse out how much of the strength you're seeing in North America is share gains from Harris versus how much is underlying market growth? And then lastly, comment on LTE. Obviously, LTE had very rough quarter both at LA-RICS and at FirstNet. What are your thoughts? We saw the guidance for $20 million in headwinds from LA in Q2, but what are your thoughts on the $100 million for this year and for next year? And just kind of just walk us through the long-term thoughts in LTE. What are the different directions that can go in, both kind of in a normal bull case, but also in a bear case?

Yes, I think, clearly, that the 4% growth in Q4, led by Jack Molloy and his team, as well as the 6% in Q1, really strong performance. Now we don't expect North America to grow for the full year at those levels. But that said, there's no question we are taking market share from them. I don't know the exact bifurcation of share gain versus overall market lift. What I would say is, though, as per my previous comments, I thought that narrowbanding would largely be behind us by the first half of this year. I would say that that's still true, given not only the North America growth performance, but the device performance specifically within North America. That's first. Second, LTE. Despite the LA-RICS delay and the $20 million headwind in Q2 and the downscoping of that project for the full year, I remind you that we have 3 projects, large ones, that generate probably 90%-plus of the LTE revenue. Even with the headwinds in LA, and we're pleased that the suspension has been lifted, we're looking forward to completing a successful system. We still believe, Ehud, we can do approximately $100 million in Public Safety LTE revenue this year because there's other puts and takes from the other projects. And in the Maine [ph], we still feel pretty good about the full year in our earlier projections. Last, in terms of LTE. We're focused on completing the awards that have been made, as we mentioned at the Financial Analyst Meeting. We're still engaged with some customers in the Middle East, customers in Latin America, customers in Asia Pac, and we will continue to pace here in the U.S. to the pace of FirstNet. The draft RFP is out. It's still unclear what final configuration or business model will result in FirstNet, but we continue to work closely with them and we'd certainly have a number of options that we're planning for, contingent upon how ultimately Public Safety LTE gets rolled out in the U.S. So I think we're well prepared from of variety of different option standpoint. And we're still in a good position. And by the way, with the investments we made, we have the best portfolio and, I believe, at least a 2-year head start versus our competitors."

The other thing to point out on those 3 large deployments that Greg mentioned, quite honestly, even the smaller trials that we've got going, they're primarily infrastructure today. So when you think about future growth, you also got to think about they're clearly going to add devices, applications, additional services. So that's also why it was important for LA-RICS, although de-scoped, to get that started so that we can demonstrate the capabilities and that will lead to some future growth of those kinds of items as we move forward. On Norway, clearly, the biggest burn-off, if you will, of the Norway revenue will happen in the second half, as we indicated earlier. Then we'll see more of a reasonable trend. Obviously, that will put pressure on EA even for next year because we had a strong first half in Norway this year. With that being said though, just like this first quarter, we had growth in constant currency terms. So EA still continues to perform strong. We are eating out of backlog as we expected to be, but really because of Norway. We're still working on a number of large deals. Our funnel in customer activity is still pretty healthy. So I do see, as we go into '16 and beyond, we will backfill beyond Norway and begin to move back towards growth."

Our view is unchanged from that perspective. I mean, I can only tell you what customers are telling us and what they're doing, both domestically and internationally, and they continue to buy LMR. By the way, North America being a great example. Reference 4% in Q4, 6% in Q1. The Middle East is another good example. And in the 3 large projects of Public Safety LTE, they are all either have bought or in the process of buying brand-new LMR systems with multiyear services contract as well. So look, I know there's a lot of noise about this. But at the end of the day, I feel very good about our position and investments in technology, and specifically, Pierre, mission-critical voice and mission-critical data communications. Customers are buying both LMR and Public Safety LTE. Backlog are at the highest levels I can remember, and remember that includes multiyear services, showing the staying power and longevity of our solutions and our platforms. So I know there's a lot of noise and misinformation, I just don't see it. I see LMR and our core platforms having a long installed life. And I see Public Safety LTE as being additive and eventually interoperable, so you have broadband data interoperable with narrowband voice. Many countries in Europe continue to buy countrywide TETRA systems. Some of those are also looking at LTE solutions. So I look at it as an overlay. And when you look at the work done in the standards community -- and people use labels like mission-critical, but there's mission-critical voice and there's mission-critical voice for public safety. And you get into a whole host of different attributes in the first layer of the 3GPP standards, the second layer of the 3GPP standards and then the actual network deployment components that are necessary for power generation and redundancy and the device-to-device communications in case the site goes down. I think it's a space we know well, and I think we know both LMR and LTE well. We absolutely view them as additive and we view them as contributing to a very solid growth story for us going forward."

By the way, coming out of that, our backlog position is better. A big piece of that backlog position improvement is in multiyear services, which is also good for future upgrades and what we do. But our product backlog is also up, and the backlog aged in the year is actually stronger than it was at this point last year. So we're seeing the improvement that we thought we would see in North America. When you look at North America, in general, overall state and local spend and revenues are up, IT spend is up. Federal seems to be returning to a little bit more normal predictability for us. We were up slightly last year. As I talked to you about in the last call, while we were down slightly in first quarter, we still have got some good orders and we're building backlog, and we think we'll have modest growth for the full year. So we have good visibility, good activity throughout North America. I mean, we are encouraged by the activity we're seeing from customers in North America."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.
First, Q2 was another solid quarter. North America grew 5%, marking its third consecutive quarter of growth, and the overall business grew 2%, when adjusting for foreign exchange. Operational execution continues to drive improved profitability and cash flow generation as reflected in our double-digit growth of EPS and double-digit growth in free cash flow per share.
Second, our growing backlog and strong pipeline illustrate the confidence our customers have in choosing our technology solutions. We posted a third consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth, ending the quarter with a record $6 billion of backlog and a healthy pipeline moving forward.
Third, I'm very pleased to announce that Silver Lake will make $1 billion strategic investment in our company that we will use to further accelerate growth in our Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services.
And finally, we announced our intent to commence a $2 billion tender offer, representing a significant step toward further improving our capital structure. This accelerated return of capital reflects our continued confidence in the future growth of the company.

Additionally, orders were up 11% year-on-year, and ending backlog is up $624 million versus last year. GAAP operating earnings were $254 million while non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million or 19% of sales, a 460 basis points improvement from the year-ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.72 compared to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.68, which represents 45% year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by our cost savings and simplification initiatives. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
Product segment Q2 sales were $867 million, down 2% versus the prior year, up 1% when adjusting for currency impact. Q2 Product segment operating income was $176 million or 20.3% of sales, up $43 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $138 million versus last year and up $48 million sequentially, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarterly increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia Pacific and the Middle East. As expected, we saw a decrease in Europe backlog as we continue to deploy the Norway countrywide system.
Turning to Services. Q2 Services revenue was $501 million, down 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Services business grew 4%. Services operating income was $84 million or 16.8% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior year quarter. Lower operating expenses drove the profitability improvement. Services gross margin was 33.5%, in line with our expectations for Q2. Services backlog is $4.7 billion, up $486 million versus last year and up $125 million sequentially, as customers continue to sign long-term service contracts to upgrade, maintain and manage their network.
Moving to operating expenses. Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $393 million, down $69 million or 15% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities as well as a stronger dollar. These reductions were significant across all categories with the largest savings coming from G&A. As of the end of Q2, we are now on a run rate to deliver savings of approximately $175 million versus 2014. We believe our business is well positioned to deliver solid operating leverage.
Other income and expense in Q2 was $39 million compared to $40 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 effective tax rate was approximately 35%. We continue to expect the full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $140 million, an increase of $22 million or 19% versus last year. Free cash flow was $92 million. The improvement in cash generation was primarily driven by improved profitability. We remain on track for approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow and $800 million of free cash flow for the full year. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $285 million. In Q2, we repurchased $285 million of stock at an average price of $61.63 per share while paying out $72 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that we intend to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of our shares. This is a significant step in improving the efficiency of our balance sheet while maintaining an investment-grade credit rate profile and is consistent with our belief that buying back our stock represents an excellent opportunity, given our view of company value and future growth.
Turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q3 to decline 1% to 3%, which corresponds to flat to up 2%, including the impact of currency, which we expect to be approximately $50 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.68 and $0.73.
Moving to the full year. Our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant-currency terms, and we continue to expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40.
Moving onto regional results. As mentioned by Greg, our North America business continues to execute, posting the third consecutive quarter of growth at 5% for the second quarter. We expect North America to show modest growth for the full year 2015 with a healthy backlog. Latin America was down, as expected, versus tough comparables, including one large deal in the prior year, as well as an expected iDEN decline. Challenging macroeconomic conditions as well as the impact of a stronger dollar continue to tamper expectations for the year. The Europe & Africa region was down 15% in total but just 2% when excluding $29 million of currency impact. We expect this region to experience headwinds of currency pressure and the nationwide Norway project transitioning from deployment to long-term managed services. Despite these near-term hurdles, we remain confident in our competitive positioning and long-term opportunities in this region.
Turning to Asia Pac. The business is stabilized, growing at 4% in constant currency. Backlog in this region is up $97 million or 16%, and our pipeline is stronger. We expect Asia Pacific to show growth in the second half of this year. Finally, our Middle East region is growing strong double digits, and backlog is up over 100% versus the year-ago quarter to $418 million. Our Public Safety LTE business continues to gain traction and attract customer interest while our LMR business is also growing robustly.
I'd also like to share some segment highlights and key initiatives. Our product business continues to execute on innovating for customer needs with a shift toward software enablement while also improving operational performance. This is reflected in the segment's healthy gross margin and lower OpEx, which drove strong profitability of 20.2%.
An example of innovation that's driving growth and bolstering gross margin includes a major order for the newly released APX8000, which is seeing strong demand. These new radio platform integrates WiFi broadband and LMR into a single device while also integrating 4 different radio bands to provide interoperability as well as high voice quality. By integrating WiFi, customers are able to more effectively add new features and functionality via over-the-air software loads.
Another example of innovative solution solving specific customer needs is the launch of our new line of intrinsically safe TETRA radios specifically built for hazardous working conditions found in our target verticals of oil and gas, fire and rescue, mining and airports.
There are a number of prove points that illustrate operational efficiency improvements in the business resulting in lower OpEx structure. For example, we have streamlined R&D by reducing various testing labs from 19 to 5, shifted resources to lower-cost work sites, and we're on track to reduce SKUs 40% by year-end 2015. Throughout the quarter, we won key customer deals that highlight this customer-focused innovation and software enablement such as a $12.5 million purchase by the U.S. Army for WAVE software that will be used by all the programs in the Army program Executive Office C3T. WAVE is our application that converts radiocommunication into Voice over IP, which allows a user with authorization and a voice-enabled IP device to participate in voice communications regardless of the network or device. $66 million of wins with 4 customers in the oil and gas and utility industries covering both P25 and TETRA technologies. Targeted devices with unique software features position our solutions as long-term investments for our customers.
Shifting to Services. The Services segment continues to show solid growth in constant-currency terms. Our core integration services are executing well, and we're encouraged by the opportunities underlying the key growth areas of life cycle support, managed services and Smart Public Safety Solutions. Lifecycle services encompasses our upgrade agreements for system refreshes and maintenance of both hardware and software. We continue to see growth and strong adoption in software maintenance agreements. Some examples of larger wins include multiyear contracts for $19 million in Hong Kong, $13 million in Québec and $8 million in Pennsylvania. Managed services continues to be an area of focus for growth. During Q2, we booked orders for several long-term deals, including 2 contracts totaling $68 million that span over 20 years of operations and managed services in Austria and a $20 million extension to an existing contract in Australia. Additionally, in Q2, we launched the North America managed services network operations center and have since transitioned customers into that NOC, providing unmatched expertise and scale.
Other notable Smart Public Safety wins include a computer-aided dispatch contract for $14 million in the U.S. and a $9 million contract in Australia. Our Emergency CallWorks acquisition is executing well, having secured 6 new customers this quarter and helping to expand our reach into next generation IP-based command-and-control centers. Additionally, we added a partnership with Wynyard, which, in conjunction with our acquisition of Public Engines, will enhance our Smart Public Safety offering. Finally, our Public Safety LTE efforts continue to move forward as planned. The existing deployments are on schedule, and we still expect Public Safety LTE revenue of approximately $100 million for this year.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

So in addition to a solid quarter, as we mentioned, we announced an important partnership with Silver Lake. We believe this strategic investment is an endorsement of our strategy and a strong vote of confidence in our future growth opportunities. The partnership combines Silver Lake's technology expertise and track record with our brand, market reach and public safety technology platforms around the world. This investment also matches the largest single-pipe investment that Silver Lake has ever done. I'm pleased that Silver Lake managing partners, Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, will be appointed to the Motorola Solutions Board of Directors. They both have a history of driving growth, creating value and bringing teams together to identify and deliver unique business opportunities in the technology industry.
Today, we also announced our intention to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock. This represents an important step towards significantly improving our balance sheet and returning more capital to shareholders and is incremental to the $8.7 billion in share repurchase and $1.1 billion in dividends that we've returned over the past 4 years. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow allows us to maintain our investment-grade rating and our ability to drive the growth of our business through strategic acquisitions and investments in innovation. This accelerated return of capital reflects our confidence in the growth prospects and future value of the company.
So in closing, Q2 was another solid quarter of outperformance relative to our sales and earnings expectations as we performed well on a number of measures, including revenue growth in North America as well as the Middle East. We continue to position this business for improved operating leverage and significant earnings power as we grew backlog for a third straight quarter, and we're now on target to deliver approximately $175 million in cost savings for the year.
And finally, today's announcements represent not only our conviction and the durability of our business and its earnings and cash generation potential but the power of our platforms and another important step in accelerating growth in Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services. In aggregate, we're confident and encouraged about the future of our company and our growth strategy and the value creation we can deliver.
And I'll now turn it back over to Shep."

So with the over-performance in Q2, we remain confident on the full year and the full year outlook. With respect to gross margin, as we've talked about in the Q4 call and the Q1 call, the gross margin has been affected largely about -- around systems integration in the Services segment, predominantly related to a couple of large project deployments that have been occurring, Q4, Q1. We saw a little bit of an improvement in Q2. We continue to expect Services gross margin longer term to be in the 35 to mid-30 range, approximately 35%. And the product gross margin is stable despite some currency headwinds."

Video is one of the critical components in our Smart Public Safety Solutions strategy, not just the edge devices that may capture it but the analytics, aggregation, dissemination and pushing of that data and the high-bandwidth video into a first responder to a full-fledged complementary converged device. So I think video is very important to what we're doing going forward. I see it as growing in importance, and I think that will be also front and center with the value proposition that we engage Silver Lake on."

If you can just comment on the split of infrastructure versus device sales for the quarter in terms of their growth trajectory.

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.
First, Q2 was another solid quarter. North America grew 5%, marking its third consecutive quarter of growth, and the overall business grew 2% when adjusting for foreign exchange. Operational execution continues to drive improved profitability and cash flow generation, as reflected in our double-digit growth of EPS and double-digit growth in free cash flow per share.
Second, our growing backlog and strong pipeline illustrate the confidence our customers have in choosing our technology solutions. We posted a third consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth, ending the quarter with a record $6 billion of backlog and a healthy pipeline moving forward.
Third, I'm very pleased to announce that Silver Lake will make $1 billion strategic investment in our company that we will use to further accelerate growth in our Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services.
And finally, we announced our intent to commence a $2 billion tender offer, representing a significant step toward further improving our capital structure. This accelerated return of capital reflects our continued confidence in the future growth of the company.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide some additional details on Q2 before returning to provide additional context with respect to our strategic announcements made this morning."

Additionally, orders were up 11% year-on-year and ending backlog is up $624 million versus last year. GAAP operating earnings were $254 million, while non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million or 19% of sales, a 460 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.72, compared to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.68, which represents 45% year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by our cost savings and simplification initiatives. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
Products segment Q2 sales were $867 million, down 2% versus the prior year, up 1% when adjusting for currency impact. Q2 Products segment operating income was $176 million or 20.3% of sales, up $43 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $138 million versus last year and up $48 million sequentially, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarterly increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia Pacific and the Middle East. As expected, we saw a decrease in Europe backlog as we continue to deploy the Norway countrywide system.
Turning to Services. Q2 Services revenue was $501 million, down 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Services business grew 4%. Services operating income was $84 million or 16.8% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior year quarter. Lower operating expenses drove the profitability improvement. Services gross margin was 33.5%, in line with our expectations for Q2. Services backlog is $4.7 billion, up $486 million versus last year and up $125 million sequentially, as customers continue to sign long-term service contracts to upgrade, maintain and manage their network.
Moving to operating expenses. Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $393 million, down $69 million or 15% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities as well as a stronger dollar. These reductions were significant across all categories, with the largest savings coming from G&A. As of the end of Q2, we are now on a run rate to deliver savings of approximately $175 million versus 2014. We believe our business is well-positioned to deliver solid operating leverage.
Other income and expense in Q2 was $39 million, compared to $40 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 effective tax rate was approximately 35%. We continue to expect the full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $140 million, an increase of $22 million or 19% versus last year. Free cash flow was $92 million. The improvement in cash generation was primarily driven by improved profitability. We remain on track for approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow and $800 million of free cash flow for the full year. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $285 million. In Q2, we repurchased $285 million of stock at an average price of $61.63 per share, while paying out $72 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that we intend to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of our share. This is a significant step in improving the efficiency of our balance sheet, while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile and is consistent with our belief that buying back our stock represents an excellent opportunity, given our view of company value and future growth.
Turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q3 to decline 1% to 3%, which corresponds to flat to up 2%, including the impact of currency, which we expect to be approximately $50 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.68 and $0.73.
Moving to the full year. Our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant-currency terms, and we continue to expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40.
Moving on to regional results. As mentioned by Greg, our North America business continues to execute, posting the third consecutive quarter of growth at 5% for the second quarter. We expect North America to show modest growth for the full year 2015 with a healthy backlog. Latin America was down, as expected, versus tough comparables, including one large deal in the prior year as well as an expected iDEN decline. Challenging macroeconomic conditions as well as the impact of a stronger dollar continue to tamper expectations for the year. The Europe & Africa region was down 15% in total, but just 2% when excluding $29 million of currency impact. We expect this region to experience headwinds of currency pressure and the nationwide Norway project transitioning from deployment to long-term managed services. Despite these near-term hurdles, we remain confident in our competitive positioning and long-term opportunities in this region.
Turning to Asia Pac. The business has stabilized, growing at 4% in constant currency. Backlog in this region is up $97 million or 16%, and our pipeline is stronger. We expect Asia Pacific to show growth in the second half of this year. Finally, our Middle East region is growing strong double digits, and backlog is up over 100% versus the year-ago quarter to $418 million. Our Public Safety LTE business continues to gain traction and attract customer interest, while our LMR business is also growing robustly.
I'd also like to share some segment highlights and key initiatives. Our product business continues to execute on innovating for customer needs with a shift toward software enablement, while also improving operational performance. This is reflected in the segment's healthy gross margin and lower OpEx, which drove strong profitability of 20.2%.
An example of innovation that's driving growth and bolstering gross margin includes a major order for the newly released APX8000, which is seeing strong demand. This new radio platform integrates WiFi broadband and LMR into a single device, while also integrating 4 different radio bands to provide interoperability as well as high voice quality. By integrating WiFi, customers are able to more effectively add new features and functionality via over-the-air software loads.
Another example of innovative solution solving specific customer needs is the launch of our new line of intrinsically safe TETRA radios specifically built for hazardous working conditions found in our target verticals of oil and gas, fire and rescue, mining and airports.
There are a number of proof points that illustrate operational efficiency improvements in the business resulting in lower OpEx structure. For example, we have streamlined R&D by reducing various testing labs from 19 to 5, shifted resources to lower-cost work sites, and we're on track to reduce SKUs 40% by year-end 2015.
Throughout the quarter, we won key customer deals that highlight this customer-focused innovation and software enablement such as a $12.5 million purchase by the U.S. Army for WAVE software that will be used by all the programs in the Army Program Executive Office, C3T. WAVE is our application that converts radio communication into Voice over IP, which allows a user with authorization and a voice-enabled IP device to participate in voice communications regardless of the network or device. $66 million of wins with 4 customers in the oil and gas and utility industries covering both P25 and TETRA technologies. Targeted devices with unique software features position our solutions as long-term investments for our customers.
Shifting to Services. The Services segment continues to show solid growth in constant-currency terms. Our core integration services are executing well, and we're encouraged by the opportunities underlying the key growth areas of Lifecycle Support, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety Solutions. Lifecycle Services encompasses our upgrade agreements for system refreshes and maintenance of both hardware and software. We continue to see growth and strong adoption in software maintenance agreements. Some examples of larger wins include multiyear contracts for $19 million in Hong Kong, $13 million in Québec and $8 million in Pennsylvania.
Managed Services continues to be an area of focus for growth. During Q2, we booked orders for several long-term deals, including 2 contracts totaling $68 million that span over 20 years of operations in Managed Services in Austria and a $20 million extension to an existing contract in Australia. Additionally, in Q2, we launched the North America Managed Services Network Operations Center and have since transitioned customers into that NOC, providing unmatched expertise and scale.
Other notable Smart Public Safety wins include a computer-aided dispatch contract for $14 million in the U.S. and a $9 million contract in Australia. Our Emergency CallWorks acquisition is executing well, having secured 6 new customers this quarter and helping to expand our reach into next-generation IP-based command-and-control centers. Additionally, we added a partnership with Wynyard, which, in conjunction with our acquisition of Public Engines, will enhance our Smart Public Safety offering.
Finally, our Public Safety LTE efforts continue to move forward as planned. The existing deployments are on schedule, and we still expect Public Safety LTE revenue of approximately $100 million for this year.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

So in addition to a solid quarter, as we mentioned, we announced an important partnership with Silver Lake. We believe this strategic investment is an endorsement of our strategy and a strong vote of confidence in our future growth opportunities. The partnership combines Silver Lake's technology expertise and track record with our brand, market reach and public safety technology platforms around the world. This investment also matches the largest single-pipe investment that Silver Lake has ever done.
I'm pleased that Silver Lake managing partners, Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, will be appointed to the Motorola Solutions Board of Directors. They both have a history of driving growth, creating value and bringing teams together to identify and deliver unique business opportunities in the technology industry.
Today, we also announced our intention to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock. This represents an important step towards significantly improving our balance sheet and returning more capital to shareholders, and is incremental to the $8.7 billion in share repurchase and $1.1 billion in dividends that we've returned over the past 4 years.
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow allows us to maintain our investment-grade rating and our ability to drive the growth of our business through strategic acquisitions and investments in innovation. This accelerated return of capital reflects our confidence in the growth prospects and future value of the company.
So in closing, Q2 was another solid quarter of outperformance relative to our sales and earnings expectations as we performed well on a number of measures, including revenue growth in North America as well as the Middle East. We continue to position this business for improved operating leverage and significant earnings power as we grew backlog for a third straight quarter, and we're now on target to deliver approximately $175 million in cost savings for the year.
And finally, today's announcements represent not only our conviction and the durability of our business and its earnings and cash generation potential, but the power of our platforms and another important step in accelerating growth in Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services. In aggregate, we're confident and encouraged about the future of our company and our growth strategy and the value creation we can deliver.
And I'll now turn it back over to Shep."

So with the over-performance in Q2, we remain confident on the full year and the full year outlook. With respect to gross margin, as we've talked about in the Q4 call and the Q1 call, the gross margin has been affected largely about -- around systems integration in the Services segment, predominantly related to a couple large project deployments that have been occurring, Q4, Q1. We saw a little bit of an improvement in Q2. We continue to expect Services gross margin, longer term, to be in the 35 -- mid-30 range, approximately 35%. And the product gross margin is stable, despite some currency headwinds."

So I think video is very important to what we're doing going forward. I see it is growing in importance, and I think that will be also front and center with the value proposition that we engage Silver Lake on."

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.
First, Q2 was another solid quarter. North America grew 5%, marking its third consecutive quarter of growth, and the overall business grew 2% when adjusting for foreign exchange. Operational execution continues to drive improved profitability and cash flow generation, as reflected in our double-digit growth of EPS and double-digit growth in free cash flow per share. Second, our growing backlog and strong pipeline illustrate the confidence our customers have in choosing our technology solutions. We posted a third consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth, ending the quarter with a record $6 billion of backlog and a healthy pipeline moving forward.
Third, I'm very pleased to announce that Silver Lake will make a $1 billion strategic investment in our company that we will use to further accelerate growth in our Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services. And finally, we announced our intent to commence a $2 billion tender offer, representing a significant step toward further improving our capital structure. This accelerated return of capital reflects our continued confidence in the future growth of the company.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide some additional details on Q2 before returning to provide additional context with respect to our strategic announcements made this morning."

Additionally, orders were up 11% year-on-year and ending backlog is up $624 million versus last year. GAAP operating earnings were $254 million, while non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million or 19% of sales, a 460 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.72, compared to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.68, which represents 45% year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by our cost savings and simplification initiatives. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
Products segment Q2 sales were $867 million, down 2% versus the prior year, up 1% when adjusting for currency impact. Q2 Products segment operating income was $176 million or 20.3% of sales, up $43 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $138 million versus last year and up $48 million sequentially, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarterly increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia Pacific and the Middle East. As expected, we saw a decrease in Europe backlog as we continue to deploy the Norway countrywide system.
Turning to Services. Q2 Services revenue was $501 million, down 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Services business grew 4%. Services operating income was $84 million or 16.8% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior year quarter. Lower operating expenses drove the profitability improvement. Services gross margin was 33.5%, in line with our expectations for Q2. Services backlog is $4.7 billion, up $486 million versus last year and up $125 million sequentially, as customers continue to sign long-term service contracts to upgrade, maintain and manage their networks.
Moving to operating expenses. Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $393 million, down $69 million or 15% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities as well as a stronger dollar. These reductions were significant across all categories, with the largest savings coming from G&A. As of the end of Q2, we are now on a run rate to deliver savings of approximately $175 million versus 2014. We believe our business is well-positioned to deliver solid operating leverage. Other income and expense in Q2 was $39 million, compared to $40 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 effective tax rate was approximately 35%. We continue to expect the full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $140 million, an increase of $22 million or 19% versus last year. Free cash flow was $92 million. The improvement in cash generation was primarily driven by improved profitability. We remain on track for approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow and $800 million of free cash flow for the full year. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $285 million. In Q2, we repurchased $285 million of stock at an average price of $61.63 per share, while paying out $72 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that we intend to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of our share. This is a significant step in improving the efficiency of our balance sheet, while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile and is consistent with our belief that buying back our stock represents an excellent opportunity, given our view of company value and future growth.
Turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q3 to decline 1% to 3%, which corresponds to flat to up 2%, including the impact of currency, which we expect to be approximately $50 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.68 and $0.73.
Moving to the full year. Our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant-currency terms, and we continue to expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40.
Moving on to regional results. As mentioned by Greg, our North America business continues to execute, posting the third consecutive quarter of growth at 5% for the second quarter. We expect North America to show modest growth for the full year 2015 with a healthy backlog. Latin America was down, as expected, versus tough comparables, including one large deal in the prior year as well as an expected iDEN decline. Challenging macroeconomic conditions as well as the impact of a stronger dollar continue to temper expectations for the year. The Europe & Africa region was down 15% in total, but just 2% when excluding $29 million of currency impact. We expect this region to experience headwinds of currency pressure and the nationwide Norway project transitioning from deployment to long-term managed services. Despite these near-term hurdles, we remain confident in our competitive positioning and long-term opportunities in this region.
Turning to Asia Pac. The business has stabilized, growing at 4% in constant currency. Backlog in this region is up $97 million or 16%, and our pipeline is stronger. We expect Asia Pacific to show growth in the second half of this year. Finally, our Middle East region is growing strong double digits, and backlog is up over 100% versus the year-ago quarter to $418 million. Our Public Safety LTE business continues to gain traction and attract customer interest, while our LMR business is also growing robustly.
I'd also like to share some segment highlights and key initiatives. Our product business continues to execute on innovating for customer needs with a shift toward software enablement, while also improving operational performance. This is reflected in the segment's healthy gross margin and lower OpEx, which drove strong profitability of 20.2%. An example of innovation that's driving growth and bolstering gross margin includes a major order for the newly released APX8000, which is seeing strong demand. This new radio platform integrates WiFi broadband and LMR into a single device, while also integrating 4 different radio bands to provide interoperability as well as high voice quality. By integrating WiFi, customers are able to more effectively add new features and functionality via over-the-air software loads.
Another example of innovative solution solving specific customer needs is the launch of our new line of intrinsically safe TETRA radios specifically built for hazardous working conditions found in our target verticals of oil and gas, fire and rescue, mining and airports. There are a number of proof points that illustrate operational efficiency improvements in the business resulting in lower OpEx structure. For example, we have streamlined R&D by reducing various testing labs from 19 to 5, shifted resources to lower-cost work sites, and we're on track to reduce SKUs 40% by year-end 2015.
Throughout the quarter, we won key customer deals that highlight this customer-focused innovation and software enablement such as a $12.5 million purchase by the U.S. Army for WAVE software that will be used by all the programs in the Army Program Executive Office, C3T. WAVE is our application that converts radio communication into Voice over IP, which allows a user with authorization and a voice-enabled IP device to participate in voice communications regardless of the network or device. $66 million of wins with 4 customers in the oil and gas and utility industries covering both P25 and TETRA technologies. Targeted devices with unique software features position our solutions as long-term investments for our customers.
Shifting to Services. The Services segment continues to show solid growth in constant-currency terms. Our core integration services are executing well, and we're encouraged by the opportunities underlying the key growth areas of Lifecycle Support, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety Solutions. Lifecycle Services encompasses our upgrade agreements for system refreshes and maintenance of both hardware and software. We continue to see growth and strong adoption in software maintenance agreements. Some examples of larger wins include multiyear contracts for $19 million in Hong Kong, $13 million in Québec and $8 million in Pennsylvania.
Managed Services continues to be an area of focus for growth. During Q2, we booked orders for several long-term deals, including 2 contracts totaling $68 million that span over 20 years of operations in Managed Services in Austria and a $20 million extension to an existing contract in Australia. Additionally, in Q2, we launched the North America Managed Services Network Operations Center and have since transitioned customers into that NOC, providing unmatched expertise and scale.
Other notable Smart Public Safety wins include a computer-aided dispatch contract for $14 million in the U.S. and a $9 million contract in Australia. Our Emergency CallWorks acquisition is executing well, having secured 6 new customers this quarter and helping to expand our reach into next-generation IP-based command-and-control centers. Additionally, we added a partnership with Wynyard, which, in conjunction with our acquisition of Public Engines, will enhance our Smart Public Safety offering. Finally, our Public Safety LTE efforts continue to move forward as planned. The existing deployments are on schedule, and we still expect Public Safety LTE revenue of approximately $100 million for this year.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

So in addition to a solid quarter, as we mentioned, we announced an important partnership with Silver Lake. We believe this strategic investment is an endorsement of our strategy and a strong vote of confidence in our future growth opportunities. The partnership combines Silver Lake's technology expertise and track record with our brand, market reach and public safety technology platforms around the world. This investment also matches the largest single-pipe investment that Silver Lake has ever done.
I'm pleased that Silver Lake managing partners, Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, will be appointed to the Motorola Solutions Board of Directors. They both have a history of driving growth, creating value and bringing teams together to identify and deliver unique business opportunities in the technology industry.
Today, we also announced our intention to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock. This represents an important step towards significantly improving our balance sheet and returning more capital to shareholders, and is incremental to the $8.7 billion in share repurchase and $1.1 billion in dividends that we've returned over the past 4 years. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow allows us to maintain our investment-grade rating and our ability to drive the growth of our business through strategic acquisitions and investments in innovation. This accelerated return of capital reflects our confidence in the growth prospects and future value of the company.
So in closing, Q2 was another solid quarter of outperformance relative to our sales and earnings expectations as we performed well on a number of measures, including revenue growth in North America as well as the Middle East. We continue to position this business for improved operating leverage and significant earnings power as we grew backlog for a third straight quarter, and we're now on target to deliver approximately $175 million in cost savings for the year.
And finally, today's announcements represent not only our conviction in the durability of our business and its earnings and cash generation potential, but the power of our platforms and another important step in accelerating growth in Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services. In aggregate, we're confident and encouraged about the future of our company and our growth strategy and the value creation we can deliver.
And I'll now turn it back over to Shep."

With respect to gross margin, as we talked about in the Q4 call and the Q1 call, the gross margin has been affected largely about -- around systems integration in the Services segment, predominantly related to a couple large project deployments that have been occurring, Q4, Q1. We saw a little bit of an improvement in Q2. We continue to expect Services gross margin, longer term, to be in the 35% -- mid-30% range, approximately 35%.

Approximately 1/3 of that is a result of a stronger dollar. If we look at our BGM profile, about 40% of it right now is denominated in something other than USD.

If you can just comment on the split of infrastructure versus device sales for the quarter in terms of their growth trajectory.

Doing things that we don't need to do after selling the enterprise business, getting after footprint, capacity requirement, duplication. There might be a little bit more there going forward. We'll always be prudent on looking at the cost structure.

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the third quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook.
First, Q3 was another solid quarter. The core business remains resilient in several areas. North American sales grew 5%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. And as expected, Asia Pac returned to growth with a very strong quarter while the Middle East continues to expand robustly.
Second, our operating discipline and cost initiatives are delivering excellent results. During the quarter, we generated 13% growth in operating earnings and 32% growth in our earnings per share, and we're now on track for approximately $200 million in OpEx savings for the full year 2015.
And finally, our focus on investments in managed and support services, Smart Public Safety and Public Safety LTE continue to gain momentum. Our managed and support services business grew solidly in constant currency. Our recent acquisition of Emergency CallWorks for Next Generation 9-1-1 is performing better than expected, and we're hosting new Public Safety LTE trials in every region in the world. We're encouraged about the growth opportunities these areas represent, and we'll continue to pursue new initiatives in these areas.
I'll now turn the call over the Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

On a constant-currency basis, sales grew 3%. Backlog is up $681 million versus last year. GAAP operating earnings were $231 million while non-GAAP operating earnings were $292 million. These non-GAAP earnings are 21% of sales, representing a 250 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.63 compared to $0.27 in the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.82, which represents a 32% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by our ongoing cost reduction and simplification initiatives as well as reduced share count. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
Products segment Q3 sales were $925 million, which is flat versus the prior year, but up 3% when adjusting for currency impact. Q3 product segment operating income was $221 million or 24% of sales, up $46 million versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by our cost reduction. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $171 million versus last year and up $65 million sequentially, reflecting the sixth consecutive quarterly increase. This increase was driven by North America.
Q3 services revenue was $497 million, down 3%. Excluding the impact of currency in iDEN, the services business grew 3%. Services operating income was $71 million or 14% of revenue. Lower sales volume and systems integration margin related to a few large projects were partially offset by lower OpEx. Gross margin in managed and support services as well as Smart Public Safety were up. Services backlog is $4.6 billion, up $509 million versus last year and down $69 million sequentially, inclusive of a $60 million currency revaluation. Customers continue to sign long-term services contract to upgrade, maintain and manage their networks.
Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $396 million, down $39 million or 9% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activity, including the expansion of lower-cost shared service centers that had benefited from a stronger dollar. We now expect full year OpEx to be about $1.58 billion, a $200 million reduction from the prior year.
Other income and expense in Q3 was $34 million compared to $29 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q3 effective tax rate was approximately 35%. We expect the full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $300 million, an increase of $415 million versus last year. Free cash flow was $250 million. The improvement in cash generation was primarily driven by lower pension payment and improved earnings. We remain on track for approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow and $800 million of free cash flow for the full year.
We repurchased $2.1 billion of stock and paid out $70 million in dividends during the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $2.2 billion at the end of Q3.
Moving to regional results. North America revenue grew 5%, ahead of expectations once again, underpinned by strong Product and Services growth. We posted solid growth in both state and local as well as U.S. federal business. Underlying demand remained solid for our products and services, and the pipeline and backlog remained healthy.
Latin America was down on challenging macroeconomic conditions, the impact of a stronger dollar and continued iDEN declines. While these variables were assumed in our prior outlook, the 22% decline was more than expected. The continuing rise of the dollar, particularly in the second half of the year is having a more pronounced translation impact in Brazil and transactional impact in countries where U.S.-dollar-denominated sales have resulted in large double-digit price increases to our customers.
The Europe & Africa region was down 23%. The region declined due to FX, the Norway implementation wind-down and weakness in Eastern Europe.
Moving to Asia Pac. The business returned to growth in the quarter, posting an increase of 14% and was up 24% in constant-currency terms. We expect growth in Q4 due to healthy backlog growth and a strong pipeline.
Finally, the Middle East region again grew strong double digits, and backlog is up over 100% versus the year-ago quarter to approximately $400 million.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. The product segment growth of 3% in constant currency was driven primarily by North American and Asia Pac. We also delivered meaningful profitability expansion in this segment, improving operating margins by 500 basis points. We continue to innovate, drive down costs and simplify our business processes. Some of the Q3 product highlights include: launching our digital evidence management solution, which combines our secured cloud-based, CommandCentral Vault software, with voice communication, body-worn video, voice recording and emergency alert delivered in one compact device; the recent APX 8000 digital radio launch has far exceeded initial expectations for new product revenue. This quad-band device includes advanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality, which acts as a personal area network and serves as a platform for future APX devices. Additionally, we remain on track for a 40% SKU reduction by year-end, furthering our drive for simplification.
The services segment grew 2% in constant currency and was up 3% when excluding iDEN and FX. Focus areas of managed and support services and Smart Public Safety were up in constant currency. Our recent acquisition of Emergency CallWorks, which is a converged solution for Next Generation 9-1-1 call taking that can be deployed in the cloud or on premise, continues to outperform our expectation, including several Tier 1 customer wins.
Our Public Safety LTE business continues to gain momentum. In addition to the 2 international deployments and the LA-RICS deployment, we also have multiple large trials ongoing with international police forces, testing and utilizing our unique Public Safety LTE solution. This includes interoperability between LTE and LMR networks enabled by our WAVE technology, third-party mobile application and broadband devices.
Now turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q4 to decline 6% to 8% or down 3% to 5% including the impact of currency. The weakness in Q4 is driven by incremental currency headwinds, which we now expect to be approximately $65 million and further macroeconomic weakness in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We now expect full year revenue to be down approximately 3% or up 1% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.45 and $1.50 for Q4 and $3.20 to $3.25 for the full year.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q3 was another solid quarter relative to our sales and earnings expectations as we performed well on a number of measures: revenue growth in North America, revenue growth in Asia Pac and revenue growth in the Middle East. That said, we saw increased softness and economic uncertainty in both Latin America and Eastern Europe, which are tempering our views of Q4. Second, our execution around cost savings and capital return continues to demonstrate strong results. We're on track for OpEx reductions of about $200 million this year, and we're planning on $125 million more in OpEx reductions for next year. We purchased over $2 billion of our shares during Q3, which now brings us to a reduction of nearly half of our share count just over the past 4 years. Based on these efforts, we expect to see sizable free cash flow per share, expansion as we move into 2016 and beyond. And finally, we're seeing progress in our investments in innovation. Strong initial revenues associated with the launch of the new flagship APX 8000 digital radio as well as the digital evidence management solution, which combines our secured cloud-based CommandCentral software with voice communications, body-worn video and voice recording, all in one device. This is an embodiment of the way we think about innovation and bringing together devices, software and services in a streamlined solution that meets the needs and use cases of our customer base.

So the way we think about this is we've seen incremental pressure in the second half of this year. I actually mentioned it at the conference in September. We started to see pressure in Latin America and Eastern Europe in the August-September time frame. What's happened is that it's become more pronounced. I would dimensionalize it the following way: think of it as approximately $100 million of incremental net pressure in the second half. I'd say $30 million of that is foreign exchange, Kulbinder. $50 million is further deterioration Latin America. Remember 80% of our revenues in Latin America are U.S.-denominated and about $20 million is further deterioration in Europe -- Eastern Europe, where all of our sales are U.S.-denominated. So some of this was mitigated in Q3 by the over-performance and strong performance in both North America and Asia Pac. But that's how we dimensionalize and see the pressures in the second half of the year. I think to your point around pricing, where we are U.S.-denominated and we've had that kind of pressure, we're seeing more of a price disparity with some of our portfolio. But in Q3 and Q4, we're taking action to adjust accordingly. But that's how -- that's what's happened over the second half."

Well, first of all, our view of this business, being a low to mid-single digit growth business in a normalized environment remains unchanged. I remind you that we talked about some specifics about next year. Norway revenue as that the largest project in our company's history winds down, $80 million of lower revenue in '16 versus '15. The good news to that is it's a very, very low margin revenue. So that's the good news associated with that. The second headwind is the $40 million of iDEN, as expected, next year in '16 over this year. And as of today, from a spot rate FX standpoint, we probably have about $40 million of additional FX in next year. Now when you put all those ingredients into the blender, that results in probably about $60 million of pressure in Q1. We're not going to guide, Rod, on the full year until next quarter's call, but I think it is important to note that North America, we do expect to grow in '16 at comparable levels to '15 as they've been building backlog and executing strongly and consistently throughout '15."

So we took the back end around content management, the cloud-based solution around CommandCentral Vault. Obviously, the secure communications model, where we're integrating it all into a speaker mic. First responders have too much on their belt and too much on their body. So a consolidated, integrated, encrypted, superior solution, in our view, was the way to go. Software, services and all integrated in one device. So we feel good about it, and I view it largely as incremental. It's -- I think the addressable market, I would characterize, as maybe $250 million or $350 million. And that's more restricted looking at the addressable market size of the body-worn camera.

I'd like to make a few opening comments about the third quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook.
First, Q3 was another solid quarter. The core business remains resilient in several areas. North America sales grew 5%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. And as expected, Asia Pac returned to growth with a very strong quarter, while the Middle East continues to expand robustly.
Second, our operating discipline and cost initiatives are delivering excellent results. During the quarter, we generated 13% growth in operating earnings and 32% growth in earnings per share, and we're now on track for approximately $200 million in OpEx savings for the full year 2015.
And finally, our focus on investments in managed and support services, Smart Public Safety and Public Safety LTE continue to gain momentum. Our managed and support services business grew solidly in constant currency. Our recent acquisition of Emergency CallWorks for Next Generation 9-1-1 is performing better than expected, and we're hosting new Public Safety LTE trials in every region in the world. We're encouraged about the growth opportunities these areas represent, and we'll continue to pursue new initiatives in these areas.

For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
Products segment Q3 sales were $925 million, which is flat versus the prior year but up 3% when adjusting for currency impact. Q3 Products segment operating income was $221 million or 24% of sales, up $46 million versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by our cost reduction. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $171 million versus last year and up $65 million sequentially, reflecting the sixth consecutive quarterly increase. This increase was driven by North America.
Q3 Services revenue was $497 million, down 3%. Excluding the impact of currency and iDEN, the Services business grew 3%. Services operating income was $71 million or 14% of revenue. Lower sales volume and systems integration margin related to a few large projects were partially offset by lower OpEx. Gross margin in managed and support services as well as Smart Public Safety were up. Services backlog is $4.6 billion, up $509 million versus last year and down $69 million sequentially, inclusive of a $60 million currency revaluation. Customers continue to sign long-term services contract to upgrade, maintain and manage their networks.
Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $396 million, down $39 million or 9% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities, including the expansion of lower-cost shared service centers that have benefited from a stronger dollar. We now expect full year OpEx to be about $1.58 billion, a $200 million reduction from the prior year. Other income and expense in Q3 was $34 million compared to $29 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q3 effective tax rate was approximately 35%. We expect the full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $300 million, an increase of $415 million versus last year. Free cash flow was $250 million. The improvement in cash generation was primarily driven by lower pension payment and improved earnings. We remain on track for approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow and $800 million of free cash flow for the full year.
We repurchased $2.1 billion of stock and paid out $70 million in dividends during the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $2.2 billion at the end of Q3.
Moving to regional results. North America revenue grew 5%, ahead of expectations once again, underpinned by strong Product and Services growth. We posted solid growth in both state and local as well as U.S. federal business. Underlying demand remains solid for our products and services, and the pipeline and backlog remain healthy.
Latin America was down on challenging macroeconomic conditions, the impact of a stronger dollar and continued iDEN declines. While these variables were assumed in our prior outlook, the 22% decline was more than expected. The continuing rise of the dollar, particularly in the second half of the year, is having a more pronounced translation impact in Brazil and transactional impact in countries where U.S.-dollar-denominated sales have resulted in large double-digit price increases to our customers.
The Europe & Africa region was down 23%. The region declined due to FX, the Norway implementation wind-down, and weakness in Eastern Europe.
Moving to Asia Pac. The business returned to growth in the quarter, posting an increase of 14% and was up 24% in constant-currency terms. We expect growth in Q4 due to healthy backlog growth and a strong pipeline.
Finally, the Middle East region again grew strong double digits, and backlog is up over 100% versus the year-ago quarter to approximately $400 million.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. The Products segment growth of 3% in constant currency was driven primarily by North America and Asia Pac. We also delivered meaningful profitability expansion in this segment, improving operating margins by 500 basis points. We continue to innovate, drive down costs and simplify our business processes. Some of the Q3 Product highlights include launching our digital evidence management solution, which combines our secured, cloud-based CommandCentral Vault software with voice communication, body-worn video, voice recording and emergency alert delivered in one compact device. The recent APX 8000 digital radio launch has far exceeded initial expectations for new Product revenue. This quad-band device includes advanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality, which acts as a personal area network and serves as a platform for future APX devices. Additionally, we remain on track for a 40% SKU reduction by year-end, furthering our drive for simplification.
The Services segment grew 2% in constant currency and was up 3% when excluding iDEN and FX. Focus areas of managed and support services and Smart Public Safety were up in constant currency. Our recent acquisition of Emergency CallWorks, which is a converged solution for Next Generation 9-1-1 call taking that can be deployed in the cloud or on-premise, continues to outperform our expectation, including several Tier 1 customer wins. Our Public Safety LTE business continues to gain momentum. In addition to the 2 international deployments and the LA-RICS deployment, we also have multiple large trials ongoing with international police forces, testing and utilizing our unique Public Safety LTE solution. This includes interoperability between LTE and LMR networks enabled by our WAVE technology, third-party mobile application and broadband devices.
Now turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q4 to decline 6% to 8% or down 3% to 5% including the impact of currency. The weakness in Q4 is driven by incremental currency headwinds, which we now expect to be approximately $65 million and further macroeconomic weakness in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We now expect full year revenue to be down approximately 3% or up 1% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.45 and $1.50 for Q4 and $3.20 to $3.25 for the full year.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q3 was another solid quarter relative to our sales and earnings expectations as we performed well on a number of measures: revenue growth in North America, revenue growth in Asia Pac and revenue growth in the Middle East. That said, we saw increased softness and economic uncertainty in both Latin America and Eastern Europe, which are tempering our views of Q4.
Second, our execution around cost savings and capital return continues to demonstrate strong results. We're on track for OpEx reductions of about $200 million this year, and we're planning on $125 million more in OpEx reductions for next year. We purchased over $2 billion of our shares during Q3, which now brings us to a reduction of nearly half of our share count just over the past 4 years. Based on these efforts, we expect to see sizable free cash flow per share expansion as we move into 2016 and beyond.
And finally, we're seeing progress on our investments in innovation. Strong initial revenue is associated with the launch of the new flagship APX 8000 digital radio as well as the digital evidence management solution, which combines our secured, cloud-based CommandCentral software with voice communications, body-worn video and voice recording all in one device. This is an embodiment of the way we think about innovation and bringing together devices, software and services in a streamlined solution that meets the needs and use cases of our customer base.
I'll now turn it back over to Shep."

I actually mentioned this at the Bernstein conference in September. We started to see pressure in Latin America and Eastern Europe in the August-September time frame. What's happened is it's become more pronounced. I would dimensionalize it the following way. Think of it as approximately $100 million of incremental net pressure in the second half. I'd say $30 million of that is foreign exchange, Kulbinder. $50 million is further deterioration in Latin America. Remember, 80% of our revenues in Latin America are U.S.-denominated, and about $20 million is further deterioration in Europe -- Eastern Europe, where all of our sales are U.S.-denominated. Now some of this was mitigated in Q3 by the over-performance and strong performance in both North America and Asia Pac, but that's how we dimensionalize and see the pressures in the second half of the year. I think to your point around pricing, where we are U.S.-denominated and we've had that kind of pressure, we're seeing more of a price disparity with some of our portfolio. But in Q3 and Q4, we're taking action to adjust accordingly. But that's how -- that's what's happened over the second half."

Well, first of all, I think it's important that our view of this business, being a low and -- to mid-single digit growth business in a normalized environment, remains unchanged. I remind you that we talked about some specifics about next year. Norway revenue, as the largest project in our company's history winds down, $80 million of lower revenue in '16 versus '15, the good news to that is it's a very, very low margin revenue. So that's the good news associated with that. The second headwind is the $40 million of iDEN, as expected, next year in '16 over this year. And as of today, from a spot rate FX standpoint, we probably have about $40 million of additional FX in next year. Now when you put all those ingredients into the blender, that results in probably about $60 million of pressure in Q1. We're not going to guide, Rod, on the full year until next quarter's call, but I think it is important to note that North America, we do expect to grow in '16 at comparable levels to '15 as they've been building backlog and executing strongly and consistently throughout '15."

So we took the back end around content management, the cloud-based solution around CommandCentral Vault, obviously, in a secure communications model, where we're integrating it all into a speaker mic. First responders have too much on their belt and too much on their body. So a consolidated, integrated, encrypted, superior solution, in our view, was the way to go; software, services and all integrated in one device. So we feel good about it, and I view it largely as incremental. It's -- I think the addressable market, I would characterize as maybe $250 million or $350 million.

The core",232,"Thanks, Shep, and good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to make a few opening comments about the third quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook.
First, Q3 was another solid quarter. The core business remains resilient in several areas. North America sales grew 5%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. And as expected, Asia Pac returned to growth with a very strong quarter, while the Middle East continues to expand robustly.
Second, our operating discipline and cost initiatives are delivering excellent results. During the quarter, we generated 13% growth in operating earnings and 32% growth in earnings per share, and we're now on track for approximately $200 million in OpEx savings for the full year 2015.
And finally, our focus on investments in managed and support services, Smart Public Safety and Public Safety LTE continue to gain momentum. Our managed and support services business grew solidly in constant currency. Our recent acquisition of Emergency CallWorks for Next Generation 9-1-1 is performing better than expected, and we're hosting new Public Safety LTE trials in every region in the world. We're encouraged about the growth opportunities these areas represent, and we'll continue to pursue new initiatives in these areas.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

On a constant-currency basis, sales grew 3%. Backlog is up $681 million versus last year. GAAP operating earnings were $231 million, while non-GAAP operating earnings were $292 million. These non-GAAP earnings are 21% of sales, representing a 250 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.63 compared to $0.27 in the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.82, which represents a 32% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by our ongoing cost reduction and simplification initiatives as well as reduced share count. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
Products segment Q3 sales were $925 million, which is flat versus the prior year but up 3% when adjusting for currency impact. Q3 Products segment operating income was $221 million or 24% of sales, up $46 million versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by our cost reduction. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $171 million versus last year and up $65 million sequentially, reflecting the sixth consecutive quarterly increase. This increase was driven by North America.
Q3 Services revenue was $497 million, down 3%. Excluding the impact of currency and iDEN, the Services business grew 3%. Services operating income was $71 million or 14% of revenue. Lower sales volume and systems integration margin related to a few large projects were partially offset by lower OpEx. Gross margin in managed and support services as well as Smart Public Safety were up. Services backlog is $4.6 billion, up $509 million versus last year and down $69 million sequentially, inclusive of a $60 million currency revaluation. Customers continue to sign long-term services contract to upgrade, maintain and manage their networks.
Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $396 million, down $39 million or 9% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost-reduction activities, including the expansion of lower-cost shared service centers that have benefited from a stronger dollar. We now expect full year OpEx to be about $1.58 billion, a $200 million reduction from the prior year. Other income and expense in Q3 was $34 million compared to $29 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q3 effective tax rate was approximately 35%. We expect the full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $300 million, an increase of $415 million versus last year. Free cash flow was $250 million. The improvement in cash generation was primarily driven by lower pension payment and improved earnings. We remain on track for approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow and $800 million of free cash flow for the full year.
We repurchased $2.1 billion of stock and paid out $70 million in dividends during the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $2.2 billion at the end of Q3.
Moving to regional results. North America revenue grew 5%, ahead of expectations once again, underpinned by strong Product and Services growth. We posted solid growth in both state and local as well as U.S. federal business. Underlying demand remains solid for our products and services, and the pipeline and backlog remain healthy.
Latin America was down on challenging macroeconomic conditions, the impact of a stronger dollar and continued iDEN declines. While these variables were assumed in our prior outlook, the 22% decline was more than expected. The continuing rise of the dollar, particularly in the second half of the year, is having a more pronounced translation impact in Brazil and transactional impact in countries where U.S.-dollar-denominated sales have resulted in large double-digit price increases to our customers.
The Europe & Africa region was down 23%. The region declined due to FX, the Norway implementation wind-down, and weakness in Eastern Europe.
Moving to Asia Pac. The business returned to growth in the quarter, posting an increase of 14% and was up 24% in constant-currency terms. We expect growth in Q4 due to healthy backlog growth and a strong pipeline.
Finally, the Middle East region again grew strong double digits, and backlog is up over 100% versus the year-ago quarter to approximately $400 million.
I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. The Products segment growth of 3% in constant currency was driven primarily by North America and Asia Pac. We also delivered meaningful profitability expansion in this segment, improving operating margins by 500 basis points. We continue to innovate, drive down costs and simplify our business processes. Some of the Q3 Product highlights include launching our digital evidence management solution, which combines our secured, cloud-based CommandCentral Vault software with voice communication, body-worn video, voice recording and emergency alert delivered in one compact device. The recent APX 8000 digital radio launch has far exceeded initial expectations for new Product revenue. This quad-band device includes advanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality, which acts as a personal area network and serves as a platform for future APX devices. Additionally, we remain on track for a 40% SKU reduction by year-end, furthering our drive for simplification.
The Services segment grew 2% in constant currency and was up 3% when excluding iDEN and FX. Focus areas of managed and support services and Smart Public Safety were up in constant currency. Our recent acquisition of Emergency CallWorks, which is a converged solution for Next Generation 9-1-1 call taking that can be deployed in the cloud or on-premise, continues to outperform our expectation, including several Tier 1 customer wins. Our Public Safety LTE business continues to gain momentum. In addition to the 2 international deployments and the LA-RICS deployment, we also have multiple large trials ongoing with international police forces, testing and utilizing our unique Public Safety LTE solution. This includes interoperability between LTE and LMR networks enabled by our WAVE technology, third-party mobile application and broadband devices.
Now turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q4 to decline 6% to 8% or down 3% to 5% including the impact of currency. The weakness in Q4 is driven by incremental currency headwinds, which we now expect to be approximately $65 million and further macroeconomic weakness in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We now expect full year revenue to be down approximately 3% or up 1% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.45 and $1.50 for Q4 and $3.20 to $3.25 for the full year.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q3 was another solid quarter relative to our sales and earnings expectations as we performed well on a number of measures: revenue growth in North America, revenue growth in Asia Pac and revenue growth in the Middle East. That said, we saw increased softness and economic uncertainty in both Latin America and Eastern Europe, which are tempering our views of Q4.
Second, our execution around cost savings and capital return continues to demonstrate strong results. We're on track for OpEx reductions of about $200 million this year, and we're planning on $125 million more in OpEx reductions for next year. We purchased over $2 billion of our shares during Q3, which now brings us to a reduction of nearly half of our share count just over the past 4 years. Based on these efforts, we expect to see sizable free cash flow per share expansion as we move into 2016 and beyond.
And finally, we're seeing progress on our investments in innovation. Strong initial revenue is associated with the launch of the new flagship APX 8000 digital radio as well as the digital evidence management solution, which combines our secured, cloud-based CommandCentral software with voice communications, body-worn video and voice recording all in one device. This is an embodiment of the way we think about innovation and bringing together devices, software and services in a streamlined solution that meets the needs and use cases of our customer base.

Because I look at the exposures you have to South America and Eastern Europe, and they're not massive in terms of the overall revenues.

I actually mentioned this at the Bernstein conference in September. We started to see pressure in Latin America and Eastern Europe in the August-September time frame. What's happened is it's become more pronounced. I would dimensionalize it the following way. Think of it as approximately $100 million of incremental net pressure in the second half. I'd say $30 million of that is foreign exchange, Kulbinder. $50 million is further deterioration in Latin America. Remember, 80% of our revenues in Latin America are U.S.-denominated, and about $20 million is further deterioration in Europe -- Eastern Europe, where all of our sales are U.S.-denominated. Now some of this was mitigated in Q3 by the over-performance and strong performance in both North America and Asia Pac, but that's how we dimensionalize and see the pressures in the second half of the year. I think to your point around pricing, where we are U.S.-denominated and we've had that kind of pressure, we're seeing more of a price disparity with some of our portfolio. But in Q3 and Q4, we're taking action to adjust accordingly. But that's how -- that's what's happened over the second half."

Well, first of all, I think it's important that our view of this business, being a low and -- to mid-single digit growth business in a normalized environment, remains unchanged. I remind you that we talked about some specifics about next year. Norway revenue, as the largest project in our company's history winds down, $80 million of lower revenue in '16 versus '15, the good news to that is it's a very, very low margin revenue. So that's the good news associated with that. The second headwind is the $40 million of iDEN, as expected, next year in '16 over this year. And as of today, from a spot rate FX standpoint, we probably have about $40 million of additional FX in next year. Now when you put all those ingredients into the blender, that results in probably about $60 million of pressure in Q1. We're not going to guide, Rod, on the full year until next quarter's call, but I think it is important to note that North America, we do expect to grow in '16 at comparable levels to '15 as they've been building backlog and executing strongly and consistently throughout '15."

So we took the back end around content management, the cloud-based solution around CommandCentral Vault, obviously, in a secure communications model, where we're integrating it all into a speaker mic. First responders have too much on their belt and too much on their body. So a consolidated, integrated, encrypted, superior solution, in our view, was the way to go; software, services and all integrated in one device. So we feel good about it, and I view it largely as incremental. It's -- I think the addressable market, I would characterize as maybe $250 million or $350 million. And that's more restricted, looking at the addressable market size of the body-worn camera.

And then when I look at the last couple of years, you've had like a very strong seasonality into year-end, like a very strong Q4. And that was a fairly new seasonal pattern.

If I take North America specifically, even though they're having -- they will -- we're not anticipating growth for North America in Q4, in part to your point. That's on a very strong comp a year ago, and North America is performing exactly as we expect it. Actually, so is Asia Pac. But North America for the full year '15, it's actually performed stronger than we expected for the first 3 quarters. They're growing backlog and building backlog along the way.
