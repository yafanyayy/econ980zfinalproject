122917,283511438,770381,"salesforce.com, inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks very much, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We had a monster quarter and it was just a great finish to yet another year of exceptional growth and customer success. First, before I get into this, I just want to c",1201,"Okay. Thanks very much, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We had a monster quarter and it was just a great finish to yet another year of exceptional growth and customer success. 
First, before I get into this, I just want to congratulate all our 15,000 Salesforce employees for just an amazing year. Our quarter -- you just look at this year after delivering more than $5 billion annual revenue. We're guiding now to a $6 billion annual revenue run rate in the next quarter. So this is the fastest software company to reach $5 billion. And in 90 days, we're going to be on the phone with you talking about that we're the fastest software company to reach $6 billion. 
And if you can look at our deferred revenue and $9 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, you can just straight line out. My dream is crystal-clear to be the first soft -- first one and fastest to $10 billion. First in the cloud, fastest to $10 billion in software and then onward. Now I'd like to share the results from our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2015.
You can see revenue for the fourth quarter has -- rose at 26% from 1 year ago to more than $1.4 billion. For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 32% to nearly $5.4 billion. That is just an awesome result for the year. No other software company of our size and scale is growing at this double-digit rate. And you can see all the single-digit growers in enterprise software who think that they are competitors where they're just not able to take advantage of this opportunity. 
Deferred revenue grew 32% year-over-year to more than $3.3 billion. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, as I said, is now more than $9 billion. There's no better predictor of our future revenue than looking at those numbers.
And as we delivered this phenomenal pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 175 basis points, exceeding our guidance, and you're going to hear our commitment to continue that incredible momentum. 
So we're not just focused on the top line and growing the top line. As we've been talking about for more than 1 year now, we're also focused on growing the bottom line as well. This translated into another excellent year in operating cash. We delivered more than $1 billion -- $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. That's up 34% year-over-year, and we're the first cloud computing company to deliver more than $1 billion in operating cash flow.
Looking to fiscal 2016. We are delighted to be raising our guidance to $6.52 billion as the high end of our range, and while we are pleased to exceed our non-GAAP operating margin guidance last year, we're committed to improving non-GAAP operating margin moving forward. And once again, we expect to deliver an additional 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement despite this foreign exchange headwind that everybody is going through and to deliver another year of strong operating cash flow.
Okay. So here we are salesforce.com, now the sixth largest software company, the #1 cloud computing company in the world. Very unique in the industry. We've got a complete, trusted Customer Success Platform built over the ground up for cloud, the social, mobile and data science world. And with 6 world-class apps, that is we have 6 engines for growth. Of course, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Marketing Cloud, our Community Cloud, our new Wave Analytics platform and our app development environment with Force.com and Heroku. It's one unified Customer Success Platform delivered on our trusted enterprise environment.
I couldn't be more excited about how all of our clouds are doing. I think that if you look to what I'm most excited about, it's got to be our newest cloud, the Analytics Cloud, just 120 days old. This is off to an incredible fast start of any product in our history. And I've never seen anything like it. 
I saw the new version of it, that's coming out in Dreamforce in September, yesterday. That completely took me aback. I haven't seen technology like this delivered in the analytics industry. Salesforce is crossing over from a CRM industry into the analytics industry with this product. It's an app development environment. It's mobile. It's built for everyone. I use it. All of our employees can use it. You can ask any of our employees for demonstration of it. It's really just an awesome product, and I've never seen a product take off with the speed and velocity that this product is selling. 
And of course, I have to just mention our Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation of everything we do has become the #1 platform developing this enterprise cloud apps. And I guess, what I love about that ecosystem that surrounds this whole company of more than 2 million developers, more than 2,600 apps, installed more than 2.8 million times through our AppExchange. And you look at another 4 million apps now in our Heroku platform. This company is so much more than our 6 apps. It's really our ecosystem that is the -- continues to fuel our growth. And the company has done a fantastic job building a platform, not an application.
Now we've delivered 177 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, that's up 68% from a year ago. You can see our usage rates are soaring. Customers are using our product more aggressively than ever before. That's an average of nearly 3 billion enterprise transactions every single business day. That's unprecedented in enterprise -- in enterprise technology. No other enterprise cloud platform comes close to that. 
And I have to mention our foundation. They are doing a fantastic job. We've added more than 4,000 nonprofits in higher education organizations managed by them, bringing the total to more than 24,000 nonprofits and NGOs that are using Salesforce. Also we have delivered over $19 million [ph] in grants, bringing our total foundation grants to $80 million. And our employees have volunteered 262,000 hours this year, bringing our total to 840,000 hours of volunteering, and we're getting ready to break to that 1 million hours of volunteering because it something I'm extremely proud of. So great work of all of our employees, and we're not only doing well but we're doing good. 
It's just an incredible year for Salesforce. I want to congratulate the entire company. Fortune Magazine just said we're the Most Admired Software Company in the world. Again, that's the third year in the row. The Most Admired Software Company. Forbes Magazine says we're the Most Innovative Company in the World. Forbes has said that now 4 years in a row. Most Admired and Most Innovative. And I couldn't be more excited about our future. 
Looking forward to seeing you all next week at the Morgan Stanley conference. And if you have an opportunity to see us at any of our events or programs. This quarter, we are going to be all over the world. how many events are we doing in Q1?"

And I want to congratu",1274,"Thanks, Marc. There's a lot of great things to say about this quarter, but the thing I'd like to say is how proud I really am about our performance in FY '15 and really the outstanding work that I saw in the quarter and in the year. And I want to congratulate, as Marc said, just an incredibly high-performing team, a super high-performing team, once again for their, I would call, sustained excellence. 
As far as how we ended the year, suffice to say that we fired another shot across the bow to the legacy antiquated on-premise software companies and our competition. And Marc, you just said this and I absolutely agree, it was an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year. It And Q4 was a cap stone to this outstanding year. 
So this was a year in FY '15 that we saw customers not only embracing but evangelizing our vision for the Customer Success Platform. And more and more CEOs, CEOs, which is incredible, are realizing how Salesforce can help drive growth and customer success. And I will tell you, they are incredible, incredible advocates for us. And that's one of the big reasons why we signed more large deals in fiscal 2015 than in any year in the history of the company.
So for fiscal 2015, we closed nearly 550 7- and 8-figure transactions, that's roughly 100 more than was last year. And not only is the number of large transactions getting bigger, but the value of the transactions is increasing. In fact, the number of 8-figure transactions in fiscal 2015 increased by 33% from a year ago. So no other cloud computing is closing transactions like these of this size and this scale and this volume. The execution by our teams to achieve these results have been simply just simply phenomenal. 
So we've been talking about this for a while. It's very clear to me that our customers want a more meaningful relationship with Salesforce. They're not just buying a single cloud, they are betting their businesses on our vision. And we are absolutely executing at scale in every region across every segment and in every major industry. 
And as our relationships are only getting stronger and more strategic, I'm going to take some examples, share some examples with you I think you'd be excited about. ABB, Time Warner, Merck, all amazing companies and they're all betting their businesses on us. 
And I'll start with one of the leading CPG companies in the world. They've been using Salesforce to great success globally. After speaking with them at Dreamforce, it was pretty clear we shared a vision for transforming the future. In Q4, I'm happy to say we strengthened our partnership with closing one of the largest deals that we've ever done in the consumer packaged goods industry. 
And for the first time, they plan to bring together their entire sales and customer support teams onto 1 platform, our Customer Success Platform with our Service Cloud. And what's really interesting about this is that we're helping them connect their front office and their legacy back office supply chain systems, giving them a very seamless experience. So we are moving from an integration perspective into legacy system supply chains. I don't know if anybody would've thought of Salesforce that way in the past. 
ABB. We talked about them before. They're a $40 billion leader in power and automation technologies, another great example in Q4. Marc and I met with their CEO in last month. We talked about how his industry is transforming and where he wants to take the company. As part of that transformation, he's placing Salesforce at the center of his strategy to help drive top line growth. So in the quarter, ABB decided to replace more than a dozen legacy CRM systems worldwide with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. It was a great win against both SAP and Microsoft.
Time Warner Cable, again, another great brand. Very strategic win in the quarter. They've been leveraging our Service Cloud and our Salesforce1 platform to drive their mobile strategy. In Q4, they also selected the Analytics Cloud. Marc talked about that and how excited we are. And it will give Time Warner Cable an unbelievable opportunity to have powerful insights across their enterprise. 
As Marc said earlier, there's enormous enthusiasm for Analytics Cloud. It's every CEO's dream to put analytics in the hands of every employee. And it's important to note our Analytics product is integrated right into our platform. That means that customers can connect any data set whether it's SAP, Oracle, Microsoft or any other legacy technology right into the metadata layer of the Salesforce Platform. 
I will tell you in my entire career, I've never seen so much enthusiasm from our customers for a solution like this or our partners, a complete CRM and analytics platform with an open ecosystem built natively for the cloud, very exciting. People are really excited about this. 
Another great story is Merck in Germany. Another very excited customer expansion in the quarter for our team. They've been a Sales Cloud customer for many years. Recently, they wanted to accelerate innovation across their geographies and their businesses. So this quarter, they expanded with Service Cloud, with Salesforce1 Platform and again Analytics Cloud. And it really is enabling to build custom applications collaboration across their R&D departments and again drive insights across their company and oh by the way, right in SAP's backyard.
I'm also pleased to continue to see our traction across our industry strategy, particularly in financial services. And again, this is all about speaking the language of the customer. In fact, this quarter, we significantly expanded our relationship with one of the largest U.S. financial services firms. It is a premier company that's using the Customer Success Platform to make their sales teams and their wealth managers wildly more effective in their customers. 
So those are just a few of the wins in the quarter. There were many more at Amtrak and Boston Scientific, Fujitsu, Home Depot, Ingersoll Rand, LinkedIn, MassMutual, Pearson, the Royal Bank of Canada, state of Colorado and the list goes on and on. So I have to tell you I'm very, very proud of the team and the progress that they've made and the level of trust that they're establishing with our customers. 
We also saw great momentum in our business globally. We accelerated our investments in Europe and Asia this year, adding more distribution capacity and expanding our partner ecosystem. We opened up a U.K. data center, and we'll have 2 more to follow in Germany and France as well. And it's obvious that our international investments are clearly paying off. We saw remarkable deal growth internationally. 
And I want to say 1 word about our partners. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have the largest cloud ecosystem in the world. And the largest that we did this quarter, in fact, was the signing global agreement with one of the world's top software companies. And not only will they be using our solutions to run their business, but they're also moving their products to the cloud with Salesforce, which is very, very exciting. So stay tuned for more of that. 
So we're incredibly well positioned for the future. We're well underway to becoming the most strategic in the technology company in the industry. And again, I want to thank everyone at Salesforce for delivering an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year and I'd like to thank our customers and our partners and our employees for their continued commitment to us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
122917,283511438,770381,"salesforce.com, inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year as he just called out. We delivered on all our key financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased wit",925,"Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year as he just called out. We delivered on all our key financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased with the results. 
On today's call, I'll be focusing my commentary on 2 key [ph] topics related to our results detailed in our earnings release. As you know, we continue to see significant moves in foreign exchange rates, which impacted both our top line and bottom line results for the fourth quarter and the full year. 
From a top line perspective, we delivered a Q4 constant currency revenue growth of 29% year-over-year, excluding the headwind of approximately $34 million. Sequentially, we saw a headwind of $21 million, and for the full year, revenue was up 33%, excluding an FX headwind of $32 million. Not only does FX impact revenue in aggregate, it also affects revenue by cloud, with a disproportionate impact as specific clouds. 
For example, Sales Cloud is the most widely distributed product with the most international exposure relative to other products, and therefore, the FX has a more pronounced impact on those results. Conversely, revenue from Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange. 
On the topic of international, we had another strong quarter and year in our geographies, with constant currency growth in EMEA of more than 30% and Asia Pac of more than 25%. Now dollar conversion for the fourth quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, remained between 9% and 10%. 
From a bottom line perspective, we expanded full year non-GAAP operating margins by 175 basis points over last year, coming in ahead of our prior guidance. We also increased full year non-GAAP EPS by nearly 50% year-over-year. We were pleased to exceed our operating margin and EPS goals during the year, even as we [indiscernible] the RelateIQ acquisition. This is a great result as we drive more discipline and efficiency throughout the company while continuing to invest in innovations of that our customers have come to expect. This margin increase contributed to a record level of operating cash flow as we delivered nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015, up 34% over last year. 
CapEx as a percent of revenue for the full year was approximately 5% and was principally related to leasehold improvement, and to a lesser extent, new data center buildouts. With CapEx at the low end of guidance, free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $883 million for the full year, up 53% from last year.
Now looking in deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter, with growth of 32% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $67 million, deferred revenue grew 35% over last year. FX also reduced revenue sequentially -- deferred revenue sequentially by approximately $44 million. 
It's worth noting that the deferred revenue benefited from a couple of items. First is the integrated [indiscernible]. In the quarter, 85% of the value of subscription and [indiscernible] invoices were issued with annual terms. This is up 4 percentage points over last year and was more than anticipated frankly. 
Second, we saw a slight benefit from Marketing Cloud contract renewals that were written down as part of the normal purchase accounting related to ExactTarget, which has now been [indiscernible] so that was a slight benefit. 
Moving on to guidance. While we delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2015, we continue to face an increasingly difficult foreign exchange environment. Since November, the dollar has continued to appreciate against most of the major currencies. As a result, we now anticipate an incremental $50 million of FX headwinds for a total of $175 million to $200 million in FY '16. 
Keep in mind that we have more international revenue pressure that we do expense but Therefore, FX also has an impact on operating margin, which we expect will cause 25 to 50 basis points of headwinds in FY '16. Despite these FX headwinds, our great results and momentum allows to raise our fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance. 
We now anticipate revenue to be $6.475 billion to $6.520 billion. And we also plan on increasing our non-GAAP operating margins by an additional 125 to 150 basis points this year. As a result, we anticipate full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes that will continue be a net expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate will be 36.5% and no significant M&A activity. 
We anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 22% to 23% and CapEx to be roughly 5% and 7% of revenue. For Q1, we anticipate revenue of $1.485 billion to $1.505 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.14 and deferred revenue growth in the mid- to high 20% range. 
To close, despite significant FX headwinds, we delivered very strong fiscal 2015 results with revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow growth of more than 30% while expanding our non-GAAP operating margins. 
Very few software companies have a leadership position in 1 product category, let alone in multiple product categories. With our world-class Customer Success Platform, we are well positioned to continue our industry-leading growth in FY '16. Also we expect to continue to improve non-GAAP operating margins consistent with the framework we laid out at the Analyst Day. 
At this point, I'd also like to thank our Salesforce team for helping deliver an amazing result. It's just inspiring to me. With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

I, of course, saw your commentary about reaching $5 billion in revenue faster than any other software enterprise company and aspiring to be the fastest to reach $10 billion. And meanwhile, there are so many signs of accelerating momentum looking through the billings growth, the deferred revenue growth, the Service Cloud growth, the platform growth. They're all actually accelerating and those markets are very large. So I'm wondering if the current offerings can carry you to $10 billion or even $15 billion in revenue. And if you have ever sketched out a path to a level beyond that, what else do you think could logically fit into the portfolio? And perhaps is it possible you would define e-commerce as a part of a CRM stack at some point?"

You really don't have to go any farther than looking at our book business on and off the balance sheet at $9 billion to ask yourself the question, ""Are we going to $10 billion?"" I mean, $10 billion will be fueled primarily by that. I can tell you more or less where will be 1 year from now or even 2 years from now because you can kind of look at deferred. We don't do that because there can be changes in foreign exchange, there can be changes in other characteristics of the business. But if you look back now, Salesforce has been a public company for over 10 years. You can see how our deferred model has played out with kind of a consistent revenue growth. Even through 2008 or even through dark times. The deferred continue to pay out onto the top line. So I don't think the question is about are we -- certainly might dream to get to $10 billion. In my mind, there's no question that, that's going to happen. I think it's all about where we are going beyond that. And as we cross through that threshold, what are the different and capabilities where we have to invest to make that happen. I'm very excited about the transformations and changes and shifts that the company's investing in data science and analytics. In the next idea that it's not just about the cloud, social or mobile anymore. It's also about fueling the analytical corporation, fueling the analytical CEO. I thought that had a fantastic article in Fortune Magazine this month on the analytical business and what that means. And we want to fuel that. We want to fuel that kind of capability that gives our customers not just world-class execution in sales, in service, in marketing, in community. We want to give them the ability to have analytics platforms, analytics app, analytics ecosystems that fuel that future. And that's, I think, our biggest most exciting revenue opportunity going forward. The CRM market is big and exciting and has fueled us and will continue to fuel us. The analytics market is just as big and just as exciting. I think some will say the analytics market is bigger than the CRM market. And our initial indications of that are that, that's true, and that's why we're investing. And I couldn't be more excited about the analytics cloud in our Wave platform."

So listen, we're very excited about our industry strategy and it takes many flavors. I think the reason why the company continues to get such traction with these enterprise customers and really customers of any size and any geography is because when we talk to these customers, we are speaking the language of the customer. So that's kind of point number one. We are focused really on 6 industries right now. And all that is equipping our folks with the solutions and the messages that our customer's really demanding and asking for so we're listening to our customers. And we will be making some announcements shortly about some exciting stuff that we're doing with products or other industries. But we also only go back to a point that Marc made about our AppExchange and our ecosystem, we have the largest ecosystem in the world for the cloud. And we are driving incredible success with a number of our ISVs who have taken our platform because they obviously have confidence in their platform. And they're building their solutions around industries. We signed up some pretty strategic partnerships this fiscal year. We continue to do it. You look at the statistics on our AppExchange, several of those are also vertically oriented, so we are really driving industry messaging into the marketplace, whether it's our own industry messaging, our organic products, the highly configurable cloud solutions that we have, whether it's our AppExchange and our ISVs and our ecosystem, this really resonates with customers and this is something that people never had. They never had a -- they were not, as you know, they were not a platform company. They were never in a position where they could drive an ecosystem medical extensions believe they are able to do it, so we're getting a lot of traction, and we're really excited."

And the spirit of the question is the FSA market is a double-digit market [indiscernible] has been that way, projected to be that way for long periods of time. We have not only done well in that market that's a double-digit growing market, but we've also took share for consistently. And so that's what happened historically.

We've got, over the years and certainly in the quarter, we've done some wonderful work with some of the best brands in the best companies in the world like 3M and ABB, Time Warner mentioned obviously. And some of these I could not mention before by name. But we're just many, many examples of us doing an incredible job building more and more traction and becoming more meaningful. And I have to tell you, part of this comes from the opportunity for us to really unshackle either legacy SAP environments or have -- give customers the opportunity to transform their business model because they've really been shackled by legacy technology for years. And with this absolute convergence of cloud and social and mobile, it really gets gives us an opportunity to talk about what our Customer Success Platform can do for them generally speaking. I mean, Marc and I had the opportunity to spend some time with Brian Moynihan in Davos. And we talked about how is transforming business, and those are the types of meaningful relationships that we're really talking about here, so I can we are very excited about what's going on.

In the fourth quarter, which was the first quarter that we've sold the Wave analytics cloud, we saw a lot of very large transactions, probably the very largest transactions that happened in the analytics industry happened on our platform. And we were really taken aback by that. We've decided to focus with a dedicated distribution personnel this fiscal year because of that. We've also made very significant investment and upgrade in the number of people working on the product. And this is the real deal. I mean, we really have a world-class product on our hands. And in our minds, the way we think is we only want to focus on those multibillion-dollar opportunities or as we call them, clouds. And there's just no doubt in our mind that this is -- has all the makings of that. And of course, we keep track of [indiscernible] we're doing.

And when I look at some of the names that closed in the fourth quarter on the analytics cloud, the one that I love that I profiled at Dreamforce, which is GE Capital, you get and watch that video that's on YouTube. I mean, what they say is true. You just can't run your business without this product. This is just 1 -- this is the greatest product, I think Salesforce has ever built. And it's just going transform the way our customers run their business, not just run their sales service and marketing. I mean, this is a enterprise-wide, enterprise grade capability to fuel the analytical corporation. And it's not just an app, it's a platform robust ecosystem. It's got every characteristic that we like to make our bookings and revenues happen in our largest and most important customers. And to that end, it's not just enterprise and very large enterprise deals. It's also, yes, departmental deals. It's even deals in nonprofit NGOs.

And first thing is you look at our competitors and their work in customer service area, number one, Oracle. They bought right now. They have their own Fusion service product. They took Fusion, they turned it into confusion. Oracle keeps saying they're growing more quickly than anyone else in the cloud. Well, that's very easy to do when you're starting at 0. And Service Cloud from Oracle, that's a great example. This is not a multibillion-dollar business for Oracle like it is for us. They have not been able to execute. They don't have a multi-tenant shared scalable mobile, social, integrated analytics customer Service Cloud. And then move onto SAP, they will just come into customer and say, ""Just use Hana."" And it's like but for what and how and unload the software into your company. First of all, I think the number one thing about this customer service revolution that's going on and why Service Cloud is delivering phenomenal results is the traditional keepers of the customer service information for these customers, Oracle and SAP, have just not delivered. And we have. We have a very clear vision that we want to transform how our customers not only grow their top line with our Sales Cloud, which we've done unbelievably well, and you can see it in the multiple billions of dollars. But now, we have this second huge multibillion dollar growth engine with Service Cloud, and our competitors have not been able to execute. They just don't have -- they're delivering new versions when our customers want new visions. And that is where we are right now in the customer service marketplace and why Gartner says we have the #1 customer service product. But anyway, Keith maybe you can tell us, you're out there everyday selling that product with customers. What's your perspective?"

Keith and I have been talking a lot about that. Because in this quarter, what Keith and I were really struck by is and all of our very largest transactions, we were not dealing with the CIO in the company or the head of Sales or the head of Service or the head of Marketing. We were dealing with the Chief Executive Officer in the company. And that was a huge shock to us. We really, either Keith or I in our careers going back now to a couple of decades, we have not really seen ourselves showing up in the CEO office. And Keith mentioned one and I'll just come back to this, which is here's an example of a great company, which is a $43 billion German manufacturer called ABB. And ABB is a great company. They're a very diversified provider of industrial steel, energy products and other products. And when ABB did the transaction with us, the CEO was personally involved. And they wanted to issued a press release and issue a statement about the strategic nature of the transaction, which we did, which was a very strong 8-digit, very healthy transaction. But it was really all about the strategic capability of the -- of what ABB's doing with us. What's interesting about the deal was Salesforce and ABB is a huge Microsoft customer. I think they've got 40,000 or 50,000 seats of Microsoft. I mean, it's just amazing what Microsoft has done on the account. And Salesforce and Microsoft went in hand-in-hand and showed Office 365 deeply integrated with Salesforce's services. And we have built a variety of very exciting verticals type functionality into Office 365 using Force.com and our different clouds and automating their business processes. And ABB really has this vision of real-time customer collaboration. But it's all driven by the CEO, okay? And that is a shock to us. And we looked at big deals we did this quarter, whether it was General Electric or Coke or others, okay? The CEO is involved with us. So that's just very exciting. And I think that, that is a big change in how our implementations are viewed. We have seen that in Home Depot. We have seen that, of course, at Cisco. We have seen that in -- but we're really seeing it in all of the biggest transactions. Keith, you want to talk about that?"

And our message is all about growth so there's a natural synergy there. And when we have talked to these customers, the -- ABB is a classic example, Marc mentioned it. But there are timeless examples, whether it's financial services institutions. Again, we talked about Bank of America earlier. It really is about solving a customer problem. It's speaking a language of the industry, and it's not about 1 Sales Cloud, 1 Service Cloud, it's about a Customer Success Platform and it's a platform discussion. And again, it fits the growth agenda. So that's why CEOs seem to be getting more and more involved in these. If I go back to the example that I gave earlier in the call about the strategic agreement that we signed in the quarter, that was a CEO agenda. That's all about growth. So I think the what the star and the moon are all aligned here as it relates to the agenda of the CEO and what's our messaging is all about, and it's showing up in our results."

Thanks very much, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We had a monster quarter and it was just a great finish to yet another year of exceptional growth and customer success.First, before I get into this, I just want to co",1201,"Okay. Thanks very much, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We had a monster quarter and it was just a great finish to yet another year of exceptional growth and customer success.
First, before I get into this, I just want to congratulate all our 15,000 Salesforce employees for just an amazing year. Our quarter -- you just look at this year after delivering more than $5 billion annual revenue, we're guiding now to a $6 billion annual revenue run rate in the next quarter. So this is the fastest software company to reach $5 billion. And in 90 days, we're going to be on the phone with you talking about that we're the fastest software company to reach $6 billion.
And if you can look at our deferred revenue and $9 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, you can just straight line out. My dream is crystal-clear to be the first soft -- first one and fastest to $10 billion. First in the cloud, fastest to $10 billion in software and then onward. Now I'd like to share the results from our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2015.
You can see revenue for the fourth quarter has -- rose at 26% from 1 year ago to more than $1.4 billion. For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 32% to nearly $5.4 billion. That is just an awesome result for the year. No other software company of our size and scale is growing at this double-digit rate. And you can see all the single-digit growers in enterprise software who think that they are our competitors where they're just not able to take advantage of this opportunity.
Deferred revenue grew 32% year-over-year to more than $3.3 billion. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, as I said, is now more than $9 billion. There's no better predictor of our future revenue than looking at those numbers.
And as we delivered this phenomenal pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 175 basis points, exceeding our guidance, and you're going to hear our commitment to continue that incredible momentum.
So we're not just focused on the top line and growing the top line. As we've been talking about for more than 1 year now, we're also focused on growing the bottom line as well. This translated into another excellent year in operating cash. We delivered more than $1 billion -- $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. That's up 34% year-over-year, and we're the first cloud computing company to deliver more than $1 billion in operating cash flow.
Looking to fiscal 2016. We are delighted to be raising our guidance to $6.52 billion at the high end of our range, and while we're pleased to exceed our non-GAAP operating margin guidance last year, we're committed to improving non-GAAP operating margin moving forward. And once again, we expect to deliver an additional 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement despite this foreign exchange headwind that everybody is going through and to deliver another year of strong operating cash flow.
Okay. So here we are, salesforce.com, now the sixth largest software company in the world, the #1 cloud computing company in the world. Very unique in the industry. And we've got a complete, trusted Customer Success Platform built from the ground up for cloud, the social, mobile and data science world. And with 6 world-class apps, that is we have 6 engines for growth. Of course, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Marketing Cloud, our Community Cloud, our new Wave Analytics platform and our app development environment with Force.com and Heroku. It's one unified Customer Success Platform delivered on our trusted enterprise environment.
I couldn't be more excited about how all of our clouds are doing. I think that if you look to what I'm most excited about, it's got to be our newest cloud, the Analytics Cloud, just 120 days old. This is off to an incredibly fast start of any product in our history. And I've never seen anything like it.
I saw the new version of it, that's coming out at Dreamforce in September, yesterday. That completely took me aback. I haven't seen technology like this delivered in the analytics industry. Salesforce is crossing over from a CRM industry into the analytics industry with this product. It's an app development environment. It's mobile. It's built for everyone. I use it. All of our employees can use it. You can ask any of our employees for demonstration of it. It's really just an awesome product, and I've never seen a product take off with the speed and velocity that this product is selling.
And of course, I have to just mention our Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation of everything we do, has become the #1 platform developing enterprise cloud apps. And I guess, what I love about that ecosystem that surrounds this whole company of more than 2 million developers, more than 2,600 apps, installed more than 2.8 million times through our AppExchange, and you look at another 4 million apps now in our Heroku platform, this company is so much more than our 6 apps. It's really our ecosystem that is -- continues to fuel our growth. And the company has done a fantastic job building a platform, not an application.
Now we've delivered 177 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, that's up 68% from a year ago. You can see our usage rates are soaring. Customers are using our product more aggressively than ever before. That's an average of nearly 3 billion enterprise transactions every single business day. That's unprecedented in enterprise -- in enterprise technology. No other enterprise cloud platform comes close to that.
And I have to mention our foundation. They are doing a fantastic job. We've added more than 4,000 nonprofits in higher education organizations managed by them, bringing the total to more than 24,000 nonprofits and NGOs that are using Salesforce. Also, we have delivered over $19 million in grants, bringing our total foundation grants to $80 million. And our employees have volunteered 262,000 hours this year, bringing our total to 840,000 hours volunteered, and we're getting ready to break through that 1 million hours of volunteering which is something I'm extremely proud of. So great work of all of our employees. We're not only doing well but we're doing good.
It's just an incredible year for Salesforce. I want to congratulate the entire company. Fortune Magazine just said we're the most admired software company in the world. Again, that's the third year in a row, the most admired software company. Forbes Magazine says we're the most innovative company in the world. Forbes has said that now 4 years in a row. Most admired and most innovative. And I couldn't be more excited about our future.
Looking forward to seeing you all next week at the Morgan Stanley conference. And if you have an opportunity to see us at any of our events or programs. This quarter, we are going to be all over the world. Liz, how many events are we doing in Q1?"

There's a lot of great things to say about this quarter, but the thing I'd like to say is how proud I really am about our performance in FY '15 and really the outstanding work that I saw in the quarter and in the year. And I want to congratulate, as Marc said, just an incredibly high-performing team, a super high-performing team, once again for their, I would call, sustained excellence.
As far as how we ended the year, suffice to say that we fired another shot across the bow to the legacy antiquated on-premise software companies and our competition. And Marc, you just said this and I absolutely agree, it was an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year. And Q4 was a capstone to this outstanding year.
So this was a year in FY '15 that we saw customers not only embracing but evangelizing our vision for the Customer Success Platform. And more and more CEOs, CEOs, which is incredible, are realizing how Salesforce can help drive growth and customer success. And I will tell you, they are incredible, incredible advocates for us. And that's one of the big reasons why we signed more large deals in fiscal 2015 than in any year in the history of the company.
So for fiscal 2015, we closed nearly 550 7- and 8-figure transactions, that's roughly 100 more than last year. And not only is the number of large transactions getting bigger, but the value of the transactions is increasing. In fact, the number of 8-figure transactions in fiscal 2015 increased by 33% from a year ago. So no other cloud computing is closing transactions like these of this size and this scale and this volume. The execution by our teams to achieve these results have been simply, just simply phenomenal.
So we've been talking about this for a while. It's very clear to me that our customers want a more meaningful relationship with Salesforce. They're not just buying a single cloud, they are betting their businesses on our vision. And we are absolutely executing at scale in every region across every segment and in every major industry.
And as our relationships are only getting stronger and more strategic, I'm going to take some examples, share some examples with you I think you'd be excited about. ABB, Time Warner, Merck, all amazing companies and they're all betting their businesses on us.
And I'll start with one of the leading CPG companies in the world. They've been using Salesforce to great success globally. After speaking with them at Dreamforce, it was pretty clear we shared a vision for transforming the future. In Q4, I'm happy to say we strengthened our partnership, we've closed one of the largest deals that we've ever done in the consumer packaged goods industry.
And for the first time, they plan to bring together their entire sales and customer support teams onto 1 platform, our Customer Success Platform with our Service Cloud. And what's really interesting about this is that we're helping them connect their front office and their legacy back office supply chain systems, giving them a very seamless experience. So we are moving from an integration perspective into legacy system supply chains. I don't know if anybody would ever thought of Salesforce that way in the past.
ABB. We've talked about them before. They're a $40 billion leader in power and automation technologies, another great example in Q4. Marc and I met with their CEO in Davos last month. We talked about how his industry is transforming and where he wants to take the company. As part of that transformation, he's placing Salesforce at the center of his strategy to help drive top line growth. So in the quarter, ABB decided to replace more than a dozen legacy CRM systems worldwide with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. It was a great win against both SAP and Microsoft.
Time Warner Cable, again, another great brand. Very strategic win in the quarter. They've been leveraging our Service Cloud and our Salesforce1 platform to drive their mobile strategy. In Q4, they also selected the Analytics Cloud. Marc talked about that and how excited we are. And it will give Time Warner Cable an unbelievable opportunity to have powerful insights across their enterprise.
As Marc said earlier, there's enormous enthusiasm for Analytics Cloud. It's every CEO's dream to put analytics in the hands of every employee. And it's important to note that our Analytics product is integrated right into our platform. That means that customers can connect any data set whether it's SAP, Oracle, Microsoft or any other legacy technology right into the metadata layer of the Salesforce Platform.
I will tell you in my entire career, I've never seen so much enthusiasm from our customers for a solution like this or our partners, a complete CRM and analytics platform with an open ecosystem built natively for the cloud, very exciting. People are really excited about this.
Another great story is Merck in Germany. Another very excited customer expansion in the quarter for our team. They've been a Sales Cloud customer for many years. Recently, they wanted to accelerate innovation across their geographies and their businesses. So this quarter, they expanded with Service Cloud, with Salesforce1 Platform and again Analytics Cloud. And it really is enabling to build custom applications, live collaboration across their R&D departments and again drive insights across their company and oh, by the way, right in SAP's backyard.
I'm also pleased to continue to see our traction across our industry strategy, particularly in financial services. And again, this is all about speaking the language of the customer. In fact, this quarter, we've significantly expanded our relationship with one of the largest U.S. financial services firms. It is a premier company that's using the Customer Success Platform to make their sales teams and their wealth managers wildly more effective with their customers.
So those are just a few of the wins in the quarter. There were many more at Amtrak and Boston Scientific, Fujitsu, Home Depot, Ingersoll Rand, LinkedIn, MassMutual, Pearson, the Royal Bank of Canada, the state of Colorado and the list goes on and on. So I have to tell you I'm very, very proud of the team and the progress that they've made and the level of trust that they're establishing with their customers.
We also saw great momentum in our business globally. We accelerated our investments in Europe and Asia this year, adding more distribution capacity and expanding our partner ecosystem. We opened up a U.K. data center, and we'll have 2 more to follow in Germany and France as well. And it's obvious that our international investments are clearly paying off. We saw remarkable deal growth internationally.
And I want to say one word about our partners. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have the largest cloud ecosystem in the world. And the largest that we did this quarter, in fact, was the signing of global agreement with one of the world's top software companies. And not only will they be using our solutions to run their business, but they're also moving their products to the cloud with Salesforce, which is very, very exciting. So stay tuned for more of that.
So we are incredibly well positioned for the future. We're well underway to becoming the most strategic and influential technology company in the industry. And again, I want to thank everyone at Salesforce for delivering an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year, and I'd like to thank our customers and our partners and our employees for their continued commitment to us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
122917,283511438,770533,"salesforce.com, inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year, as he just called out. We delivered on all our key financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased wi",930,"Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year, as he just called out. We delivered on all our key financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased with the results.
On today's call, I'll be focusing my commentary on a few key topics related to our results, detailed in our earnings release. As you know, we continue to see significant movements in foreign exchange rates, which impacted both our top line and bottom line results for the fourth quarter and the full year.
From a top line perspective, we delivered a Q4 constant currency revenue growth of 29% year-over-year, excluding the headwind of approximately $34 million. Sequentially, we saw a headwind of $21 million, and for the full year, revenue was up 33%, excluding an FX headwind of $32 million. Not only does FX impact revenue in aggregate, it also affects revenue by cloud, with a disproportionate impact at specific clouds.
For example, Sales Cloud is the most widely distributed product with the most international exposure relative to other products, and therefore, the FX has a more pronounced impact on those results. Conversely, revenue from Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange.
On the topic of international, we had another strong quarter and year in our geographies, with constant currency growth in EMEA of more than 30% and Asia Pac of more than 25%. Now dollar conversion for the fourth quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, remained between 9% and 10%.
From a bottom line perspective, we expanded full year non-GAAP operating margins by 175 basis points over last year, coming in ahead of our prior guidance. We also increased full year non-GAAP EPS by nearly 50% year-over-year. We were pleased to exceed our operating margin and EPS goals during the year, even as we absorb the RelateIQ acquisition. This is a great result as we drive more discipline and efficiency throughout the company while continuing to invest in innovations that our customers have come to expect. This margin increase contributed to a record level of operating cash flow as we delivered nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015, up 34% over last year.
CapEx as a percent of revenue for the full year was approximately 5% and was principally related to leasehold improvement and, to a lesser extent, new data center buildouts. With CapEx at the low end of guidance, free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $883 million for the full year, up 53% from last year.
Now looking in deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter, with growth of 32% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $67 million, deferred revenue grew 35% over last year. FX also reduced revenue sequentially -- deferred revenue sequentially by approximately $44 million.
It's worth noting that the deferred revenue benefited from a couple of items. First is the integrated -- or the invoice duration. In this quarter, 85% of the value of subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms. This is up 4 percentage points over last year and was more than we anticipated, frankly.
Second, we saw a slight benefit from Marketing Cloud contract renewals that were written down as part of the normal purchase accounting related to ExactTarget, which has now been re-invoiced so there's a slight benefit.
Moving on to guidance. While we delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2015, we continue to face an increasingly difficult foreign exchange environment. Since November, the dollar has continued to appreciate against most of the major currencies. As a result, we now anticipate an incremental $50 million of FX headwinds for a total of $175 million to $200 million in FY '16.
Keep in mind that we have more international revenue pressure than we do expense relief. Therefore, FX also has an impact on operating margin, which we expect will cause 25 to 50 basis points of headwinds in FY '16. Despite these FX headwinds, our great results and momentum allow us to raise our fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance.
We now anticipate revenue to be $6.475 billion to $6.520 billion. And we also plan on increasing our non-GAAP operating margins by an additional 125 to 150 basis points this year. As a result, we anticipate full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes that OI&E will continue be a net expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate will be 36.5% and no significant M&A activity.
We anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 22% to 23% and CapEx to be roughly 5% to 7% of revenue. For Q1, we anticipate revenue of $1.485 billion to $1.505 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.14 and deferred revenue growth in the mid- to high 20% range.
To close, despite significant FX headwinds, we delivered very strong fiscal 2015 results with revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow growth of more than 30% while expanding our non-GAAP operating margins.
Very few software companies have a leadership position in 1 product category, let alone in multiple product categories. With our world-class Customer Success Platform, we are well positioned to continue our industry-leading growth in FY '16. Also, we expect to continue to improve non-GAAP operating margins consistent with the framework we laid out at the Analyst Day.
At this point, I'd also like to thank our Salesforce team for helping deliver an amazing result. It's just inspiring to me. With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

I, of course, saw your commentary about reaching $5 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company and aspiring to be the fastest to reach $10 billion. And meanwhile, there are so many signs of accelerating momentum looking through the billings growth, the deferred revenue growth, the Service Cloud growth, the platform growth. They're all actually accelerating and those markets are very large. So I'm wondering if the current offerings can carry you to $10 billion or even $15 billion in revenue. And if you have ever sketched out a path to a level beyond that, what else do you think could logically fit into the portfolio? And perhaps is it possible you would define e-commerce as a part of a CRM stack at some point?"

And I think, you really don't have to go any farther than looking at our booked business on and off the balance sheet at $9 billion to ask yourself the question, ""Are we going to $10 billion?"" I mean, $10 billion will be fueled primarily by that. I can tell you more or less where revenue will be 1 year from now or even 2 years from now because you can kind of look at deferred. We don't do that because there can be changes in foreign exchange, there can be changes in other characteristics of the business. But if you look back now, Salesforce has been a public company for over 10 years. You can see how our deferred model has played out with kind of a consistent revenue growth. Even through 2008 or even through dark times, the deferred continue to pay out onto the top line. So I don't think the question is about are we -- certainly you might dream to get to $10 billion. In my mind, there's no question that, that's going to happen. I think it's all about where are we going beyond that. And as we cross through that threshold, what are the different clouds and capabilities where we have to invest to make that happen. I'm very excited about the transformations and changes and shifts that the company's investing in, in data science, in analytics, in the next idea that it's not just about the cloud, social or mobile anymore. It's also about fueling the analytical corporation, fueling the analytical CEO. I thought that [indiscernible] had a fantastic article in Fortune Magazine this month on the analytical business and what that means. And we want to fuel that. We want to fuel that kind of capability that gives our customers not just world-class execution in sales, in service, in marketing, in community. We want to give them the ability to have analytics platforms, analytics apps, analytics ecosystems that fuel that future. And that's, I think, our biggest, most exciting revenue opportunity going forward. The CRM market is big and exciting and has fueled us and will continue to fuel us. The analytics market is just as big and just as exciting. I think some will say the analytics market is bigger than the CRM market. And our initial indications of that are that, that's true, and that's why we're investing. And I couldn't be more excited about the analytics cloud and our Wave platform."

As I recall, Siebel Systems had about 22 verticals that they addressed. And right now, you guys kind of have only 1 or so vertical. And also maybe for Mark Hawkins. On the sequential increase in the Sales Cloud, I heard your comments on FX. It looks like it was up only about 1% sequentially. But even if I assume that's flat and take that on the first year-over-year number we're going to have, which is April, it's still about 10%. So is it fair to assume that when we start getting the numbers, year-over-year numbers, that Sales Cloud still is going to be, on a constant currency basis, a double-digit growth business?"

So listen, we're very excited about our industry strategy and it takes many flavors. I think the reason why the company continues to get such traction with these enterprise customers and really customers of any size, any geography, is because when we talk to these customers, we are speaking the language of the customer. So that's kind of point number one. We are focused really on 6 industries right now. And all of that is equipping our folks with the solutions and the messages that our customers' really demanding and asking for so we're listening to our customers. And we will be making some announcements shortly about some exciting stuff that we're doing with products or other industries. But we also -- let me go back to a point that Marc made about our AppExchange and our ecosystem, we have the largest ecosystem in the world for the cloud. And we are driving incredible success with a number of our ISVs who have taken our platform because they obviously have confidence in our platform. And they're building their solutions around industries. We signed up some pretty strategic partnerships this fiscal year. We continue to do it. You look at the statistics on our AppExchange, several of those are also vertically oriented. So we are really driving industry messaging into the marketplace, whether it's our own industry messaging, our organic products, the highly configurable cloud solutions that we have, whether it's our AppExchange and our ISVs and our ecosystem, this really resonates with customers. And this is something that people never had. They never had a -- they were -- as you know, they were not a platform company. They were never in a position where they could drive an ecosystem with vertical expansions the way that we're able to do it, so we're getting a lot of traction and we're really excited."

And I'm looking forward that at the end of Q1, we'll be able to see the year-on-year and, of course, you will see that with all the dynamics that are going on there, including whatever degree of foreign exchange is there. But I think I can get to the spirit of the question that you're asking. And the spirit of the question is the SFA market is a double-digit market, according to Gartner, it's been that way -- projected to be that way for long periods of time. We have not only done well in that market, that's a double-digit growing market, but we've also took share for the last decade consistently. And so that's what happened historically. We don't guide by cloud, that's a very attractive market as Marc had talked about. And we'll know -- you'll be able to see a lot more when we anniversary the actual revenue by cloud. I hope that helps, Rick."

I think first of all, I think that the numbers were astounding, we're incredibly proud. I'm certainly proud of the work that the team has done. And I think it has proved positive about the relationships that we're building strategically with these customers. You don't do these types of deals at scale in volume unless you are successfully getting mind share, building those great relationships. We've got -- over the year and certainly in the quarter, we've done some wonderful work with some of the best brands and the best companies in the world like 3M and ABB, Time Warner, I mentioned obviously. And some of these that I could not mention before by name. But they're just many, many examples of us doing an incredible job building more and more traction and becoming more meaningful. And I have to tell you, part of this comes from the opportunity for us to really unshackle either legacy SAP environments or have -- give customers the opportunity to transform their business models because they've really been shackled by legacy technology for years. And with this absolute convergence of cloud and social and mobile, it really gives us an opportunity to talk about what our Customer Success Platform can do for them generally speaking. I mean, Marc and I had the opportunity to spend some time with Brian Moynihan in Davos. And we talked about how BofA is transforming their business. And so those are the types of meaningful relationships that we're really talking about here. So again, we're very excited about what's going on.

In the fourth quarter, which was the first quarter that we've sold the Wave analytics cloud, we saw a lot of very large transactions, probably the very largest transactions that happened in the analytics industry happened on our platform. And we were really taken aback by that. We've decided to focus with a dedicated distribution personnel this fiscal year because of that. We've also made a very significant investment and upgrade in the number of people working on the product. And this is the real deal. I mean, we really have a world-class product on our hands. And in our minds or the way we think is we only want to focus on those multibillion-dollar opportunities or as we call them, clouds. And there's just no doubt in our mind that this is -- has all the makings of that. And of course, we keep track of what all the start-ups are doing. And we're very friendly with them and they were part of our ecosystem or attend our trade shows. They cannot even -- their bookings can't even compare to what our team did in the fourth quarter. So very excited about that. And when I look at some of the names that closed in the fourth quarter on the analytics cloud, the one that I love that I profiled at Dreamforce, which is GE Capital, and if you get and watch that video that's on YouTube, I mean, what they say is true. You just can't run your business without this product. This is just 1 -- this is the greatest product I think Salesforce has ever built. And it's going to just transform the way our customers run their business, not just run their sales, service and marketing. I mean, this is a enterprise-wide, enterprise-grade capability to fuel the analytical corporation. And it's not just an app, it's a platform, it's going to have a robust ecosystem. It's got every characteristic that we like to make our bookings and revenues happen in our largest and most important customers. And to that end, it's not just enterprise and very large enterprise deals. It's also, yes, departmental deals. It's even deals with nonprofits, NGOs. I mean, it's amazing the democratic nature of the pipeline and deal flow already. Do you want to talk about any of the deals that you've closed in the fourth quarter on the analytics cloud?"

And the first thing is you look at our competitors and their work in customer service area, number one, Oracle. They bought right now. They have their own Fusion service product. They took Fusion, they turned it into confusion. Oracle keeps saying they're growing more quickly than anyone else in the cloud. Well, that's very easy to do when you're starting at 0. And Service Cloud from Oracle, that's a great example. This is not a multibillion-dollar business for Oracle like it is for us. They have not been able to execute. They don't have a multi-tenant shared, scalable mobile, social, integrated with analytics customer service cloud. And then move onto SAP, they will just come into the customer and say, ""Just use HANA."" And it's like but, for what, and how and unload the software into your company. First of all, I think the number one thing about this customer service revolution that's going on and why Service Cloud is delivering phenomenal results is the traditional keepers of the customer service information for these customers, Oracle and SAP, have just not delivered. And we have. We have a very clear vision that we want to transform how our customers not only grow their top line with our Sales Cloud, which we've done unbelievably well, and you can see it in multiple billions of dollars. But now, we have this second huge multibillion dollar growth engine with Service Cloud, and our competitors have not been able to execute. They just don't have -- they're delivering new versions when our customers want new visions. And that is where we are right now in the customer service marketplace and why Gartner says we have the #1 customer service product.

Keith and I have been talking a lot about that because, in this quarter, what Keith and I were really struck by is, in all of our very largest transactions, we were not dealing with the CIO in the company or the head of sales or the head of service or the head of marketing, we were dealing with the Chief Executive Officer in the company. And that was a huge shock to us. We really, either Keith or I in our careers, going back now to a couple of decades, we have not really seen ourselves showing up in the CEO office. And Keith mentioned one, and I'll just come back to this, which is here's an example of a great company, which is a $43 billion German manufacturer called ABB. And ABB is a great company. They're a very diversified provider of industrial scale energy products and other products. And when ABB did the transaction with us, the CEO was personally involved. And they wanted to issued a press release and issue a statement about the strategic nature of the transaction which we did, which was a very strong 8-digit, very healthy transaction. But it was really all about the strategic capability of the -- of what ABB's doing with us. What's interesting about the deal was Salesforce -- and ABB is a huge Microsoft customer. I think they've got 40,000 or 50,000 seats of Microsoft. I mean it's just amazing what Microsoft has done on the account. And Salesforce and Microsoft went in hand-in-hand and showed Office 365 deeply integrated with Salesforce's services. And we have built a variety of very exciting vertical type functionality in the Office 365 using Force.com and our different clouds and automating their business processes. And ABB really has this vision of real-time customer collaboration. But it's all driven by the CEO, okay? And that is a shock to us. And we looked at big deals we did this quarter, whether it was General Electric or Coke or others, okay, the CEO is involved with us. So that's just very exciting. And I think that, that is a big change in how our implementations are viewed. We have seen that in Home Depot. We have seen that, of course, at Cisco. We have seen that in -- but we're really seeing it in all the biggest transactions. Keith, do you want to talk about that?"

But there are countless examples, whether it's financial services institutions. Again, we talked about Bank of America earlier, it really is about solving a customer problem, it's speaking the language of industry and it's not about 1 Sales Cloud, 1 Service Cloud, it's about a Customer Success Platform, and it's a platform discussion. And again, it fits the growth agenda. So that's why CEOs seem to be getting more and more involved in these. If I go back to the example that I gave earlier in the call about the strategic agreement that we signed in the quarter, that was a CEO agenda. That's all about growth. So I think the star and the moon are all aligned here as it relates to the agenda of the CEO and what our messaging is all about, and it's showing up in our results."

I think the guidance, when you look at the revenue, 20% to 21%, which is the implied guidance here for the revenue growth in U.S. dollars plus a headwind that we talked about at $175 million to $200 million, and you quickly get a sense of what the constant currency growth rate is. You can see that snaps right in to our revenue margin framework. I think the operating margin to expand that 125 to 150, again after a year that we've just exceeded at 175 plus the old headwind of 25 to 50 basis points due to foreign exchange is right in the exact zip code of where we want to be. We feel like it's excellent balance in terms of the top line that Marc talked about, the bottom line that we talked about. And the cash flows stacks in there nicely as well with the growth rates. So we feel really good about where that lines up, and the revenue margin framework is very much something we embrace."

And they have the influence with their clients and we are very aligned around customer engagement in our customer platform and growth strategies for customers. The early returns from these firms are very -- they're very, very excited about what the Analytics Cloud is all about. So that's a natural play for them because they can wrap some incredibly high value-add services around our offering.

Thanks very much, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We had a monster quarter and it was just a great finish to yet another year of exceptional growth and customer success.
First, before I get into this, I just want to congratulate all our 15,000 Salesforce employees for just an amazing year. Our quarter -- you just look at this year after delivering more than $5 billion annual revenue, we're guiding now to a $6 billion annual revenue run rate in the next quarter. So this is the fastest software company to reach $5 billion. And in 90 days, we're going to be on the phone with you talking about that we're the fastest software company to reach $6 billion.
And if you can look at our deferred revenue and $9 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, you can just straight line out. My dream is crystal-clear to be the first soft -- first one and fastest to $10 billion. First in the cloud, fastest to $10 billion in software and then onward. Now I'd like to share the results from our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2015.
You can see revenue for the fourth quarter has -- rose at 26% from 1 year ago to more than $1.4 billion. For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 32% to nearly $5.4 billion. That is just an awesome result for the year. No other software company of our size and scale is growing at this double-digit rate. And you can see all the single-digit growers in enterprise software who think that they are our competitors where they're just not able to take advantage of this opportunity.
Deferred revenue grew 32% year-over-year to more than $3.3 billion. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, as I said, is now more than $9 billion. There's no better predictor of our future revenue than looking at those numbers.
And as we delivered this phenomenal pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 175 basis points, exceeding our guidance, and you're going to hear our commitment to continue that incredible momentum.
So we're not just focused on the top line and growing the top line. As we've been talking about for more than 1 year now, we're also focused on growing the bottom line as well. This translated into another excellent year in operating cash. We delivered more than $1 billion -- $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. That's up 34% year-over-year, and we're the first cloud computing company to deliver more than $1 billion in operating cash flow.
Looking to fiscal 2016. We are delighted to be raising our guidance to $6.52 billion at the high end of our range, and while we're pleased to exceed our non-GAAP operating margin guidance last year, we're committed to improving non-GAAP operating margin moving forward. And once again, we expect to deliver an additional 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement despite this foreign exchange headwind that everybody is going through and to deliver another year of strong operating cash flow.
Okay. So here we are, salesforce.com, now the sixth largest software company in the world, the #1 cloud computing company in the world. Very unique in the industry. And we've got a complete, trusted Customer Success Platform built from the ground up for cloud, the social, mobile and data science world. And with 6 world-class apps, that is we have 6 engines for growth. Of course, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Marketing Cloud, our Community Cloud, our new Wave Analytics platform and our app development environment with Force.com and Heroku. It's one unified Customer Success Platform delivered on our trusted enterprise environment.
I couldn't be more excited about how all of our clouds are doing. I think that if you look to what I'm most excited about, it's got to be our newest cloud, the Analytics Cloud, just 120 days old. This is off to an incredibly fast start of any product in our history. And I've never seen anything like it.
I saw the new version of it, that's coming out at Dreamforce in September, yesterday. That completely took me aback. I haven't seen technology like this delivered in the analytics industry. Salesforce is crossing over from a CRM industry into the analytics industry with this product. It's an app development environment. It's mobile. It's built for everyone. I use it. All of our employees can use it. You can ask any of our employees for demonstration of it. It's really just an awesome product, and I've never seen a product take off with the speed and velocity that this product is selling.
And of course, I have to just mention our Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation of everything we do, has become the #1 platform developing enterprise cloud apps. And I guess what I love about that ecosystem that surrounds this whole company of more than 2 million developers, more than 2,600 apps, installed more than 2.8 million times through our AppExchange, and you look at another 4 million apps now in our Heroku platform, this company is so much more than our 6 apps. It's really our ecosystem that is -- continues to fuel our growth. And the company has done a fantastic job building a platform, not an application.
Now we've delivered 177 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, that's up 68% from a year ago. You can see our usage rates are soaring. Customers are using our product more aggressively than ever before. That's an average of nearly 3 billion enterprise transactions every single business day. That's unprecedented in enterprise -- in enterprise technology. No other enterprise cloud platform comes close to that.
And I have to mention our foundation. They are doing a fantastic job. We've added more than 4,000 nonprofits in higher education organizations managed by them, bringing the total to more than 24,000 nonprofits and NGOs that are using Salesforce. Also, we have delivered over $19 million in grants, bringing our total foundation grants to $80 million. And our employees have volunteered 262,000 hours this year, bringing our total to 840,000 hours volunteered, and we're getting ready to break through that 1 million hours of volunteering which is something I'm extremely proud of. So great work of all of our employees. We're not only doing well but we're doing good.
It's just an incredible year for Salesforce. I want to congratulate the entire company. Fortune Magazine just said we're the most admired software company in the world. Again, that's the third year in a row, the most admired software company. Forbes Magazine says we're the most innovative company in the world. Forbes has said that now 4 years in a row. Most admired and most innovative. And I couldn't be more excited about our future.
Looking forward to seeing you all next week at the Morgan Stanley conference. And if you have an opportunity to see us at any of our events or programs. This quarter, we are going to be all over the world. Liz, how many events are we doing in Q1?"

There's a lot of great things to say about this quarter, but the thing I'd like to say is how proud I really am about our performance in FY '15 and really the outstanding work that I saw in the quarter and in the year. And I want to congratulate, as Marc said, just an incredibly high-performing team, a super high-performing team, once again for their, I would call, sustained excellence.
As far as how we ended the year, suffice to say that we fired another shot across the bow to the legacy antiquated on-premise software companies and our competition. And Marc, you just said this and I absolutely agree, it was an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year. And Q4 was a capstone to this outstanding year.
So this was a year in FY '15 that we saw customers not only embracing but evangelizing our vision for the Customer Success Platform. And more and more CEOs, CEOs, which is incredible, are realizing how Salesforce can help drive growth and customer success. And I will tell you, they are incredible, incredible advocates for us. And that's one of the big reasons why we signed more large deals in fiscal 2015 than in any year in the history of the company.
So for fiscal 2015, we closed nearly 550 7- and 8-figure transactions, that's roughly 100 more than last year. And not only is the number of large transactions getting bigger, but the value of the transactions is increasing. In fact, the number of 8-figure transactions in fiscal 2015 increased by 33% from a year ago. So no other cloud computing is closing transactions like these of this size and this scale and this volume. The execution by our teams to achieve these results have been simply, just simply phenomenal.
So we've been talking about this for a while. It's very clear to me that our customers want a more meaningful relationship with Salesforce. They're not just buying a single cloud, they are betting their businesses on our vision. And we are absolutely executing at scale in every region across every segment and in every major industry.
And as our relationships are only getting stronger and more strategic, I'm going to take some examples, share some examples with you I think you'd be excited about. ABB, Time Warner, Merck, all amazing companies and they're all betting their businesses on us.
And I'll start with one of the leading CPG companies in the world. They've been using Salesforce to great success globally. After speaking with them at Dreamforce, it was pretty clear we shared a vision for transforming the future. In Q4, I'm happy to say we strengthened our partnership, we've closed one of the largest deals that we've ever done in the consumer packaged goods industry.
And for the first time, they plan to bring together their entire sales and customer support teams onto 1 platform, our Customer Success Platform with our Service Cloud. And what's really interesting about this is that we're helping them connect their front office and their legacy back office supply chain systems, giving them a very seamless experience. So we are moving from an integration perspective into legacy system supply chains. I don't know if anybody would ever thought of Salesforce that way in the past.
ABB. We've talked about them before. They're a $40 billion leader in power and automation technologies, another great example in Q4. Marc and I met with their CEO in Davos last month. We talked about how his industry is transforming and where he wants to take the company. As part of that transformation, he's placing Salesforce at the center of his strategy to help drive top line growth. So in the quarter, ABB decided to replace more than a dozen legacy CRM systems worldwide with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. It was a great win against both SAP and Microsoft.
Time Warner Cable, again, another great brand. Very strategic win in the quarter. They've been leveraging our Service Cloud and our Salesforce1 platform to drive their mobile strategy. In Q4, they also selected the Analytics Cloud. Marc talked about that and how excited we are. And it will give Time Warner Cable an unbelievable opportunity to have powerful insights across their enterprise.
As Marc said earlier, there's enormous enthusiasm for Analytics Cloud. It's every CEO's dream to put analytics in the hands of every employee. And it's important to note that our Analytics product is integrated right into our platform. That means that customers can connect any data set whether it's SAP, Oracle, Microsoft or any other legacy technology right into the metadata layer of the Salesforce Platform.
I will tell you in my entire career, I've never seen so much enthusiasm from our customers for a solution like this or our partners, a complete CRM and analytics platform with an open ecosystem built natively for the cloud, very exciting. People are really excited about this.
Another great story is Merck in Germany. Another very excited customer expansion in the quarter for our team. They've been a Sales Cloud customer for many years. Recently, they wanted to accelerate innovation across their geographies and their businesses. So this quarter, they expanded with Service Cloud, with Salesforce1 Platform and again Analytics Cloud. And it really is enabling to build custom applications, provide collaboration across their R&D departments and again drive insights across their company and oh, by the way, right in SAP's backyard.
I'm also pleased to continue to see our traction across our industry strategy, particularly in financial services. And again, this is all about speaking the language of the customer. In fact, this quarter, we've significantly expanded our relationship with one of the largest U.S. financial services firms. It is a premier company that's using the Customer Success Platform to make their sales teams and their wealth managers wildly more effective with their customers.
So those are just a few of the wins in the quarter. There were many more at Amtrak and Boston Scientific, Fujitsu, Home Depot, Ingersoll Rand, LinkedIn, Lixil, MassMutual, Pearson, the Royal Bank of Canada, the state of Colorado and the list goes on and on. So I have to tell you I'm very, very proud of the team and the progress that they've made and the level of trust that they're establishing with their customers.
We also saw great momentum in our business globally. We accelerated our investments in Europe and Asia this year, adding more distribution capacity and expanding our partner ecosystem. We opened up a U.K. data center, and we'll have 2 more to follow in Germany and France as well. And it's obvious that our international investments are clearly paying off. We saw remarkable deal growth internationally.
And I want to say one word about our partners. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have the largest cloud ecosystem in the world. And the largest deal we did this quarter, in fact, was the signing of global agreement with one of the world's top software companies. And not only will they be using our solutions to run their business, but they're also moving their products to the cloud with Salesforce, which is very, very exciting. So stay tuned for more of that.
So we are incredibly well positioned for the future. We're well underway to becoming the most strategic and influential technology company in the industry. And again, I want to thank everyone at Salesforce for delivering an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year, and I'd like to thank our customers and our partners and our employees for their continued commitment to us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
122917,283511438,770591,"salesforce.com, inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year, as he just called out. We delivered on all our key financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased wi",931,"Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year, as he just called out. We delivered on all our key financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased with the results.
On today's call, I'll be focusing my commentary on a few key topics related to our results, detailed in our earnings release. As you know, we continue to see significant movements in foreign exchange rates, which impacted both our top line and bottom line results for the fourth quarter and the full year.
From a top line perspective, we delivered a Q4 constant currency revenue growth of 29% year-over-year, excluding the headwind of approximately $34 million. Sequentially, we saw a headwind of $21 million, and for the full year, revenue was up 33%, excluding an FX headwind of $32 million. Not only does FX impact revenue in aggregate, it also affects revenue by cloud, with a disproportionate impact at specific clouds.
For example, Sales Cloud is the most widely distributed product with the most international exposure relative to other products, and therefore, the FX has a more pronounced impact on those results. Conversely, revenue from Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange.
On the topic of international, we had another strong quarter and year in our geographies, with constant currency growth in EMEA of more than 30% and Asia Pac of more than 25%. Now dollar attrition for the fourth quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, remained between 9% and 10%.
From a bottom line perspective, we expanded full year non-GAAP operating margins by 175 basis points over last year, coming in ahead of our prior guidance. We also increased full year non-GAAP EPS by nearly 50% year-over-year. We were pleased to exceed our operating margin and EPS goals during the year, even as we absorb the RelateIQ acquisition. This is a great result as we drive more discipline and efficiency throughout the company while continuing to invest in innovations that our customers have come to expect. This margin increase contributed to a record level of operating cash flow as we delivered nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015, up 34% over last year.
CapEx as a percent of revenue for the full year was approximately 5% and was principally related to leasehold improvement and, to a lesser extent, new data center buildouts. With CapEx at the low end of guidance, free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $883 million for the full year, up 53% from last year.
Now looking in deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter, with growth of 32% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $67 million, deferred revenue grew 35% over last year. FX also reduced revenue sequentially -- deferred revenue sequentially by approximately $44 million.
It's worth noting that the deferred revenue benefited from a couple of items. First is the integrated -- or the invoice duration. In this quarter, 85% of the value of subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms. This is up 4 percentage points over last year and was more than we anticipated, frankly.
Second, we saw a slight benefit from Marketing Cloud contract renewals that were written down as part of the normal purchase accounting related to ExactTarget, which has now been re-invoiced so there's a slight benefit.
Moving on to guidance. While we delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2015, we continue to face an increasingly difficult foreign exchange environment. Since November, the dollar has continued to appreciate against most of the major currencies. As a result, we now anticipate an incremental $50 million of FX headwinds for a total of $175 million to $200 million in FY '16.
Keep in mind that we have more international revenue pressure than we do expense relief. Therefore, FX also has an impact on operating margin, which we expect will cause 25 to 50 basis points of headwinds in FY '16. Despite these FX headwinds, our great results and momentum allow us to raise our fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance.
We now anticipate revenue to be $6.475 billion to $6.520 billion. And we also plan on increasing our non-GAAP operating margins by an additional 125 to 150 basis points this year. As a result, we anticipate full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes that OI&E will continue to be a net expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate will be 36.5% and no significant M&A activity.
We anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 22% to 23% and CapEx to be roughly 5% to 7% of revenue. For Q1, we anticipate revenue of $1.485 billion to $1.505 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.14 and deferred revenue growth in the mid- to high 20% range.
To close, despite significant FX headwinds, we delivered very strong fiscal 2015 results with revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow growth of more than 30% while expanding our non-GAAP operating margins.
Very few software companies have a leadership position in 1 product category, let alone in multiple product categories. With our world-class Customer Success Platform, we are well positioned to continue our industry-leading growth in FY '16. Also, we expect to continue to improve non-GAAP operating margins consistent with the framework we laid out at the Analyst Day.
At this point, I'd also like to thank our Salesforce team for helping deliver an amazing result. It's just inspiring to me. With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

I, of course, saw your commentary about reaching $5 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company and aspiring to be the fastest to reach $10 billion. And meanwhile, there are so many signs of accelerating momentum looking through the billings growth, the deferred revenue growth, the Service Cloud growth, the platform growth. They're all actually accelerating and those markets are very large. So I'm wondering if the current offerings can carry you to $10 billion or even $15 billion in revenue. And if you have ever sketched out a path to a level beyond that, what else do you think could logically fit into the portfolio? And perhaps is it possible you would define e-commerce as a part of a CRM stack at some point?"

And I think, you really don't have to go any farther than looking at our booked business on and off the balance sheet at $9 billion to ask yourself the question, ""Are we going to $10 billion?"" I mean, $10 billion will be fueled primarily by that. I can tell you more or less where revenue will be 1 year from now or even 2 years from now because you can kind of look at deferred. We don't do that because there can be changes in foreign exchange, there can be changes in other characteristics of the business. But if you look back now, Salesforce has been a public company for over 10 years. You can see how our deferred model has played out with kind of a consistent revenue growth. Even through 2008 or even through dark times, the deferred continue to pay out onto the top line. So I don't think the question is about are we -- certainly you might dream to get to $10 billion. In my mind, there's no question that, that's going to happen. I think it's all about where are we going beyond that. And as we cross through that threshold, what are the different clouds and capabilities where we have to invest to make that happen. I'm very excited about the transformations and changes and shifts that the company's investing in, in data science, in analytics, in the next idea that it's not just about the cloud, social or mobile anymore. It's also about fueling the analytical corporation, fueling the analytical CEO. I thought that [indiscernible] had a fantastic article in Fortune Magazine this month on the analytical business and what that means. And we want to fuel that. We want to fuel that kind of capability that gives our customers not just world-class execution in sales, in service, in marketing, in community. We want to give them the ability to have analytics platforms, analytics apps, analytics ecosystems that fuel that future. And that's, I think, our biggest, most exciting revenue opportunity going forward. The CRM market is big and exciting and has fueled us and will continue to fuel us. The analytics market is just as big and just as exciting. I think some will say the analytics market is bigger than the CRM market. And our initial indications of that are that, that's true, and that's why we're investing. And I couldn't be more excited about the analytics cloud and our Wave platform."

On the sequential increase in the Sales Cloud, I heard your comments on FX. It looks like it was up only about 1% sequentially. But even if I assume that's flat and take that on the first year-over-year number we're going to have, which is April, it's still about 10%. So is it fair to assume that when we start getting the numbers, year-over-year numbers, that Sales Cloud still is going to be, on a constant currency basis, a double-digit growth business?"

So listen, we're very excited about our industry strategy and it takes many flavors. I think the reason why the company continues to get such traction with these enterprise customers and really customers of any size, any geography, is because when we talk to these customers, we are speaking the language of the customer. So that's kind of point number one. We are focused really on 6 industries right now. And all of that is equipping our folks with the solutions and the messages that our customers' really demanding and asking for so we're listening to our customers. And we will be making some announcements shortly about some exciting stuff that we're doing with products around our industries. But we also -- let me go back to a point that Marc made about our AppExchange and our ecosystem, we have the largest ecosystem in the world for the cloud. And we are driving incredible success with a number of our ISVs who have taken our platform because they obviously have confidence in our platform. And they're building their solutions around industries. We signed up some pretty strategic partnerships this fiscal year. We continue to do it. You look at the statistics on our AppExchange, several of those are also vertically oriented. So we are really driving industry messaging into the marketplace, whether it's our own industry messaging, our organic products, the highly configurable cloud solutions that we have, whether it's our AppExchange and our ISVs and our ecosystem, this really resonates with customers. And this is something that Siebold never had. They never had a -- they were -- as you know, they were not a platform company. They were never in a position where they could drive an ecosystem with vertical expansions the way that we're able to do it, so we're getting a lot of traction and we're really excited."

But I think I can get to the spirit of the question that you're asking. And the spirit of the question is the SFA market is a double-digit market, according to Gartner, it's been that way -- projected to be that way for long periods of time. We have not only done well in that market, that's a double-digit growing market, but we've also took share for the last decade consistently. And so that's what happened historically. We don't guide by cloud, that's a very attractive market as Marc had talked about. And we'll know -- you'll be able to see a lot more when we anniversary the actual revenue by cloud. I hope that helps, Rick."

You don't do these types of deals at scale and volume unless you are successfully getting mind share, building those great relationships. We've got -- over the year and certainly in the quarter, we've done some wonderful work with some of the best brands and the best companies in the world like 3M and ABB, Time Warner, I mentioned obviously. And some of these that I could not mention before by name. But they're just many, many examples of us doing an incredible job building more and more traction and becoming more meaningful. And I have to tell you, part of this comes from the opportunity for us to really unshackle either legacy SAP environments or have -- give customers the opportunity to transform their business models because they've really been shackled by legacy technology for years. And with this absolute convergence of cloud and social and mobile, it really gives us an opportunity to talk about what our Customer Success Platform can do for them generally speaking. I mean, Marc and I had the opportunity to spend some time with Brian Moynihan in Davos. And we talked about how BofA is transforming their business. And so those are the types of meaningful relationships that we're really talking about here. So again, we're very excited about what's going on.

In the fourth quarter, which was the first quarter that we've sold the Wave analytics cloud, we saw a lot of very large transactions, probably the very largest transactions that happened in the analytics industry happened on our platform. And we were really taken aback by that. We've decided to focus with a dedicated distribution personnel this fiscal year because of that. We've also made a very significant investment and upgrade in the number of people working on the product. And this is the real deal. I mean, we really have a world-class product on our hands. And in our minds or the way we think is we only want to focus on those multibillion-dollar opportunities or as we call them, clouds. And there's just no doubt in our mind that this is -- has all the makings of that. And of course, we keep track of what all the start-ups are doing. And we're very friendly with them and many of them are part of our ecosystem or attend our trade shows. They cannot even -- their bookings can't even compare to what our team did in the fourth quarter. So very excited about that. And when I look at some of the names that closed in the fourth quarter on the analytics cloud, the one that I love that I profiled at Dreamforce, which is GE Capital, and if you get and watch that video that's on YouTube, I mean, what they say is true. You just can't run your business without this product. This is just 1 -- this is the greatest product I think Salesforce has ever built. And it's going to just transform the way our customers run their business, not just run their sales, service and marketing. I mean, this is an enterprise-wide, enterprise-grade capability to fuel the analytical corporation. And it's not just an app, it's a platform, it's going to have a robust ecosystem. It's got every characteristic that we like to make our bookings and revenues happen in our largest and most important customers. And to that end, it's not just enterprise and very large enterprise deals. It's also, yes, departmental deals. It's even deals with nonprofits, NGOs.

And the first thing is you look at our competitors and their work in customer service area, number one, Oracle. They bought right now. They have their own Fusion service product. They took Fusion, they turned it into confusion. Oracle keeps saying they're growing more quickly than anyone else in the cloud. Well, that's very easy to do when you're starting at 0. And Service Cloud from Oracle, that's a great example. This is not a multibillion-dollar business for Oracle like it is for us. They have not been able to execute. They don't have a multi-tenant shared, scalable mobile, social, integrated with analytics customer service cloud. And then move onto SAP, they will just come into the customer and say, ""Just use HANA."" And it's like but, for what, and how and unload the software into your company. First of all, I think the number one thing about this customer service revolution that's going on and why Service Cloud is delivering phenomenal results is the traditional keepers of the customer service information for these customers, Oracle and SAP, have just not delivered. And we have. We have a very clear vision that we want to transform how our customers not only grow their top line with our Sales Cloud, which we've done unbelievably well, and you can see it in multiple billions of dollars. But now, we have this second huge multibillion dollar growth engine with Service Cloud, and our competitors have not been able to execute. They just don't have -- they're delivering new versions when our customers want new visions. And that is where we are right now in the customer service marketplace and why Gartner says we have the #1 customer service product.

Keith and I have been talking a lot about that because, in this quarter, what Keith and I were really struck by is, in all of our very largest transactions, we were not dealing with the CIO in the company or the head of sales or the head of service or the head of marketing, we were dealing with the Chief Executive Officer in the company. And that was a huge shock to us. We really, either Keith or I in our careers, going back now to a couple of decades, we have not really seen ourselves showing up in the CEO office. And Keith mentioned one, and I'll just come back to this, which is here's an example of a great company, which is a $43 billion German manufacturer called ABB. And ABB is a great company. They're a very diversified provider of industrial scale energy products and other products. And when ABB did the transaction with us, the CEO was personally involved. And they wanted to issued a press release and issue a statement about the strategic nature of the transaction which we did, which was a very strong 8-digit, very healthy transaction. But it was really all about the strategic capability of the -- of what ABB's doing with us. What's interesting about the deal was Salesforce -- and ABB is a huge Microsoft customer. I think they've got 40,000 or 50,000 seats of Microsoft. I mean it's just amazing what Microsoft has done on the account. And Salesforce and Microsoft went in hand-in-hand and showed Office 365 deeply integrated with Salesforce's services. And we have built a variety of very exciting vertical type functionality in the Office 365 using Force.com and our different clouds and automating their business processes. And ABB really has this vision of real-time customer collaboration. But it's all driven by the CEO, okay? And that is a shock to us. And we looked at big deals we did this quarter, whether it was General Electric or Coke or others, okay, the CEO is involved with us. So that's just very exciting. And I think that, that is a big change in how our implementations are viewed. We have seen that in Home Depot. We have seen that, of course, at Cisco. We have seen that in -- but we're really seeing it in all the biggest transactions. Keith, do you want to talk about that?"

But there are countless examples, whether it's financial services institutions. Again, we talked about Bank of America earlier, it really is about solving a customer problem, it's speaking the language of industry and it's not about 1 Sales Cloud, 1 Service Cloud, it's about a Customer Success Platform, and it's a platform discussion. And again, it fits the growth agenda. So that's why CEOs seem to be getting more and more involved in these. If I go back to the example that I gave earlier in the call about the strategic agreement that we signed in the quarter, that was a CEO agenda. That's all about growth. So I think the star and the moon are all aligned here as it relates to the agenda of the CEO and what our messaging is all about, and it's showing up in our results."

And that's why this year, we're coming in and saying that we're expecting to deliver another 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin while continuing the strong top line growth. And I think both of these things are now important for Salesforce. And we obviously know how to do that, we did it this year and we plan to do it again in the coming year as well."

Appreciate the comments about the quarter. I think the guidance, when you look at the revenue, 20% to 21%, which is the implied guidance here for the revenue growth in U.S. dollars plus a headwind that we talked about at $175 million to $200 million, and you quickly get a sense of what the constant currency growth rate is. You can see that snaps right in to our revenue margin framework. I think the operating margin to expand that 125 to 150, again after a year that we've just exceeded at 175 plus deal with a headwind of 25 to 50 basis points due to foreign exchange is right in the exact zip code of where we want to be. We feel like it's excellent balance in terms of the top line that Marc talked about, the bottom line that we talked about. And the cash flows stacks in there nicely as well with the growth rates. So we feel really good about where that lines up, and the revenue margin framework is very much something we embrace."

Thanks, John, and thanks for everyone for joining us on the call today. You can just see why I am so excited because I'm thrilled to report that we had just an outstanding start to our fiscal 2016 and just great building on the phenomenal momentum from last year.
In this quarter, we surpassed the $6 billion annual revenue run rate than we did that faster than any enterprise software company in history and we could not be more excited. Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7 billion revenue run rate later this year, on the way to being the fastest to reach $10 billion, which is our dream and something that we are very focused on.
I'd like to share results from the quarter. And revenue for the first quarter was 23% from a year ago to more than $1.5 billion and constant currency revenue grew even faster at 27%. I mean, you can look at all the other top 10 software companies, no one is delivering this kind of performance. And as I said, we delivered this amazing growth as we pushed through the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone.
Deferred revenue grew more than $3 billion, up 31% year-over-year and 36% in constant currency and the dollar value of booked business, on and off balance sheet, is now $9.1 billion, $9.1 billion. That's an increase of nearly $2 billion since last year. That is a very clear indicator of the strength of our future business. But even as we deliver this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 200 basis points this quarter over last year. And as you can see, we're not just focused on growing the top line, we're also growing the bottom line. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $730 million in operating cash flow, which is up 54% year-over-year and that's just an astonishing number.
Given our outstanding first quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our guidance for both our top and bottom line for fiscal year 2016. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.55 billion. And we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to $0.71 at the high end of our range.
As you can see, our strong revenue, deferred revenue, operating cash performance along with incredible momentum of our Customer Success Platform puts us on a trajectory to be the fastest enterprise software company to deliver $10 billion in revenue.
We're achieving this level performance and growing faster than the competition because we have a unique platform, really unique company designed for this today's connected world, designed for only 1 purpose, helping our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way and then ultimately creating customer success.
Today, this call is taking place right here from the great city of Chicago. When I've been meeting with some of our greatest today like State Farm and Northern trust, I've met with hundreds of customers from around the world. In recent weeks, I've been on a tour. And next month, I'm going to be taking that toward to Europe and then spending the summer once again learning from our customers in the region and hearing about all the great things going on over there and you can just do see our European businesses just awesome. And every CEO I've met with is feeling the impact of this technology moving faster and faster. Customers and employees are expecting deeper levels of engagement, they're creating these amazing one-on-one journeys. They're more automated intelligent business processing, everything's going mobile, ever thinks available on their phone, soon, right on our wrists. Well, they're relying on Salesforce with our metadata-driven technology platform. Our 6 core clouds and incredible, incredible employees, our customer success services teams and ecosystem and software developers, systems integrators, servers providers, all of them, the whole ecosystem helping our customers grew faster and transform their businesses to be more successful than ever before.
That's why Gartner has ranked Salesforce as the worldwide market share leader in the CRM market for 2014, continuing more than a decade of growth and market share gains while Oracle and SAP continue to fall behind.
Well, we can certainly see that from their quarters, can't we. You can see in the tremendous growth we've had across our 6 clouds and how we are outpacing the competition and taking market share at the expense of our competitors. Sales Cloud continues to be the market share leader in SFA by far. And on its own, one of the top tier-play enterprise companies it by revenue in the world.
Service Cloud displays SAP in the quarter and is now the market share leader in customer service and sport. Sorry about that, SAP. And the Marketing Cloud, which was born out of our acquisition of ExactTarget 2 years ago, is now the fastest-growing top 5 marketing vendor according to the latest Gartner report, taking market share while every other top 5 vendor is losing.
Community Cloud continues to grow its market share and we now have some of our largest partners communities in the world, dozens of more than 100,000 members.
Our Wave Analytics Cloud has become a real game changer for us. I've never seen more excitement about this product. I've been demoing it everywhere I go. It's not just an analytics app, it's a platform with a whole ecosystem of partners and a development environment that lets you basically build any kind of analytics app our customers want.
We saw as deep in our relationship with Microsoft this quarter with the launch of wave connector for Excel, which transfers Excel spreadsheets and the visual, the and the analytics cloud was just a click and we had a phenomenal demonstration of exciting new technology that we're building would Microsoft at their Build Conference. And we also saw more revelation of that at Ignite. And we also launched analytics cloud for the Apple watch, the first enterprise app from Apple's amazing new, wearable and we're really thrilled that Apple featured Analytics Cloud as one of the marquee apps in their launch.
The Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation for everything we develop, has been ranked by Gartner as the leading enterprise Platform as a Service for the second year in a row. We've seen tremendous momentum in the quarter with customers and partners with ISVs now more than 2 million developers building apps on top of our platform. And that's reflected in our customer adoption and usage rates. They are just story.
We delivered 211 billion transactions to our customers in the quarter, 211 billion, up 79% from a year ago. That is astonishing. That's an average of more than 3.4 billion transactions every single business day, unprecedented in the technology industry.
Before I close, I want to mention the great work of Salesforce foundation. The foundation now supporting 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs and we've distributed more than $85 million in grants and our employees have volunteered almost 1 million hours of community service, an increase of 300,000 hours since Q1 of last year, just amazing.
Now I'll hand it off to Keith who's in London, where he'll be keynoting our London world tour event tomorrow when this is the largest cloud computing event in the region with more than 13,000 people registered to attend. Now the world tour that we're all on will follow a record -- that we've had record attendance stops already in Melbourne and Amsterdam, here in Boston, in Chicago and Toronto. You're also welcome to join us for upcoming Salesforce World Tour's stops. The next one's going to be Washington D.C. next week, which will be incredible. And then we head to New York for salesforce connections largest digital marketing event in the world and our New York world tour, which will be June 16, 17 and in 18. You're not going to want to miss that. More than 15,000 people will join us. And I'll be keynoting the world tour events in Paris on June 25 and in Munich on July 2. If you haven't seen what's going on in Europe, it's worth seeing just an amazing level of momentum with the cloud. And mark your calendar for the largest enterprise technology conference on the planet, Dreamforce, you may have heard of it. That's going to be happening September 15 to 18 in San Francisco. That is an event I am quite sure you will not want to miss.
Okay, Keith?"

And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastest-growing region where we've now exceeded $1 billion in revenue over the past year. So congratulations to the entire team for really an incredible achievement. Suffice to say, that proved positive that the investments that we've been talking about and making internationally are absolutely playing off. 
As Marc said, tomorrow I'm hosting our London Salesforce World Tour. We will have a record turnout expected. I've got a number of special guests joining me on stage, including executives from Barclays and British Airways. Beast guy will be with us, John Lewis, Vodafone and many others. We're also going to have an organization called Quarter Dojo, which is really a very incredible nonprofit here in the U.K., which teaches young kids how to code and adopt technology. So this is going to be a great event, really a world-class event.
And as you heard from Marc, we had a world-class first quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. You can see that in the results and this is a great way for us to start our fiscal year. It really does set a terrific tone for the rest of the year and we're very excited about it. So we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our customers of all sizes, all industries and all geographies. And what's interesting is they're transforming their business model and are doing this by leveraging our Customer Success Platform and this is leading to larger deals in all segments and deeper, more meaningful strategic relationships. In fact, we hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions of any first quarter in the history of the company.
We saw some incredible wins in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the fact that 30% of our top deals were net new customers and I'd like to share a few these stories. The first one is a company called We Telecom. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in France. It's a great new relationship that closed in the quarter and they selected our Customer Success Platform to create an omnichannel digital experience for their 13 million customers across all their call centers, stores and online, very exciting.
We also signed an amazing new deal with a transportation company, really one of the world's greatest brands in their category. They were using on-premise legacy technology from Oracle. And in the quarter, they decided to go all in with the cloud and they plan to put Salesforce1 on their mobile devices and into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world. It was really just an incredible when and I couldn't be prouder of the team for being in this new strategic relationship.
Also one of the largest deals in the quarter was a net new relationship with a Fortune 500 leader in retail. They were looking to consolidate all of their tools and campaigns and selected our Marketing Cloud as their company-wide digital marketing platform. As Marc mentioned, the Marketing Cloud is absolutely on fire. It is the tip of the sphere was with B2C companies. And it really is in almost every conversation that we're having with senior executives around the world. It's really terrific. 
We're also seeing some significant expansions with accessing customers. Tico, which is a brand that I'm sure many people recognize. It's a great example. They're a $10 billion leader in protection and security. They've been using Sales Cloud for years and expanded their relationship with us in the quarter with Service Cloud and Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform. So their vision is to really bring all their teams together and transform their organization and build a global Customer Success Platform across sales and service and marketing.
Barclays, another great win. They started with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and communities and now with the addition of Analytics Cloud in the quarter, Barclays will be putting realtime customer intelligence into the hands of their corporate bankers so they can make faster and smarter decisions right from their mobile devices. It's a great example of impact from the Analytics Cloud. And in my keynote tomorrow, Barclays is going to demonstrate how they use Salesforce to strip -- to transform their brokerage journey and build the most qualified digital workforce in financial services.
And speaking of financial services, we expanded our relationship with JPMorgan Investment Management. This is a customer that has been using us in a few their divisions and now they will be significantly increasing their deployment of Service Cloud at the CRM platform across their growing mutual funds division. So JPMorgan is yet another great example of how financial services companies are moving to the cloud. 
Other new wins or expansions in Q1 include the Bank of America, Dentsu, Expedia, Hitachi, Japan Post, John Deer, Medtronic, Telus, T-Mobile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Western Union and Zürich Insurance. So this is really, as you can see, a pretty incredible list of brands and it shows the continued traction we're getting in our industry strategy. You're also going to see our industry strategy come in to greater focus this summer when introduce our first industry solution name wealth management.
Now I will tell you we've been able to to achieve level of customer success and growth because we are, without a doubt, the trusted enterprise level. And with this incredible culture of relentless innovation, a 16-year track record of customer success, no other technology provider is in a position to say this, we are all about customer success. And conversely, if you were paying attention to SAP's event a few years -- a few weeks ago, the CIO of the world's largest retailer, which is an SAP customer, she said she hopes to see an SAP implementation in her lifetime. And I think that spells it out. That is the different between on-premise and the cloud. It doesn't sound like customer success to me and we are all about customer success.
So we're seeing a growing trend of SAP and Oracle customers who are coming to us and talking to us and working with us to wraparound their legacy solution but I want us to be that identity layer to these legacy technologies. They want us to be able to unlock more value from their investments and ultimately, it puts us on a path to complete replacement in their front office. 
In fact, I will tell you a few days ago, I had a meeting with the COO of one of the world's largest banks and they were incredibly excited about the strategy to ultimately replace all their legacy customer-facing systems with our Customer Success Platform can. So that's very exciting for us.
So before I close, I want to talk about our ecosystem. Marc touched on it a minute ago. It continues to thrive with the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. We had a huge milestone this quarter with over 3 million total installs from our AppExchange. We continue to develop more strategic ISV relationships from both the horizontal and vertical basis. And as I travel around the world and speak to customers and partners, it's pretty clear the relationship with our global and regional SIs is just never been stronger. So with that, I want to thank the entire team at Salesforce and congratulate them for delivering just a terrific and strong Q1 and a great site to the year. So over to you, Mark."

And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $52 million and a sequential headwind of around $17 million.
Our geographies also delivered strong growth on a constant currency basis with the Americas growth of 27%, EMEA growth of 28% and Asia Pac of 27%.
Dollar attrition for the first quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9% [ph]. Now while we continue to deliver industry-leading top line growth, we are thrilled to have expanded our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins by 197 basis points year-over-year. And by the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our top line outperformance, along with the improved expense controls, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 45% over last year and $0.02 higher than our guidance.
Additionally, we've made great progress toward GAAP profitability in the quarter, including reducing our stock-based compensation to below 10% of revenue.
Now turning to cash flow. We delivered record operating cash flow in the quarter of $731 million. Now that's up 54% over last year. And as we've previously discussed, we anticipate that Q1 will continue to be the largest cash flow quarter. Now this is due to our seasonally strong Q4 and the compounding nature of our new and renewal business in the fourth quarter and the associated collections of our Q4 invoices in the first quarter.
Now free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $660 million. That was up 60% over Q1 of last year. Looking at deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter with growth of 31% year-over-year, excluding an FX headwind of $69 million. Deferred revenue were 36% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $18 million.
As a reminder, we calculate our FX on revenue using the average rates throughout the quarter, however, for deferred revenue, our balance sheet item, we use the spot rate on the last day of the quarter. Keep in mind, we conduct business in multiple currencies including the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar and others. While the dollar exchange rates for most of these currencies were roughly flat at the end of the quarter, a stronger pound drove a slight sequential tailwind to the deferred revenue in Q1.
In the quarter, 75% of the value of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms.
Now let's move on to guidance. With our strong first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.52 billion to $6.55 billion or 22% growth at the high end. Now this guidance includes an anticipated FX headwind of about $175 million to $200 million.
In addition to raising our top line guidance, we're also pleased to be raising our bottom line as well. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 125 to 150 basis points this year. With our strong Q1 operating cash flow, we now anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%.
For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18 and deferred revenue growth in the mid- to high-20% range. Our guidance implies that will continue to be in that expense and we now assume a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and that we will not make significant acquisitions.
To close, we are very pleased with our fast start to fiscal 2016. We delivered outstanding results across the board. Our top of the bottom line outperformance drove record cash flow and our backlog of booked business positions us extremely well for continued growth while we continued to deliver our non-GAAP operating margin expansion commitment.

This is just a breakthrough product. There's ever been an analytics product that's been built from the ground up as a multitenet cloud service built on a metadata platform that gives you the ability to build the apps and deploy them rapidly. And I think you're going to see some amazing things with the Analytics Cloud when we get to Dreamforce as well. We've had some huge technical breakthroughs in our ability to build an ecosystem around the Analytics Cloud and we plan to show those off. We've only been in this business about 90 days.

If you talk to Mark Hawkins, he will tell you that this finance organization at Salesforce, they are all using Analytics Cloud. Our employee success organization is all using Analytics Cloud so this is a very compelling new product. Marc is absolutely correct. In 2 weeks of announcing this at Dreamforce, we were closing deals in very large enterprises. So the market reaction has been very good. People are very excited about it.

We may continue improvement and the percent of annualized billing, pretty in sync with the rate of improvement that we've made before it's been a modest improvement.

We wanted to create a new technology model now known as the cloud. We wanted to create a new business model, which is singly focus on the success of our customers and helping our customers to create new ways to connect with their customers and help them to innovate and transform their organizations. And three, we create a new profit model with 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of our employees' time and [indiscernible] raise because we had no equity, we had no profit, we had no time. But I would say at this point, I mean Salesforce has far exceeded our expectations over the last 16 years. But people are always overestimating what they can do in a year and underestimating what they can do in a decade in our business. And when I look out, what I see is we are absolutely committed to being the fastest software company ever to $10 billion. And I'm sure, Jason, if you look at your model now it's over $9 billion in deferred, I don't know about the balance sheet, you can start to model exactly how fast that's going to be. I mean it's record time and we're going to squarely be very, very shortly the fourth largest software company in the world. Now when that happens, we are really targeting 1 company to surpass, which is SAP. Fortunately for us, their kind of lackluster growth execution and lack of innovation in their core products as we signed their conference this quarter, well, they're an easy target. That's our next goal. But we've got our minds squarely on the price, which is the $10 billion revenue run rate and that's step. 1 step 2 is go past SAP. And I think we can absolutely do that and I'm personally committed to making that happen. That's my dream. And I am super motivated every single day to get up and run a company that is doing well by doing good. We don't -- we're not just a software company, Jason, that's building products and selling them every day like the rest of the guys. We are a software company that is working hard to make the world a better place, not just through our innovation, but to our philanthropy and for commitment to equality for all and also to inspire other entrepreneurs and other companies to do the same. I am sure your experience is the same as mine when I meet the all these new companies, they all have philanthropy built into their model and they've all got [indiscernible] of entrepreneurs who are going to head out to their community, not just build products. And I hope in some small way, we've inspired the industry to kind of get off its kind of traditional stinginess and to get out there and do something for other people. And that's what I'm excited about and those are my goals going forward. Does that help clarify that?"

But I do want to call out something, Heather, to try to get more context to the spirit of your question. When I look at the unit economics of what's happening in our business, the lifetime economics, I clearly see a business that's in the mid-30s in terms of operating margin. And that is really I think what we should think about when we get the business at a mature level of growth in the mid-30s. That will be the key point. And in terms of the Service Cloud, one of the things that was most pleasing to look at is just the amazing amount of market share we took, that Gartner just took where we made really real progress on the market share, where we ripped over 300 basis points.

I mean when we're in there, I presented that product today to executives, they're one of the very largest insurance companies here in Chicago and they've never seen anything like that. And I don't think anything like it exists. They probably already own every product and I don't think that's a reason why they wouldn't buy ours because they don't use that product. Those other products are really isolated and used by analysts and they're not analytics for everyone. They're certainly not analytics for the rest of us. They don't run well on iPhone and Android devices. They don't run on the Apple Watch, they don't run -- you can't spin it up instantly in our cloud environment. So this is just an extraordinary offering and it is only -- well, I've obviously seen the next 2 versions and it is just going to get better and better and better and we're going to just bring in a very big ecosystem of developers and apps and we're going to exercise our magic in regards to building a really broad, broad use of it. And by Dreamforce, you'll see something just awesome. So I hope that answers that question."

We worked with their core management team and transformed that to just turning it into the sun exceptional offering with Journey Builder and our customers can build journeys for their customers. They can build journeys for their employees. They can build journeys further partners, journeys for their products. I mean we just use it ourselves to build something called an adoption manager for Salesforce1 and when you are using CRM you have now have the ability to turn on the adoption manager you basically turn on the Journey Builder and the Marketing Cloud and I know that we saw almost 50% increase in the adoption rates using that technology. And I encourage everyone of our customers to move to that model. As part of that, I also am extremely excited by the phenomenal success over pyridoxine in Atlanta, which is part of our Marketing Cloud. They have done a great job as well, which is the B2B marketing solution. So we not only have a tremendous B2C solution that has applicability throughout the enterprise but we have an unbelievable B2B marketing solution and both of those are just executing incredibly well. For those of you who know, we have taken a long time to build our Marketing Cloud strategy through -- primarily through acquisition and we have now had a couple of years to be able to operate it and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Some of our largest transactions in the quarter were done with the Marketing Cloud and I don't know of a customer who's not looking at it. It's what you need to be able to connect with your customers on a day-by-day basis and minute-by-minute basis. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little insight in the world that they were there during Dreamforce, which is as it relates to the Marketing Cloud, you know everyone probably who's listening to this call might be wearing some kind of a wearable. All those wearables are probably evolving very rapidly, probably all of us will be wearing some kind of different wearables in the next 2 years. Everybody knows that we're moving to this incredible Internet of Things. That's a part of it. We call it and 10 at that customers. Every thing is going online. Everything has got an API. We're generating more data than ever before. 90% of the world's data was generated in the last 2 years. A lot of it is coming out of this machine data. Well, as all these things are happening, of course you want to build and connect everything and then have these directed journeys and messaging and build to put everything online and everything deeply integrated into your CRM systems, I don't think there's any other company in the world that's going to be able to show what we're going to show at Dreamforce, which is this idea that everything is connected, everything's online and that you're basically able to stay and talk to your a customer minute by minute as it's happening. And that's all possible because of this Marketing Cloud, so I couldn't be more excited. I mean between the Marketing Cloud, between the Analytics Cloud, between some of exciting enhancements that are going to be coming for our core salesforce and Service Cloud offerings and next-generation solutions there. We've got a lot of very, very exciting things planned for September."

And it goes back to customers really want to be engaged -- more engaged, more deeply -- have deeper relationships with our customers and drive success and that's what this Customer Success Platform is all about. So this is a $2.5 billion run rate business. As a cloud, it's one of the top 8 standalone largest cloud companies. We keep getting accolades from Gartner.

Thanks, John, and thanks for everyone for joining us on the call today. You can just see why I am so excited because I'm thrilled to report that we had just an outstanding start to our fiscal 2016 and just great building on the phenomenal momentum from last year.
In this quarter, we surpassed the $6 billion annual revenue run rate, and we did that faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we could not be more excited. Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7 billion revenue run rate later this year, on the way to being the fastest to reach $10 billion, which is our dream and something that we are very focused on.
I'd like to share the results from the quarter. And revenue for the first quarter rose 23% from a year ago to more than $1.5 billion. Constant currency revenue grew even faster at 27%. I mean, you can look at all the other top 10 software companies. No one is delivering this kind of performance. And as I said, we delivered this amazing growth as we pushed through the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone.
Deferred revenue grew more than $3 billion, up 31% year-over-year and 36% in constant currency. And the dollar value of booked business, on and off balance sheet, is now $9.1 billion, $9.1 billion. That's an increase of nearly $2 billion since last year. That is a very clear indicator of the strength of our future business. Even as we deliver this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 200 basis points this quarter over last year. And as you can see, we're not just focused on growing the top line, we're also growing the bottom line. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $730 million in operating cash flow, which is up 54% year-over-year, and that's just an astonishing number.
Given our outstanding first quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our guidance for both our top and bottom line for fiscal year 2016. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.55 billion. And we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to $0.71, at the high end of our range. As you can see, our strong revenue, deferred revenue, operating cash performance, along with incredible momentum of our Customer Success Platform, puts us on a trajectory to be the fastest enterprise software company to deliver $10 billion in revenue.
We're achieving this level of performance and growing faster than the competition because we have a unique platform, really unique company designed for today's connected world, designed for only one purpose, helping our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way and then ultimately creating customer success.
Today, this call is taking place right here from the great city of Chicago. When I've been meeting with some of our great customers today like State Farm and Northern Trust, I've met with hundreds of customers from around the world in recent weeks I've been on a tour, and next month, I'm going to be taking that tour to Europe and spending the summer once again learning from our customers in the region and hearing about all the great things going on over there. And you can just see our European business is just awesome. And every CEO I've met with is feeling the impact of this technology moving faster and faster. Customers' employees are expecting deeper levels of engagement. They're creating these amazing one-on-one journeys. They're more automated, intelligent business processing. Everything is going mobile. Everything is available on their phone; soon, right on our wrists. 
Well, they're relying on Salesforce with our metadata-driven technology platform. Our 6 core clouds and incredible, incredible employees, our customer success services team and ecosystem of software developers, systems integrators, service providers, all of them, the whole ecosystem helping our customers grow faster and transform their businesses to be more successful than ever before. That's why Gartner has ranked Salesforce as the worldwide market share leader in the CRM market for 2014, continuing more than a decade of growth and market share gains while Oracle and SAP continue to fall behind. Well, we can certainly see that from their quarters, can't we?
You can see the tremendous growth we've had across our 6 clouds and how we are outpacing the competition and taking market share at the expense of our competitors. Sales Cloud continues to be the market share leader in SFA by far, and on its own, one of the top pure-play enterprise cloud companies by revenue in the world. Service Cloud displaced SAP in the quarter and is now the market share leader in customer service and support. Sorry about that, SAP. And the Marketing Cloud, which was borne out of our acquisition of ExactTarget 2 years ago, is now the fastest-growing top 5 marketing vendor according to the latest Gartner report, taking market share while every other top 5 vendor is losing. Community Cloud continues to grow its market share, and we now have some of our largest partner communities in the world, dozens with more than 100,000 members. 
Our Wave Analytics Cloud has become a real game changer for us. I've never seen more excitement about this product. I've been demoing it everywhere I go. It's not just an analytics app, it's a platform with a whole ecosystem of partners and a development environment that lets you basically build any kind of analytics app our customers want.
You saw as deepen our relationship with Microsoft this quarter with the launch of Wave Connector for Excel, which transfers the Excel spreadsheets into visual, dynamic graphs and the Analytics Cloud with just a click. And we had a phenomenal demonstration of exciting new technology that we're building with Microsoft at their Build conference. And we also saw more revelation of that at Ignite. 
And we also launched Analytics Cloud for the Apple Watch, the first enterprise app from Apple's amazing new wearable. And we're really thrilled that Apple featured Analytics Cloud as one of the marquee apps in their launch.
The Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation for everything we develop, has been ranked by Gartner as the leading enterprise Platform as a Service for the second year in a row. We've seen tremendous momentum in the quarter with customers, with partners, with ISVs. Now more than 2 million developers building apps on top of our platform. And that's reflected in our customer adoption and usage rates. They are just soaring.
We delivered 211 billion transactions to our customers in the quarter, 211 billion, up 79% from a year ago. That is astonishing. That's an average of more than 3.4 billion transactions every single business day, unprecedented in the technology industry.
Before I close, I want to mention the great work of Salesforce Foundation. The foundation now supporting 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs, and we've distributed more than $85 million in grants. And our employees have volunteered almost 1 million hours of community service, an increase of 300,000 hours since Q1 of last year. Just amazing.
Now I'll hand it off to Keith, who's in London, where he'll be keynoting our London world tour event tomorrow. And this is the largest cloud computing event in the region with more than 13,000 people registered to attend. Now the world tour that we're all on will follow a record -- that we've had record attendance stops already in Melbourne and Amsterdam, here in Boston, in Chicago and Toronto. You're also welcome to join us for upcoming Salesforce World Tour stops. The next one's going to be Washington, D.C. next week, which will be incredible. And then we head to New York for Salesforce Connections, the largest digital marketing event in the world and our New York world tour, which will be June 16, 17 and 18. You're going to not want to miss that. More than 15,000 people will join us. And I'll be keynoting the world tour events in Paris on June 25 and in Munich on July 2. If you haven't seen what's been going on in Europe, it's worth seeing just an amazing level of momentum with the cloud. And mark your calendars for the largest enterprise technology conference on the planet, Dreamforce. You may have heard of it. That's going to be happening in September 15 to 18 in San Francisco. That is an event I am quite sure you will not want to miss.
Okay. Keith?"

It's great to be here in London. As Marc said, I love London. I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastes",1290,"Thanks, Marc. Greetings, everybody. It's great to be here in London. As Marc said, I love London. I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastest-growing region where we've now exceeded $1 billion in revenue over the past year. So congratulations to the entire team for really an incredible achievement. Suffice to say, that proved positive that the investments that we've been talking about and making internationally are absolutely playing off.
As Marc said, tomorrow I'm hosting our London Salesforce World Tour. We will have a record turnout expected. I've got a number of special guests joining me on stage, including executives from Barclays and British Airways. BSkyB will be with us, John Lewis, Vodafone and many others. We're also going to have an organization called CoderDojo, which is really a very incredible nonprofit here in the U.K., which teaches young kids how to code and adopt technology. So this is going to be a great event, really a world-class event.
And as you heard from Marc, we had a world-class first quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. You can see that in the results, and this is a great way for us to start our fiscal year. It really does set a terrific tone for the rest of the year, and we're very excited about it. So we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our customers of all sizes, all industries and all geographies. And what's interesting is they're transforming their business models and are doing this by leveraging our Customer Success Platform. And this is leading to larger deals in all segments and deeper and more meaningful strategic relationships. In fact, we hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions of any first quarter in the history of the company.
We saw some incredible wins in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the fact that 30% of our top deals were net new customers, and I'd like to share a few these stories. The first one is a company called WIG Telecom. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in France. It's a great new relationship that closed in the quarter, and they selected our Customer Success Platform to create an omnichannel digital experience for their 13 million customers across all their call centers, stores and online. Very exciting.
We also signed a major new deal with a transportation company, really one of the world's greatest brands in their category. They were using on-premise legacy technology from Oracle. And in the quarter, they decided to go all in with the cloud, and they plan to put Salesforce1 on the mobile devices and into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world. It was really just an incredible win, and I couldn't be prouder of the team for bringing in this new strategic relationship.
Also one of the largest deals in the quarter was a net new relationship with a Fortune 500 leader in retail. They were looking to consolidate all of their tools and campaigns and selected our Marketing Cloud as their company-wide digital marketing platform. As Marc mentioned, the Marketing Cloud is absolutely on fire. It is the tip of the spear for us with B2C companies. And it really is in almost every conversation that we're having with senior executives around the world. It's really terrific.
We're also seeing some significant expansions with our existing customers. Tyco, which is a brand that I'm sure many people recognize, it's a great example. They're a $10 billion leader in protection and security. They've been using Sales Cloud for years, and they expanded their relationship with us in the quarter with Service Cloud and Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform. So their vision is to really bring all of their teams together and transform their organization and build a global Customer Success Platform across sales and service and marketing.
Barclays, another great win. They started with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Communities. And now with the addition of Analytics Cloud in the quarter, Barclays will be putting realtime customer intelligence into the hands of their corporate bankers so they can make faster and smarter decisions right from their mobile devices. It's a great example of impact from the Analytics Cloud. And in my keynote tomorrow, Barclays is going to demonstrate how they use Salesforce to strip -- to transform their brokerage journey and build the most qualified digital workforce in financial services.
And speaking of financial services, we expanded our relationship with JPMorgan Investment Management. This is a customer that has been using us in a few of their divisions. And now they will be significantly increasing their deployment of Service Cloud as the CRM platform across their growing Mutual Funds division. So JPMorgan is yet another great example of how financial services companies are moving to the cloud.
Other new wins or expansions in Q1 include the Bank of America, Dentsu, Expedia, Hitachi, Japan Post, John Deere, Medtronic, TELUS, T-Mobile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Western Union and Zürich Insurance. So this is really, as you can see, a pretty incredible list of brands. And it shows the continued traction we're getting in our industry strategy. You're also going to see our industry strategy come into greater focus this summer when introduce our first industry solution in wealth management.
Now I will tell you we've been able to achieve this level of customer success and growth because we are, without a doubt, the trusted enterprise cloud. And with this incredible culture of relentless innovation, a 16-year track record of customer success, no other technology provider is in a position to say this. We are all about customer success. And conversely, if you were paying attention to SAP's event a few years -- a few weeks ago, the CIO of the world's largest retailer, which is an SAP customer, she said she hopes to see an SAP implementation in her lifetime. And I think that spells it out. That is the difference between on-premise and the cloud. It doesn't sound like customer success to me, and we are all about customer success.
So we're seeing a growing trend of SAP and Oracle customers who are coming to us and talking to us and working with us to wraparound their legacy solution. They want us to be the agility layer to these legacy technologies. They want us to be able to unlock more value from their investments. And ultimately, it puts us on a path to a complete replacement in their front office.
In fact, I will tell you, a few days ago, I had a meeting with the COO of one of the world's largest banks. And they were incredibly excited about the strategy to ultimately replace all of their legacy customer-facing systems with our Customer Success Platform. So that's very exciting for us.
So before I close, I want to talk about our ecosystem. Marc touched on it a minute ago. It continues to thrive with the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. We had a huge milestone this quarter with over 3 million total installs from our AppExchange. We continue to develop more strategic ISV relationships on both the horizontal and vertical basis. And as I travel around the world and speak to customers and partners, it's pretty clear that the relationship with our global and regional SIs, it's just never been stronger.
So with that, I want to thank the entire team at Salesforce and congratulate them for delivering just a terrific and strong Q1 and a great start to the year. So over to you, Mark."
122917,292877187,820410,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2015",2015-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue wit",680,"Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $52 million and a sequential headwind of around $17 million. Our geographies also delivered strong growth on a constant currency basis with the Americas growth of 27%, EMEA growth of 28% and Asia Pac of 27%. Dollar attrition for the first quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%.
Now while we continue to deliver industry-leading top line growth, we are thrilled to have expanded our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins by 197 basis points year-over-year. And by the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our top line outperformance, along with the improved expense controls, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 45% over last year and $0.02 higher than our guidance. Additionally, we've made great progress toward GAAP profitability in the quarter, including reducing our stock-based compensation to below 10% of revenue.
Now turning to cash flow. We delivered record operating cash flow in the quarter of $731 million. Now that's up 54% over last year. And as we've previously discussed, we anticipate that Q1 will continue to be the largest cash flow quarter. Now this is due to our seasonally strong Q4 and the compounding nature of our new and renewal business in the fourth quarter and the associated collections of our Q4 invoices in the first quarter. Now free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $660 million. That was up 60% over Q1 of last year. 
Looking at deferred revenue. We delivered another strong quarter with growth of 31% year-over-year, excluding an FX headwind of $69 million. Deferred revenue grew 36% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $18 million.
As a reminder, we calculate our FX on revenue using the average rates throughout the quarter. However, for deferred revenue, a balance sheet item, we use the spot rate on the last day of the quarter. Keep in mind, we conduct business in multiple currencies, including the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar and others. While the dollar exchange rates for most of these currencies were roughly flat at the end of the quarter, a stronger pound drove a slight sequential tailwind to the deferred revenue in Q1.
In the quarter, 75% of the value of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms.
Now let's move on to guidance. With our strong first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.52 billion to $6.55 billion for 22% growth at the high end. Now this guidance includes an anticipated FX headwind of about $175 million to $200 million.
In addition to raising our top line guidance, we're also pleased to be raising our bottom line as well. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 125 to 150 basis points this year. With our strong Q1 operating cash flow, we now anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%.
For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18 and deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20% range. Our guidance implies that OI&E will continue to be a net expense, and we now assume a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and that we will not make significant acquisitions.
To close, we are very pleased with our fast start to fiscal 2016. We delivered outstanding results across the board. Our top and our bottom line outperformance drove record cash flow, and our backlog of booked business positions us extremely well for continued growth while we continue to deliver our non-GAAP operating margin expansion commitment.

So this is a very compelling new product. Marc is absolutely correct. Within 2 weeks of announcing this at Dreamforce, we were closing deals in very large enterprises.

We wanted to create a new technology model now known as the cloud. We wanted to create a new business model, which is singularly focused on the success of our customers and helping our customers to create new ways to connect with their customers and help them to innovate and transform their organizations. And three, we create a new profit model with 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees' time. And of course, that was raised because we had no equity, we had no profit, we had no time. But I would say at this point, I mean, Salesforce has far exceeded our expectations over the last 16 years. But people are always overestimating what they can do in a year and underestimating what they can do in a decade in our business. And when I look out, what I see is we are absolutely committed to being the fastest software company ever to $10 billion. And I'm sure, Jason, if you look at your model, now it's over $9 billion in deferred. I don't know about the balance sheet. You can start to model exactly how fast that's going to be. I mean, it's record time. And we're going to squarely be very, very shortly the fourth largest software company in the world. Now when that happens, we are really targeting one company to surpass, which is SAP. Fortunately for us, their kind of lackluster growth execution and lack of innovation in their core products as we saw on their conference this quarter, well, you know what, they're an easy target. And that's our next goal. But we've got our minds squarely on the price, which is the $10 billion revenue run rate, and that's step 1. Step 2 is go past SAP. And I think we can absolutely do that, and I'm personally committed to making that happen. That's my dream. And I am super motivated every single day to get up and run a company that is doing well by doing good. We don't -- we're not just a software company, Jason, that's building products and selling them every day like the rest of the guys. We are a software company that is working hard to make the world a better place, not just through our innovation, but through our philanthropy and through our commitment to equality for all and also to inspire other entrepreneurs and other companies to do the same. I am sure your experience is the same as mine. When I meet the all these new companies, they've all got philanthropy built into their model, and they've all got fired-up entrepreneurs who are going to add value to their community and not just build products. And I hope that in some small way, we've inspired the industry to kind of get off its kind of traditional stinginess and to get out there and do something for other people. And that's what I'm excited about, and those are my goals going forward. Does that help clarify that?"

But I think from an operating margin viewpoint, one of the things that you should think about is that this squares very nicely with our revenue operating margin framework in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. So this fits very nicely. But what we're doing also, Ross, as you touched on, is we're making sure to make the votes -- or make the investments rather that are essential to making sure that we grow not only this year but in '17 and well beyond to fulfill the vision that Marc had that articulated earlier on the call.

But Heather, the $10 billion vision that Marc articulated, you can see us driving towards that. You're hearing loud and clear. I think that the profitability will be a function of the speed of how fast we get there. And when we talk about the revenue operating margin framework, very much it's correlated with the rate of the growth rate compared to the operating margin expansion. That's a higher-level framework that remains intact. We continue to execute that, and you can see it even in this period and the guidance for this year. But I do want to call out something, Heather, to try to get more context to the spirit of your question. When I look at the unit economics of what's happening in our business, the lifetime economics, I clearly see a business that's in the mid-30s in terms of operating margin. And that is really, I think, what we should think about when we get the business at a mature level of growth, in the mid-30s. That will be the key point. And in terms of the Service Cloud, one of the things that was most pleasing to look at is just the amazing amount of market share we took, that Gartner just took where we made really real progress on the market share, where we ripped over 300 basis points. We displaced basically SAP and are making real progress. But let me just see if there's other commentary on that."

They are leveraging our platform, and many of them are asking us to wrap an agility layer around their existing legacy systems. Now that could be a homegrown system, but more often or not -- than not, that's Oracle and SAP. And ultimately, the game plan here is to surround them and eventually replace them.

How do you guys -- and then there's a question for Keith Block. How do you keep your guys focused on the price, focused on the execution when there's all of that sort of speculation going on externally? And then the second question is just about the industry solutions that are going to be rolling out later this year. Is there anything incremental that you guys need to do in sort of building out the distribution around those industry solutions? Or is that pretty well in place and it is really putting product into place with what has been a build-out in the vertical distribution capability?"

So our people are motivated. They are very excited. It's part of our culture -- a big part of our culture to focus on customer success. And our people feel really, really good about what they're doing and the success that they're enjoying with our customers. With respect to our industry strategy and execution around our product, for the most part, we have already started to pivot around an industry orientation as we're organized in the field. So our distribution model is gradually moving towards an industry orientation over the last couple of years. It's hard to believe that in June will be my 2-year anniversary. But over the last couple of years, we've started to pivot towards vertical selling organization. And that is kind of a natural tip of the spear for these solutions that we will be bringing out."

I think when you look at some of our core deployments of our Community Cloud, companies like Home Depot, and you can see that if you go to community.homedepot.com or many of the other ones, well, you'll see that we're tightly integrated with their employees. We're tightly integrated with their partners. And it's been a huge boom for them to be able to increase their store traffic, that they get actual results. I mean, I know that because Salesforce uses our Community Cloud every day, but I don't know a customer that's not planning to deploy this product. I mean, this is something that's extremely important for every company, whether they're a B2C company or a B2B company, and being able to aggregate their customers and unite them with their employees. As you know, we have a very -- a strong integrated system of engagement with our core product. And that system of engagement is tightly integrated with our system of record and is now with our Analytics Cloud, tightly integrated with our system of intelligence. So system of record tightly integrated with a system of intelligence, tightly integrated with the system of engagement. And that system of engagement is extended into those core customer offering through our Community Cloud. And that's the right architecture. That's the right products. It's had phenomenal success, super high growth rate, and I expect continued great performance from them this year."

They probably already own every product, and I don't think that's a reason why they wouldn't buy ours because they don't use that product. Those other products are really isolated and used by analysts, and they're not analytics for everyone. They're certainly not analytics for the rest of us. They don't run well on iPhone and Android devices. They don't run on the Apple Watch. They don't run -- you can't spin it up instantly in our cloud environment. So this is just an extraordinary offering, and it is only -- well, I've obviously seen the next 2 versions, and it is just going to get better and better and better.

I'm sure you see that we took this great company in Indianapolis, Indiana, ExactTarget. We've worked with their core management team and transformed that to just turning it into just an exceptional offering with Journey Builder. And our customers can build journeys for their customers. They can build journeys for their employees. They can build journeys for their partners, journeys for their products. I mean, we just use it ourself to build something called Adoption Manager for Salesforce1. And when you are using Salesforce1, you now have the ability to turn on something called Adoption Manager. You're basically turning on Journey Builder and the Marketing Cloud. And I know that we saw almost 50% increase in adoption rates using that technology. And I encourage every one of our customers to move to that model. As part of that, I also am extremely excited by the phenomenal success of our Pardot team in Atlanta, which is part of our Marketing Cloud. They have done a great job as well, which is the B2B marketing solution. So we not only have a tremendous B2C solution that has applicability throughout the enterprise, but we have an unbelievable B2B marketing solution, and both of those are just executing incredibly well. For those of you who know, we have taken a long time to build our Marketing Cloud strategy through -- primarily through acquisition. And we have now had a couple of years to be able to operate it, and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Some of our largest transactions in the quarter were done with the Marketing Cloud, and I don't know a customer who's not looking at it. It's just -- it's what you need to be able to connect with your customers on a day-by-day basis and minute-by-minute basis. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little insight into where we're going for Dreamforce, which is -- and as it relates to the Marketing Cloud, you know everyone probably who's listening to this call might be wearing some kind of a wearable. All those wearables are probably evolving very rapidly. Probably all of us will be wearing some kind of different wearables in the next 2 years. Everybody knows that we're moving to this incredible Internet of Things. That's part of it. We call it Internet of Customers. Every thing is going online. Everything has got an API. We're generating more data than ever before. 90% of the world's data was generated in the last 2 years. A lot of it is coming out of this machine data. Well, as all these things are happening, of course, you want to be able to connect everything and then have these directed journeys and messaging and be able to put everything online and have everything deeply integrated into your CRM systems. I don't think there's any other company in the world that's going to be able to show what we're going to show at Dreamforce, which is this idea that everything is connected, everything is online and that you're basically able to stay in touch with your customer minute by minute as it's happening. And that's all possible because of this Marketing Cloud, so I couldn't be more excited. I mean, between the Marketing Cloud, between the Analytics Cloud, between some of the exciting enhancements that are going to be coming for our core Salesforce and Service Cloud offerings and next-generation solutions there, we've got a lot of very, very exciting things planned for September."

Thanks, John, and thanks for everyone for joining us on the call today. You can just see why I am so excited because I'm thrilled to report that we had just an outstanding start to our fiscal 2016 and just great building on the phenomenal momentum from last year.
In this quarter, we surpassed the $6 billion annual revenue run rate, and we did that faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we could not be more excited. Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7 billion revenue run rate later this year, on the way to being the fastest to reach $10 billion, which is our dream and something that we are very focused on.
I'd like to share the results from the quarter. And revenue for the first quarter rose 23% from a year ago to more than $1.5 billion. In constant currency, revenue grew even faster at 27%. I mean, you can look at all the other top 10 software companies. No one is delivering this kind of performance. And as I said, we delivered this amazing growth as we pushed through the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone.
Deferred revenue grew more than $3 billion, up 31% year-over-year and 36% in constant currency. And the dollar value of booked business, on and off balance sheet, is now $9.1 billion, $9.1 billion. That's an increase of nearly $2 billion since last year. That is a very clear indicator of the strength of our future business. Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 200 basis points this quarter over last year. And as you can see, we're not just focused on growing the top line, we're also growing the bottom line. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $730 million in operating cash flow, which is up 54% year-over-year, and that's just an astonishing number.
Given our outstanding first quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our guidance for both our top and bottom line for fiscal year 2016. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.55 billion. And we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to $0.71, at the high end of our range. As you can see, our strong revenue, deferred revenue, operating cash performance, along with incredible momentum of our Customer Success Platform, puts us on a trajectory to be the fastest enterprise software company to deliver $10 billion in revenue.
We're achieving this level of performance and growing faster than the competition because we have a unique platform, a really unique company designed for today's connected world, designed for only one purpose, helping our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way and then ultimately, creating customer success.
Today, this call is taking place right here from the great city of Chicago. When I've been meeting with some of our great customers today like State Farm and Northern Trust, I've met with hundreds of customers from around the world in recent weeks I've been on a tour, and next month, I'm going to be taking that tour to Europe and spending the summer once again learning from our customers in the region and hearing about all the great things going on over there. And you can just see our European business is just awesome. And every CEO I've met with is feeling the impact of this technology moving faster and faster. Customers' employees are expecting deeper levels of engagement. They're creating these amazing one-on-one journeys. They're more automated, intelligent business processing. Everything is going mobile. Everything is available on their phone and soon, right on our wrists. 
Well, they're relying on Salesforce with our metadata-driven technology platform. Our 6 core clouds and incredible, incredible employees, our customer success services team and ecosystem of software developers, systems integrators, service providers, all of them, the whole ecosystem helping our customers move faster and transform their businesses to be more successful than ever before. That's why Gartner has ranked Salesforce as the worldwide market share leader in the CRM market for 2014, continuing more than a decade of growth and market share gains, while Oracle and SAP continue to fall behind. Well, we can certainly see that from their quarters, can't we?
You can see in the tremendous growth we've had across our 6 clouds and how we are outpacing the competition and taking market share at the expense of our competitors. Sales Cloud continues to be the market share leader in SFA by far, and on its own, one of the top pure-play enterprise cloud companies by revenue in the world. Service Cloud displaced SAP in the quarter and is now the market share leader in customer service and support. Sorry about that, SAP. And the Marketing Cloud, which was borne out of our acquisition of ExactTarget 2 years ago, is now the fastest-growing top 5 marketing vendor according to the latest Gartner report, taking market share while every other top 5 vendor is losing. Community Cloud continues to grow its market share, and we now have some of our largest partner communities in the world, dozens with more than 100,000 members. 
Our Wave Analytics Cloud has become a real game changer for us. I've never seen more excitement about this product. I've been demoing it everywhere I go. It's not just an analytics app, it's a platform with a whole ecosystem of partners and a development environment that lets you basically build any kind of analytics app our customers want.
You saw us deepen our relationship with Microsoft this quarter with the launch of Wave Connector for Excel, which transfers the Excel spreadsheets into visual, dynamic graphs in the Analytics Cloud with just a click. And we had a phenomenal demonstration of exciting new technology that we're building with Microsoft at their Build conference. And we also saw more revelation of that at Ignite. 
And we also launched Analytics Cloud for the Apple Watch, the first enterprise app from Apple's amazing new wearable. And we're really thrilled that Apple featured Analytics Cloud as one of the marquee apps in their launch.
The Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation for everything we develop, has been ranked by Gartner as the leading enterprise Platform as a Service for the second year in a row. We've seen tremendous momentum in the quarter with customers, with partners, with ISVs; now more than 2 million developers building apps on top of our platform. 
And that's reflected in our customer adoption and usage rates. They are just soaring. We delivered 211 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, 211 billion, up 79% from a year ago. That is astonishing. That's an average of more than 3.4 billion transactions every single business day, unprecedented in the technology industry.
Before I close, I want to mention the great work of Salesforce Foundation. The foundation now supporting 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs, and we've distributed more than $85 million in grants. And our employees have volunteered almost 1 million hours of community service, an increase of 300,000 hours since Q1 of last year. Just amazing.
Now I'll hand it off to Keith, who's in London, where he'll be keynoting our London world tour event tomorrow. And this is the largest cloud computing event in the region, with more than 13,000 people registered to attend. Now the world tour that we're all on will follow a record -- that we've had record attendance stops already in Melbourne and Amsterdam, here in Boston, in Chicago and Toronto. You're also welcome to join us for upcoming Salesforce World Tour stops. The next one's going to be Washington, D.C. next week, which will be incredible. And then we head to New York for Salesforce Connections, the largest digital marketing event in the world and our New York World Tour, which will be June 16, 17 and 18. You're going to not want to miss that. More than 15,000 people will join us. And I'll be keynoting the world tour events in Paris on June 25 and in Munich on July 2. If you haven't seen what's been going on in Europe, it's worth seeing just an amazing level of momentum with the cloud. And mark your calendars for the largest enterprise technology conference on the planet, Dreamforce. You may have heard of it. That's going to be happening September 15 to 18 in San Francisco. That is an event I am quite sure you will not want to miss.
Okay. Keith?"

It's great to be here in London. As Marc said, I love London. I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastes",1291,"Thanks, Marc. Greetings, everybody. It's great to be here in London. As Marc said, I love London. I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastest-growing region where we've now exceeded $1 billion in revenue over the past year. So congratulations to the entire team for really an incredible achievement. Suffice to say, that proved positive that the investments that we've been talking about and making internationally are absolutely playing off.
As Marc said, tomorrow I'm hosting our London Salesforce World Tour. We will have a record turnout expected. I've got a number of special guests joining me on stage, including executives from Barclays and British Airways. BSkyB will be with us, John Lewis, Vodafone and many others. We're also going to have an organization called CoderDojo, which is really a very incredible nonprofit here in the U.K., which teaches young kids how to code and adopt technology. So this is going to be a great event, really a world-class event.
And as you heard from Marc, we had a world-class first quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. You can see that in the results, and this is a great way for us to start our fiscal year. It really does set a terrific tone for the rest of the year, and we're very excited about it. So we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our customers of all sizes, all industries and all geographies. And what's interesting is they're transforming their business models and are doing this by leveraging our Customer Success Platform. And this is leading to larger deals in all segments and deeper and more meaningful strategic relationships. In fact, we hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions of any first quarter in the history of the company.
We saw some incredible wins in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the fact that 30% of our top deals were net new customers, and I'd like to share a few these stories. The first one is a company called WIG Telecom. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in France. It's a great new relationship that closed in the quarter, and they selected our Customer Success Platform to create an omnichannel digital experience for their 13 million customers across all their call centers, stores and online. Very exciting.
We also signed a major new deal with a transportation company, really one of the world's greatest brands in their category. They were using on-premise legacy technology from Oracle. And in the quarter, they decided to go all in with the cloud, and they plan to put Salesforce1 on the mobile devices and into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world. It was really just an incredible win, and I couldn't be prouder of the team for bringing in this new strategic relationship.
Also one of the largest deals in the quarter was a net new relationship with a Fortune 500 leader in retail. They were looking to consolidate all of their tools and campaigns and selected our Marketing Cloud as their company-wide digital marketing platform. As Marc mentioned, the Marketing Cloud is absolutely on fire. It is the tip of the spear for us with B2C companies. And it really is in almost every conversation that we're having with senior executives around the world. It's really terrific.
We're also seeing some significant expansions with our existing customers. Tyco, which is a brand that I'm sure many people recognize, it's a great example. They're a $10 billion leader in protection and security. They've been using Sales Cloud for years, and they expanded their relationship with us in the quarter with Service Cloud and Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform. So their vision is to really bring all of their teams together and transform their organization and build a global Customer Success Platform across sales and service and marketing.
Barclays, another great win. They started with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Communities. And now with the addition of Analytics Cloud in the quarter, Barclays will be putting real-time customer intelligence into the hands of their corporate bankers so they can make faster and smarter decisions right from their mobile devices. It's a great example of impact from the Analytics Cloud. And in my keynote tomorrow, Barclays is going to demonstrate how they use Salesforce to strip -- to transform their brokerage journey and build the most qualified digital workforce in financial services.
And speaking of financial services, we expanded our relationship with JPMorgan Investment Management. This is a customer that has been using us in a few of their divisions. And now they will be significantly increasing their deployment of Service Cloud as the CRM platform across their growing Mutual Funds division. So JPMorgan is yet another great example of how financial services companies are moving to the cloud.
Other new wins or expansions in Q1 include the Bank of America, Dentsu, Expedia, Hitachi, Japan Post, John Deere, Medtronic, TELUS, T-Mobile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Western Union and Zürich Insurance. So this is really, as you can see, a pretty incredible list of brands. And it shows the continued traction we're getting in our industry strategy. You're also going to see our industry strategy come into greater focus this summer when we introduce our first industry solution in wealth management.
Now I will tell you we've been able to achieve this level of customer success and growth because we are, without a doubt, the trusted enterprise cloud. And with this incredible culture of relentless innovation, a 16-year track record of customer success, no other technology provider is in a position to say this. We are all about customer success. And conversely, if you were paying attention to SAP's event a few years -- a few weeks ago, the CIO of the world's largest retailer, which is an SAP customer, she said she hopes to see an SAP implementation in her lifetime. And I think that spells it out. That is the difference between on-premise and the cloud. It doesn't sound like customer success to me, and we are all about customer success.
So we're seeing a growing trend of SAP and Oracle customers who are coming to us and talking to us and working with us to wraparound their legacy solution. They want us to be the agility layer to these legacy technologies. They want us to be able to unlock more value from their investments. And ultimately, it puts us on a path to a complete replacement in their front office.
In fact, I will tell you, a few days ago, I had a meeting with the COO of one of the world's largest banks. And they were incredibly excited about a strategy to ultimately replace all of their legacy customer-facing systems with our Customer Success Platform. So that's very exciting for us.
So before I close, I want to talk about our ecosystem. Marc touched on it a minute ago. It continues to thrive. We're the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. We had a huge milestone this quarter with over 3 million total installs from our AppExchange. We continue to develop more strategic ISV relationships on both the horizontal and vertical basis. And as I travel around the world and speak to customers and partners, it's pretty clear that the relationship with our global and regional SIs, it's just never been stronger.
So with that, I want to thank the entire team at Salesforce and congratulate them for delivering just a terrific and strong Q1 and a great start to the year. So over to you, Mark."
122917,292877187,820448,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2015",2015-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant-currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, wi",677,"Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant-currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $52 million and a sequential headwind of around $17 million. Our geographies also delivered strong growth on a constant-currency basis with the Americas growth of 27%, EMEA growth of 28% and Asia Pac of 27%. Dollar attrition for the first quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%.
Now while we continue to deliver industry-leading top line growth, we are thrilled to have expanded our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins by 197 basis points year-over-year. And by the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our top line outperformance, along with the improved expense controls, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 45% over last year and $0.02 higher than our guidance. Additionally, we've made great progress toward GAAP profitability in the quarter, including reducing our stock-based compensation to below 10% of revenue.
Now turning to cash flow. We delivered record operating cash flow in the quarter of $731 million. Now that's up 54% over last year. And as we've previously discussed, we anticipate that Q1 will continue to be the largest cash flow quarter. Now this is due to our seasonally strong Q4 and the compounding nature of our new and renewal business in the fourth quarter and the associated collections of our Q4 invoices in the first quarter. Now free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $660 million. That was up 60% over Q1 of last year. 
Looking at deferred revenue. We delivered another strong quarter with growth of 31% year-over-year, excluding an FX headwind of $69 million. Deferred revenue grew 36% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $18 million.
As a reminder, we calculate our FX on revenue using the average rates throughout the quarter. However, for deferred revenue, a balance sheet item, we use the spot rate on the last day of the quarter. Keep in mind, we conduct business in multiple currencies, including the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar and others. While the dollar exchange rates for most of these currencies were roughly flat at the end of the quarter, a stronger pound drove a slight sequential tailwind to the deferred revenue in Q1.
In the quarter, 75% of the value of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms.
Now let's move on to guidance. With our strong first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.52 billion to $6.55 billion for 22% growth at the high end. Now this guidance includes an anticipated FX headwind of about $175 million to $200 million.
In addition to raising our top line guidance, we're also pleased to be raising our bottom line as well. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 125 to 150 basis points this year. With our strong Q1 operating cash flow, we now anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%.
For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18 and deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20% range. Our guidance implies that OI&E will continue to be a net expense, and we assume a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and that we will not make significant acquisitions.
To close, we are very pleased with our fast start to fiscal 2016. We delivered outstanding results across the board. Our top and our bottom line outperformance drove record cash flow, and our backlog of booked business positions us extremely well for continued growth while we continue to deliver our non-GAAP operating margin expansion commitment.

There's never been an analytics product that's been built from the ground up as a multi-tenant cloud service built on a metadata platform that gives you the ability to build apps and deploy them rapidly. And I think you're going to see some amazing things with the Analytics Cloud when we get to Dreamforce as well. We've had some huge technical breakthroughs in our ability to build an ecosystem around the Analytics Cloud, and we plan to show those off. We've only been in this business about 90 days.

If you talk to Mark Hawkins, he will tell you that this finance organization at Salesforce, they are all using Analytics Cloud. Our Employee Success organization is all using Analytics Cloud. So this is a very compelling new product. Marc is absolutely correct. Within 2 weeks of announcing this at Dreamforce, we were closing deals in very large enterprises. So the market reaction has been very good. People are very excited about it. And there's no reason why this should not be in virtually all of our entire installed base."

We wanted to create a new technology model now known as the cloud. We wanted to create a new business model, which is singularly focused on the success of our customers and helping our customers to create new ways to connect with their customers and help them to innovate and transform their organizations. And three, we created a new profit model with 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees' time. And of course, that was very easy because we had no equity, we had no profit and we had no time. But I would say at this point, I mean, Salesforce has far exceeded our expectations over the last 16 years. But people are always overestimating what they can do in a year and underestimating what they can do in a decade in our business. And when I look out, what I see is we are absolutely committed to being the fastest software company ever to $10 billion. And I'm sure, Jason, if you look at your model, now with over $9 billion in deferred on and off the balance sheet, you can start to model exactly how fast that's going to be. I mean, it's record time. And we're going to squarely be very, very shortly the fourth largest software company in the world. Now when that happens, we are really targeting one company to surpass, which is SAP. Fortunately for us, their kind of lackluster growth execution and lack of innovation in their core products, as we saw on their conference this quarter, well, you know what, they're an easy target. And that's our next goal. But we've got our minds squarely on the prize, which is the $10 billion revenue run rate, and that's step 1. Step 2 is go past SAP. And I think we can absolutely do that, and I'm personally committed to making that happen. That's my dream. And I am super motivated every single day to get up and run a company that is doing well by doing good. We don't -- we're not just a software company, Jason, that's building products and selling them every day like the rest of the guys. We are a software company that is working hard to make the world a better place, not just through our innovation, but through our philanthropy and through our commitment to equality for all and also to inspire other entrepreneurs and other companies to do the same. I am sure your experience is the same as mine. When I meet the all these new companies, they've all got philanthropy built into their model, and they've all got fired-up entrepreneurs who are going to add value to their community and not just build products. And I hope that in some small way, we've inspired the industry to kind of get off its kind of traditional stinginess and to get out there and do something for other people. And that's what I'm excited about, and those are my goals going forward. Does that help clarify that?"

But I think from an operating margin viewpoint, one of the things that you should think about is that this squares very nicely with our revenue operating margin framework in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. So this fits very nicely. But what we're doing also, Ross, as you touch on, is we're making sure to make the votes -- or the investments rather that are essential to making sure that we grow not only this year but in '17 and well beyond to fulfill the vision that Marc had that articulated earlier on the call.

How do you think about what the profitability level of the company might look like knowing that there's a lot of different things that could happen? But how do you think about the profitability level that you'll be able to achieve once you get to that $10 billion target that looks increasingly in sight? And then the other question I had, Marc, was just Service Cloud had a big sequential acceleration this quarter. I'm just wondering, are there some factors you could share with us that are causing this? And where are we in the rip and replace of those massive Siebel call center systems that were put in place in the early 2000s?"

But, Heather, the $10 billion vision that Marc articulated, you can see us driving towards that. You're hearing loud and clear. I think that the profitability will be a function of the speed of how fast we get there. And when we talk about the revenue operating margin framework, very much it's correlated with the rate of the growth rate compared to the operating margin expansion. That's a higher-level framework that remains intact. We continue to execute that, and you can see it even in this period and the guidance for this year. But I do want to call out something, Heather, to try to get more context to the spirit of your question. When I look at the unit economics of what's happening in our business, the lifetime economics, I clearly see a business that's in the mid-30s in terms of operating margin. And that is really, I think, what we should think about when we get the business at a mature level of growth, in the mid-30s. That would be the key point. And in terms of the Service Cloud, one of the things that was most pleasing to look at is just the amazing amount of market share we took, that Gartner just took where we made really real progress on the market share, where we ripped over 300 basis points. We displaced basically SAP and are making real progress. But let me just see if there's other commentary on that."

So one of the themes that we're hearing as we go around the world and we're talking to CEOs is that companies are transforming themselves and they are differentiating, Heather, around service. If you talk to GE, if you talk to Philips, they are trying to transform themselves into service companies and they're leveraging our Customer Success Platform to do that. It's very interesting because it's an opportunity for them to change their business model. They are leveraging our platform, and many of them are asking us to wrap an agility layer around their existing legacy systems. Now that could be a homegrown system, but more often or not -- than not, that's Oracle and SAP. And ultimately, the game plan here is to surround them and eventually replace them. So the overwhelming message from customers is they want to get out of the maintenance game and they want to get into the innovation and transformation game. And that's what they see in the Customer Success Platform, and that's what's going on in the marketplace."

And our people feel really, really good about what they're doing and the success that they're enjoying with our customers. With respect to our industry strategy and execution around the product, for the most part, we have already started to pivot around an industry orientation as we're organized in the field. So our distribution model is gradually moving towards an industry orientation over the last couple of years. It's hard to believe that in June will be my 2-year anniversary. But over the last couple of years, we've started to pivot towards vertical selling organizations. And that is kind of a natural tip of the spear for these solutions that we'll be bringing out."

We're tightly integrated with their partners. And it's been a huge boom for them to be able to increase their store traffic, that they get actual results. I mean, I know that because Salesforce uses our Community Cloud every day, but I don't know a customer that's not planning to deploy this product. I mean, this is something that's extremely important for every company, whether they're a B2C company or a B2B company, and being able to aggregate their customers and unite them with their employees. As you know, we have a very -- a strong integrated system of engagement with our core product. And that system of engagement is tightly integrated with our system of record and is now with our Analytics Cloud, tightly integrated with our system of intelligence. So a system of record tightly integrated with a system of intelligence, tightly integrated with the system of engagement. And that system of engagement is extended into those core customer offerings through our Community Cloud. And that's the right architecture. That's the right products. It's had phenomenal success, super high growth rate, and I expect continued great performance from it this year."

Those other products are really isolated and used by analysts, and they're not analytics for everyone. They're certainly not analytics for the rest of us. They don't run well on iPhones and Android devices. They don't run on the Apple Watch. They don't run -- you can't spin it up instantly in our cloud environment. So this is just an extraordinary offering, and it is only -- well, I've obviously seen the next 2 versions, and it is just going to get better and better and better.

They can build journeys for their employees. They can build journeys for their partners, journeys for their products. I mean, we just used it ourself to build something called Adoption Manager for Salesforce1. And when you are using Salesforce1, you now have the ability to turn on something called Adoption Manager. You're basically turning on Journey Builder and the Marketing Cloud. And I know that we saw almost 50% increase in adoption rates using that technology. And I encourage every one of our customers to move to that model. As part of that, I also am extremely excited by the phenomenal success of our Pardot team in Atlanta, which is part of our Marketing Cloud. They have done a great job as well, which is the B2B marketing solution. So we not only have a tremendous B2C solution that has applicability throughout the enterprise, but we have an unbelievable B2B marketing solution, and both of those are just executing incredibly well. For those of you who know, we have taken a long time to build our Marketing Cloud strategy through -- primarily through acquisition. And we have now had a couple of years to be able to operate it, and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Some of our largest transactions in the quarter were done with the Marketing Cloud, and I don't know a customer who's not looking at it. It's just -- it's what you need to be able to connect with your customers on a day-by-day basis and minute-by-minute basis. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little insight into where we're going for Dreamforce, which is -- and as it relates to the Marketing Cloud, you know everyone probably who's listening to this call might be wearing some kind of a wearable. All those wearables are probably evolving very rapidly. Probably all of us will be wearing some kind of different wearable in the next 2 years. Everybody knows that we're moving to this incredible Internet of Things. That's part of it. We call it Internet of Customers. Everything is going online. Everything's got an API. We're generating more data than ever before. 90% of the world's data was generated in the last 2 years. A lot of it is coming out of this machine data. Well, as all these things are happening, of course, you want to be able to connect everything and then have these directed journeys and messaging and be able to put everything online and have everything deeply integrated into your CRM systems. I don't think there's any other company in the world that's going to be able to show what we're going to show at Dreamforce, which is this idea that everything is connected, everything's online and that you're basically able to stay in touch with your customer minute by minute as it's happening. And that's just all possible because of this Marketing Cloud, so I couldn't be more excited. I mean, between the Marketing Cloud, between the Analytics Cloud, between some of the exciting enhancements that are going to be coming in for our core Salesforce and Service Cloud offerings and next-generation solutions there, we've got a lot of very, very exciting things planned for September."

Thanks, John, and thanks for everyone for joining us on the call today. You can just see why I am so excited because I'm thrilled to report that we had just an outstanding start to our fiscal 2016 and just great building on the phenomenal momentum from last year.
In this quarter, we surpassed the $6 billion annual revenue run rate, and we did that faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we could not be more excited. Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7 billion revenue run rate later this year, on the way to being the fastest to reach $10 billion, which is our dream and something that we are very focused on.
I'd like to share the results from the quarter. And revenue for the first quarter rose 23% from a year ago to more than $1.5 billion. In constant currency, revenue grew even faster at 27%. I mean, you can look at all the other top 10 software companies. No one is delivering this kind of performance. And as I said, we delivered this amazing growth as we pushed through the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone.
Deferred revenue grew more than $3 billion, up 31% year-over-year and 36% in constant currency. And the dollar value of booked business, on and off balance sheet, is now $9.1 billion, $9.1 billion. That's an increase of nearly $2 billion since last year. That is a very clear indicator of the strength of our future business. Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 200 basis points this quarter over last year. And as you can see, we're not just focused on growing the top line, we're also growing the bottom line. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $730 million in operating cash flow, which is up 54% year-over-year, and that's just an astonishing number.
Given our outstanding first quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our guidance for both our top and bottom line for fiscal year 2016. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.55 billion. And we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to $0.71, at the high end of our range. As you can see, our strong revenue, deferred revenue, operating cash performance, along with incredible momentum of our Customer Success Platform, puts us on a trajectory to be the fastest enterprise software company to deliver $10 billion in revenue.
We're achieving this level of performance and growing faster than the competition because we have a unique platform, a really unique company designed for today's connected world, designed for only one purpose, helping our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way and then ultimately, creating customer success.
Today, this call is taking place right here from the great city of Chicago. When I've been meeting with some of our great customers today like State Farm and Northern Trust, I've met with hundreds of customers from around the world in recent weeks I've been on a tour, and next month, I'm going to be taking that tour to Europe and spending the summer once again learning from our customers in the region and hearing about all the great things going on over there. And you can just see our European business is just awesome. And every CEO I've met with is feeling the impact of this technology moving faster and faster. Customers' employees are expecting deeper levels of engagement. They're creating these amazing one-on-one journeys. They're more automated, intelligent business processing. Everything is going mobile. Everything is available on their phone and soon, right on our wrists. 
Well, they're relying on Salesforce with our metadata-driven technology platform. Our 6 core clouds and incredible, incredible employees, our customer success services team and ecosystem of software developers, systems integrators, service providers, all of them, the whole ecosystem helping our customers move faster and transform their businesses to be more successful than ever before. That's why Gartner has ranked Salesforce as the worldwide market share leader in the CRM market for 2014, continuing more than a decade of growth and market share gains, while Oracle and SAP continue to fall behind. Well, we can certainly see that from their quarters, can't we?
You can see in the tremendous growth we've had across our 6 clouds and how we are outpacing the competition and taking market share at the expense of our competitors. Sales Cloud continues to be the market share leader in SFA by far, and on its own, one of the top pure-play enterprise cloud companies by revenue in the world. Service Cloud displaced SAP in the quarter and is now the market share leader in customer service and support. Sorry about that, SAP. And the Marketing Cloud, which was borne out of our acquisition of ExactTarget 2 years ago, is now the fastest-growing top 5 marketing vendor according to the latest Gartner report, taking market share while every other top 5 vendor is losing. Community Cloud continues to grow its market share, and we now have some of our largest partner communities in the world, dozens with more than 100,000 members. 
Our Wave Analytics Cloud has become a real game changer for us. I've never seen more excitement about this product. I've been demoing it everywhere I go. It's not just an analytics app, it's a platform with a whole ecosystem of partners and a development environment that lets you basically build any kind of analytics app our customers want.
You saw us deepen our relationship with Microsoft this quarter with the launch of Wave Connector for Excel, which transfers the Excel spreadsheets into visual, dynamic graphs in the Analytics Cloud with just a click. And we had a phenomenal demonstration of exciting new technology that we're building with Microsoft at their Build conference. And we also saw more revelation of that at Ignite. 
And we also launched Analytics Cloud for the Apple Watch, the first enterprise app from Apple's amazing new wearable. And we're really thrilled that Apple featured Analytics Cloud as one of the marquee apps in their launch.
The Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation for everything we develop, has been ranked by Gartner as the leading enterprise Platform as a Service for the second year in a row. We've seen tremendous momentum in the quarter with customers, with partners, with ISVs; now more than 2 million developers building apps on top of our platform. 
And that's reflected in our customer adoption and usage rates. They are just soaring. We delivered 211 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, 211 billion, up 79% from a year ago. That is astonishing. That's an average of more than 3.4 billion transactions every single business day, unprecedented in the technology industry.
Before I close, I want to mention the great work of Salesforce Foundation. The foundation now supporting 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs, and we've distributed more than $85 million in grants. And our employees have volunteered almost 1 million hours of community service, an increase of 300,000 hours since Q1 of last year. Just amazing.
Now I'll hand it off to Keith, who's in London, where he'll be keynoting our London world tour event tomorrow. And this is the largest cloud computing event in the region, with more than 13,000 people registered to attend. Now the world tour that we're all on will follow a record -- that we've had record attendance stops already in Melbourne and Amsterdam, here in Boston, in Chicago and Toronto. You're also welcome to join us for upcoming Salesforce World Tour stops. The next one's going to be Washington, D.C. next week, which will be incredible. And then we head to New York for Salesforce Connections, the largest digital marketing event in the world and our New York World Tour, which will be June 16, 17 and 18. You're going to not want to miss that. More than 15,000 people will join us. And I'll be keynoting the world tour events in Paris on June 25 and in Munich on July 2. If you haven't seen what's been going on in Europe, it's worth seeing just an amazing level of momentum with the cloud. And mark your calendars for the largest enterprise technology conference on the planet, Dreamforce. You may have heard of it. That's going to be happening September 15 to 18 in San Francisco. That is an event I am quite sure you will not want to miss.
Okay. Keith?"

It's great to be here in London. As Marc said, I love London. I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastes",1291,"Thanks, Marc. Greetings, everybody. It's great to be here in London. As Marc said, I love London. I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastest-growing region where we've now exceeded $1 billion in revenue over the past year. So congratulations to the entire team for really an incredible achievement. Suffice to say, that proved positive that the investments that we've been talking about and making internationally are absolutely playing off.
As Marc said, tomorrow I'm hosting our London Salesforce World Tour. We will have a record turnout expected. I've got a number of special guests joining me on stage, including executives from Barclays and British Airways. BSkyB will be with us, John Lewis, Vodafone and many others. We're also going to have an organization called CoderDojo, which is really a very incredible nonprofit here in the U.K., which teaches young kids how to code and adopt technology. So this is going to be a great event, really a world-class event.
And as you heard from Marc, we had a world-class first quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. You can see that in the results, and this is a great way for us to start our fiscal year. It really does set a terrific tone for the rest of the year, and we're very excited about it. So we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our customers of all sizes, all industries and all geographies. And what's interesting is they're transforming their business models and are doing this by leveraging our Customer Success Platform. And this is leading to larger deals in all segments and deeper and more meaningful strategic relationships. In fact, we hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions of any first quarter in the history of the company.
We saw some incredible wins in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the fact that 30% of our top deals were net new customers, and I'd like to share a few these stories. The first one is a company called WIG Telecom. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in France. It's a great new relationship that closed in the quarter, and they selected our Customer Success Platform to create an omnichannel digital experience for their 13 million customers across all their call centers, stores and online. Very exciting.
We also signed a major new deal with a transportation company, really one of the world's greatest brands in their category. They were using on-premise legacy technology from Oracle. And in the quarter, they decided to go all in with the cloud, and they plan to put Salesforce1 on the mobile devices and into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world. It was really just an incredible win, and I couldn't be prouder of the team for bringing in this new strategic relationship.
Also one of the largest deals in the quarter was a net new relationship with a Fortune 500 leader in retail. They were looking to consolidate all of their tools and campaigns and selected our Marketing Cloud as their company-wide digital marketing platform. As Marc mentioned, the Marketing Cloud is absolutely on fire. It is the tip of the spear for us with B2C companies. And it really is in almost every conversation that we're having with senior executives around the world. It's really terrific.
We're also seeing some significant expansions with our existing customers. Tyco, which is a brand that I'm sure many people recognize, it's a great example. They're a $10 billion leader in protection and security. They've been using Sales Cloud for years, and they expanded their relationship with us in the quarter with Service Cloud and Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform. So their vision is to really bring all of their teams together and transform their organization and build a global Customer Success Platform across sales and service and marketing.
Barclays, another great win. They started with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Communities. And now with the addition of Analytics Cloud in the quarter, Barclays will be putting real-time customer intelligence into the hands of their corporate bankers so they can make faster and smarter decisions right from their mobile devices. It's a great example of impact from the Analytics Cloud. And in my keynote tomorrow, Barclays is going to demonstrate how they use Salesforce to strip -- to transform their brokerage journey and build the most qualified digital workforce in financial services.
And speaking of financial services, we expanded our relationship with JPMorgan Investment Management. This is a customer that has been using us in a few of their divisions. And now they will be significantly increasing their deployment of Service Cloud as the CRM platform across their growing Mutual Funds division. So JPMorgan is yet another great example of how financial services companies are moving to the cloud.
Other new wins or expansions in Q1 include the Bank of America, Dentsu, Expedia, Hitachi, Japan Post, John Deere, Medtronic, TELUS, T-Mobile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Western Union and Zürich Insurance. So this is really, as you can see, a pretty incredible list of brands. And it shows the continued traction we're getting in our industry strategy. You're also going to see our industry strategy come into greater focus this summer when we introduce our first industry solution in wealth management.
Now I will tell you we've been able to achieve this level of customer success and growth because we are, without a doubt, the trusted enterprise cloud. And with this incredible culture of relentless innovation, a 16-year track record of customer success, no other technology provider is in a position to say this. We are all about customer success. And conversely, if you were paying attention to SAP's event a few years -- a few weeks ago, the CIO of the world's largest retailer, which is an SAP customer, she said she hopes to see an SAP implementation in her lifetime. And I think that spells it out. That is the difference between on-premise and the cloud. It doesn't sound like customer success to me, and we are all about customer success.
So we're seeing a growing trend of SAP and Oracle customers who are coming to us and talking to us and working with us to wraparound their legacy solution. They want us to be the agility layer to these legacy technologies. They want us to be able to unlock more value from their investments. And ultimately, it puts us on a path to a complete replacement in their front office.
In fact, I will tell you, a few days ago, I had a meeting with the COO of one of the world's largest banks. And they were incredibly excited about a strategy to ultimately replace all of their legacy customer-facing systems with our Customer Success Platform. So that's very exciting for us.
So before I close, I want to talk about our ecosystem. Marc touched on it a minute ago. It continues to thrive. We're the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. We had a huge milestone this quarter with over 3 million total installs from our AppExchange. We continue to develop more strategic ISV relationships on both the horizontal and vertical basis. And as I travel around the world and speak to customers and partners, it's pretty clear that the relationship with our global and regional SIs, it's just never been stronger.
So with that, I want to thank the entire team at Salesforce and congratulate them for delivering just a terrific and strong Q1 and a great start to the year. So over to you, Mark."
122917,292877187,820449,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2015",2015-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant-currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, wi",677,"Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant-currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $52 million and a sequential headwind of around $17 million. Our geographies also delivered strong growth on a constant-currency basis with the Americas growth of 27%, EMEA growth of 28% and Asia Pac of 27%. Dollar attrition for the first quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%.
Now while we continue to deliver industry-leading top line growth, we are thrilled to have expanded our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins by 197 basis points year-over-year. And by the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our top line outperformance, along with the improved expense controls, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 45% over last year and $0.02 higher than our guidance. Additionally, we've made great progress toward GAAP profitability in the quarter, including reducing our stock-based compensation to below 10% of revenue.
Now turning to cash flow. We delivered record operating cash flow in the quarter of $731 million. Now that's up 54% over last year. And as we've previously discussed, we anticipate that Q1 will continue to be the largest cash flow quarter. Now this is due to our seasonally strong Q4 and the compounding nature of our new and renewal business in the fourth quarter and the associated collections of our Q4 invoices in the first quarter. Now free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $660 million. That was up 60% over Q1 of last year. 
Looking at deferred revenue. We delivered another strong quarter with growth of 31% year-over-year, excluding an FX headwind of $69 million. Deferred revenue grew 36% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $18 million.
As a reminder, we calculate our FX on revenue using the average rates throughout the quarter. However, for deferred revenue, a balance sheet item, we use the spot rate on the last day of the quarter. Keep in mind, we conduct business in multiple currencies, including the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar and others. While the dollar exchange rates for most of these currencies were roughly flat at the end of the quarter, a stronger pound drove a slight sequential tailwind to the deferred revenue in Q1.
In the quarter, 75% of the value of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms.
Now let's move on to guidance. With our strong first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.52 billion to $6.55 billion for 22% growth at the high end. Now this guidance includes an anticipated FX headwind of about $175 million to $200 million.
In addition to raising our top line guidance, we're also pleased to be raising our bottom line as well. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 125 to 150 basis points this year. With our strong Q1 operating cash flow, we now anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%.
For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18 and deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20% range. Our guidance implies that OI&E will continue to be a net expense, and we assume a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and that we will not make significant acquisitions.
To close, we are very pleased with our fast start to fiscal 2016. We delivered outstanding results across the board. Our top and our bottom line outperformance drove record cash flow, and our backlog of booked business positions us extremely well for continued growth while we continue to deliver our non-GAAP operating margin expansion commitment.

There's never been an analytics product that's been built from the ground up as a multi-tenant cloud service built on a metadata platform that gives you the ability to build apps and deploy them rapidly. And I think you're going to see some amazing things with the Analytics Cloud when we get to Dreamforce as well.

So this is a very compelling new product. Marc is absolutely correct. Within 2 weeks of announcing this at Dreamforce, we were closing deals in very large enterprises. So the market reaction has been very good. People are very excited about it. And there's no reason why this should not be in virtually all of our entire installed base."

We wanted to create a new technology model now known as the cloud. We wanted to create a new business model, which is singularly focused on the success of our customers and helping our customers to create new ways to connect with their customers and help them to innovate and transform their organizations. And three, we created a new profit model with 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees' time. And of course, that was very easy because we had no equity, we had no profit and we had no time. But I would say at this point, I mean, Salesforce has far exceeded our expectations over the last 16 years. But people are always overestimating what they can do in a year and underestimating what they can do in a decade in our business. And when I look out, what I see is we are absolutely committed to being the fastest software company ever to $10 billion. And I'm sure, Jason, if you look at your model, now with over $9 billion in deferred on and off the balance sheet, you can start to model exactly how fast that's going to be. I mean, it's record time. And we're going to squarely be very, very shortly the fourth largest software company in the world. Now when that happens, we are really targeting one company to surpass, which is SAP. Fortunately for us, their kind of lackluster growth execution and lack of innovation in their core products, as we saw on their conference this quarter, well, you know what, they're an easy target. And that's our next goal. But we've got our minds squarely on the prize, which is the $10 billion revenue run rate, and that's step 1. Step 2 is go past SAP. And I think we can absolutely do that, and I'm personally committed to making that happen. That's my dream. And I am super motivated every single day to get up and run a company that is doing well by doing good. We don't -- we're not just a software company, Jason, that's building products and selling them every day like the rest of the guys. We are a software company that is working hard to make the world a better place, not just through our innovation, but through our philanthropy and through our commitment to equality for all and also to inspire other entrepreneurs and other companies to do the same. I am sure your experience is the same as mine. When I meet the all these new companies, they've all got philanthropy built into their model, and they've all got fired-up entrepreneurs who are going to add value to their community and not just build products. And I hope that in some small way, we've inspired the industry to kind of get off its kind of traditional stinginess and to get out there and do something for other people. And that's what I'm excited about, and those are my goals going forward. Does that help clarify that?"

And yes, definitely we feel great about the quarter. I think -- and one of the things I would say on the -- certainly the operating margin expansion, fourth quarter in a row, we feel really great about the fact that for the full year, we guide this 125 to 150 basis points on an even bigger revenue base, right, because we raised the revenue base and we're showing even more EPS. But I think from an operating margin viewpoint, one of the things that you should think about is that this squares very nicely with our revenue operating margin framework in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. So this fits very nicely. But what we're doing also, Ross, as you touch on, is we're making sure to make the votes -- or the investments rather that are essential to making sure that we grow not only this year but in '17 and well beyond to fulfill the vision that Marc had that articulated earlier on the call. So we feel good about this. It's squarely within the framework. We're delivering on our commitments even on a higher base."

And customers really want to leverage our Customer Success Platform to help their customers succeed. So it's a pretty common theme around the Customer Success Platform and industry orientation. I mean, if I look at the -- kind of the larger deals in the quarter that I just went through here, many of these were in financial services, many of these were in telecommunications, some in public sector. And these are kind of the strike-zone industries that we're focusing our attention on.

But, Heather, the $10 billion vision that Marc articulated, you can see us driving towards that. You're hearing loud and clear. I think that the profitability will be a function of the speed of how fast we get there. And when we talk about the revenue operating margin framework, very much it's correlated with the rate of the growth rate compared to the operating margin expansion. That's a higher-level framework that remains intact. We continue to execute that, and you can see it even in this period and the guidance for this year. But I do want to call out something, Heather, to try to get more context to the spirit of your question. When I look at the unit economics of what's happening in our business, the lifetime economics, I clearly see a business that's in the mid-30s in terms of operating margin. And that is really, I think, what we should think about when we get the business at a mature level of growth, in the mid-30s. That would be the key point. And in terms of the Service Cloud, one of the things that was most pleasing to look at is just the amazing amount of market share we took, that Gartner just took where we made really real progress on the market share, where we ripped over 300 basis points. We displaced basically SAP and are making real progress. But let me just see if there's other commentary on that."

If you talk to GE, if you talk to Philips, they are trying to transform themselves into service companies and they're leveraging our Customer Success Platform to do that. It's very interesting because it's an opportunity for them to change their business model. They are leveraging our platform, and many of them are asking us to wrap an agility layer around their existing legacy systems. Now that could be a homegrown system, but more often or not -- than not, that's Oracle and SAP. And ultimately, the game plan here is to surround them and eventually replace them. So the overwhelming message from customers is they want to get out of the maintenance game and they want to get into the innovation and transformation game. And that's what they see in the Customer Success Platform, and that's what's going on in the marketplace."

You're basically turning on Journey Builder and the Marketing Cloud. And I know that we saw almost 50% increase in adoption rates using that technology. And I encourage every one of our customers to move to that model. As part of that, I also am extremely excited by the phenomenal success of our Pardot team in Atlanta, which is part of our Marketing Cloud. They have done a great job as well, which is the B2B marketing solution. So we not only have a tremendous B2C solution that has applicability throughout the enterprise, but we have an unbelievable B2B marketing solution, and both of those are just executing incredibly well. For those of you who know, we have taken a long time to build our Marketing Cloud strategy through -- primarily through acquisition. And we have now had a couple of years to be able to operate it, and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Some of our largest transactions in the quarter were done with the Marketing Cloud, and I don't know a customer who's not looking at it. It's just -- it's what you need to be able to connect with your customers on a day-by-day basis and minute-by-minute basis. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little insight into where we're going for Dreamforce, which is -- and as it relates to the Marketing Cloud, you know everyone probably who's listening to this call might be wearing some kind of a wearable. All those wearables are probably evolving very rapidly. Probably all of us will be wearing some kind of different wearable in the next 2 years. Everybody knows that we're moving to this incredible Internet of Things. That's part of it. We call it Internet of Customers. Everything is going online. Everything's got an API. We're generating more data than ever before. 90% of the world's data was generated in the last 2 years. A lot of it is coming out of this machine data. Well, as all these things are happening, of course, you want to be able to connect everything and then have these directed journeys and messaging and be able to put everything online and have everything deeply integrated into your CRM systems. I don't think there's any other company in the world that's going to be able to show what we're going to show at Dreamforce, which is this idea that everything is connected, everything's online and that you're basically able to stay in touch with your customer minute by minute as it's happening. And that's just all possible because of this Marketing Cloud, so I couldn't be more excited. I mean, between the Marketing Cloud, between the Analytics Cloud, between some of the exciting enhancements that are going to be coming in for our core Salesforce and Service Cloud offerings and next-generation solutions there, we've got a lot of very, very exciting things planned for September."

It is a flagship product, and we continue to take net new logos all over the world in all shapes, size, forms of companies in all industries. And arguably, you could say it's the most loved sales app in the world. So we see an awful lot of interest in our Sales Cloud as a standalone product but also as part of the Customer Success Platform. And it goes back to customers really want to be engaged -- more engaged, more deeply -- have deeper relationships with their customers and drive success. And that's what this Customer Success Platform is all about. So this is a $2.5 billion run rate business. As a cloud, it's one of the top 8 standalone largest cloud companies. We keep getting accolades from Gartner. So this is really a very successful product, a very successful solution as a standalone. And it's part of a greater solution, and that's what customers want. They want impact. They want transformational value. They want innovation, and they want success for their customers. And that's why we're so well positioned, and we still have so much momentum."

Thanks, John, and thanks for everyone for joining us on the call today. You can just see why I am so excited because I'm thrilled to report that we had just an outstanding start to our fiscal 2016 and just great building on the phenomenal momentum from last year.
In this quarter, we surpassed the $6 billion annual revenue run rate, and we did that faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we could not be more excited. Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7 billion revenue run rate later this year, on the way to being the fastest to reach $10 billion, which is our dream and something that we are very focused on.
I'd like to share the results from the quarter. And revenue for the first quarter rose 23% from a year ago to more than $1.5 billion. In constant currency, revenue grew even faster at 27%. I mean, you can look at all the other top 10 software companies. No one is delivering this kind of performance. And as I said, we delivered this amazing growth as we pushed through the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone.
Deferred revenue grew more than $3 billion, up 31% year-over-year and 36% in constant currency. And the dollar value of booked business, on and off balance sheet, is now $9.1 billion, $9.1 billion. That's an increase of nearly $2 billion since last year. That is a very clear indicator of the strength of our future business. Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 200 basis points this quarter over last year. And as you can see, we're not just focused on growing the top line, we're also growing the bottom line. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $730 million in operating cash flow, which is up 54% year-over-year, and that's just an astonishing number.
Given our outstanding first quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our guidance for both our top and bottom line for fiscal year 2016. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.55 billion. And we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to $0.71, at the high end of our range. As you can see, our strong revenue, deferred revenue, operating cash performance, along with incredible momentum of our Customer Success Platform, puts us on a trajectory to be the fastest enterprise software company to deliver $10 billion in revenue.
We're achieving this level of performance and growing faster than the competition because we have a unique platform, a really unique company designed for today's connected world, designed for only one purpose, helping our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way and then ultimately, creating customer success.
Today, this call is taking place right here from the great city of Chicago. When I've been meeting with some of our great customers today like State Farm and Northern Trust, I've met with hundreds of customers from around the world in recent weeks I've been on a tour, and next month, I'm going to be taking that tour to Europe and spending the summer once again learning from our customers in the region and hearing about all the great things going on over there. And you can just see our European business is just awesome. And every CEO I've met with is feeling the impact of this technology moving faster and faster. Customers' employees are expecting deeper levels of engagement. They're creating these amazing one-on-one journeys. They're more automated, intelligent business processing. Everything is going mobile. Everything is available on their phone and soon, right on our wrists. 
Well, they're relying on Salesforce with our metadata-driven technology platform. Our 6 core clouds and incredible, incredible employees, our customer success services team and ecosystem of software developers, systems integrators, service providers, all of them, the whole ecosystem helping our customers move faster and transform their businesses to be more successful than ever before. That's why Gartner has ranked Salesforce as the worldwide market share leader in the CRM market for 2014, continuing more than a decade of growth and market share gains, while Oracle and SAP continue to fall behind. Well, we can certainly see that from their quarters, can't we?
You can see in the tremendous growth we've had across our 6 clouds and how we are outpacing the competition and taking market share at the expense of our competitors. Sales Cloud continues to be the market share leader in SFA by far, and on its own, one of the top pure-play enterprise cloud companies by revenue in the world. Service Cloud displaced SAP in the quarter and is now the market share leader in customer service and support. Sorry about that, SAP. And the Marketing Cloud, which was borne out of our acquisition of ExactTarget 2 years ago, is now the fastest-growing top 5 marketing vendor according to the latest Gartner report, taking market share while every other top 5 vendor is losing. Community Cloud continues to grow its market share, and we now have some of our largest partner communities in the world, dozens with more than 100,000 members. 
Our Wave Analytics Cloud has become a real game changer for us. I've never seen more excitement about this product. I've been demoing it everywhere I go. It's not just an analytics app, it's a platform with a whole ecosystem of partners and a development environment that lets you basically build any kind of analytics app our customers want.
You saw us deepen our relationship with Microsoft this quarter with the launch of Wave Connector for Excel, which transfers the Excel spreadsheets into visual, dynamic graphs in the Analytics Cloud with just a click. And we had a phenomenal demonstration of exciting new technology that we're building with Microsoft at their Build conference. And we also saw more revelation of that at Ignite. 
And we also launched Analytics Cloud for the Apple Watch, the first enterprise app from Apple's amazing new wearable. And we're really thrilled that Apple featured Analytics Cloud as one of the marquee apps in their launch.
The Salesforce1 Platform, the foundation for everything we develop, has been ranked by Gartner as the leading enterprise Platform as a Service for the second year in a row. We've seen tremendous momentum in the quarter with customers, with partners, with ISVs; now more than 2 million developers building apps on top of our platform. 
And that's reflected in our customer adoption and usage rates. They are just soaring. We delivered 211 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, 211 billion, up 79% from a year ago. That is astonishing. That's an average of more than 3.4 billion transactions every single business day, unprecedented in the technology industry.
Before I close, I want to mention the great work of Salesforce Foundation. The foundation now supporting 25,000 nonprofits and NGOs, and we've distributed more than $85 million in grants. And our employees have volunteered almost 1 million hours of community service, an increase of 300,000 hours since Q1 of last year. Just amazing.
Now I'll hand it off to Keith, who's in London, where he'll be keynoting our London world tour event tomorrow. And this is the largest cloud computing event in the region, with more than 13,000 people registered to attend. Now the world tour that we're all on will follow a record -- that we've had record attendance stops already in Melbourne and Amsterdam, here in Boston, in Chicago and Toronto. You're also welcome to join us for upcoming Salesforce World Tour stops. The next one's going to be Washington, D.C. next week, which will be incredible. And then we head to New York for Salesforce Connections, the largest digital marketing event in the world and our New York World Tour, which will be June 16, 17 and 18. You're going to not want to miss that. More than 15,000 people will join us. And I'll be keynoting the world tour events in Paris on June 25 and in Munich on July 2. If you haven't seen what's been going on in Europe, it's worth seeing just an amazing level of momentum with the cloud. And mark your calendars for the largest enterprise technology conference on the planet, Dreamforce. You may have heard of it. That's going to be happening September 15 to 18 in San Francisco. That is an event I am quite sure you will not want to miss.
Okay. Keith?"

And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastest-growing region where we've now exceeded $1 billion in revenue over the past year. So congratulations to the entire team for really an incredible achievement. Suffice to say, that proved positive that the investments that we've been talking about and making internationally are absolutely playing off.
As Marc said, tomorrow I'm hosting our London Salesforce World Tour. We will have a record turnout expected. I've got a number of special guests joining me on stage, including executives from Barclays and British Airways. BSkyB will be with us, John Lewis, Vodafone and many others. We're also going to have an organization called CoderDojo, which is really a very incredible nonprofit here in the U.K., which teaches young kids how to code and adopt technology. So this is going to be a great event, really a world-class event.
And as you heard from Marc, we had a world-class first quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. You can see that in the results, and this is a great way for us to start our fiscal year. It really does set a terrific tone for the rest of the year, and we're very excited about it. So we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our customers of all sizes, all industries and all geographies. And what's interesting is they're transforming their business models and are doing this by leveraging our Customer Success Platform. And this is leading to larger deals in all segments and deeper and more meaningful strategic relationships. In fact, we hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions of any first quarter in the history of the company.
We saw some incredible wins in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the fact that 30% of our top deals were net new customers, and I'd like to share a few these stories. The first one is a company called WIG Telecom. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in France. It's a great new relationship that closed in the quarter, and they selected our Customer Success Platform to create an omnichannel digital experience for their 13 million customers across all their call centers, stores and online. Very exciting.
We also signed a major new deal with a transportation company, really one of the world's greatest brands in their category. They were using on-premise legacy technology from Oracle. And in the quarter, they decided to go all in with the cloud, and they plan to put Salesforce1 on the mobile devices and into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world. It was really just an incredible win, and I couldn't be prouder of the team for bringing in this new strategic relationship.
Also one of the largest deals in the quarter was a net new relationship with a Fortune 500 leader in retail. They were looking to consolidate all of their tools and campaigns and selected our Marketing Cloud as their company-wide digital marketing platform. As Marc mentioned, the Marketing Cloud is absolutely on fire. It is the tip of the spear for us with B2C companies. And it really is in almost every conversation that we're having with senior executives around the world. It's really terrific.
We're also seeing some significant expansions with our existing customers. Tyco, which is a brand that I'm sure many people recognize, it's a great example. They're a $10 billion leader in protection and security. They've been using Sales Cloud for years, and they expanded their relationship with us in the quarter with Service Cloud and Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform. So their vision is to really bring all of their teams together and transform their organization and build a global Customer Success Platform across sales and service and marketing.
Barclays, another great win. They started with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Communities. And now with the addition of Analytics Cloud in the quarter, Barclays will be putting real-time customer intelligence into the hands of their corporate bankers so they can make faster and smarter decisions right from their mobile devices. It's a great example of impact from the Analytics Cloud. And in my keynote tomorrow, Barclays is going to demonstrate how they use Salesforce to strip -- to transform their brokerage journey and build the most qualified digital workforce in financial services.
And speaking of financial services, we expanded our relationship with JPMorgan Investment Management. This is a customer that has been using us in a few of their divisions. And now they will be significantly increasing their deployment of Service Cloud as the CRM platform across their growing Mutual Funds division. So JPMorgan is yet another great example of how financial services companies are moving to the cloud.
Other new wins or expansions in Q1 include the Bank of America, Dentsu, Expedia, Hitachi, Japan Post, John Deere, Medtronic, TELUS, T-Mobile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Western Union and Zürich Insurance. So this is really, as you can see, a pretty incredible list of brands. And it shows the continued traction we're getting in our industry strategy. You're also going to see our industry strategy come into greater focus this summer when we introduce our first industry solution in wealth management.
Now I will tell you we've been able to achieve this level of customer success and growth because we are, without a doubt, the trusted enterprise cloud. And with this incredible culture of relentless innovation, a 16-year track record of customer success, no other technology provider is in a position to say this. We are all about customer success. And conversely, if you were paying attention to SAP's event a few years -- a few weeks ago, the CIO of the world's largest retailer, which is an SAP customer, she said she hopes to see an SAP implementation in her lifetime. And I think that spells it out. That is the difference between on-premise and the cloud. It doesn't sound like customer success to me, and we are all about customer success.
So we're seeing a growing trend of SAP and Oracle customers who are coming to us and talking to us and working with us to wraparound their legacy solution. They want us to be the agility layer to these legacy technologies. They want us to be able to unlock more value from their investments. And ultimately, it puts us on a path to a complete replacement in their front office.
In fact, I will tell you, a few days ago, I had a meeting with the COO of one of the world's largest banks. And they were incredibly excited about a strategy to ultimately replace all of their legacy customer-facing systems with our Customer Success Platform. So that's very exciting for us.
So before I close, I want to talk about our ecosystem. Marc touched on it a minute ago. It continues to thrive. We're the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. We had a huge milestone this quarter with over 3 million total installs from our AppExchange. We continue to develop more strategic ISV relationships on both the horizontal and vertical basis. And as I travel around the world and speak to customers and partners, it's pretty clear that the relationship with our global and regional SIs, it's just never been stronger.
So with that, I want to thank the entire team at Salesforce and congratulate them for delivering just a terrific and strong Q1 and a great start to the year. So over to you, Mark."
122917,292877187,821255,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 20, 2015",2015-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, wi",679,"Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $52 million and a sequential headwind of around $17 million. Our geographies also delivered strong growth on a constant currency basis with the Americas growth of 27%, EMEA growth of 28% and Asia Pac of 27%. Dollar attrition for the first quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%.
Now while we continue to deliver industry-leading top line growth, we are thrilled to have expanded our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins by 197 basis points year-over-year. And by the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our top line outperformance, along with the improved expense controls, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 45% over last year and $0.02 higher than our guidance. Additionally, we've made great progress toward GAAP profitability in the quarter, including reducing our stock-based compensation to below 10% of revenue.
Now turning to cash flow. We delivered record operating cash flow in the quarter of $731 million. Now that's up 54% over last year. And as we've previously discussed, we anticipate that Q1 will continue to be the largest cash flow quarter. Now this is due to our seasonally strong Q4 and the compounding nature of our new and renewal business in the fourth quarter and the associated collections of our Q4 invoices in the first quarter. Now free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $660 million. That was up 60% over Q1 of last year. 
Looking at deferred revenue. We delivered another strong quarter with growth of 31% year-over-year, excluding an FX headwind of $69 million. Deferred revenue grew 36% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $18 million.
As a reminder, we calculate our FX on revenue using the average rates throughout the quarter. However, for deferred revenue, a balance sheet item, we use the spot rate on the last day of the quarter. Keep in mind, we conduct business in multiple currencies, including the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar and others. While the dollar exchange rates for most of these currencies were roughly flat at the end of the quarter, a stronger pound drove a slight sequential tailwind to the deferred revenue in Q1.
In the quarter, 75% of the value of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms.
Now let's move on to guidance. With our strong first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.52 billion to $6.55 billion for 22% growth at the high end. Now this guidance includes an anticipated FX headwind of about $175 million to $200 million.
In addition to raising our top line guidance, we're also pleased to be raising our bottom line as well. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 125 to 150 basis points this year. With our strong Q1 operating cash flow, we now anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%.
For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18 and deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20% range. Our guidance implies that OI&E will continue to be a net expense, and we assume a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and that we will not make significant acquisitions.
To close, we are very pleased with our fast start to fiscal 2016. We delivered outstanding results across the board. Our top and our bottom line outperformance drove record cash flow, and our backlog of booked business positions us extremely well for continued growth while we continue to deliver our non-GAAP operating margin expansion commitment.

So the market reaction has been very good. People are very excited about it. And there's no reason why this should not be in virtually all of our entire installed base."

We use Analytics Cloud constantly to run our business and it's exciting within Salesforce. In terms of the billing frequency, early renewals question, Kash, I think not being dramatic this year, we made continued improvement and the percent of annualized billings, pretty in sync with the rate of improvement that we've made. Before, it's been a modest improvement. And as we called out, we had 75% of our total billings were annual compared to, I think, 69% last year, very in sync with the kind of pace of improvement that we've been making and really nothing extraordinary to report on that side. We're just very pleased with the total deferred revenue and the revenue together. So..."

We wanted to create a new technology model now known as the cloud. We wanted to create a new business model, which is singularly focused on the success of our customers and helping our customers to create new ways to connect with their customers and help them to innovate and transform their organizations. And three, we created a new profit model with 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees' time. And of course, that was very easy because we had no equity, we had no profit and we had no time. But I would say at this point, I mean, Salesforce has far exceeded our expectations over the last 16 years. But people are always overestimating what they can do in a year and underestimating what they can do in a decade in our business. And when I look out, what I see is we are absolutely committed to being the fastest software company ever to $10 billion. And I'm sure, Jason, if you look at your model, now with over $9 billion in deferred on and off the balance sheet, you can start to model exactly how fast that's going to be. I mean, it's record time. And we're going to squarely be very, very shortly the fourth largest software company in the world. Now when that happens, we are really targeting one company to surpass, which is SAP. Fortunately for us, their kind of lackluster growth execution and lack of innovation in their core products, as we saw on their conference this quarter, well, you know what, they're an easy target. And that's our next goal. But we've got our minds squarely on the prize, which is the $10 billion revenue run rate, and that's step 1. Step 2 is go past SAP. And I think we can absolutely do that, and I'm personally committed to making that happen. That's my dream. And I am super motivated every single day to get up and run a company that is doing well by doing good. We don't -- we're not just a software company, Jason, that's building products and selling them every day like the rest of the guys. We are a software company that is working hard to make the world a better place, not just through our innovation, but through our philanthropy and through our commitment to equality for all and also to inspire other entrepreneurs and other companies to do the same. I am sure your experience is the same as mine. When I meet the all these new companies, they've all got philanthropy built into their model, and they've all got fired-up entrepreneurs who are going to add value to their community and not just build products. And I hope that in some small way, we've inspired the industry to kind of get off its kind of traditional stinginess and to get out there and do something for other people. And that's what I'm excited about, and those are my goals going forward. Does that help clarify that?"

But I think from an operating margin viewpoint, one of the things that you should think about is that this squares very nicely with our revenue operating margin framework in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. So this fits very nicely. But what we're doing also, Ross, as you touch on, is we're making sure to make the votes -- or the investments rather that are essential to making sure that we grow not only this year but in '17 and well beyond to fulfill the vision that Marc had that articulated earlier on the call.

But Heather, the $10 billion vision that Marc articulated, you can see us driving towards that. You're hearing loud and clear. I think that the profitability will be a function of the speed of how fast we get there. And when we talk about the revenue operating margin framework, very much it's correlated with the rate of the growth rate compared to the operating margin expansion. That's a higher-level framework that remains intact. We continue to execute that, and you can see it even in this period and the guidance for this year. But I do want to call out something, Heather, to try to get more context to the spirit of your question. When I look at the unit economics of what's happening in our business, the lifetime economics, I clearly see a business that's in the mid-30s in terms of operating margin. And that is really, I think, what we should think about when we get the business at a mature level of growth, in the mid-30s. That would be the key point. And in terms of the Service Cloud, one of the things that was most pleasing to look at is just the amazing amount of market share we took, that Gartner just took where we made really real progress on the market share, where we ripped over 300 basis points. We displaced basically SAP and are making real progress. But let me just see if there's other commentary on that."

It's very interesting because it's an opportunity for them to change their business model. They are leveraging our platform, and many of them are asking us to wrap an agility layer around their existing legacy systems. Now that could be a homegrown system, but more often or not -- than not, that's Oracle and SAP. And ultimately, the game plan here is to surround them and eventually replace them. So the overwhelming message from customers is they want to get out of the maintenance game and they want to get into the innovation and transformation game.

I'm sure you see that we took this great company in Indianapolis, Indiana, ExactTarget. We've worked with their core management team and transformed that to just tur",600,"Yes, Marketing -- well, I mean, I can't say enough good things about the Marketing Cloud. I'm sure you see that we took this great company in Indianapolis, Indiana, ExactTarget. We've worked with their core management team and transformed that to just turning it into just an exceptional offering with Journey Builder. And our customers can build journeys for their customers. They can build journeys for their employees. They can build journeys for their partners, journeys for their products. I mean, we just used it ourself to build something called Adoption Manager for Salesforce1. And when you are using Salesforce1, you now have the ability to turn on something called Adoption Manager. You're basically turning on Journey Builder and the Marketing Cloud. And I know that we saw almost 50% increase in adoption rates using that technology. And I encourage every one of our customers to move to that model. As part of that, I also am extremely excited by the phenomenal success of our Pardot team in Atlanta, which is part of our Marketing Cloud. They have done a great job as well, which is the B2B marketing solution. So we not only have a tremendous B2C solution that has applicability throughout the enterprise, but we have an unbelievable B2B marketing solution, and both of those are just executing incredibly well. For those of you who know, we have taken a long time to build our Marketing Cloud strategy through -- primarily through acquisition. And we have now had a couple of years to be able to operate it, and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Some of our largest transactions in the quarter were done with the Marketing Cloud, and I don't know a customer who's not looking at it. It's just -- it's what you need to be able to connect with your customers on a day-by-day basis and minute-by-minute basis. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little insight into where we're going for Dreamforce, which is -- and as it relates to the Marketing Cloud, you know everyone probably who's listening to this call might be wearing some kind of a wearable. All those wearables are probably evolving very rapidly. Probably all of us will be wearing some kind of different wearable in the next 2 years. Everybody knows that we're moving to this incredible Internet of Things. That's part of it. We call it Internet of Customers. Everything is going online. Everything's got an API. We're generating more data than ever before. 90% of the world's data was generated in the last 2 years. A lot of it is coming out of this machine data. Well, as all these things are happening, of course, you want to be able to connect everything and then have these directed journeys and messaging and be able to put everything online and have everything deeply integrated into your CRM systems. I don't think there's any other company in the world that's going to be able to show what we're going to show at Dreamforce, which is this idea that everything is connected, everything's online and that you're basically able to stay in touch with your customer minute by minute as it's happening. And that's just all possible because of this Marketing Cloud, so I couldn't be more excited. I mean, between the Marketing Cloud, between the Analytics Cloud, between some of the exciting enhancements that are going to be coming in for our core Salesforce and Service Cloud offerings and next-generation solutions there, we've got a lot of very, very exciting things planned for September."

And arguably, you could say it's the most loved sales app in the world. So we see an awful lot of interest in our Sales Cloud as a standalone product but also as part of the Customer Success Platform. And it goes back to customers really want to be engaged -- more engaged, more deeply -- have deeper relationships with their customers and drive success. And that's what this Customer Success Platform is all about. So this is a $2.5 billion run rate business. As a cloud, it's one of the top 8 standalone largest cloud companies. We keep getting accolades from Gartner. So this is really a very successful product, a very successful solution as a standalone. And it's part of a greater solution, and that's what customers want. They want impact. They want transformational value. They want innovation, and they want success for their customers. And that's why we're so well positioned, and we still have so much momentum."

I'll tell you, this second quarter well, this is just the best quarter we have ever had at salesforce.com. And just 1 quarter after crossing the $6 billion annual revenue",2253,"Well, hey, thanks so much, John, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I'll tell you, this second quarter well, this is just the best quarter we have ever had at salesforce.com. And just 1 quarter after crossing the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone, we have now surpassed a $6.5 billion revenue run rate, that's faster than any software -- enterprise software company in history, and we anticipate we're going to reach a $7 billion run rate by the end of this year. And we are now well on our way -- I mean, we have a clear trajectory to accomplishing our goal of being the fastest ever to reach $10 billion in revenues. So exciting. And no one in our industry is producing this kind of results of our size and scale. 
Also in this quarter, we became a Fortune 500 company. That's really exciting for Salesforce, one of the 500 largest companies in the world, a huge milestone. Congratulations to all of our customers, our partners and employees in this incredible job. 
We continue to be the fastest-growing top 10 enterprise software company than many of you projected. We're going to go from being the sixth-largest software company in the world to the fourth-largest next year. That's awesome. That is next year. Only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are bigger than Salesforce. That is incredible. And then, of course, we are going to go on to our next goal, which is to become the third-largest software company in the world, first by market cap and then by revenue. 
Then, only Microsoft and Oracle are going to be larger than Salesforce. It's just amazing. Well, I want to thank all of our customers and partners for their inspiration and all of our Salesforce employees for this unwavering focus on customer success. This is what is driving Salesforce forward quarter-after-quarter. It just delights us to see our customers so successful with our products. 
And now I'd like to turn the balance for the quarter. Well, revenue for the quarter rose to $1.63 billion. That is up 28% in constant currency. And that's just beyond our expectations. Deferred revenue grew to more than $3 billion, up 33% in constant currency, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is $9.2 billion. It's a great indicator of the strength of our future revenues. And we are just really excited to see such strength in our deferred revenue. 
Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year. And we are committed, very deeply committed to improving profitability quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we also grow this business at record levels. 
All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $300 million in operating cash flow, which is up 24% year-over-year. That brings us to more than $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first half of the year, $1 billion in the first half of the year. And that clearly demonstrates the cash model built into cloud computing. This is an incredible achievement and demonstrates the power of our model.
Given these outstanding second quarter results, I am thrilled to announce that we are raising our full year guidance for both our top and bottom lines. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.625 billion, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS by $0.01 to $0.72 at the high end of our range. 
As you can see from our strong results, along with the incredible momentum we're having with our Customer Success Platform and our sales and service and marketing, community, analytics, apps, we're on a trajectory to deliver $10 billion in revenue, faster than any other enterprise software company in history. Did I mention that? It's been a phenomenal first half of the year. You'll hear more from Keith in a moment about how we've become a catalyst for business transformation and growth and how we're delivering new levels of customer success in every industry in every region every day. 
And this is especially true in Europe where I spent a majority of the quarter and where we're seeing tremendous growth. Our tours in Paris, in Munich drew nearly 10,000 raving customers. And I've had the opportunity to talk to dozens of CEOs in the region, whether it was at AXA or Barclays or BMW or Deutsche Telekom, Eurostar, Louis Vuitton, Schneider, Unilever, all of these folks have become very significant customers in the last year for Salesforce. And I'm even heading back to Europe again next week because we are seeing incredible momentum in our European business. Right now, every company in the world is looking to strengthen how they connect with their customers. This is a massive customer relationship management opportunity. Perhaps it is the largest opportunity in the software industry. Every company is looking to connect with their customer in whole new way. Every company is looking for a whole new type of customer success. 
And no company is better positioned to deliver this to our customers than Salesforce. There has never been a company of our size and scale, focused so exclusively on this customer relationship management opportunity. No other customer relationship management company have 17,000 people, every single employee completely focused on the customer. 
And that's why there's no other enterprise software company selling billions of dollars of CRM and still growing at nearly 30% in constant currency. Look, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, they're selling millions of dollars of CRM. That's with an M. We are selling billions of dollars of CRM, that's with a B, and that is the difference between us and the competition. 
No other enterprise cloud can match the breadth and depth of our trusted cloud platform and complete customer relationship management solutions, whether it's service or sales or service, marketing, community analytics, apps, within the Internet of Things and no one can match the strength of the Salesforce ecosystem, our platforms, which is accelerating our growth with SIs and ISVs, creating solutions that address any kind of business process. 
In addition, the AppExchange, which is now the #1 business app marketplace, continues to set us apart from all others. I'll tell you, that AppExchange, our partners, our platform strategy over last 10 years, this has really separated us from the competition. We're not an app, we're a platform. And we're not an app, we're an ecosystem. And we're not an app, we're all about customer success and it's our partners that help us to create that. 
We're seeing tremendous growth in the adoption and usage of our core platform. We delivered 234 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, up 79% from year ago. That's an average of nearly 3.7 billion transactions every single business day. 
We're also getting traction as we better integrate acquisitions and invest in deep organic innovation. Well, those results are just phenomenal. You're going to see more innovation than ever at Dreamforce this year. You're going to see new products and new clouds, and we're going to be showcasing incredible new services. I mean, we're going to be breaking through with a whole new level of customer success. We're even going to be announcing this incredible new cloud.
Well, in addition, our strategic partnerships are paying off. There's no better example of this than our relationship with Microsoft. And at Dreamforce, you're going to hear about how we're making our joint customers, the customers of Salesforce and Microsoft, well, we're working more closely together than ever before, and we're working on making those customers even more successful, delivering deep integration with Office and Outlook and Azure. And I'm thrilled that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, is going to be speaking at Dreamforce this year with his own keynote. And that Microsoft Chairman, John Thompson, will be part of my keynote. 
Well, I have to tell you, but as all of you already know, Salesforce just isn't about doing well, we're also about doing good. Giving back has been an integral part of our company culture from the beginning with our 1/1/1 profit model. Salesforce technology now powers more than 26,000 nonprofit and higher education institutions, and the Salesforce Foundation has provided more than $96 million in grants. That's in addition to the almost $250 million of in-kind services that we've provided to these other nonprofits over our life. 
And this quarter, we surpassed another huge milestone. Our employees have given more than 1.1 million hours of community service. Well, that's just extraordinary. It's creating an amazing culture at Salesforce. It's an amazing place to work. And I think it is one of the reasons that our attrition has remained so well at a time of increased talent in Silicon Valley and even in San Francisco. There's no other technology company like Salesforce. 
Look, as I mentioned, Dreamforce is on the horizon. It's just 26 days away. It's going to be our biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever. And we expect more than 150,000 people to register for the event in San Francisco and 10 million to join us online. They're going to come from 75 countries. 
Dreamforce has become so big, we're bringing in a cruise ship because we've run out of hotel rooms. So we're calling that the Dreamboat and to provide extra accommodations for all of our attendees. We've even partnered with Airbnb to radically expand the number of people that we can house in San Francisco. We've partnered with Uber to make sure that there's more drivers available than ever before. We're even going to have 4 air streams in the Dream Park for special events, and we even have a few people staying there for additional accommodations because we're completely out of rooms. 
Look, you're going to see the future of Salesforce in my keynote, with relationship intelligence, next-generation of clouds, the Internet of Things. You're going to see a whole new standard for our industry. We have 1,500 customer-driven breakout sessions at Dreamforce. The world's biggest cloud ecosystem coming together in one place, thousands of solutions for more than 400 companies in our Cloud Expo. Isn't that amazing? 
And I didn't even mention the huge Foo Fighters concert that's going to be happening on Thursday night. And our special event for our very customers with John Legend the night before that. We've also gathered an amazing group of global thought leaders. In addition to Satya, we've got an incredible lineup of innovation speakers, including the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, Foundation's Larry John Collison of William of Labs. Just more [indiscernible] into the atmosphere. Hamptons Josh Patrick. George is launching his new company Z Taylor and Z Talks at Dreamforce. 
We even have best-selling authors Tom Davenport, Andrew McAfee and many, many, many others all speaking at Dreamforce. And we're all going to be talking about the future of business, the future of technology, the future of the cloud, social, mobile, the future of data science, Internet of Things and the future of social responsibility as well as the importance of business to give back and to manage their stakeholders, not just their shareholders. 
A new Dreamforce Women's Leadership Summit features actress and entrepreneur Jessica Alba, YouTube CEO and Salesforce member Susan Hickey and Oscar winner Patricia Arquette. Incredible focus on the empowerment of women at Dreamforce. 
And we have a start of summit to aspire the next generation of entrepreneurs, with keynotes from actor and entrepreneur, Adrian Grenair, I'm sure you all love the movie Entourage. Pro football Hall of Famer, Steve Young; and we have a [indiscernible] because we're all going to need to kick back, relax and clear our minds after that Dreamforce. And we have one of the world's top meditation teachers, Jack Kornfield, as well as design and fashion icon, Donna Karan all talking about the importance of taking ourself, taking care of ourself while we're taking care of the world. 
And world champion San Francisco Giants CEO, Larry Baer, the Golden State President and COO Rick Wells, are going to share the secrets for success in professional sports. Throughout Dreamforce, we'll have many ways in which attendees can give back. Each day at Dreamforce is a focus on an important cause in our world. 
One day will be dedicated to our veterans. One day dedicated to our K-12 schools, one day dedicated to women and technology and one day dedicated to the environment and our oceans. And we're holding a fantastic benefit concert, as I mentioned, with Foo Fighters and other incredible bands that you're going to love to support children's health and our children's hospitals. 
Bring all your friends. You're not going to want to miss it. If you buy a sponsorship for the concert, we're going to make sure you get unbelievable seats and recognition. And we're going to have the world's largest book drive of all time. So if you want to come to Dreamforce, you better bring a book for kids because we're going to be collecting books and putting them in libraries over the country. Collecting more than 1 million books to support schools and students. So don't forget your books. Don't forget bringing food because we're running a huge food drive. And I look forward to seeing you all at Dreamforce. And don't forget, it's going to be the biggest most exciting Dreamforce of all time. Now over to Keith."
122917,308178617,861560,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We are executing like never before, and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry, and certainly in every cloud. We saw an amazing number",1143,"Thanks, Marc. As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We are executing like never before, and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry, and certainly in every cloud. 
We saw an amazing number of big deals this quarter. Really, for example, the Marketing Cloud doubled its number of large deals year-over-year, which was terrific to see. And more importantly, the value of our large deals across all the clouds has increased significantly. That is proof positive of a level and depth of relationships that we're certainly driving with customers. 
As Marc said, we are now part of the Fortune 500, and that is a great indicator of how Salesforce is delivering customer success at scale. It's pretty clear that Salesforce is taking share from our competitors. And we are growing in every segment, in every industry, in every region as software center of gravity continues its shift from on-premise to the cloud.
In the past year, we have had countless conversations with CEOs of world-class companies. Marc mentioned his trip to Europe around innovation and taking their companies into the future. They're looking to us to help transform their business models to drive growth and to become their trusted adviser. Every CEO's agenda is about growth and they are looking for Salesforce to be that growth engine. They're looking to us, and it all starts with our Customer Success Platform. 
These are conversations that are driving more meaningful and long-term relationships quite frankly with some of the greatest companies on Earth. And I'm going to give you some examples, starting with Enel. Enel is Europe's largest power company with 61 million customers. This deal was significant in terms of expansion of an important relationship where the CEO was personally involved. 
We are now Enel's strategic partner for the complete transformation of their customer engagement platform, leveraging sales and service in communities, analytics and platform. But that doesn't stop there. In addition, we are building an agility layer on their legacy on-premise SAP system. And we're helping them extract information from complex order management and inventory and billing systems. They're having trouble getting meaningful and timely information out of SAP. And Salesforce is bringing all this data together so Enel's teams can get a 360-degree view of their customers. 
And with Wave Analytics, they can drill down into their customer data right from the mobile phone in seconds. Enel absolutely has a tremendous vision for the future, and we at Salesforce are helping them make it a reality.
We also signed a significant deal this quarter with a huge global systems integrator. And just as they advise their clients, they are making a major shift to the cloud and decided to replace their aging on-premise software with our Sales Cloud, with our Marketing Cloud and with our Platform. 
I'm also pleased to tell you they are doubling down on a dedicated Salesforce practice, and we're very, very excited about that. So with this win with this very large integrator, virtually every global systems integrator globally is running their business on Salesforce. In fact, the number of Salesforce-certified consultants across the globe grew 44% year-over-year. It's pretty staggering. This is a great indication of the type of growth and success that we're seeing in our partner ecosystem, which is one of our growth strategies and our partner strategy overall. We're very, very pleased with this. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is another exciting win for us in Q2 and one of their largest agencies. They've standardized on the Salesforce Platform to build and deploy mobile applications. In addition, their farm service agency is also using our Service Cloud to connect citizens to critical resources. 
Our public sector business is just growing off the charts, and I'm really proud of the team for their outstanding performance. And just a year after being certified, we are building huge momentum with federal, state and local governments. In fact, 15 out of 15 federal cabinet agencies now use Salesforce as well as 45 of 50 state governments, and we are just getting started in the space. 
We also signed an exciting new relationship in the quarter with one of the largest hospitality vendors in the world. Now they have an incredible vision to bring all their customer service together on a single platform to deliver a very personalized experience at scale to millions of their guests. The Service Cloud will now be the social mobile front office to their Oracle back-office and allow their hotel associates to better engage and service guests no matter where they are anywhere in the globe. It was a great win of Oracle and they chose Salesforce for our ability to deliver customer service on a flexible platform that would allow them to innovate with scale and speed. 
AXA has significantly expanded their 7-year relationship with us. And in the quarter, they've decided to consolidate 18 systems together onto our Service Cloud to run their entire global front office with more than 26,000 users. They're taking sales and customer service to a whole new level by modernizing their agent engagement platform with Salesforce. 
Now we've also signed new and extended relationships in the quarter with Barclays and BBC, Comcast, Commerzbank, Cox, Ford, Genomic Health, GlaxoSmithKline, Honda, Honeywell, Renault. Listen, this list just goes on and on. It's pretty clear that we're driving success in every major industry. And as all you know, industries have been one of our critical strategies. We're incredibly excited about our industry momentum. It continues to gain mind share with our customers and our partners. 
In fact, we'll be launching our first industry products at the end of this month. Some of the most influential industry-leading companies are serving as our design partners in the development of these industry clouds. The early feedback has absolutely been incredibly positive, and you're going to see these products in action at Dreamforce. 
And speaking of Dreamforce, we've tailored the experienced for customers with a special industry showcase in the Dreamforce Expo as well as industry keynotes and special sessions. It's going to be 4 incredible days for banks, for retailers, for manufactures, telecommunications companies, government entities, health care providers and I really hope that you check it out. 
So I want to close by congratulating everyone at Salesforce for their tremendous performance this quarter and of course, just incredible execution. I also want to thank our customers for their continued commitment and inspiration and our partners for their ongoing investment in our customer success. With our Customer Success Platform, our 6 world-class clouds, our industry innovation, our partner ecosystem, our international strategy, we are the innovation engine and trusted adviser for companies looking to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark."

As you've heard, we've delivered another great quarter. From a top line perspective, we delivered revenue of $1.63 billion, up 24% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year he",642,"Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we've delivered another great quarter. From a top line perspective, we delivered revenue of $1.63 billion, up 24% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $50 million and a sequential tailwind of $4 million. 
Our revenue was strong across-the-board, becoming more diversified across each geography, all of our clouds and all of our business units. For example, our geographies continue to deliver great year-over-year growth in constant currency basis as Americas grew 28%, EMEA grew 29% and Asia Pac grew 25%. 
We also delivered incredible year-over-year growth and all of our clouds on a dollar basis as Sales Cloud grew 10%, Service Cloud grew 40%, Platform and others grew 36% and Marketing Cloud grew 29%. Dollar attrition for the second quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%. 
And not only did we continue to grow our top line, we also improved our bottom line, expanding our non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year, and this is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We've been able to deliver this improvement by driving efficiencies across all our operating expense categories. 
As we remain committed to improving our non-GAAP operating margins year-over-year going forward, this is consistent with our operating margin framework we've discussed previously. Our great top line performance, along with continued spending discipline, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.19, up 46% over last year. 
Turning to cash flow. We delivered another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $304 million, up 24% over last year. And we've already delivered more than $1 billion in operating cash flow this year, up 44% for the first half of the year.
Second quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was up 37% over last year to $240 million. Looking at billed deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 29% year-over-year. Excluding FX headwind of $72 million, deferred revenue grew 33% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of roughly $12 million.
In the quarter, 74% of the value of all subscriptions and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, and this is compared with 71% last year. This increase is primarily due to our annual invoicing policy for new contracts and, to a lesser extent, shifting current customers to annual terms upon renewal. In Q2, this benefited year-over-year deferred revenue by approximately 1 percentage point.
Moving on to guidance. With our strong performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $75 million. We now anticipate to be $6.6 billion to $6.625 billion for 23% growth. This guidance includes an FX headwind of approximately $175 million, which is a bit less than previously expected. 
Given the spending discipline I've discussed and a slightly lower impact from FX in the second half, we now expect to deliver approximately 150 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. This is the high end of our previous guidance. In that context, we're also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.70 to $0.72. 
Now let's turn to cash flow. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%. For Q3, we anticipate revenues of $1.69 billion to $1.70 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and deferred revenue growth in the mid-20% range. 
To close, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. We saw strong growth across all of our products and regions and are well positioned to move into the second half. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for delivering another great quarter. I look forward to seeing all of you at our annual Investor Day at Dreamforce in September 15. And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

Obviously, this is true positive that we're not just a Sales Force Automation company, and that we have a very diversified, very, very strong portfolio across the Customer Success Platform. Specifically around service, as you know, many companies differentiate themselves because of service and the way that they deliver service. So many companies are looking for innovation around how they engage with their customers. And over 70% of all sales, quite frankly, come from great service. So we're seeing this play out in the marketplace, as customers talk to us about how they can transform their business and our Service Cloud product is best-in-class. So that certainly is what we're seeing on -- going on in the marketplace right now."

Secondly, the industry has just deepened the relationship with the customer. Marc and I both talked about the level of engagement that we're seeing from CEOs. A lot of that dialogue is around specific industry and vertical content. So as we continue to think about our product portfolio and we extend our Customer Success Platform, which is an incredible platform, it's not just things that we extend ourselves, our customers extend it. We have an incredible ecosystem that extends the capability of the platform. There is a natural play to deepen their relationships, drive more strategic relationships with more industry-focused product. Specific to your question around how we organize in the field, over the last 2 years, we have been very carefully and very slowly moving to more and more of the vertical orientation. For example, we have a huge focus on our public sector. We are taking a look at expanding how we go after financial services markets and health care and life sciences markets. So we've done this very carefully and very thoughtfully, and it's really paying out in our results."

It seems like a fascinating time in the history of the software industry. You have Sage re-architecting on the Force.com platform. The big 3 traditional software companies are trying to deal with the cloud a bit more actively. And for a couple of them, their product revenues are actually declining for the first time ever outside of recession. And then their margins are under pressure while yours are increasing. So I'm wondering as they talk up their own cloud products, to what extent do you think the bigger traditional software companies can retain some of their customers versus to what extent it feels like their leaky buckets and they might inadvertently drive more customers to reassess and perhaps move in your direction."

That doesn't mean that IBM is creating value for customers or helping them to transform customer's businesses are aligned them with modern trends [indiscernible] selling them old technology and upgrading them. And that's what you see with companies like Oracle and SAP. These are old technology basis that are kind of meandering along like mainframes. And I think that is reflected exactly, as you said, in their license revenue growth, which has been poor. And in their movement to the cloud has been stunted because they don't want to shift those customers into new models. Exactly why IBM lost the PC business because there were too afraid to let go of the mainframe. It's the past replaying itself but instead of IBM, you've got Oracle and SAP basically running the same playbook. We all know that the world has changed its move to the cloud, it's multi-tenant architectures, it's about meta database application development and deployment. It's about social user interfaces. It's about mobility and it's about data science and it's about the Internet of Things and the integration of everything. And companies who have built platforms like Salesforce, who've done that, deliver world-class growth like we're doing in this quarter. And if you haven't done that, well then, you end up with a quarter like Oracle or SAP had. And I think you've seen in the last 4 or 6 or 8 quarters, they've missed almost all of them. And that's because their technology bases are degrading the way mainframes have. But they can hang in there with their revenue and just meander along like big dinosaurs moving down the desert for a while. But nothing can stop the movement of new technologies. And the key to being successful in the technology industry is to kind of transform that innovator's dilemma, to kind of constantly rethink and reconceptualize yourself to have a beginner's mind. And if you can do that, you can create something amazingly new. And you're going to see at Dreamforce more examples of Salesforce doing that. I've never been more excited about our technology base and what we're delivering to our customers. But ultimately, I've never been more excited that customers just love using our solutions, love working with us. And you feel that when you're at Dreamforce, and you're going to feel that in a bigger way than ever before."

We've also had the chance to help our customers build and create your own applications using our platform.

I'll tell you, it'll be the fastest launch of any product line that we've ever had here at Salesforce. So there's a lot of enthusiasm, there's a lot of innovation. There's quite a bit of traction with the product. We're getting some great feedback from our customers. We're getting great feedback from our partners. And I think it is very differentiated in the way that it drives insights to actions. And that's not something you see from the legacy BI product lines that have been in trends for 20 or 30 years. So customers think of it as innovative and game-breaking and we're starting to see the results."

First of all, I think everybody knows that one of our growth strategies was to really expand our ecosystem and that takes a couple of favors. We talked a little bit on this call a couple of questions ago around our platform and our ISV's focus. But another very important piece of that obviously is the systems integrators globally and the regional boutiques so we have influence in the boardroom was industry expertise and deep content and are at the forefront of helping our joint customers transform their businesses. Really what's happening is that we're moving away from the legacy world of on-premise into the cloud. And the integrators and influencers in the world, they see it, they want to be part of it. They see new business opportunities. They want to drive unprecedented levels of customer success. And we're the only company that can bring that solution to bear with our Customer Success Platform at scale. And that's why these integrators and influencers are really latching onto us and partnering with us and locking arms. And they are making the investments in their Salesforce practices and cannibalizing their legacy SAP and Oracle practices. And that's exactly what's happening. They see this huge shift in the marketplace, and they want to be able to respond to it with us."

I actually wanted to ask you about your guidance on both margins and cash flow. You've guided to non-GAAP operating margin improvement of plus 150 [ph] I think in the first half, you were plus 180, so the guide implies a little bit of a slower rate of improvement in the second half, and it's not obvious why that would be. And then on the cash flow side, to get to your 24%, 25% growth, given your great first half performance, operating cash flow in the second half would actually have to be negative year-over-year, and we haven't really seen that since the recession. So my take is that your appropriately keeping expectations low, and there's some conservatism built into both margin and cash flow guide. But I wanted to give you an opportunity to flag anything that might be informing your guidance on those 2 metrics in the second half."

Let's just break it down one question at a time. Let's start with the operating margin. We're super pleased with the operating margin we've expanded the operating margin for 5 quarters in a row year-on-year. Moreover, you've heard from Marc and I just the -- just absolute, unequivocal commitment to the revenue operating margin framework that we talked about in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. That's really clear, and you're seeing period after period after period of demonstrating that with action and results. And we're committed to the increase obviously. And so at the same time, it's obviously our priority is a company to be a growth company and to take full advantage of investing to go tackle this amazing TAM that's out there, that's north of $50 billion today. It's a double-digit growing TAM, huge opportunity. And so clearly, what we're doing is we're growing rapidly fastest growing top 10 software company in the world and we're expanding operating margin just exactly as we said we would do, just exactly consistent with the framework. So obviously making sure that we're investing in growth as well. So I think that's a key point there. We feel great about the guide, we raised the guide effectively, it was 125 to 150 as you said. Now we've taken it up to 150 approximately, and we feel good and confident about that. So we'll get a chance to revisit that as ago but that's where we're at, point 1. Point 2 is on operating cash flow. One of the things that is pronounced not only in operating cash flow but in a number of metrics for the company we talked for actually quite some time around the compounding effect of more and more of our invoicing showing up in Q4. And as we know, one of the effects of that shows flow growth more bimodal it shows up more in Q1 and then it shows up more in terms of Q4. And that's no shock and one of the things that we want to make sure we think we have a very solid operating cash flow guide. By the way, that's exactly consistent with the revenue operating margin framework that we put out. Right now, the exact framework that we added. And at the end of the day, would we see we have closer to Q4 we have more visibility around Q4 we will revisit that and will have a better sense of is there anything you want to change their, but we think it's an appropriate guide so hopefully, that's helped on both sides."

And we find our distribution strategy really been focused on 7 core countries, which we've really just expanded to 9 core countries. The idea that we were going to be super focused in Europe and the U.K., France and Germany was a huge reset for us because ultimately, what we're doing is building the U.K. cloud, the French cloud, the German cloud, and we're paying more attention to these customers inside of these countries than ever before. Of course, that doesn't mean we don't do business in other countries or don't have customers in other countries. But this extraordinary focus in these core countries where the buyers are, has paid off in spades for us and allowed us to scale distribution, scale service, scale marketing and make sure our products are right for those customers in those core mega markets. That has resulted in numbers in Europe and growth in this company. We haven't seen numbers like this growing in Europe in other software companies. That's the power of what's going on. So I only see more next week because I'm still excited about the European opportunity. And the customers that I met with spent time in Europe, well, that has escalated.

I'll tell you, this second quarter well, this is just the best quarter we have ever had at salesforce.com. And just 1 quarter after crossing the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone, we have now surpassed a $6.5 billion revenue run rate, that's faster than any software -- enterprise software company in history, and we anticipate we're going to reach a $7 billion run rate by the end of this year. And we are now well on our way -- I mean, we have a clear trajectory to accomplishing our goal of being the fastest ever to reach $10 billion in revenues. So exciting. And no one in our industry is producing this kind of results of our size and scale. 
And also in this quarter, we became a Fortune 500 company. That's really exciting for Salesforce, one of the 500 largest companies in the world, a huge milestone. Congratulations to all of our customers and our partners and employees in this incredible job. 
We continue to be the fastest-growing top 10 enterprise software company that many of you projected. We're going to go from being the sixth largest software company in the world to the fourth largest next year. That's awesome. That is next year. Only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are bigger than Salesforce. That is incredible. And then, of course, we're going to go on to our next goal, which is to become the third largest software company in the world, first by market cap and then by revenue. 
Then, only Microsoft and Oracle are going to be larger than Salesforce. It's just amazing. Well, I want to thank all of our customers and partners for their inspiration and all of our Salesforce employees for this unwavering focus on customer success. This is what is driving Salesforce forward quarter-after-quarter. It just delights us to see our customers so successful with our products. 
And now I'd like to turn to the highlights for the quarter. Well, revenue for the quarter rose to $1.63 billion. That is up 28% in constant currency. And that's just beyond our expectations. Deferred revenue grew to more than $3 billion, up 33% in constant currency. And the dollar value of booked business, on and off the balance sheet, is $9.2 billion. It's a great indicator of the strength of our future revenues, and we are just really excited to see such strength in our deferred revenue. 
Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year. And we are committed, very deeply committed to improving profitability quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we also grow this business at record levels. 
All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $300 million in operating cash flow, which is up 24% year-over-year. That brings us to more than $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first half of the year, $1 billion in the first half of the year. And that really demonstrates the cash model built into cloud computing. This is an incredible achievement and demonstrates the power of our model.
Given these outstanding second quarter results, I am thrilled to announce that we are raising our full year guidance for both our top and bottom lines. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.625 billion, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS by $0.01 to $0.72 at the high end of our range. 
As you can see from our strong results, along with the incredible momentum we're having with our Customer Success Platform and our sales and service and marketing, community, analytics, apps, we're on a trajectory to deliver $10 billion in revenue, faster than any other enterprise software company in history. Did I mention that? It's been a phenomenal first half of the year. You'll hear more from Keith in a moment about how we've become a catalyst for business transformation and growth and how we're delivering new levels of customer success in every industry in every region every day. 
And this is especially true in Europe where I spent a majority of the quarter and where we're seeing tremendous growth. Our tours in Paris, in Munich drew nearly 10,000 raving customers. And I've had the opportunity to talk to dozens of CEOs in the region, whether it was at AXA or Barclays or BMW or Deutsche Telekom, Eurostar, Louis Vuitton, Schneider, Unilever, all of these folks have become very significant customers in the last year of Salesforce. And I'm even heading back to Europe again next week because we are seeing incredible momentum in our European business. Right now, every company in the world is looking to strengthen how they connect with their customers. This is a massive customer relationship management opportunity. Perhaps it is the largest opportunity in the software industry. Every company is looking to connect with their customer in a whole new way. Every company is looking for a whole new type of customer success. 
And no company is better positioned to deliver this to our customers than Salesforce. There has never been a company of our size and scale focused so exclusively on this customer relationship management opportunity. No other customer relationship management company has 17,000 people, every single employee completely focused on the customer. 
And that's why there's no other enterprise software company selling billions of dollars of CRM and still growing at nearly 30% in constant currency. Look, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, they're selling millions of dollars of CRM. That's with an M. We are selling billions of dollars of CRM, that's with a B, and that is the difference between us and the competition. 
No other enterprise cloud can match the breadth and depth of our trusted cloud platform and complete customer relationship management solutions, whether it's service or sales or service, marketing, community analytics, apps, within the Internet of Things. And no one can match the strength of the Salesforce ecosystem, our platforms, which is accelerating our growth with SIs and ISVs, creating solutions that address any kind of business process. 
In addition, the AppExchange, which is now the #1 business app marketplace, continues to set us apart from all others. I'll tell you, that AppExchange, our partners, our platform strategy over the last 10 years, this has really separated us from the competition. We're not an app; we're a platform. And we're not an app; we're an ecosystem. And we're not an app; we're all about customer success and it's our partners that help us to create that. 
We're seeing tremendous growth in the adoption and usage of our core platform. We delivered 234 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, up 79% from year ago. That's an average of nearly 3.7 billion transactions every single business day. 
We're also gaining traction as we better integrate acquisitions and invest in deep organic innovation. Well, those results are just phenomenal. You're going to see more innovation than ever at Dreamforce this year. You're going to see new products and new clouds, and we're going to be showcasing incredible new services. I mean, we're going to be breaking through with a whole new level of customer success. We're even going to be announcing this incredible new cloud.
Well, in addition, our strategic partnerships are paying off. There's no better example of this than our relationship with Microsoft. And at Dreamforce, you're going to hear about how we're making our joint customers, the customers of Salesforce and Microsoft, well, we're working more closely together than ever before, and we're working on making those customers even more successful, delivering deep integration with Office and Outlook and Azure. And I'm thrilled that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, is going to be speaking at Dreamforce this year with his own keynote, and that Microsoft Chairman, John Thompson, will be part of my keynote. 
Well, I have to tell you, but as all of you already know, Salesforce just isn't about doing well; we're also about doing good. Giving back has been an integral part of our company culture from the beginning with our 1/1/1 profit model. Salesforce technology now powers more than 26,000 nonprofit and higher education institutions, and the Salesforce Foundation has provided more than $96 million in grants. That's in addition to the almost $250 million of in-kind services that we've provided to these other nonprofits over our life. 
And this quarter, we surpassed another huge milestone. Our employees have given more than 1.1 million hours of community service. Well, that's just extraordinary. It's creating an amazing culture at Salesforce. It's an amazing place to work. And I think it is one of the reasons that our attrition has remained so well at a time of increased talent wars in Silicon Valley and even in San Francisco. There's no other technology company like Salesforce. 
Look, as I mentioned, Dreamforce is on the horizon. It's just 26 days away. It's going to be our biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever. And we expect more than 150,000 people to register for the event in San Francisco and 10 million to join us online. They're going to come from 75 countries. 
Dreamforce has become so big, we're bringing in a cruise ship because we've run out of hotel rooms. So we're calling that the Dreamboat. And to provide extra accommodations for all of our attendees, we've even partnered with Airbnb to radically expand the number of people that we can house in San Francisco. We've partnered with Uber to make sure that there's more drivers available than ever before. We're even going to have 4 air streams in the Dream Park for special events, and we're even going to have a few people staying there for additional accommodations because we're completely out of rooms. 
 
Look, you're going to see the future of Salesforce in my keynote, with relationship intelligence, next-generation of clouds, the Internet of Things. You're going to see a whole new standard for our industry. We have 1,500 customer-driven breakout sessions at Dreamforce. The world's biggest cloud ecosystem coming together in one place, thousands of solutions for more than 400 companies in our Cloud Expo. Isn't that amazing? 
And I didn't even mention the huge Foo Fighters concert that's going to be happening on Thursday night and our special event for our very top customers with John Legend the night before that. 
We've also gathered an amazing group of global thought leaders. In addition to Satya, we've got an incredible lineup of innovation speakers, including the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick; Skoll Foundation's Larry Brilliant; John Collison of Stripe; William Marshall of Planet Labs, so just much more of it goes into the atmosphere; Hampton Creek's Josh Tetrick; George Zimmer is launching his new company zTailor and zTux, at Dreamforce. 
We even have best-selling authors Tom Davenport, Andrew McAfee, Dov Seidman and many, many, many others all speaking at Dreamforce. 
And we're all going to be talking about the future of business, the future of technology, the future of the cloud, social, mobile, the future of data science, of Internet of Things and the future of social responsibility as well as the importance of business to give back and to manage their stakeholders, not just their shareholders. 
A new Dreamforce Women's Leadership Summit features actress and entrepreneur Jessica Alba, YouTube CEO and Salesforce board member Susan Wojcicki, and Oscar winner Patricia Arquette. Incredible focus on the empowerment of women at Dreamforce. 
And we have a Startup Summit to aspire the next generation of entrepreneurs, with keynotes from actor and entrepreneur, Adrian Grenier -- I'm sure you all love the movie Entourage; FOX CEO, Aaron Levie; Pro Football Hall of Famer, Steve Young. 
And we have a Mindfulness Day because we're all going to need to kick back, relax and clear our minds after that Dreamforce. And we have one of the world's top meditation teachers, Jack Kornfield; as well actress  Goldie Hawn; and fashion icon, Donna Karan, all talking about the importance of taking ourself, taking care of ourself while we're taking care of the world. 
And World Champion San Francisco Giants CEO, Larry Baer, the Golden State Warriors President and COO Rick Welts, are going to share the secrets for success in professional sports. Throughout Dreamforce, we'll have many ways in which attendees can give back. 
Each day at Dreamforce is a focus on an important cause in our world. One day will be dedicated to our veterans, one day dedicated to our K-12 schools, one day dedicated to women and technology, and one day dedicated to the environment and our oceans. 
And we're holding a fantastic benefit concert, as I mentioned, with Foo Fighters and other incredible bands that you're going to love to support children's health and our children's hospitals.  Bring all your friends. You're not going to want to miss it. If you buy a sponsorship for the concert, we're going to make sure you get unbelievable seats and recognition. 
And we're going to have the world's largest book drive of all time. So if you want to come to Dreamforce, you better bring a book for kids because we're going to be collecting books and putting them in libraries all over the country, collecting more than 1 million books to support schools and students. So don't forget your books. 
Don't forget bringing food because we're running a huge food drive. And I look forward to seeing you all at Dreamforce. And don't forget, it's going to be the biggest most exciting Dreamforce of all time. Now over to Keith."
122917,308178617,861596,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We were executing like never before, and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry, and certainly in every cloud. We saw an amazing numbe",1151,"Thanks, Marc. As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We were executing like never before, and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry, and certainly in every cloud. 
We saw an amazing number of big deals this quarter. Really, for example, the Marketing Cloud doubled its number of large deals year-over-year, which was terrific to see. And more importantly, the value of our large deals across all the clouds has increased significantly. That is proof positive of the level and depth of the relationships that we're certainly driving with customers. 
As Marc said, we are now part of the Fortune 500, and that is a great indicator of how Salesforce is delivering customer success at scale. It's pretty clear that Salesforce is taking share from our competitors. And we are growing in every segment, in every industry and in every region as software center of gravity continues its shift from on-premise to the cloud.
In the past year, we have had countless conversations with CEOs of world-class companies -- marc mentioned his trip to Europe -- around innovation and taking their companies into the future. They're looking to us to help transform their business models to drive growth and to become their trusted adviser. Every CEO's agenda is about growth and they are looking for Salesforce to be that growth engine. They're looking to us, and it all starts with our Customer Success Platform. 
These are conversations that are driving more meaningful and long-term relationships, quite frankly, with some of the greatest companies on earth. And I'm going to give you some examples, starting with Enel. Enel is Europe's largest power company, with 61 million customers. This deal was significant in terms of the expansion of an important relationship, where the CEO was personally involved. We are now Enel's strategic partner for the complete transformation of their customer engagement platform, leveraging sales and service in communities, analytics and platform. 
But that doesn't stop there. In addition, we are building an agility layer on their legacy on-premise SAP system. And we're helping them extract information from complex order management and inventory and billing systems. They're having trouble getting meaningful and timely information out of SAP. And Salesforce is bringing all this data together so Enel's teams can get a 360-degree view of their customers. 
And with Wave Analytics, they can drill down into their customer data right from the mobile phone in seconds. Enel absolutely has a tremendous vision for the future, and we at Salesforce are helping them make it a reality.
We also signed a significant deal this quarter with a huge global systems integrator. And just as they advise their clients, they themselves are making a major shift to the cloud and decided to replace their aging on-premise software with our Sales Cloud, with our Marketing Cloud and with our Platform. I'm also pleased to tell you they are doubling down on a dedicated Salesforce practice, and we're very, very excited about that. 
So with this win with this very large integrator, virtually every global systems integrator globally is running their business on Salesforce. In fact, the number of Salesforce-certified consultants across the globe grew 44% year-over-year. It's pretty staggering. This is a great indication of the type of growth and success that we're seeing in our partner ecosystem, which is one of our growth strategies and our partner strategy overall. We're very, very pleased with this. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is another exciting win for us in Q2. In one of their largest agencies, they've standardized on the Salesforce Platform to build and deploy mobile applications. In addition, their Farm Service Agency is also using our Service Cloud to connect citizens to critical resources. 
Our public sector business is just growing off the charts, and I'm really proud of the team for their outstanding performance. And just a year after being FedRAMP certified, we are building huge momentum with federal, state and local governments. In fact, 15 out of 15 federal cabinet agencies now use Salesforce as well as 45 of 50 state governments, and we are just getting started in this space. 
We also signed an exciting new relationship in the quarter with one of the largest hospitality vendors in the world. Now they have an incredible vision to bring all their customer service together on a single platform to deliver a very personalized experience at scale to millions of their guests. The Service Cloud will now be the social mobile front office to their Oracle back office and allow their hotel associates to better engage and service guests no matter where they are anywhere in the globe. It was a great win of Oracle, and they chose Salesforce for our ability to deliver customer service on a flexible platform that would allow them to innovate with scale and speed. 
AXA has significantly expanded their 7-year relationship with us. And in the quarter, they've decided to consolidate 18 systems together onto our Service Cloud to run their entire global front office with more than 26,000 users. They're taking sales and customer service to a whole new level by modernizing their agent engagement platform with Salesforce. 
Now we've also signed new or extended relationships in the quarter with Barclays and BBC, Comcast, Commerzbank, Cox, Ford, Genomic Health, GlaxoSmithKline, Honda, Honeywell, Renault. Listen, this list just goes on and on. It's pretty clear that we're driving success in every major industry. And as all you know, industries have been one of our critical strategies. We're incredibly excited about our industry momentum. It continues to gain mind share with our customers and our partners. 
In fact, we'll be launching our first industry products at the end of this month. Some of the most influential industry-leading companies are serving as our design partners in the development of these industry clouds. The early feedback has absolutely been incredibly positive, and you're going to see these products in action at Dreamforce. 
And speaking of Dreamforce, we've tailored the experienced for customers with a special industry showcase in the Dreamforce Expo as well as industry keynotes and special sessions. It's going to be 4 incredible days for banks, for retailers, for manufacturers, telecommunications companies, government entities, health care providers, and I really hope that you check it out. 
So I want to close by congratulating everyone at Salesforce for their tremendous performance this quarter and, of course, just incredible execution. I also want to thank our customers for their continued commitment and inspiration and our partners for their ongoing investment in our customer success. 
With our Customer Success Platform, our 6 world-class clouds, our industry innovation, our partner ecosystem, our international strategy, we are the innovation engine and trusted adviser for companies looking to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark."
122917,308178617,861596,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith.

Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year he",642,"Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we've delivered another great quarter. From a top line perspective, we delivered revenue of $1.63 billion, up 24% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $50 million and a sequential tailwind of $4 million. 
Our revenue was strong across-the-board, becoming more diversified across each geography, all of our clouds and all of our business units. For example, our geographies continued to deliver great year-over-year growth in constant currency basis as Americas grew 28%, EMEA grew 29% and Asia Pac grew 25%. 
We also delivered incredible year-over-year growth in all of our clouds on a dollar basis, as Sales Cloud grew 10%, Service Cloud grew 40%, Platform and others grew 36% and Marketing Cloud grew 29%. Dollar attrition for the second quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%. 
And not only did we continue to grow our top line, we also improved our bottom line, expanding our non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year, and this is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We've been able to deliver this improvement by driving efficiencies across all our operating expense categories. 
As we remain committed to improving our non-GAAP operating margins year-over-year going forward, this is consistent with our operating margin framework we've discussed previously. Our great top line performance along with continued spending discipline, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.19, up 46% over last year. 
Turning to cash flow. We delivered another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $304 million, up 24% over last year. And we've already delivered more than $1 billion in operating cash flow this year, up 44% for the first half of the year.
Second quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was up 37% over last year to $240 million. Looking at billed deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 29% year-over-year. Excluding FX headwind of $72 million, deferred revenue grew 33% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of roughly $12 million.
In the quarter, 74% of the value of all subscriptions and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, and this is compared with 71% last year. This increase is primarily due to our annual invoicing policy for new contracts and, to a lesser extent, shifting current customers to annual terms upon renewal. In Q2, this benefited year-over-year deferred revenue by approximately 1 percentage point.
Moving on to guidance. With our strong performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $75 million. We now anticipate to be $6.6 billion to $6.625 billion for 23% growth. This guidance includes an FX headwind of approximately $175 million, which is a bit less than previously expected. 
Given the spending discipline I've discussed and a slightly lower impact from FX in the second half, we now expect to deliver approximately 150 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. This is the high end of our previous guidance. In that context, we're also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.70 to $0.72. 
Now let's turn to cash flow. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%. For Q3, we anticipate revenues of $1.69 billion to $1.70 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and deferred revenue growth in the mid-20% range. 
To close, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. We saw strong growth across all of our products and regions and are well positioned to move into the second half. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for delivering another great quarter. I look forward to seeing all of you at our annual Investor Day at Dreamforce in September 15.

Specifically around service, as you know, many companies differentiate themselves because of service and the way that they deliver service. So many companies are looking for innovation around how they engage with their customers. And over 70% of all sales, quite frankly, come from great service. So we're seeing this play out in the marketplace, as customers talk to us about how they can transform their business. And our Service Cloud product is best-in-class.

A lot of that dialogue is around specific industry and vertical content. So as we continue to think about our product portfolio and we extend our Customer Success Platform, which is an incredible platform, it's not just things that we extend ourselves. Our customers extend it. We have an incredible ecosystem that extends the capability of the platform. There is a natural play to deepen their relationships, drive more strategic relationships with more industry-focused product. Specific to your question around how we organize in the field, over the last 2 years, we have been very carefully and very slowly moving to more and more at a vertical orientation. For example, we have a huge focus on our public sector. We are taking a look at expanding how we go after financial services markets and health care and life sciences markets.

It seems like a fascinating time in the history of the software industry. You have Sage re-architecting under the Force.com platform.

And for a couple of them, their product revenues are actually declining for the first time ever outside of the recession. And then, their margins are under pressure while yours are increasing.

I think we all know IBM still sells a lot of mainframes. That doesn't mean that IBM is innovating. That doesn't mean that IBM is creating value for customers or helping them to transform customer's businesses or aligned them with modern trends. It just means they're sort of selling them old technology and upgrading them. And that's what you see with companies like Oracle and SAP. These are old technology bases that are kind of meandering along like mainframes. And I think that is reflected exactly, as you said, in their license revenue growth, which has been poor. And in their movement to the cloud has been stunted because they don't want to shift those customers into new models. Exactly why IBM lost the PC business because they were too afraid to let go of the mainframe. It's the past replaying itself, but instead of IBM, you've got Oracle and SAP basically running the same playbook. We all know that the world has changed. It's moved to the cloud. It's multi-tenant architectures. It's about meta database application development and deployment. It's about social user interfaces. It's about mobility. And it's about data science, and it's about the Internet of Things and the integration of everything. And companies who have built platforms like Salesforce, who've done that, deliver world-class growth like we're doing in this quarter. And if you haven't done that, well then, you end up with a quarter like Oracle or SAP had. And I think you've seen in the last 4 or 6 or 8 quarters, they've missed almost all of them. And that's because their technology bases are degrading the way mainframes have. But they can hang in there with their revenue and meander along like big dinosaurs moving down the desert for a while. But nothing can stop the movement of new technologies. And the key to being successful in the technology industry is to kind of transform that innovator's dilemma, to kind of constantly rethink and reconceptualize yourself to have a beginner's mind. And if you can do that, you can create something amazingly new. And you're going to see at Dreamforce more examples of Salesforce doing that. I've never been more excited about our technology base and what we're delivering to our customers. But ultimately, I've never been more excited that customers just love using our solutions, love working with us. And you feel that when you're at Dreamforce, and you're going to feel that in a bigger way than ever before."

We've also had the chance to help our customers build and create your own applications using our platform. And I think that's then actually by far the most exciting thing for us because it's taking us from just having a static application to something that customers mold and shape like they would with like Play-Doh or Lego, and they can create everything they want. And when you get to Dreamforce, you're going to see the next iteration of our Lightning platform that we released last year. And you're going to see a level of application, creation capabilities that's never been before possible in our industry and the ability to execute that on everything from an Apple Watch to a phone, to a desktop or a tablet. And that idea that we do have, that super dynamic app dev environment, and that's how we built all of our applications, means that we can help execute that verticalization or that line of business vision or the vision for any specific customer so much more rapidly. One -- I think it's also one of the reasons we've been able to create this incredible venture fund. I think you've seen we've been able to deliver amazing returns with our venture fund because we see -- we do see everything and we've been able to have incredible relationships with all these new companies and get them to integrate and work with our platform.

Here, you can see Salesforce is selling billions of dollars of CRM in the cloud this year. Oracle is selling millions of dollars.

So we have gotten some tremendous feedback about the capabilities of that particular cloud and how it fits relative to the customer engagement and driving customer success and how it does against the competition. I'll tell you, it will be the fastest launch of any product line that we've ever had here at Salesforce. So there's a lot of enthusiasm, there's a lot of innovation.

You've guided to non-GAAP operating margin improvement of plus 150. I think in the first half, you were plus 180, so the guide implies a little bit of a slower rate of improvement in the second half, and it's not obvious why that would be. And then on the cash flow side, to get to your 24%, 25% growth, given your great first half performance, operating cash flow in the second half would actually have to be negative year-over-year, and we haven't really seen that since the recession. So my take is that you're appropriately keeping expectations low and there's some conservatism built into both margin and cash flow guide. But I wanted to give you an opportunity to flag anything that might be informing your guidance on those 2 metrics in the second half."

Let's start with the operating margin. We're super pleased with the operating margin. As you've heard, we've expanded the operating margin for 5 quarters in a row year-on-year. Moreover, you've heard from Marc and I just the -- just absolute, unequivocal commitment to the revenue operating margin framework that we talked about in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. That's really clear, and you're seeing period after period after period of demonstrating that with action and results. And we're committed to the increase, obviously. And so at the same time, it's obviously our priority as a company to be a growth company and to take full advantage of investing to go tackle this amazing TAM that's out there, that's north of $50 billion today. It's a double-digit growing TAM, huge opportunity. And so clearly, what we're doing is we're growing rapidly, fastest growing top 10 software company in the world, and we're expanding operating margin just exactly as we said we would do, just exactly consistent with the framework. So obviously, making sure that we're investing in growth as well. So I think that's a key point there. We feel great about the guide. We raised the guide. Effectively, it was 125 to 150 as you said. Now we've taken it up to 150 approximately, and we feel good and confident about that. So we'll get a chance to revisit that as we go, but that's where we're at, point one. Point two is on operating cash flow. One of the things that is pronounced not only in operating cash flow but in a number of the metrics for the company, we talked for actually quite some time around the compounding effect of more and more of our invoicing showing up in Q4. And as we know, one of the effects of that shows -- makes our cash flow growth more bimodal as it shows up more in Q1 and then it shows up more in terms of Q4. And that's no shock. And one of the things that we want to make sure, we think we have a very solid operating cash flow guide. By the way, that's exactly consistent with the revenue operating margin framework that we put out, breakdown, the exact framework that we added. And at the end of the day, when we see when we have -- we're closer to Q4 and we have more visibility around Q4, we'll revisit that and we'll have a better sense of, is there anything we want to change there. But we think it's an appropriate guide so hopefully, that's helped on both sides."

And we refined our distribution strategy, really being focused on 7 core countries, which we've really just expanded to 9 core countries. The idea that we were going to be super focused in Europe and the U.K., France and Germany was a huge reset for us because, ultimately, what we're doing is building the U.K. cloud, the French cloud, the German cloud, and we're paying more attention to these customers inside these countries than ever before. Of course, that doesn't mean we don't do business in other countries or don't have customers in other countries. But this extraordinary focus in these core countries where the buyers are has paid off in spades for us, and it's allowed us to scale distribution, scale service, scale marketing and make sure our products are right for those customers in those core mega markets.

And at the end of the day, we want to also expand our operating margins in a framework consistent with our revenue growth. And so we try to balance that at the highest level.

I'll tell you, this second quarter well, this was just the best quarter we have ever had at salesforce.com. And just 1 quarter after crossing the $6 billion annual revenue",2286,"Well, hey, thanks so much, John, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I'll tell you, this second quarter well, this was just the best quarter we have ever had at salesforce.com. And just 1 quarter after crossing the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone, we have now surpassed a $6.5 billion revenue run rate, that's faster than any software -- enterprise software company in history, and we anticipate we're going to reach a $7 billion run rate by the end of this year. And we are now well on our way -- I mean, we have a clear trajectory to accomplishing our goal of being the fastest ever to reach $10 billion in revenues. So exciting. And no one in our industry is producing this kind of results of our size and scale. 
You know, also in this quarter, we became a Fortune 500 company. That's really exciting for Salesforce, one of the 500 largest companies in the world, a huge milestone. Congratulations to all of our customers and our partners and employees in this incredible job. 
We continue to be the fastest-growing top 10 enterprise software company that many of you projected. We're going to go from being the sixth largest software company in the world to the fourth largest next year. That's awesome. That is next year. Only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are bigger than Salesforce. That is incredible. And then, of course, we're going to go on to our next goal, which is to become the third largest software company in the world, first by market cap and then by revenue. 
Then, only Microsoft and Oracle are going to be larger than Salesforce. It's just amazing. Well, I want to thank all of our customers and partners for their inspiration and all of our Salesforce employees for this unwavering focus on customer success. This is what is driving Salesforce forward quarter-after-quarter. It just delights us to see our customers so successful with our products. 
And now I'd like to turn to the highlights for the quarter. Well, revenue for the quarter rose to $1.63 billion. That is up 28% in constant currency. And that's just beyond our expectations. Deferred revenue grew to more than $3 billion, up 33% in constant currency. And the dollar value of booked business, on and off the balance sheet, is $9.2 billion. It's a great indicator of the strength of our future revenues, and we are just really excited to see such strength in our deferred revenue. 
Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year. And we are committed, very deeply committed to improving profitability quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we also grow this business at record levels. 
All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $300 million in operating cash flow, which is up 24% year-over-year. That brings us to more than $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first half of the year, $1 billion in the first half of the year. And that really demonstrates the cash model built into cloud computing. This is an incredible achievement and demonstrates the power of our model.
Given these outstanding second quarter results, I am thrilled to announce that we are raising our full year guidance for both our top and bottom lines. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.625 billion, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS by $0.01 to $0.72 at the high end of our range. 
As you can see from our strong results, along with the incredible momentum we're having with our Customer Success Platform and our sales and service and marketing, community, analytics, apps, we're on a trajectory to deliver $10 billion in revenue, faster than any other enterprise software company in history. Did I mention that? It's been a phenomenal first half of the year. You'll hear more from Keith in a moment about how we've become a catalyst for business transformation and growth and how we're delivering new levels of customer success in every industry in every region every day. 
And this is especially true in Europe where I spent a majority of the quarter and where we're seeing tremendous growth. Our tours in Paris, in Munich drew nearly 10,000 raving customers. And I've had the opportunity to talk to dozens of CEOs in the region, whether it was at AXA or Barclays or BMW or Deutsche Telekom, Eurostar, Louis Vuitton, Schneider, Unilever, all of these folks have become very significant customers in the last year of Salesforce. And I'm even heading back to Europe again next week because we are seeing incredible momentum in our European business. Right now, every company in the world is looking to strengthen how they connect with their customers. This is a massive customer relationship management opportunity. Perhaps it is the largest opportunity in the software industry. Every company is looking to connect with their customer in a whole new way. Every company is looking for a whole new type of customer success. 
And no company is better positioned to deliver this to our customers than Salesforce. There has never been a company of our size and scale focused so exclusively on this customer relationship management opportunity. No other customer relationship management company has 17,000 people, every single employee completely focused on the customer. 
And that's why there's no other enterprise software company selling billions of dollars of CRM and still growing at nearly 30% in constant currency. Look, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, they're selling millions of dollars of CRM. That's with an M. We are selling billions of dollars of CRM, that's with a B, and that is the difference between us and the competition. 
No other enterprise cloud can match the breadth and depth of our trusted cloud platform and complete customer relationship management solutions, whether it's service or sales or service, marketing, community analytics, apps, within the Internet of Things. And no one can match the strength of the Salesforce ecosystem, our platforms, which is accelerating our growth with SIs and ISVs, creating solutions that address any kind of business process. 
In addition, the AppExchange, which is now the #1 business app marketplace, continues to set us apart from all others. I'll tell you, that AppExchange, our partners, our platform strategy over the last 10 years, this has really separated us from the competition. We're not an app; we're a platform. And we're not an app; we're an ecosystem. And we're not an app; we're all about customer success and it's our partners that help us to create that. 
We're seeing tremendous growth in the adoption and usage of our core platform. We delivered 234 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, up 79% from year ago. That's an average of nearly 3.7 billion transactions every single business day. 
We're also gaining traction as we better integrate acquisitions and invest in deep organic innovation. Well, those results are just phenomenal. You're going to see more innovation than ever at Dreamforce this year. You're going to see new products and new clouds, and we're going to be showcasing incredible new services. I mean, we're going to be breaking through with a whole new level of customer success. We're even going to be announcing this incredible new cloud.
Well, in addition, our strategic partnerships are paying off. There's no better example of this than our relationship with Microsoft. And at Dreamforce, you're going to hear about how we're making our joint customers, the customers of Salesforce and Microsoft, well, we're working more closely together than ever before, and we're working on making those customers even more successful, delivering deep integration with Office and Outlook and Azure. And I'm thrilled that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, is going to be speaking at Dreamforce this year with his own keynote, and that Microsoft Chairman, John Thompson, will be part of my keynote. 
Well, I have to tell you, but as all of you already know, Salesforce just isn't about doing well; we're also about doing good. Giving back has been an integral part of our company culture from the beginning with our 1/1/1 profit model. Salesforce technology now powers more than 26,000 nonprofit and higher education institutions, and the Salesforce Foundation has provided more than $96 million in grants. That's in addition to the almost $250 million of in-kind services that we've provided to these other nonprofits over our life. 
And this quarter, we surpassed another huge milestone. Our employees have given more than 1.1 million hours of community service. Well, that's just extraordinary. It's creating an amazing culture at Salesforce. It's an amazing place to work. And I think it is one of the reasons that our attrition has remained so low at a time of increased talent wars in Silicon Valley and even in San Francisco. There's no other technology company like Salesforce. 
Look, as I mentioned, Dreamforce is on the horizon. It's just 26 days away. It's going to be our biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever. And we expect more than 150,000 people to register for the event in San Francisco and 10 million to join us online. They're going to come from 75 countries. 
Dreamforce has become so big, we're bringing in a cruise ship because we've run out of hotel rooms. So we're calling that the Dreamboat. And to provide extra accommodations for all of our attendees, we've even partnered with Airbnb to radically expand the number of people that we can house in San Francisco. We've partnered with Uber to make sure that there's more drivers available than ever before. We're even going to have 4 air streams in the Dream Park for special events, and we're even going to have a few people staying there for additional accommodations because we're completely out of rooms. 
 
Look, you're going to see the future of Salesforce in my keynote, with relationship intelligence, next-generation of clouds, the Internet of Things. You're going to see a whole new standard for our industry. We have 1,500 customer-driven breakout sessions at Dreamforce. The world's biggest cloud ecosystem coming together in one place, thousands of solutions for more than 400 companies in our Cloud Expo. Isn't that amazing? 
And I didn't even mention the huge Foo Fighters concert that's going to be happening on Thursday night and our special event for our very top customers with John Legend the night before that. 
We've also gathered an amazing group of global thought leaders. In addition to Satya, we've got an incredible lineup of innovation speakers, including the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick; Skoll Foundation's Larry Brilliant; John Collison of Stripe; William Marshall of Planet Labs, who just launched more of his doves into the atmosphere; Hampton Creek's Josh Tetrick; George Zimmer is launching his new company zTailor and zTux, at Dreamforce. 
We even have best-selling authors Tom Davenport, Andrew McAfee, Dov Seidman and many, many, many others all speaking at Dreamforce. 
And we're all going to be talking about the future of business, the future of technology, the future of the cloud, social, mobile, the future of data science, of Internet of Things and the future of social responsibility as well as the importance of business to give back and to manage their stakeholders, not just their shareholders. 
A new Dreamforce Women's Leadership Summit features actress and entrepreneur Jessica Alba, YouTube CEO and Salesforce board member Susan Wojcicki, and Oscar winner Patricia Arquette. Incredible focus on the empowerment of women at Dreamforce. 
And we have a Startup Summit to aspire the next generation of entrepreneurs, with keynotes from actor and entrepreneur, Adrian Grenier -- I'm sure you all loved the movie Entourage; FOX CEO, Aaron Levie; Pro Football Hall of Famer, Steve Young. 
And we have a Mindfulness Day because we're all going to need to kick back, relax and clear our minds after that Dreamforce. And we have one of the world's top meditation teachers, Jack Kornfield; as well actress  Goldie Hawn; and fashion icon, Donna Karan, all talking about the importance of taking ourself, taking care of ourself while we're taking care of the world. 
And World Champion San Francisco Giants CEO, Larry Baer, the Golden State Warriors President and COO Rick Welts, are going to share the secrets for success in professional sports. Throughout Dreamforce, we'll have many ways in which attendees can give back. 
Each day at Dreamforce is a focus on an important cause in our world. One day will be dedicated to our veterans, one day dedicated to our K-12 schools, one day dedicated to women and technology, and one day dedicated to the environment and our oceans. 
And we're holding a fantastic benefit concert, as I mentioned, with Foo Fighters and other incredible bands that you're going to love to support children's health and our children's hospitals.  Bring all your friends. You're not going to want to miss it. If you buy a sponsorship for the concert, we're going to make sure you get unbelievable seats and recognition. 
And we're going to have the world's largest book drive of all time. So if you want to come to Dreamforce, you better bring a book for kids because we're going to be collecting books and putting them in libraries all over the country, collecting more than 1 million books to support schools and students. So don't forget your books. 
Don't forget bringing food because we're running a huge food drive. And I look forward to seeing you all at Dreamforce. And don't forget, it's going to be the biggest most exciting Dreamforce of all time. Now over to Keith."

As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We were executing like never before, and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry, and certainly in every cloud. We saw an amazing numbe",1151,"Thanks, Marc. As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We were executing like never before, and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry, and certainly in every cloud. 
We saw an amazing number of big deals this quarter. Really, for example, the Marketing Cloud doubled its number of large deals year-over-year, which was terrific to see. And more importantly, the value of our large deals across all the clouds has increased significantly. That is proof positive of the level and depth of the relationships that we're certainly driving with customers. 
As Marc said, we are now part of the Fortune 500, and that is a great indicator of how Salesforce is delivering customer success at scale. It's pretty clear that Salesforce is taking share from our competitors. And we are growing in every segment, in every industry and in every region as software center of gravity continues its shift from on-premise to the cloud.
In the past year, we have had countless conversations with CEOs of world-class companies -- Marc mentioned his trip to Europe -- around innovation and taking their companies into the future. They're looking to us to help transform their business models to drive growth and to become their trusted adviser. Every CEO's agenda is about growth and they are looking for Salesforce to be that growth engine. They're looking to us, and it all starts with our Customer Success Platform. 
These are conversations that are driving more meaningful and long-term relationships, quite frankly, with some of the greatest companies on earth. And I'm going to give you some examples, starting with Enel. Enel is Europe's largest power company, with 61 million customers. This deal was significant in terms of the expansion of an important relationship, where the CEO was personally involved. We are now Enel's strategic partner for the complete transformation of their customer engagement platform, leveraging sales and service in communities, analytics and platform. 
But that doesn't stop there. In addition, we are building an agility layer on their legacy on-premise SAP system. And we're helping them extract information from complex order management and inventory and billing systems. They're having trouble getting meaningful and timely information out of SAP. And Salesforce is bringing all this data together so Enel's teams can get a 360-degree view of their customers. 
And with Wave Analytics, they can drill down into their customer data right from the mobile phone in seconds. Enel absolutely has a tremendous vision for the future, and we at Salesforce are helping them make it a reality.
We also signed a significant deal this quarter with a huge global systems integrator. And just as they advise their clients, they themselves are making a major shift to the cloud and decided to replace their aging on-premise software with our Sales Cloud, with our Marketing Cloud and with our Platform. I'm also pleased to tell you they are doubling down on a dedicated Salesforce practice, and we're very, very excited about that. 
So with this win with this very large integrator, virtually every global systems integrator globally is running their business on Salesforce. In fact, the number of Salesforce-certified consultants across the globe grew 44% year-over-year. It's pretty staggering. This is a great indication of the type of growth and success that we're seeing in our partner ecosystem, which is one of our growth strategies and our partner strategy overall. We're very, very pleased with this. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is another exciting win for us in Q2. In one of their largest agencies, they've standardized on the Salesforce Platform to build and deploy mobile applications. In addition, their Farm Service Agency is also using our Service Cloud to connect citizens to critical resources. 
Our public sector business is just growing off the charts, and I'm really proud of the team for their outstanding performance. And just a year after being FedRAMP certified, we are building huge momentum with federal, state and local governments. In fact, 15 out of 15 federal cabinet agencies now use Salesforce as well as 45 of 50 state governments, and we are just getting started in this space. 
We also signed an exciting new relationship in the quarter with one of the largest hospitality vendors in the world. Now they have an incredible vision to bring all their customer service together onto a single platform to deliver a very personalized experience at scale to millions of their guests. The Service Cloud will now be the social mobile front office to their Oracle back office and allow their hotel associates to better engage and service guests no matter where they are anywhere in the globe. It was a great win over Oracle, and they chose Salesforce for our ability to deliver customer service on a flexible platform that would allow them to innovate with scale and speed. 
AXA has significantly expanded their 7-year relationship with us. And in the quarter, they've decided to consolidate 18 systems together onto our Service Cloud to run their entire global front office with more than 26,000 users. They're taking sales and customer service to a whole new level by modernizing their agent engagement platform with Salesforce. 
Now we've also signed new or expanded relationships in the quarter with Barclays and BBC, Comcast, Commerzbank, Cox, Ford, Genomic Health, GlaxoSmithKline, Honda, Honeywell, Renault. Listen, this list just goes on and on. It's pretty clear that we're driving success in every major industry. And as all you know, industries have been one of our critical strategies. We're incredibly excited about our industry momentum. It continues to gain mind share with our customers and our partners. 
In fact, we'll be launching our first industry products at the end of this month. Some of the most influential industry-leading companies are serving as our design partners in the development of these industry clouds. The early feedback has absolutely been incredibly positive, and you're going to see these products in action at Dreamforce. 
And speaking of Dreamforce, we've tailored the experienced for customers with a special industry showcase in the Dreamforce Expo as well as industry keynotes and special sessions. It's going to be 4 incredible days for banks, for retailers, for manufacturers, telecommunications companies, government entities, health care providers, and I really hope that you check it out. 
So I want to close by congratulating everyone at Salesforce for their tremendous performance this quarter and, of course, just incredible execution. I also want to thank our customers for their continued commitment and inspiration and our partners for their ongoing investment in our customer success. 
With our Customer Success Platform, our 6 world-class clouds, our industry innovation, our partner ecosystem, our international strategy, we are the innovation engine and trusted adviser for companies looking to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark."
122917,308178617,861637,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we've delivered another great quarter. From a top line perspective, we delivered revenue of $1.63 billion, up 24% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year he",643,"Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we've delivered another great quarter. From a top line perspective, we delivered revenue of $1.63 billion, up 24% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $50 million and a sequential tailwind of $4 million. 
Our revenue was strong across-the-board, becoming more diversified across each geography, all of our clouds and all of our business units. For example, our geographies continued to deliver great year-over-year growth in constant currency basis as Americas grew 28%, EMEA grew 29% and Asia Pac grew 25%. 
We also delivered incredible year-over-year growth in all of our clouds on a dollar basis, as Sales Cloud grew 10%, Service Cloud grew 40%, Platform and others grew 36% and Marketing Cloud grew 29%. Dollar attrition for the second quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%. 
And not only did we continue to grow our top line, we also improved our bottom line, expanding our non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year, and this is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We've been able to deliver this improvement by driving efficiencies across all our operating expense categories. 
As we remain committed to improving our non-GAAP operating margins year-over-year going forward, this is consistent with our operating margin framework we've discussed previously. Our great top line performance along with continued spending discipline, allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.19, up 46% over last year. 
Turning to cash flow. We delivered another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $304 million, up 24% over last year. And we've already delivered more than $1 billion in operating cash flow this year, up 44% for the first half of the year.
Second quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was up 37% over last year to $240 million. Looking at billed deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 29% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $72 million, deferred revenue grew 33% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of roughly $12 million.
In the quarter, 74% of the value of all subscriptions and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, and this is compared with 71% last year. This increase is primarily due to our annual invoicing policy for new contracts and, to a lesser extent, shifting current customers to annual terms upon renewal. In Q2, this benefited year-over-year deferred revenue by approximately 1 percentage point.
Moving on to guidance. With our strong performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $75 million. We now anticipate to be $6.6 billion to $6.625 billion for 23% growth. This guidance includes an FX headwind of approximately $175 million, which is a bit less than previously expected. 
Given the spending discipline I've discussed and a slightly lower impact from FX in the second half, we now expect to deliver approximately 150 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. This is the high end of our previous guidance. In that context, we're also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.70 to $0.72. 
Now let's turn to cash flow. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%. For Q3, we anticipate revenues of $1.69 billion to $1.70 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and deferred revenue growth in the mid-20% range. 
To close, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. We saw strong growth across all of our products and regions and are well positioned to move into the second half. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for delivering another great quarter. I look forward to seeing all of you at our annual Investor Day at Dreamforce in September 15. 
And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

Obviously, this is true positive that we're not just a Sales Force Automation company, and that we have a very diversified, very, very strong portfolio across the Customer Success Platform. Specifically around service, as you know, many companies differentiate themselves because of service and the way that they deliver service. So many companies are looking for innovation around how they engage with their customers. And over 70% of all sales, quite frankly, come from great service. So we're seeing this play out in the marketplace, as customers talk to us about how they can transform their business. And our Service Cloud product is best-in-class. So that certainly is what we're seeing going on in the marketplace right now."

Secondly, the industry has just deepened the relationship with the customer. Marc and I both talked about the level of engagement that we're seeing from CEOs. A lot of that dialogue is around specific industry and vertical content. So as we continue to think about our product portfolio and we extend our Customer Success Platform, which is an incredible platform, it's not just things that we extend ourselves. Our customers extend it. We have an incredible ecosystem that extends the capability of the platform. There is a natural play to deepen their relationships, drive more strategic relationships with more industry-focused product. Specific to your question around how we organize in the field, over the last 2 years, we have been very carefully and very slowly moving to more and more of a vertical orientation. For example, we have a huge focus on our public sector. We are taking a look at expanding how we go after financial services markets and health care and life sciences markets. So we've done this very carefully and very thoughtfully, and it's really paying out in our results."

I think we all know IBM still sells a lot of mainframes. That doesn't mean that IBM is innovating. That doesn't mean that IBM is creating value for customers or helping them to transform customer's businesses or align them with modern trends. It just means they're sort of selling them old technology and upgrading it. And that's what you see with companies like Oracle and SAP. These are old technology bases that are kind of meandering along like mainframes. And I think that is reflected exactly, as you said, in their license revenue growth, which has been poor. And in their movement to the cloud has been stunted because they don't want to shift those customers into new models. Exactly why IBM lost the PC business because they were too afraid to let go of the mainframe. It's the past replaying itself, but instead of IBM, you've got Oracle and SAP basically running the same playbook. We all know that the world has changed. It's moved to the cloud. It's multi-tenant architectures. It's about meta database application development and deployment. It's about social user interfaces. It's about mobility. And it's about data science, and it's about the Internet of Things and the integration of everything. And companies who have built platforms like Salesforce, who've done that, deliver world-class growth like we're doing in this quarter. And if you haven't done that, well then, you end up with a quarter like Oracle or SAP had. And I think you've seen in the last 4 or 6 or 8 quarters, they've missed almost all of them. And that's because their technology bases are degrading the way mainframes have. But they can hang in there with their revenue and meander along like big dinosaurs moving down the desert for a while. But nothing can stop the movement of new technologies. And the key to being successful in the technology industry is to kind of transform that innovator's dilemma, to kind of constantly rethink and reconceptualize yourself to have a beginner's mind. And if you can do that, you can create something amazingly new. And you're going to see at Dreamforce more examples of Salesforce doing that. I've never been more excited about our technology base and what we're delivering to our customers. But ultimately, I've never been more excited that customers just love using our solutions, love working with us. And you feel that when you're at Dreamforce, and you're going to feel that in a bigger way than ever before."

And then on the cash flow side, to get to your 24%, 25% growth, given your great first half performance, operating cash flow in the second half would actually have to be negative year-over-year, and we haven't really seen that since the recession. So my take is that you're appropriately keeping expectations low and there's some conservatism built into both margin and cash flow guide. But I wanted to give you an opportunity to flag anything that might be informing your guidance on those 2 metrics in the second half."

Let's just break it down one question at a time. Let's start with the operating margin. We're super pleased with the operating margin.

Let's start with the operating margin. We're super pleased with the operating margin. As you've heard, we've expanded the operating margin for 5 quarters in a row year-on-year. Moreover, you've heard from Marc and I just the -- just absolute, unequivocal commitment to the revenue operating margin framework that we talked about in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. That's really clear, and you're seeing period after period after period of demonstrating that with action and results. And we're committed to the increase, obviously. And so at the same time, it's obviously our priority as a company to be a growth company and to take full advantage of investing to go tackle this amazing TAM that's out there, that's north of $50 billion today. It's a double-digit growing TAM, huge opportunity. And so clearly, what we're doing is we're growing rapidly, fastest growing top 10 software company in the world, and we're expanding operating margin just exactly as we said we would do, just exactly consistent with the framework. So obviously, making sure that we're investing in growth as well. So I think that's a key point there. We feel great about the guide. We raised the guide. Effectively, it was 125 to 150 as you said. Now we've taken it up to 150 approximately, and we feel good and confident about that. So we'll get a chance to revisit that as we go, but that's where we're at, point one. Point two is on operating cash flow. One of the things that is pronounced not only in operating cash flow but in a number of the metrics for the company, we talked for actually quite some time around the compounding effect of more and more of our invoicing showing up in Q4. And as we know, one of the effects of that shows -- makes our cash flow growth more bimodal as it shows up more in Q1 and then it shows up more in terms of Q4. And that's no shock. And one of the things that we want to make sure, we think we have a very solid operating cash flow guide. By the way, that's exactly consistent with the revenue operating margin framework that we put out, breakdown, the exact framework that we added. And at the end of the day, when we see when we have -- we're closer to Q4 and we have more visibility around Q4, we'll revisit that and we'll have a better sense of, is there anything we want to change there. But we think it's an appropriate guide so hopefully, that's helped on both sides."

And their customers inspire them. And that's what Salesforce is all about. And so we have gotten some great feedback on analytics. We are well positioned in the marketplace. We've got a great ecosystem associated with analytics. We've got more than 80 partners. We've done some great things with Merck and Barclays and Genomic Health. And we'll continue to evolve and augment and enhance the product so that it is far-reaching. So we're excited about the future of Wave. We think it's going to be an incredible product. It's already had a great first year, almost first year, I should say. We're very proud of our Marketing Cloud performance in the quarter. That cloud is gaining momentum. It has really been an incredible part of our Customer Success Platform. It completes our solution for our customers to transform their businesses as far as how they define their digital strategies and their customer strategies. And so we will continue to see, again, as all innovative companies do, but none like Salesforce, we will continue to innovate our product line and enhance our product line.

And we refined our distribution strategy, really being focused on 7 core countries, which we've really just expanded to 9 core countries. The idea that we were going to be super focused in Europe and the U.K., France and Germany was a huge reset for us because, ultimately, what we're doing is building the U.K. cloud, the French cloud, the German cloud, and we're paying more attention to these customers inside these countries than ever before. Of course, that doesn't mean we don't do business in other countries or don't have customers in other countries. But this extraordinary focus in these core countries where the buyers are has paid off in spades for us, and it's allowed us to scale distribution, scale service, scale marketing and make sure our products are right for those customers in those core mega markets. That has resulted in numbers in Europe and growth in this company. We haven't seen numbers like this growing in Europe in other software companies. That's the power of what's going on. So I only see more of that. I'm heading back to Europe next week because I'm still excited about the European opportunity. And the customers that I met with and spent time in Europe, well, that has escalated. I mean, I'm now really not meeting with the CIOs anymore or the Chief Revenue Officers or Chief Service Officers. When I get over there, we're meeting mostly with Chief Executive Officers because they are more committed to delivering their customer capabilities than ever before.

All right, well, Mark Hawkins is also with us, our Chief Financial Officer, and the 3 of us are thrilled to be with you today to talk another standing growth quarter for Salesforce. 
Now you can see from these results, we are on pace to deliver well over $6 billion -- $6.6 billion this year, which is faster than any other enterprise software company in history. And I am thrilled to share with you that we are expecting to deliver more than $8 billion in revenue or $8.1 billion revenue at the high end of our range for next year. So that is amazing. 
And we could not be more excited about the results of the third quarter. We could not be more excited about coming into the fourth quarter, and we could not be more excited about the potential for next year. And you can see that we have something in sight which we have been talking about now for several years, which is our $10 billion year. And of course, Salesforce, as you can see, will be the fourth largest software company in the world next year. But you can see that we will be one of the only software companies ever to reach $10 billion in revenue. 
And as we become #4, we have #3 in our sights, and we certainly [indiscernible] goal as well quite wholeheartedly. Now as many of you are predicting, Salesforce will be indeed the fourth largest enterprise software company in the world next year, behind only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. 
And we are really making a difference to our customers in the industry and it's a tribute to our employees. Almost 20,000 of these employees who are focused on one thing: our customer success. I'd like to kind of give you some specifics on the results for the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter rose to more than $1.7 billion, which was up 27% in constant currency from year ago. That is absolutely, I think, the best performance that I've seen in the top 10 enterprise software companies. 
And Salesforce continues to be the fastest-growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies. And we are really excited with our -- the 27% number. The third revenue grew to more than $2.8 billion or up 30% in constant currency from a year ago, pretty incredible at our size and scale to see that achievement. 
And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $9.5 billion. So that again is setting us up very well for next year and the future. As we deliver on this outstanding top line growth, we also delivered 221 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. And as you know, while we are absolutely committed to be the fastest-growing enterprise software company and delivering phenomenal top line numbers, we are also deeply committed to continuing to increase our profitability, and the results this year are evidence of that. 
So let's be clear, Salesforce is the only software company selling billions of dollars of CRM. And we are at the center of what every company is going through. It's digital transformation. It's what every company wants to be in the 21st century. 
So now during the quarter, I want to tell you, I met with hundreds of CEOs around the world. And I'll tell you, when meeting with CEOs, they are not that interested in talking about honestly about the cloud or about social or mobile. They want to talk about their customers. And they want to talk about their top line, and they want to talk about how they're going to grow that top line. 
And this is really, really exciting thing that's going on which is this customer revolution. Now we're really talking connecting with -- talking about -- talking with our customers about connect with their customers in the only way, accelerate their growth, creating these one-to-one customer journeys, running their businesses from their phone and making smarter more predictive decisions. 
And I'll tell you one of those customers is us. And at the end of this quarter, it just kind of blew me away [indiscernible] using Salesforce1 which has on it, I think, 1 million users, active users on it now. And my IT department here at Salesforce has built new apps, which got automatically installed on iPhone because I'm using Salesforce1. And I'm using this incredible sales forecasting map basically touching on the photograph of all of our sales leaders around the world kind of navigating through our pipelines and through our forecast. 
And it was amazing just to be able to run my business from iPhone and have that kind of connectivity with my customers. And I think that today, more than ever, connecting with customers like that is absolutely essential because as a CEO, I can tell you -- almost of your business and what's really going on. 
Well, I think that, that was definitely evident for everyone who attended Dreamforce. And if you came to Dreamforce, you saw the biggest software conference ever. And you also saw not just a huge amount of customers, but we really rolled out incredible new innovation, which is enabling my own personal experience with Salesforce product but for hundreds of thousands of Salesforce customers who are using these incredible new products like our new Lightning platform, which is amazing. You have the ability to build an application and run it on any device, on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC. It transcends operating systems, it transcends devices. 
And we've our sales and service and our core community products in all of our core platforms on this amazing new platform. And when it shows up, it's -- it's done nothing like I've ever seen, which is -- gives you this incredible modern experience in a mobile environment. 
And then, of course, we also had a Salesforce IQ the intelligence to that. We introduced our IOT cloud bring it into the Internet of Things, and then you can transform that Internet of Things into Internet of Customers. Well, of course, we also had our Analytics Cloud. With our new apps and there's still much more. 
And I'll tell you that walking around Dreamforce, I just -- I was blown away also with our ecosystem and the hundreds and hundreds of companies who have built on this platform and who have made so much happen. But I guess what I'm most proud of is that during Dreamforce, we also held the largest book drive ever, collective over 1 million books for schools. We also raised over $10 million for UCFF Children's Hospital in San Francisco and Oakland. And I'll tell you that I want to thank all of our partners and our customers for helping us to achieve those numbers there. Just really awesome.
Well, I'll tell you, it's been an exciting few months here at Salesforce, and I would say that nothing is more indicative of how Salesforce is delivering customer's [indiscernible] than how this Lightning platform is being adopted. 
In the third quarter, we delivered more than 259 billion transactions, which is up 63% from a year ago. That's 4.1 transactions every single business day. No other customer platform comes close to that level of usage. And while our transaction continues to skyrocket and our customer success continues to skyrocket, we committed also to reducing our carbon footprint, and the environment is a key stakeholder for us. And we continue to show how the multi-tenant cloud platform is 98% more efficient than on-premise software. And we're helping our customers avoid the many more than 1 million tons of carbon each year through our unique architecture of cloud computing.
But we have to do more, and we've made significant commitments to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050, and over the next several weeks in Paris at the top 21 [ph] conference, we'll be making more announcements on how Salesforce is focused on the environment.
Well, as you're about to hear now from Keith, we're working with some of these great customers to deliver fantastic results, to accelerate the digital transformation. And I guess, there was no more stronger evidence point to the analyst community than Gartner's 2016 CIO Agenda, which I'm sure a lot of you follow as I do. 
And they found that Salesforce is rated as the #1 accelerator by the majority of the respondents and received the highest digital acceleration score out of 30 vendors. Salesforce was at the top. And just Gartner did an amazing job and the CIO agenda report is have the chance to look at that, I would. 
Well, anyway let's hear from Keith. He's had a huge day already in New York. He's still -- I can see him on the monitor here so he's still there, which is good. And Keith, tell us how did New York go today?"

You obviously had a great Dreamforce. We saw more customers this year. I know you and I this year have been in front of more CEOs and CIOs, I think, ever in our entire career. And everyone wants to talk about how to transform the customer experience. 
I don't know a company today that isn't reviewing how to transform the customer experience and how to not get -- a lot of them say, they don't want to get Uber-ized out of the world. But some of, them I, think you don't want to get post made it out of the world because I just ordered my lunch on post mid-tier in San Francisco. So maybe you can tell me your experience there in New York."

I appreciate it and great to be here and obviously, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter. And what I would characterize, I think we all would characterize, one o",1663,"All right. So thanks, Marc. I appreciate it and great to be here and obviously, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter. And what I would characterize, I think we all would characterize, one of the most memorable and exciting quarters that we've had here at Salesforce. 
And we heard it today and we continue to hear as a message from our customers is very clear. And while many of our competitors are struggling quite frankly to catch up to the cloud, Salesforce is taking customers and partners forward into this age of the customer. 
And we are squarely in this age of the customer. Marc and I just talked about this, but I had the opportunity to kick off our Salesforce World Tour here in New York. Again, over 8,000 people registered for this event, and people wanted to hear, both customers and prospects, about companies like American Express and Mattel and Western Union and an awful lot of customers through a variety of industries about how they are reinventing their futures and leveraging Salesforce. 
And as I speak to the top customers around the world and Marc is exactly right, many of them are CEOs which is terrific. There is a constant theme that keeps coming through here. And that is that we are clearly in this age of the customer and the time of cutting your way through prosperity is over. 
And when you think about it, the agenda for every CEO in the world is growth. And the reason why CEOs are coming to us as because they see Salesforce as that catalyst for growth. And we are also, quite frankly, catalysts for customer success. 
So whether it's a company of all shapes and sizes, whether its business model is B2B or B2C, large company or small company, regardless of the industry, these CEOs are really looking at us now to be their trusted adviser and really help them define their new customer strategy, their digital strategies, their engagement models and really new ways to transform into customer company. And that's just because super, super important to them. 
And all of this has translated into some of the most exciting deals that we've done in our industry. We had another huge quarter of fantastic wins. In fact, the total number of our large transactions in Q3 was up significantly compared to last year in terms of value. Our relationships are becoming bigger. They're becoming broader, they're becoming more strategic and deeper. And we are now working with some of the world's greatest brands, and this is a far different roster of companies that we have been [indiscernible] work with. 
A big part of that success, quite frankly, it's been our industry strategy. And we've talk about this on many calls but this is about our ability to speak to of customers and to understand their business problems and drive a level of innovation and a point of view, and it's become a regular part of how we engage with customers of all sizes from the smallest to the largest of enterprises. And it's really proving out in our results. 
And I'll give you a few examples. Certainly, there's a company that we've all heard of called General Motors. They have 125 million cars on the road. They have a significant vision for the connected vehicle. And in Q3, they selected Salesforce to connect drivers, the cars, merchants and retailers to bring a connected vision, a great experience to life. 
And with the push of a button, drivers are going to be able to instantly connect with the OnStar adviser and retailers and merchants. And it doesn't matter where they are, and they're going to get real-time information. And this is an example of a company, GM, that is really embracing the opportunity around the Internet of Things. And we are really excited about working with them. 
We're entering the holiday season as we all know. We're seeing a lot of traction in retail. And I'm thrilled that we closed the largest Marketing Cloud deal in the company's history with a very large retailer in Q3. They are taking things to the next level by personalizing the software experience across every single channel. We're going to be at the core of their omnichannel consumer engagement strategy. And they will be able to create a very personalized and predicted one-to-one relationship with customers at every single touch point, which is really compelling. And they're also going to be able to anticipate what the next step is and what the next action is and what customers might need and relevant suggestions at exactly the right moment. So we were very excited about that new partnership. 
Another great win was with AECOM. If you're familiar with AECOM, they design and build and finance and operate some of the largest and most iconic infrastructure projects around the globe, including here in New York, the World Trade Center and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Stadium, which we're very excited about [indiscernible] They have nearly 100,000 employees in more than 150 companies, excuse me, countries. And we're all thrilled that AECOM has decided to move their entire company to our platform. 
In financial services, which is certainly a key focus area for us, we have expanded our relationship with American Express, one of the great brands in the industry, a company that has been delivering world-class service more than 160 years. In the quarter, American Express selected Salesforce to bring their sales and marketing and product teams altogether to collaborate and to coordinate so they can further transform their customer experiences for their business payments. Super excited about that new relationship. 
And what's interesting about that deal is that AmEx and so many others continue to use our process to really reconceptualize their futures that this is a very unique solution approach that is all about the art of possible. We have increased our ten-fold in the past few years. It is the standard part of our what it is one of the best investments, quite frankly, that we've made, and it's having a significant impact with our customers. 
In fact, one of the leading high-tech manufacturing companies in the world also engaged with us in the quarter in and in Ignite, and that resulted in a significant 8-figure deal, which we're very, very excited about. 
And right before Dreamforce, I think as we all know, we introduced our first vertical specific product line with cloud and the financial services cloud. We're very excited about the growth opportunity for these clouds. The interest has been very strong. We're excited about their future and these products are really translating our incredible core technology into the language of the customer, which is part of our industry strategy. And we are cultivating an excellent ecosystem of partners for all of these solutions. So we're excited about that as well. 
International continues to be a cornerstone of our growth strategy. In the quarter, we expanded our relationship with a company called AB InBev. They've been in the press a lot recently. They're one of the world's top 5 consumer product companies. They've standardized their collaboration with us globally. 
And that's after a successful relationship start in Europe and now they're going to reinforce their customer-centric digital approach and innovation efforts, leveraging our products as well, so we're excited about that. And AB InBev joined ABB and Barclays and GlaxoSmithKlein, Telefónica, Virgin Media and so many great leading companies in Europe again who selected Salesforce in Q3. 
In Asia Pac, we continued with our strength. We closed deals with Australian Post, Singtel Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Toyota and the list goes on there. So I really couldn't be thrilled -- more thrilled about the success we're seeing internationally. We continue to invest in our capacity, our service capacity, our data centers, our offices, our partners, all to drive growth and to make our customers successful. 
Another area where we continue to make progress, quite frankly, is with our partners in our ecosystem. And I'm very proud of the results receipting with regional and global systems integrators. Our partner certifications in the quarter, they were up more than 40% from a year ago, which is outstanding. And with all of our global SIs growing at an even faster rate, this is a great indicator that the most important consulting partners and firms in the world are betting their business and their customers' business on Salesforce. 
So we have friends like Accenture and Deloitte, PwC and Capgemini, they're all increasing their Salesforce practices. They are walking arm and arm into the suite with Salesforce. And in addition, our App Cloud continues to be the platform of choice for innovation by our ISVs. And a great example of where our industry strategy were ecosystem strategy. 
A firm named Accenture, we're all familiar with, selected Salesforce as a partner to transform the front office of consumer companies around the world. So they will be bringing their Accenture CaaS solution onto the Salesforce AppExchange, which is a great endorsement of our platform and critical to our joint industry strategy. 
So in closing, I want to say thank you to all of our customers and thank you to all of our partners for their trust in us and their confidence in us. And I'd also like to thank our incredible employees for their outstanding execution in the quarter and this unrelentless dedication to customer success. And right now, we are firing on all cylinders and our investments in the industries, our partner ecosystem, our international regions, it's all paying off, and we have excellent momentum coming out of Salesforce. And really Marc, based on what I saw in New York this morning, we are very well positioned for a very strong finish to the FY '16 and we're looking forward to a historic close this year. So [indiscernible]."

And Keith, I'll tell you, I watched the Sales Cloud keynote after your keynote today, and Accenture was the speaker with Sarah Barney during the Sales Cloud keynote. And what was really interesting, they talked about how not only are they doing this incredible partnership, building products on our platform to sell to their customers, but that they have rolled out 25,000 users internally, and their speaker today in New York on the video I watched talked about how what he learned working with Salesforce is the key to success is to be bold and go fast and just go do whatever you can and that goes much, much faster than any other platform he had ever worked with.

And so they appreciate the level of transformation. They know what their customers are looking for. And because of that, they want to partner with a company like Salesforce, who understands growth, understands transformation. So it's a very good linkage between the 2 firms. And that's what we're seeing in the marketplace, and that's why Accenture was happy to establish that partnership in the consumer packaged goods space.

We delivered another great quarter with consistent execution and balanced growth across all of our products and geographies. And our results this quarter set us up for a strong finish in FY '16 as discussed and another solid year in FY '17. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.71 billion, up 24% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue with the year-over-year headwind of $40 million and a sequential headwind of $6 million. 
We continue to see strong year-over-year constant currency growth in all of our geographies with the Americas growing 27%, EMEA growing 28% and Asia Pac ORINK 25%. Each of our clouds delivered outstanding year-over-year growth on a dollar basis with Sales Cloud growing 10%, Service Cloud growing 38%, App Cloud and other growing 40% and Marketing Cloud growing 29%. 
Dollar attrition for the third quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%. From a bottom line perspective, we delivered another quarter of improving profitability. In fact, we have now increased our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 221 basis points over Q3 of last year.
Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.21. Non-GAAP EPS includes approximately $0.01 from our lower-than-anticipated non-GAAP tax rate, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Our great top line and bottom line performance in Q3 drove another solid quarter of cash generation, with operating cash flow of $118 million. This is slightly down year-over-year about 4%, while operating cash flow year-to-date was up 37% compared to the same period over last year. And that's now up to $1.2 billion year-to-date, which is very exciting. 
Marc, it took us 15 years to get to $1 billion in cash flow, and we did it in the first 2 quarters and now we're topping it, so we are really excited about that. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating cash flow in the growth of 24% to 25%, consistent with our prior guidance and our growth operating margin framework. 
Third quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $38 million, down 23% over last year. Again, year-to-date free cash flow was $937 million, up 47% over the first 9 months of the last year.
Looking at deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 28% year-over-year.  An FX headwind of $41 million, deferred revenue grew 30% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of $7 million. In the quarter, 79% of the subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms compared to 73% in Q3 of last year. This was a bit higher than anticipated and translated into approximately 2 percentage points of deferred revenue growth in the quarter.
Moving on to guidance. With our great performance in the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $25 million. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.64 billion to $6.65 billion or 24% growth year-over-year. 
Our guidance continues to include an FX headwind of approximately $175 million. We are also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.74 to $0.75 or $0.03 at the high end of the range, which is approximately $0.02 as a result of our outperformance and about $0.01 as a result of our lower full year non-GAAP tax rate. 
Now let me take a minute to discuss our non-GAAP tax rate. We are adjusting our projected full year non-GAAP tax rate to 35.5% in light of a recent tax opinion. You may recall that we began to compute and used a fixed long-term non-GAAP tax rate during FY '15. And as we said, we would reevaluate this rate annually and/or if a situation arises where we need to reevaluate that and that is exactly the case as it relates to Volterra, and that's just the situation where we need to true that up. We'll continue to reevaluate that and give you updates as we need to.
For Q4, our full year guidance implies revenue growth of approximately $1.782 billion to $1.792 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and a billed deferred revenue growth of approximately 23% to 24%. And as you heard from Marc, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal revenue guidance of approximately $8 billion to $8.1 billion for a year-over-year growth of 20% to 22%. In fact, FY '17 feels very similar to last year as we continue to deliver strong growth at scale. And we will provide additional details about our outlook for FY '17 on our fourth quarter call in February.
To close, we had a strong third quarter and we are well positioned for a great finish to FY '16 and to deliver another solid year in FY '17. Thanks to all of our employees for continuing to deliver these outstanding results. So with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

Sales, service, marketing, analytics, these are all multibillion-dollar markets. We actually call them internally swimmers. And we call them swimmers in their lanes. And we look at these products each going down their own lane. And yes, you're right, Service is performing incredibly well. But so is Sales, so is analytics, so is community, so is our platform, so is marketing. We have many, many, many high-performing swimmers. Then we don't just look at it that way, by the way, we not only see that. We see it by geography, which -- and we also look at it in verticals. And in each of the strategic areas that we've made these big bets, we continue to see very high performance. And in customer service support, if you've read Gartner's most recent customer engagement Magic Quadrant, you'll see Salesforce is #1. We've displaced Oracle, we've displaced SAP. These were traditionally the leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. And so we're not only now the #1 in the Magic Quadrant on sales, which we have been for a few years, but now we're #1 in the Magic Quadrant for service, which means we actually have the best product possible. Our customers just have phenomenal success. We have great examples of customers who have tens of thousands of users deployed on this product. We have examples of customers who have tens of users, hundreds of users. But what's unusual about our Service Cloud is it could be a very small company or you could be a massive company and you can use our Service Cloud. And when you look at the requirements for customers to provide extended customer services, especially in regards to areas like the Internet of Things, when some core customers like Cisco or Philips or even Coca-Cola are more connected to their customer than ever before, the first point of access with those customers is customer service. So they better have their customer service act together if they're going to drive the customer Revolution. So of course, we continue to do well in all of our core products but also customer service is a critical part of our portfolio. Keith, do you want to add anything to that?"

So there is no doubt we are at a tipping point in cloud platform. And companies who have been cloud deniers like SAP and Oracle are paying a horrible price in single digits and negative growth because companies are not buying their products because they're not modern and they're not built in this kind of modern architecture. When you look at the cloud opportunities, there's different opportunities. And one opportunity is at the applications layer where we dominate in sales and service, the marketing where we have these multi-, multiple billion dollar clouds all kind of underway, which I just talked about in the last question. At the next layer down, which is declared as programmatic application development deployment, especially in rapid application development and deployment, this is an area where we also have incredible success, partner calls this APaaS, application platform as a service. You look at our product like our app cloud, Salesforce1, Lightning, Heroku, this is an area that's very strategic to us because our core applications are built with our platform, which gives our customers basically the plasticity necessary to kind of take our applications apart and close them back together. This is an area that's very important to us. The next layer down is the kind of what we call traditionally call Infrastructure as a Service. Amazon Web Services, which we are a huge customer of Amazon Web Services. Amazon is also a huge customer of Salesforce. And we use Amazon Web Services to build our products. For example, Heroku is one of the most successful platforms on the Amazon Web Services and has been an incredible success for salesforce.com and also demonstrates the power of Amazon's platform. Salesforce also has been working with Microsoft on how we are currently using Azure as part of our product line as well. We're very excited about Microsoft. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We've talked about that. And I think as is terrific. And Google by the way, who is a huge customer of Salesforce. We use Google platform very extensively as Salesforce as well. And I'll tell you something. That is critical for the operations of our company and Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud platforms. We're a very modern company in how we deploy IT internally that's given us the flexibility to grow. We tutor and mentor other CIOs in industry leaders and show them what we've done to build a modern company using this highly flexible IT infrastructure. But it's because we're doing all 3 of these layers: one, very flexible dynamic, highly innovative, 3 releases a year, applications at the top. In the middle, rapid application development and deployment of app like I was talking about new apps appearing on my phone instantly from my IT department in the -- and that gate pass area. And also in infrastructure-as-a-service where we partner with Amazon, we partner with Microsoft and we partner with Google. Those are 3 core strategic partners in infrastructure-as-a-service. And that's of the modern IP infrastructure. And today, of course, what do we all run it on? you don't run it on our laptop, but we run it on our phones. And that's the power of the modern age. And this gives you the level of speed in IT. It gives you much lower total cost of ownership. And it gives you a rate of innovation because you're not waiting 3 or 4 years for a new release. You're waiting 3 or 4 months, sometimes 3 or 4 days before you're getting incredible new features and functionality. And so yes, we're at a tipping point. You could see that in the results of Amazon. You can see to the results of Microsoft. You can see it under both Google, and you can see to the results of Salesforce and for companies who have denied that this is shift is happening for companies who customers to be afraid of this shift and for companies who have tried to stop this shift, look at where they are today. It's quite a good example of [indiscernible] theory regarding the innovator's dilemma."

Look, across the board, I mean, if you look at the wins in this quarter, we had some terrific experiences with financial services obviously with American Express. In automotive, with General Motors; in consumer packaged goods with AB InBev and Mattel. So financial services is very strong. Health care and life sciences is very strong. Retail is really picking up. CPG is really picking up. Manufacturing has always been a strength of the company, but we continue to do very, very well. I alluded to the deal that we closed earlier. So it really has become a situation where no surprise, customers want to speak to us, and we should be speaking to them in their language. And that is the whole idea behind the industry strategy, and it starts with that. It starts with the messaging the creation of the solution. It also moves into making sure organize carefully, and we've done that very carefully over the last 2.5 years in physical organizations that's focused on vertical markets. And then the third is we start delivering products, which we announced again just before Dreamforce around health cloud and financial services cloud. So it's really a 3-pronged industry strategy. It is resonating with our customers. They want more of it. don't want less of it. And we already have a very compelling and differentiated solution but when you also add this sort of layer on it with the industry messaging and going to market by industry also adding to this products that, it becomes super compelling and customers really, really like what we're doing."

And when you look at the great success of a lot of these core products, we want to continue to fuel them. Certainly, Service Cloud is amazing. Marketing Cloud obviously is also amazing. And Sales Cloud, of course, achieved a level of revenue that we never could have anticipated and continues to grow. And we have other, as I said, swimmers in their lane still be very, very well. Now in addition to those core products, especially with the tips Marketing Cloud outstanding performance specially since we acquired ExactTarget and integrated that very deeply into the company, I think also, you have to look at what Keith has done with the public sector, which is very exciting for us. It is a huge opportunity for our company. And of course, the verticals where we are continuing to build some new products, including our wealth management product that we've announced in our health products and other applications, categories that we see. And that I will also have to see ISVs. So ISVs remain a really powerful growth as well. So if we have problem at Salesforce, it's that we have a huge amount to invest next year, but we can't just peanut butter and give everybody something. We have to make some bets and invest in some of these winners, but I'm talking about because we have had some phenomenal results as well."

The first thing we always think about obviously this customer success, and we want to make sure that happens and that really promotes renewals, and we love the attrition rate cash drag the company for a long, long time, and you watch that come down and now into the approximately 9% range and that really helps us. And so as we think about margins going forward as it relates to renewals, one of the things I just would almost level it up and say, ""All of our unit economics suggest that you can hit the mid-30s in terms of our operating margin over the long term at mature revenue growth rates. And part of that taking good care is because he give the attrition rate low and part of that is we continue to get scale with unit economics that we can see today. So Kash, I think the long and short of it is as that renewal business continues to grow, our #1 priority is to take care of the customer and #2 is we will fulfill the operating margin in the mid-30s long, long term."

And how far do you want to push the boundaries of data science at Salesforce? In other words, do you think you would have more of a focus on analytics to support sales, service and marketing?

Because all of those things are going to be important in the next 10 years. All of those things, the cloud, social mobile, data science, deep learning, MLP, machine intelligence, those are table stakes, those are table stakes. What are you going to do with that technology? Who's not using those technologies? Is using the technologies is using that technology. Apple is using that technology Cisco is using that technology Coca-Cola Unilever, they're all using it. Look, it's the next 10 years for these companies is going to be about customer. What are they doing to build a world-class customer experience? How do they transform from being product companies to customer experience companies? And as millennials takeover in these enterprises, they are going to be much more focused on experiences. And that is going to be the transformational lever for growth with these companies. And I think that if we get 2 and 2, any one particular technology or [indiscernible] all of a sudden wave the flag like I used to do 15 or 16 years ago for Cloud, okay, that will be a huge mistake for our company because the #1 thing most important thing for this company is the customer. So there was a really good discussion between materially host of the CEO of IBM. And John Stumpf who is the CEO of Wells Fargo Bank at a conference that I was just at put on by Fortune Magazine here in San Francisco. And I'm sure that the transcript is available online. But you'll see that when she is discussing her strategy is to become the company. And when he is discussing his strategy is to become the customer company. And I think that we do have to decide what kind of companies are we going to be. I'm going with customer company. I want to be a customer company like John does. He is all about the customer, maintaining the integrity and the fidelity of the customer relationship. I want to help them do that. And yes, we are cognitive we can do that that yes, its full belly is socially S IoT yes, all of these things. But let's keep our eye on the ball, which there is a transformational that is its way through all of these companies and every company is afraid that they're going to be Uber-ized out of the world. And they see it happening and could be financial services it could be IBM, okay? Every company's worried about, look at the decline of IBM over the last decade. Technology is shaking every company at its roots. So that's why the companies who will be the most successful other ones are most connected other customers because the customers are the ones who guide us into the future. They are the ones with a true mission of very have to go. So I'm going with customer on this one."

We've been on a steady path of continuous improvement and we reported out when we make progress in last quarter, we continued to make progress as in no year-on-year, we went from 74% of our invoices being annual to 79%. And so that is just good progress, good execution. We are pleased to see it. It works well for lots and lots of different reasons. And that added as I called out about roughly 2 points of growth to deferred revenue year-on-year. But I think we have continued runway on this in the sense that the more enterprise we get, the more natural it is for people to go to the annual terms of that we're looking for, so I wouldn't expect any short terms, Karl. I think about this as a steady progression with yes, more runway in the future. Keith [indiscernible] watered, and that's what we're jetting I think it's good execution that's number one. Number two, in terms of renewals and one of the things for everybody on the call to just as a reminder, we just talked about the quantum of our renewals if you think about when they show up in Q4 is when they show up the most when you think about that of the historical patterns of our business and in fact, that is what we expect, and that's all got grounded in our guidance, which we feel really good about both for Q4, the strong finish and also as we point into next year. Obviously, hitting something worth $8 billion, $8.1 billion on top line revenue, which really good about for the company to continue to grow and execute that this scale.

Now you can see from these results, we are o",1518,"Fantastic. All right, well, Mark Hawkins is also with us, our Chief Financial Officer, and the 3 of us are really thrilled to be with you today to talk about another outstanding growth quarter for Salesforce. 
Now you can see from these results, we are on pace to deliver well over $6 billion -- $6.6 billion this year, which is faster than any other enterprise software company in history. And I am thrilled to share with you that we are expecting to deliver more than $8 billion in revenue or $8.1 billion revenue at the high end of our range for next year. So that is amazing, and we could not be more excited about the results of the third quarter. We could not be more excited about coming into the fourth quarter, and we could not be more excited about the potential for next year. 
And you can see that we have something in sight, which we have been talking about now for several years, which is our $10 billion year. And of course, Salesforce, as you can see, will be the fourth largest software company in the world next year. But you can see that we will be one of the only software company to ever to reach $10 billion in revenue. And as we become #4, we have #3 in our sight, and we certainly [indiscernible] that goal as well quite wholeheartedly. 
Now as many of you are predicting, Salesforce will be indeed the fourth largest enterprise software company in the world next year, behind only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. And we are really making a difference to our customers in the industry and it's a tribute to our employees. Almost 20,000 of these employees who are similarly focused on one thing, our customer's success. 
I'd like to kind of give you some specifics on the results for the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter rose to more than $1.7 billion, which was up 27% in constant currency from year ago. That is absolutely, I think, the best performance that I've seen in the top 10 enterprise software companies, and Salesforce continues to be the fastest-growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies. And we are really excited with our -- that 27% number. Deferred revenue grew to more than $2.8 billion or up 30% in constant currency from a year ago, pretty incredible at our size and scale to see that achievement, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $9.5 billion. 
So that, again, is setting us up very well for next year and the future. As we deliver on this outstanding top line growth, we also delivered 221 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. And as you know, while we are absolutely committed to be the fastest-growing enterprise software company in delivering these phenomenal top line numbers, we are also deeply committed to continuing to increase our profitability, and the results this year are evidence of that. 
So let's be clear, Salesforce is the only software company selling billions of dollars of CRM, and we are at the center of what every company is going through. It's digital transformation. It's what every company wants to be in the 21st century.
So now during the quarter, I want to tell you, I met with hundreds of CEOs around the world. And I'll tell you, when meeting with CEOs, they are not that interested in talking about, honestly, about the cloud or about social or mobile. They want to talk about their customers and they want to talk about their top line. They want to talk about how they're going to grow that top line. And this is really, really exciting thing that's going on, which is this customer revolution. 
We're really talking about connecting with -- talking about -- talking with our customers about connecting with their customers in a whole new way, accelerate their growth, creating these one-to-one customer journeys, running their businesses from their phone and making smarter more predictive decisions. 
And I'll tell you one of those customers is us. And at the end of this quarter, it just kind of blew me away. I was using Salesforce1, which has almost, I think, 1 million users, active users on it now. And my IT department here at Salesforce has built new apps, which got automatically installed on my phone because I'm using Salesforce1. And I'm using this incredible sales forecasting app, where I'm just basically touching on the photographs of all of our sales leaders around the world kind of navigating through our pipelines and through our forecast. 
And it was amazing just to be able to run my business from my phone and have that kind of connectivity with my customers. And I think that today, more than ever, connecting with customers like that is absolutely essential because as a CEO, I can tell you, it puts you on the pulse of your business and what's really going on. 
Well, I think that, that was definitely evident for everyone who attended Dreamforce. And if you came to Dreamforce, you saw the biggest software conference ever. And you also saw not just a huge amount of customers, but we really rolled out incredible new innovations, which is enabling my own personal experience with Salesforce products. But for hundreds of thousands of Salesforce customers who are using these incredible new products like our new Lightning platform, which is amazing, you have the ability to build an application and run it on any device, on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC. It transcends operating systems. It transcends devices. 
And we as a result, our sales and service and our core community products in all of our core platforms on this amazing new Lightning platform. And when it shows up, it's done nothing like I've ever seen, which is -- gives you this incredible modern experience in a mobile environment. 
And then, of course, we also added SalesforceIQ to bring in machine intelligence to that. We introduced our IoT Cloud so we can bring in the Internet of Things, and then you can transform that Internet of Things into an Internet of Customers. Well, of course, we also have our Analytics Cloud, with our new Wave apps, and there's just so much more. 
And I'll tell you that walking around Dreamforce, I just -- I was just blown away also with our ecosystem and the hundreds and hundreds of companies, who have built on this platform and who have made so much happen. But I guess what I'm most proud of is that during Dreamforce, we also held the largest book drive ever, collecting over 1 million books for schools. We also raised over $10 million for UCSF Children's Hospital in San Francisco and Oakland. And I'll tell you that I want to thank all of our partners and our customers for helping us to achieve those numbers there. Just really awesome.
Well, I'll tell you, it's been an exciting few months here at Salesforce, and I would say that nothing is more indicative of how Salesforce is delivering customer success and how this Lightning platform is being adopted. 
In the third quarter, we delivered more than 259 billion transactions, which is up 63% from a year ago. That's 4.1 transactions every single business day. No other customer platform comes close to that level of usage. And while our transactions continue to skyrocket and our customer success continues to skyrocket, we committed also to reducing our carbon footprint, and the environment is a key stakeholder for us. And we continue to show how the multi-tenant cloud platform is 98% more efficient than on-premise software. And we're helping our customers avoid the emitting more than 1 million tons of carbon each year through our unique architecture of cloud computing.
But we have to do more, and we've made significant commitments to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. And over the next several weeks, in Paris, at the COP 21 Conference, we'll be making more announcements on how Salesforce is focused on the environment.
Well, as you're about to hear now from Keith, we're working with some of these great customers to deliver fantastic results, to accelerate the digital transformations. And I guess, there was no more stronger evidence point in the analyst community than Gartner's 2016 CIO Agenda, which I'm sure a lot of you follow as I do. 
And they found that Salesforce is rated as the #1 accelerator by the majority of respondents and received the highest digital acceleration score. Out of 30 vendors, Salesforce was at the top. And just Gartner did an amazing job in the CIO agenda report, and if you haven't had a chance to look at that, I would. 
Well, anyway let's hear from Keith. He's had a huge day already in New York. He's still -- I can see him on the monitor here, so he's still there, which is good. And Keith, tell us how did New York go today?"

I don't know a company today that isn't reviewing how to transform their customer experience and how to not get a -- I guess, a lot of them say, they don't want to get uberized out of the world.

I appreciate it and it's great to be here. And obviously, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter, and one that I would characterize -- I think we all would charact",1687,"All right. So thanks, Marc. I appreciate it and it's great to be here. And obviously, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter, and one that I would characterize -- I think we all would characterize as one of the most memorable, exciting quarters that we've had here at Salesforce. 
And we heard it today and we continue to hear it. The message from our customers is very clear. And while many of our competitors are struggling quite frankly to catch up to the cloud, Salesforce is taking customers and partners forward into this age of the customer, and we are squarely in this age of the customer. 
Marc and I just talked about this, but I had the opportunity to kick off our Salesforce World Tour here in New York. Again, over 8,000 people registered for this event, and people wanted to hear, both customers and prospects, about companies like American Express and Mattel and Western Union and an awful lot of customers through a variety of industries about how they are reinventing their futures and leveraging Salesforce. 
And as I speak to the top customers around the world, and Marc is exactly right, many of them are CEOs, which is terrific. There is a constant theme that keeps coming through here, and that is that we are clearly in this age of the customer and the time of cutting your way to prosperity is over. 
And when you think about it, the agenda for every CEO in the world is growth. And the reason why CEOs are coming to us is because they see Salesforce as that catalyst for growth. And we are also, quite frankly, catalysts for customer success. 
So whether it's a company of all shapes and sizes, whether the business model is B2B or B2C, large company or small company, regardless of the industry, these CEOs are really looking at us now to be their trusted adviser and really help them define their new customer strategies, their digital strategies, their engagement models and really new ways to transform into customer companies, and that's just becomes super, super important to them. 
And all of this has translated into some of the most exciting deals that we've done in our industry. We had another huge quarter of fantastic wins. In fact, the total number of our large transactions in Q3 was up significantly compared to last year in terms of value. Our relationships are becoming bigger. They're becoming broader. They're becoming more strategic and deeper. And we are now working with some of the world's greatest brands, and this is a far different roster of companies that we have historically worked with. 
A big part of that success, quite frankly, has been our industry strategy. And we've talk about this on many calls, but this is about our ability to speak the language of customers and to understand their business problems and drive a level of innovation and a point of view, and it's become a regular part of how we engage with customers of all sizes, from the smallest to the largest of enterprises. And it's really proving out in our results. 
And I'll give you a few examples. Certainly, there's a company that we've all heard of called General Motors. They have 125 million cars on the road. They have a significant vision for the connected vehicle. And in Q3, they selected Salesforce to connect drivers, the cars, merchants and retailers to bring a connected vision, a great experience to life. 
And with a push of a button, drivers are going to be able to instantly connect with the OnStar adviser and retailers and merchants. And it doesn't matter where they are, and they're going to get real-time information. And this is an example of a company, GM, that is really embracing the opportunity around the Internet of Things, and we are really excited about working with them. 
We are entering the holiday season as we all know. We're seeing a lot of traction in retail, and I'm thrilled that we closed the largest Marketing Cloud deal in the company's history with a very large retailer in Q3. They are taking things to the next level by personalizing the software experience across every single channel. We're going to be at the core of their omnichannel consumer engagement strategy, and they will be able to create a very personalized and predicted one-to-one relationship with customers at every single touch point, which is really compelling. And they're also going to be able to anticipate what the next step is and what the next action is and what customers might need and relevant suggestions at exactly the right moment. So we're very excited about that new partnership. 
Another great win was with AECOM. If you're familiar with AECOM, they design and build and finance and operate some of the largest and most iconic infrastructure projects around the globe, including here in New York, the World Trade Center and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Stadium, which we're very excited about, and so are they. They have nearly 100,000 employees in more than 150 companies -- excuse me, countries, and we are all thrilled that AECOM has decided to move their entire company to our platform. 
In financial services, which is certainly a key focus area for us, we have expanded our relationship with American Express, one of the great brands in the industry, a company that has been delivering world-class service for more than 160 years. In the quarter, American Express selected Salesforce to bring their sales and marketing and product teams altogether to collaborate and to coordinate so they can further transform their customer experiences for their business payments. Super excited about that new relationship. 
And what's interesting about that deal is that Amex and so many others continue to use our Ignite process to really reconceptualize their futures and this is a very unique solution selling approach that is all about the art of the possible. We have increased our Ignite to tenfold in the past few years. It is the standard part of our selling motion. It is one of the best investments, quite frankly, that we have made, and it's having a significant impact with our customers. 
In fact, one of the leading high-tech manufacturing companies in the world also engaged with us in the quarter and in Ignite, and that resulted in a significant 8-figure deal, which we're very, very excited about. 
And right before Dreamforce, I think as we all know, we introduced our first vertical-specific product line with Health Cloud and the Financial Services Cloud. We're very excited about the growth opportunity for these clouds. The interest has been very strong. We're excited about their future, and these products are really translating our incredible core technology into the language of the customer, which is part of our industry strategy, and we are cultivating an excellent ecosystem of partners for all of these solutions. So we're excited about that as well. 
International continues to be a cornerstone of our growth strategy. And in the quarter, we expanded our relationship with a company called AB InBev. They've been in the press a lot recently. They're one of the world's top 5 consumer product companies. They've standardized their collaboration with us globally. 
And that's after a successful relationship and start in Europe and now they're going to reinforce their consumer-centric digital approach and innovation efforts leveraging our products as well, so we're excited about that. And AB InBev joined ABB and Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline, Telefónica, Virgin Media and so many great leading companies in Europe, again, who selected Salesforce in Q3. 
In Asia Pac, we continue with our strength. We closed deals with Australia Post and Singtel, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Toyota and the list goes on there. So I really couldn't be thrilled -- more thrilled about the success we're seeing internationally. We have been continuing to invest in our selling capacity, our service capacity, our data centers, our offices, our partners, all to drive growth and to make our customers successful. 
Another area where we continue to make progress, quite frankly, is with our partners in our ecosystem, and I'm very proud of the results we're seeing with regional and global systems integrators, our partner certifications in the quarter. They were up more than 40% from a year ago, which is outstanding. And with all of our global SIs growing at an even faster rate, this is a great indicator that the most important consulting partners and firms in the world are betting their business and their customer's business on Salesforce. 
So we have firms like Accenture and Deloitte, PwC and Capgemini. They're all increasing their Salesforce practices. They are walking arm in arm into the C-suite with Salesforce. And in addition, our App Cloud continues to be the platform of choice for innovation by our ISVs. And a great example of where our industry strategy works hand in glove ecosystem strategy, a firm named Accenture, we're all familiar with, selected Salesforce as a partner to transform the front office of consumer goods companies around the world. So they will be bringing their Accenture CAS solution onto the Salesforce AppExchange, which is a great endorsement of our platform and critical to our joint industry strategy. 
So in closing, I want to say thank you to all of our customers and thank you to all of our partners for their trust in us and their confidence in us. And I'd also like to thank our incredible employees for their outstanding execution in the quarter and this unrelentless dedication to customer success. And right now, we are firing on all cylinders with our investments in the industries, our partner ecosystem, our international region, all paying off, and we have excellent momentum coming out of Dreamforce. 
And really, Marc, based on what I saw in New York this morning, we are very well-positioned for a very strong finish to the FY '16, and we're looking forward to a historic close this year. So [indiscernible]"

And Keith, I'll tell you, I watched the Sales Cloud Keynote after your Keynote today, and Accenture was the speaker with Sarah Varney during the Sales Cloud Keynote. And what was really interesting, they talked about how not only are they doing this incredible partnership, building products on our platform to sell to their customers, but that they have rolled out 25,000 users internally, and their speaker today in New York on the video I watched talked about how -- what he learned working with Salesforce is that the key to success is to be bold and go fast and just go do whatever you can and it just goes much, much faster than any other platform he had ever worked with.

And because of that, they want to partner with a company like Salesforce, who understands growth, understands transformation. So it's a very good linkage between the 2 firms. And that's what we're seeing in the marketplace, and that's why Accenture was happy to establish that partnership in the consumer packaged goods space.

Thank you, Marc. We delivered another great quarter with consistent execution and balanced growth across all of our products and geographies, and our results this quarter set us up for a strong finish in FY '16 as discussed and another solid year in FY '17. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.71 billion, up 24% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continue to impact revenue, with a year-over-year headwind of $40 million and a sequential headwind of $6 million. 
We continue to see strong year-over-year constant currency growth in all of our geographies, with the Americas growing 27%, EMEA growing 28% and Asia Pac growing 25%. Each of our clouds delivered outstanding year-over-year growth on a dollar basis with Sales Cloud growing 10%, Service Cloud growing 38%, App Cloud and other growing 40% and Marketing Cloud growing 29%. 
Dollar attrition for the third quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%. From a bottom line perspective, we delivered another quarter of improving profitability. In fact, we have now increased our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 221 basis points over Q3 of last year.
Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.21. Non-GAAP EPS includes approximately $0.01 from our lower-than-anticipated non-GAAP tax rate, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Our great top line and bottom line performance in Q3 drove another solid quarter of cash generation, with operating cash flow of $118 million. This was slightly down year-over-year about 4%, while operating cash flow year-to-date was up 37% compared to the same period over last year. And that's now up to $1.2 billion year-to-date, which is very exciting. 
Marc, it took us 15 years to get to $1 billion in cash flow, and we did it in the first 2 quarters and now we're topping it. we're really excited about that. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating cash flow in the growth of 24% to 25%, consistent with our prior guidance and our revenue growth operating margin framework. 
Third quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $38 million, down 23% over last year. Again, year-to-date free cash flow was $937 million, up 47% over the first 9 months of the last year.
Looking at deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 28% year-over-year.  Excluding an FX headwind of $41 million, deferred revenue grew 30% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of $7 million. In the quarter, 79% of the value of all subscription- and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms compared to 73% in Q3 of last year. This was a bit higher than anticipated and translated into approximately 2 percentage points of deferred revenue growth in the quarter.
Moving on to guidance. With our great performance in the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $25 million. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.64 billion to $6.65 billion or 24% growth year-over-year. 
Our guidance continues to include an FX headwind of approximately $175 million. We are also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.74 to $0.75 or $0.03 at the high end of the range, which is approximately $0.02 as a result of our outperformance and about $0.01 as a result of our lower full year non-GAAP tax rate. 
Now, let me take a minute to discuss our non-GAAP tax rate. We are adjusting our projected full year non-GAAP tax rate to 35.5% in light of a recent Altera tax opinion. You may recall that we began to compute and used a fixed long-term non-GAAP tax rate during FY '15. And as we said, we would reevaluate this rate annually and/or if a situation arises where we need to reevaluate that, and that is exactly the case as it relates to Altera, and that's just the situation where we needed to true that up. And we'll continue to reevaluate that and give you updates as we need to.
For Q4, our full year guidance implies revenue growth of approximately $1.782 billion to $1.792 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and a billed deferred revenue growth of approximately 23% to 24%. And as you heard from Marc, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal revenue guidance of approximately $8 billion to $8.1 billion for a year-over-year growth of 20% to 22%. In fact, FY '17 feels very similar to last year as we continue to deliver strong growth at scale, and we will provide additional details about our outlook for FY '17 on our fourth quarter call in February.
To close, we had a strong third quarter and we are well-positioned for a great finish to FY '16 and to deliver another solid year in FY '17. Thanks to all of our employees for continuing to deliver these outstanding results. So with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

I have a question on Service Cloud because obviously, the revenue there, which is obviously lagging a bit, continues to grow just phenomenally and no sort of sign of deceleration there. If it continues at this pace, you could almost see within a couple of years Service Cloud overtaking Sales Cloud. So the question is what are the net dynamics that are going on there? How would you compare them to the Sales Cloud when it was at sort of this point of its life cycle? And then are you displacing more legacy vendors? Is this net new? Is it replacing custom-developed software? How should we think about Service Cloud?"

Sales, Service, Marketing, Analytics, these are all multibillion-dollar markets. We actually call them internally swimmers, and we call them swimmers in their lanes. And we look at these products each going down their own lane. And yes, you're right, Service is performing incredibly well. But so is Sales, so is Analytics, so is Community, so is our platform, so is Marketing. We have many, many, many high-performing swimmers. Then we don't just look at it that way, by the way. We not only see that. We see it by geography, which -- and we also look at it in verticals. And in each of the strategic areas that we've made these big bets, we continue to see very high performance. And in customer service and support, if you've read Gartner's most recent customer engagement Magic Quadrant, you'll see Salesforce is #1. We've displaced Oracle. We've displaced SAP. These were traditionally the leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. And so we're not only now the #1 in the Magic Quadrant on sales, which we have been for a few years, but now we're #1 in the Magic Quadrant for service, which means we actually have the best product possible. Our customers just have phenomenal success. We have great examples of customers, who have tens of thousands of users deployed on this product. We have examples of customers, who have tens of customers, tens of users, hundreds of users. But what's unusual about our Service Cloud is you could be a very small company or you could be a massive company and you can use our Service Cloud. And when you look at the requirements for customers to provide extended customer service, especially in regards to areas like the Internet of Things, when our customers core like Cisco or Philips or even Coca-Cola are more connected to their customers than ever before, the first point of access with those customers is customer service. So they better have their customer service act together if they're going to drive the customer revolution. So of course, we continue to do well in all of our core products, but also customer service is a critical part of our portfolio. Keith, do you want to add anything to that?"

So there is no doubt we are at a tipping point in cloud platforms. And companies who have been cloud deniers like SAP and Oracle are paying a horrible price in single digit and negative growth because companies are not buying their products because they're not modern and they're not built in this kind of modern architecture. When you look at the cloud opportunities, there's different opportunities. And one opportunity is at the applications layer, where we dominate in sales and service, in marketing, where we have these multi -- multiple billion dollar clouds all kind of underway, which I just talked about in the last question. At the next layer down, which is declared as programmatic application development deployment, especially in rapid application development and deployment, this is an area where we also have incredible success. Gartner calls this aPaas, Application Platform as a Service. You look at our product like our App Cloud, Salesforce1, Lightning, Heroku, this is an area that's very strategic to us because our core applications are built with our platform, which gives our customers basically the plasticity necessary to kind of take our applications apart and putting them back together. This is an area that's very important to us. The next layer down is the kind of what we kind of traditionally call Infrastructure as a Service. Amazon Web Services, which we are a huge customer of Amazon Web Services. Amazon is also a huge customer of Salesforce, and we use Amazon Web Services to build our products. For example, Heroku is one of the most successful platforms on the Amazon Web Services and has been an incredible success for salesforce.com, and also demonstrates the power of Amazon's platform. Salesforce also has been working with Microsoft on how we're going to be using Azure as part of our product line as well. We're very excited about Microsoft. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We've talked about that, and I think Azure is terrific. And Google, by the way, who's a huge customer of Salesforce, we use Google's platform very extensively at Salesforce as well. And I'll tell you something that it's critical for the operations of our company and Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud platforms. We're a very modern company in how we deployed IT internally that's given us the flexibility to grow. We tutor and mentor other CIOs and industry leaders and show them what we've done to build a modern company using this highly flexible IT infrastructure. But it's because we're doing all 3 of these layers: one, very flexible dynamic, highly innovative, 3 releases a year, applications at the top; in the middle, rapid application development and deployment of apps, like I was talking about new apps appearing on my phone instantly from my IT department in the -- in that aPaas area. And also in Infrastructure as a Service where we partner with Amazon, we partner with Microsoft and we partner with Google. Those are our 3 core strategic partners in Infrastructure as a Service. And that's the modern IT infrastructure. And today -- and, of course, what do we all run it on? We don't run it on our laptops, but we run it on our phones. And that's the power of the modern age. And this gives you the level of speed in IT. It gives you much lower total cost of ownership, and it gives you a rate of innovation because you're not waiting 3 or 4 years for a new release. You're waiting 3 or 4 months, sometimes 3 or 4 days before you're getting incredible new features and functionality. And so yes, we're at a tipping point. You could see that in the results of Amazon. You can see it in the results of Microsoft. You can see it in the results of Google, and you can see it in the results of Salesforce. And for companies who have denied that this shift is happening, for companies who have told customers to be afraid of this shift and for companies who have tried to stop this shift, look at where they are today. It's quite a good example of Clayton Christensen's theories regarding the innovator's dilemma."

Happy to fill that question. Look, across the board, I mean, if you look at the wins in this quarter, we had some terrific experiences with financial services, obviously, with American Express; in automotive, with General Motors; in consumer packaged goods, with AB InBev and Mattel. So financial services is very strong. Health care and life sciences is very strong. Retail is really picking up. CPG is really picking up. Manufacturing has always been a strength of the company, but we continue to do very, very well. I alluded to that deal that we closed earlier. So it really has become a situation where no surprise, customers want to speak to us, and we should be speaking to them in their language. And that is the whole idea behind the industry strategy, and it starts with that. It starts with the messaging and the creation of the solution. It also moves into making sure they're organized carefully, and we've done that very carefully over the last 2.5 years in physical organizations that's focused on vertical markets. And then the third is to start delivering products, which we announced again just before Dreamforce around Health Cloud and Financial Services Cloud. So it's really a 3-pronged industry strategy, and it is resonating with our customers. They want more of it. They certainly don't want less of it. And we already have a very compelling and differentiated solution, but when you also add this sort of layer on it with the industry messaging and going to market by industry and also adding to this product set, it becomes super compelling and customers really, really like what we're doing."

Obviously, service and sales, as big as they are, they're not going to continue to grow as rapidly. So are we going to see other engines come to the forefront to help you increase your business by 50% be it analytics or platform or verticals? And one for you, Mark Hawkins, is the renewal business becomes larger and larger. What kind of impact does it have on our margins?"

And when you look at the great success of a lot of these core products, we want to continue to fuel them. Certainly, Service Cloud is amazing. Marketing Cloud, obviously, is also amazing. And Sales Cloud, of course, has achieved a level of revenue that we never could have anticipated and it continues to grow. And we have other, as I said, kind of swimmers in their lanes doing be very, very well. Now, in addition to those core products, especially with the tip to Marketing Cloud and its outstanding performance, especially since we acquired ExactTarget and integrated that very deeply into the company, I think also, you have to look at what Keith has done with public sector, which is very exciting for us. It is a huge opportunity for our company. And of course, the verticals where we're continuing to build some new products, including our wealth management product that we've announced in our health product and other applications, categories that we see. And that I will also have to say ISVs. So ISVs remain a really powerful growth channel as well. So if we have any problem with Salesforce, it's that we have a huge amount to invest next year, but we can't just peanut butter and give everybody something. We have to make some bets and to invest in some of these winners that I'm talking about because we have had some phenomenal results as well."

You've tracked the company for a long, long time, and you've watched that come down now into the approximately 9% range and that really helps us. And so as we think about margins going forward as it relates to renewals, one of the things I just would almost level it up and say, all of our unit economics suggest that we can hit the mid-30s in terms of our operating margin over the long term at mature revenue growth rates. And part of that is because we're taking good care of the customer, part of that is because we keep the attrition rate low and part of that is we continue to get scale with the unit economics that we can see today. So Kash, I think the long and short of it is as that renewal business continues to grow, our #1 priority is to take care of the customer and #2 is we will fulfill the operating margin in the mid-30s long, long term."

Aneel Bhusri recently said that if the first 10 years was about cloud, the next 10 years is going to be about data and analytics. And he commented that there won't be any difference between the transaction systems and the analytical systems. So I was wondering first off, Marc, what do you think of that statement? And how far do you want to push the boundaries of data science at Salesforce? In other words, do you think you would have more of a focus on analytics to support Sales, Service and Marketing? Or are you thinking of very broadly pushing into machine learning, predictive behavioral unstructured data, massive data volumes for Internet of Things and really becoming a hub for essentially any kind of data?"

I don't think it's the age of data science or the age of machine intelligence or the age of cognitive or the age of mobility or the age of social or the age of cloud or whatever, okay? Because all of those things are going to be important in the next 10 years. All of those things, the cloud, social, mobile, data science, deep learning, NLP, machine intelligence on that, those are table stakes. Those are table stakes. What are you going to do with that technology? Who's not using those technologies? Philips is using that technology. GE is using that technology. Apple is using that technology. Cisco is using that technology. Coca-Cola, Unilever, they're all using it. Look, it's the next 10 years for these companies, it's going to be about customer. What are they doing to build a world-class customer experience? How do they transform from being product companies to customer experience companies? And as millennials takeover in these enterprises, they are going to be much more focused on experiences. And that is going to be the transformational lever for growth with these companies. And I think that if we get to -- into any one particular technology or if I was to all of a sudden wave the flag like I used to do 15 or 16 years ago for Cloud, okay, that would be a huge mistake for our company because the #1 thing, most important thing for this company, is the customer. So there was a really good discussion between Ginni Rometty, the CEO of IBM; and John Stumpf, who is the CEO of Wells Fargo Bank at a conference that I was just at put on by Fortune Magazine here in San Francisco, and I'm sure that the transcript is available online. But you'll see that when she is discussing her strategy, it's to become the cognitive company. And when he is discussing his strategy, it's to become the customer company. And I think that we do have to decide what kind of companies are we going to be. I'm going with customer company. I want to be a customer company like John Stumpf does. He is all about the customer, maintaining integrity and the fidelity of the customer relationship, and I want to help him do that. And yes, will cognitive help them do that? Yes. Will Cloud help them do that? Yes. [indiscernible] Is mobile? Yes. Social? Yes. IoT? Yes, all of these things. But let's keep our eye on the ball, which there is a transformational force that is wasting it's way through all of these companies, and every company is afraid that they're going to be uberized out of the world. And they see it happening, and it could be financial services, it could be IBM, okay? Every company is worried about -- look at the decline of IBM over the last decade. Technology is shaking every company at its roots. So that's why the companies who will be the most successful are the ones who are most connected to the customers because the customers are the ones who guide us into the future. They are the ones with a true vision of where we have to go. So I'm going with customer on this one."

Let's just talk about the second question first, and then we'll go back to the renewals. I'd say the first thing is that we are pleased that we have been on a path to just increase our invoices to annual from FY '12. We've been on a steady path of continuous improvement and we reported out when we make progress. And last quarter, we continue to make progress as you noted, Karl, year-on-year, we went from 74% of our invoices being annual to 79%. And so that is just good progress, good execution. We're pleased to see it. It works well for lots and lots of different reasons. And that added and as I called out about roughly 2 points of growth to the deferred revenue year-on-year. But I think we have continued runway on this in the sense that the more enterprise business we get, the more natural it is for people to go to the annual terms that we're looking for, so I wouldn't expect any short terms, Karl. I think about this as a steady progression with yes, more runway in the future. Keith thinks about it as moderate, and that's what we're intending and I think it's just good execution, that's number one. Number two, in terms of renewals and one of the things, for everybody on the call, just as a reminder, we just talked about the quantum of our renewals. If you think about when they show up and Q4 is when they show up the most when you think about the kind of the historical patterns of our business and in fact, that is what we expect, and that's all comprehended in our guidance, which we feel really good about both for Q4, the strong finish and also as we point into next year. Obviously, hitting something worth $8 billion to $8.1 billion on top line revenue, we feel really good about for the company to continue to grow and execute at this scale. So those are my answers in both points, Karl."

Now you can see from these results, we are o",1523,"Fantastic. All right, well, Mark Hawkins is also with us, our Chief Financial Officer, and the 3 of us are really thrilled to be with you today to talk about another outstanding growth quarter for Salesforce. 
Now you can see from these results, we are on pace to deliver well over $6 billion -- $6.6 billion this year, which is faster than any other enterprise software company in history. And I am thrilled to share with you that we are expecting to deliver more than $8 billion in revenue or $8.1 billion revenue at the high end of our range for next year. So that is amazing, and we could not be more excited about the results of the third quarter. We could not be more excited about coming into the fourth quarter, and we could not be more excited about the potential for next year. 
And you can see that we have something in sight, which we have been talking about now for several years, which is our $10 billion year. And of course, Salesforce, as you can see, will be the fourth largest software company in the world next year. But you can see that we will be one of the only software companies ever to reach $10 billion in revenue. And as we become #4, we have #3 in our sights, and we certainly [indiscernible] that goal as well quite wholeheartedly. 
Now as many of you are predicting, Salesforce will be indeed the fourth largest enterprise software company in the world next year, behind only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. And we are really making a difference for our customers in the industry and it's a tribute to our employees. Almost 20,000 of these employees who are singularly focused on one thing, our customer's success. 
I'd like to kind of give you some specifics on the results for the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter rose to more than $1.7 billion, which was up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. That is absolutely, I think, the best performance that I've seen in the top 10 enterprise software companies, and Salesforce continues to be the fastest-growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies. And we are really excited with our -- that 27% number. Deferred revenue grew to more than $2.8 billion or up 30% in constant currency from a year ago, pretty incredible at our size and scale to see that achievement, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $9.5 billion. 
So that, again, is setting us up very well for next year and the future. As we deliver on this outstanding top line growth, we also delivered 221 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. And as you know, while we are absolutely committed to be the fastest-growing enterprise software company in delivering these phenomenal top line numbers, we are also deeply committed to continuing to increase our profitability, and the results this year are evidence of that. 
So let's be clear, Salesforce is the only software company selling billions of dollars of CRM, and we are at the center of what every company is going through. It's digital transformation. It's what every company wants to be in the 21st century.
So now during the quarter, I want to tell you, I met with hundreds of CEOs around the world. And I'll tell you, when meeting with CEOs, they are not that interested in talking about, honestly, about the cloud or about social or mobile. They want to talk about their customers and they want to talk about their top line. They want to talk about how they're going to grow that top line. And this is a really, really exciting thing that's going on, which is this customer revolution. 
We're really talking about connecting with -- talking about -- talking with our customers about how to connect with their customers in a whole new way, accelerate their growth, creating these one-to-one customer journeys, running their businesses from their phone and making smarter more predictive decisions. 
And I'll tell you one of those customers is us. And at the end of this quarter, it just kind of blew me away. I was using Salesforce1, which has almost, I think, 1 million users, active users on it now. And my IT department here at Salesforce had built new apps, which got automatically installed on my phone because I'm using Salesforce1. And I'm using this incredible sales forecasting app, where I'm just basically touching on the photographs of all of our sales leaders around the world kind of navigating through our pipelines and through our forecast. 
And it was amazing just to be able to run my business from my phone and have that kind of connectivity with my customers. And I think that today, more than ever, connecting with customers like that is absolutely essential because as a CEO, I can tell you, it puts you on the pulse of your business and what's really going on. 
Well, I think that, that was definitely evident for everyone who attended Dreamforce. And if you came to Dreamforce, you saw the biggest software conference ever. And you also saw not just a huge amount of customers, but we really rolled out incredible new innovations, which is enabling my own personal experience with Salesforce products. But for our hundreds of thousands of Salesforce customers who are using these incredible new products like our new Lightning platform, which is amazing, you have the ability to build an application and run it on any device, on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC. It transcends operating systems. It transcends devices. 
And we as a result, our sales and service and our core community products and all of our core platforms on this amazing new Lightning platform. And when it shows up, it's done nothing like I've ever seen, which is -- gives you this incredible modern experience in a mobile environment. 
And then, of course, we also added SalesforceIQ to bring in machine intelligence to that. We introduced our IoT Cloud so we can bring it into the Internet of Things, and then you can transform that Internet of Things into an Internet of Customers. Well, of course, we also have our Analytics Cloud, with our new Wave apps, and there's just so much more. 
And I'll tell you that walking around Dreamforce, I just -- I was just blown away also with our ecosystem and the hundreds and hundreds of companies, who have built on this platform and who have made so much happen. But I guess what I'm most proud of is that during Dreamforce, we also held the largest book drive ever, collecting over 1 million books for schools. We also raised over $10 million for UCSF Children's Hospital in San Francisco and Oakland. And I'll tell you that I want to thank all of our partners and our customers for helping us to achieve those numbers there. Just really awesome.
Well, I'll tell you, it's been an exciting few months here at Salesforce, and I would say that nothing is more indicative of how Salesforce is delivering customer success than how this Lightning platform is being adopted. 
In the third quarter, we delivered more than 259 billion transactions, which was up 63% from a year ago. That's 4.1 [ph] transactions every single business day. No other customer platform comes close to that level of usage. And while our transactions continue to skyrocket and our customer success continues to skyrocket, we committed also to reducing our carbon footprint, and the environment is a key stakeholder for us. And we continue to show how the multi-tenant cloud platform is 98% more efficient than on-premise software. And we're helping our customers avoid emitting more than 1 million tons of carbon each year through our unique architecture of cloud computing.
But we have to do more, and we've made significant commitments to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. And over the next several weeks, in Paris, at the COP 21 Conference, we'll be making more announcements on how Salesforce is focused on the environment.
Well, as you're about to hear now from Keith, we're working with some of these great customers to deliver fantastic results, to accelerate their digital transformations. And I guess, there was no more stronger evidence point in the analyst community than Gartner's 2016 CIO Agenda, which I'm sure a lot of you follow as I do. 
And they found that Salesforce is rated as the #1 accelerator by the majority of respondents and received the highest digital acceleration score. Out of 30 vendors, Salesforce was at the top. And just Gartner did an amazing job on the CIO agenda report, and if you haven't had a chance to look at that, I would. 
Well, anyway let's hear from Keith. He's had a huge day already in New York. He's still -- I can see him on the monitor here, so he's still there, which is good. And Keith, tell us how did New York go today?"

And everyone wants to talk about how to transform the customer experience. 
I don't know a company today that isn't reviewing how to transform their customer experience and how to not get a -- I guess, a lot of them say, they don't want to get uberized out of the world. But some of them I think -- I don't want to get Postmated out of the world because I just ordered my lunch on Postmates here in San Francisco.

I appreciate it and it's great to be here. And obviously, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter, and one that I would characterize -- I think we all would charact",1691,"All right. So thanks, Marc. I appreciate it and it's great to be here. And obviously, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter, and one that I would characterize -- I think we all would characterize as one of the most memorable and exciting quarters that we've had here at Salesforce. 
And we heard it today and we continue to hear it. The message from our customers is very clear. And while many of our competitors are struggling, quite frankly, to catch up to the cloud, Salesforce is taking customers and partners forward into this age of the customer, and we are squarely in this age of the customer. 
Marc and I just talked about this, but I had the opportunity to kick off our Salesforce World Tour here in New York. Again, over 8,000 people registered for this event, and people wanted to hear, both customers and prospects, about companies like American Express and Mattel and Western Union and an awful lot of customers through a variety of industries about how they are reinventing their futures and leveraging Salesforce. 
And as I speak to the top customers around the world, and Marc is exactly right, many of them are CEOs, which is terrific. There is a constant theme that keeps coming through here, and that is that we are clearly in this age of the customer and the time of cutting your way to prosperity is over. 
And when you think about it, the agenda for every CEO in the world is growth. And the reason why CEOs are coming to us is because they see Salesforce as that catalyst for growth. And we are also, quite frankly, a catalyst for customer success. 
So whether it's a company of all shapes and sizes, whether the business model is B2B or B2C, large company or small company, regardless of the industry, these CEOs are really looking at us now to be their trusted adviser and really help them define their new customer strategies, their digital strategies, their engagement models and really new ways to transform into customer companies, and that's just become super, super important to them. 
And all of this has translated into some of the most exciting deals that we've done in our industry. We had another huge quarter of fantastic wins. In fact, the total number of our large transactions in Q3 was up significantly compared to last year in terms of value. Our relationships are becoming bigger. They're becoming broader. They're becoming more strategic and deeper. And we are now working with some of the world's greatest brands, and this is a far different roster of companies that we have historically worked with. 
A big part of that success, quite frankly, has been our industry strategy. And we've talked about this on many calls, but this is about our ability to speak the language of customers and to understand their business problems and drive a level of innovation and a point of view, and it's become a regular part of how we engage with customers of all sizes, from the smallest to the largest of enterprises. And it's really proving out in our results. 
And I'll give you a few examples. Certainly, there's a company that we've all heard of called General Motors. They have 125 million cars on the road. They have a significant vision for the connected vehicle. And in Q3, they selected Salesforce to connect drivers, the cars, merchants and retailers to bring a connected vision, a great experience to life. 
And with a push of a button, drivers are going to be able to instantly connect with the OnStar adviser and retailers and merchants. And it doesn't matter where they are, and they're going to get real-time information. And this is an example of a company, GM, that is really embracing the opportunity around the Internet of Things, and we are really excited about working with them. 
We are entering the holiday season as we all know. We're seeing a lot of traction in retail, and I'm thrilled that we closed the largest Marketing Cloud deal in the company's history with a very large retailer in Q3. They are taking things to the next level by personalizing the software experience across every single channel. We're going to be at the core of their omnichannel consumer engagement strategy, and they will be able to create a very personalized and predicted one-to-one relationship with customers at every single touch point, which is really compelling. And they're also going to be able to anticipate what the next step is and what the next action is and what customers might need and relevant suggestions at exactly the right moment. So we're very excited about that new partnership. 
Another great win was with AECOM. If you're familiar with AECOM, they design and build and finance and operate some of the largest and most iconic infrastructure projects around the globe, including here in New York, the World Trade Center and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Stadium, which we're very excited about, as are they. They have nearly 100,000 employees in more than 150 companies -- excuse me, countries, and we are all thrilled that AECOM has decided to move their entire company to our platform. 
In financial services, which is certainly a key focus area for us, we have expanded our relationship with American Express, one of the great brands in the industry, a company that has been delivering world-class service for more than 160 years. In the quarter, American Express selected Salesforce to bring their sales and marketing and product teams altogether to collaborate and to coordinate so that they can further transform their customer experiences for their business payments. Super excited about that new relationship. 
And what's interesting about that deal is that Amex and so many others continue to use our Ignite process to really reconceptualize their futures and this is a very unique solution selling approach that is all about the art of the possible. We have increased our Ignite tenfold in the past few years. It is the standard part of our selling motion. It is one of the best investments, quite frankly, that we have made, and it's having a significant impact with our customers. 
In fact, one of the leading high-tech manufacturing companies in the world also engaged with us in the quarter and in Ignite, and that resulted in a significant 8-figure deal, which we're very, very excited about. 
And right before Dreamforce, I think as we all know, we introduced our first vertical-specific product line with Health Cloud and the Financial Services Cloud. We're very excited about the growth opportunity for these clouds. The interest has been very strong. We're excited about their future, and these products are really translating our incredible core technology into the language of the customer, which is part of our industry strategy, and we are cultivating an excellent ecosystem of partners for all of these solutions. So we're excited about that as well. 
International continues to be a cornerstone of our growth strategy. And in the quarter, we expanded our relationship with a company called AB InBev. They've been in the press a lot recently. They're one of the world's top 5 consumer product companies. They've standardized their collaboration with us globally. 
And that's after a successful relationship and start in Europe and now they're going to reinforce their consumer-centric digital approach and innovation efforts leveraging our products as well, so we're excited about that. And AB InBev joined ABB and Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline, Telefónica, Virgin Media and so many great leading companies in Europe, again, who selected Salesforce in Q3. 
In Asia Pac, we continue with our strength. We closed deals with Australia Post and Singtel, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Toyota and the list goes on there. So I really couldn't be thrilled -- more thrilled about the success we're seeing internationally. We have been continuing to invest in our selling capacity, our service capacity, our data centers, our offices, our partners, all to drive growth and to make our customers successful. 
Another area where we continue to make progress, quite frankly, is with our partners and our ecosystem, and I'm very proud of the results we're seeing with regional and global systems integrators. Our partner certifications in the quarter, they were up more than 40% from a year ago, which is outstanding. And with all of our global SIs growing at an even faster rate, this is a great indicator that the most important consulting partners and firms in the world are betting their business and their customer's business on Salesforce. 
So we have firms like Accenture and Deloitte, PwC and Capgemini. They're all increasing their Salesforce practices. They are walking arm in arm into the C-suite with Salesforce. And in addition, our App Cloud continues to be the platform of choice for innovation by our ISVs. And a great example of where our industry strategy works hand in glove with our ecosystem strategy, a firm named Accenture, we're all familiar with, selected Salesforce as a partner to transform the front office of consumer goods companies around the world. So they will be bringing their Accenture CAS solution onto the Salesforce AppExchange, which is a great endorsement of our platform and critical to our joint industry strategy. 
So in closing, I want to say thank you to all of our customers and thank you to all of our partners for their trust in us and their confidence in us. And I'd also like to thank our incredible employees for their outstanding execution in the quarter and this unrelentless [ph] dedication to customer success. And right now, we are firing on all cylinders with our investments in the industries, our partner ecosystem, our international regions, all paying off, and we have excellent momentum coming out of Dreamforce. 
And really, Marc, based on what I saw in New York this morning, we are very well-positioned for a very strong finish to the FY '16, and we're looking forward to a historic close this year. So [indiscernible]"

And Keith, I'll tell you, I watched the Sales Cloud Keynote after your Keynote today, and Accenture was the speaker with Sarah Varney during the Sales Cloud Keynote. And what was really interesting, they talked about how not only are they doing this incredible partnership, building products on our platform to sell to their customers, but that they have rolled out 25,000 users internally, and their speaker today in New York on the video I watched talked about how what he learned working with Salesforce is that the key to success is to be bold and go fast and just go do whatever you can and it just goes much, much faster than any other platform he had ever worked with.

And so they appreciate the level of transformation. They know what their customers are looking for. And because of that, they want to partner with a company like Salesforce, who understands growth, understands transformation. So it's a very good linkage between the 2 firms.

Thank you, Marc. We delivered another great quarter with consistent execution and balanced growth across all of our products and geographies, and our results this quarter set us up for a strong finish in FY '16 as discussed and another solid year in FY '17. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.71 billion, up 24% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue, with a year-over-year headwind of $40 million and a sequential headwind of $6 million. 
We continue to see strong year-over-year constant currency growth in all of our geographies, with the Americas growing 27%, EMEA growing 28% and Asia Pac growing 25%. Each of our clouds delivered outstanding year-over-year growth on a dollar basis with Sales Cloud growing 10%, Service Cloud growing 38%, App Cloud and other growing 40% and Marketing Cloud growing 29%. 
Dollar attrition for the third quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud, was approximately 9%. From a bottom line perspective, we delivered another quarter of improving profitability. In fact, we have now increased our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 221 basis points over Q3 of last year.
Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.21. Non-GAAP EPS includes approximately $0.01 from our lower-than-anticipated non-GAAP tax rate, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Our great top line and bottom line performance in Q3 drove another solid quarter of cash generation, with operating cash flow of $118 million. This was slightly down year-over-year about 4%, while operating cash flow year-to-date was up 37% compared to the same period over last year. And that's now up to $1.2 billion year-to-date, which is very exciting. 
Marc, it took us 15 years to get to $1 billion in cash flow, and we did it in the first 2 quarters and now we're topping it. So we're really excited about that. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating cash flow in a growth of 24% to 25%, consistent with our prior guidance and our revenue growth operating margin framework. 
Third quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $38 million, down 23% over last year. Again, year-to-date free cash flow was $937 million, up 47% over the first 9 months of the last year.
Looking at deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 28% year-over-year.  Excluding an FX headwind of $41 million, deferred revenue grew 30% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of $7 million. In the quarter, 79% of the value of all subscription- and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms compared to 73% in Q3 of last year. This was a bit higher than anticipated and translated into approximately 2 percentage points of deferred revenue growth in the quarter.
Moving on to guidance. With our great performance in the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $25 million. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.64 billion to $6.65 billion for 24% growth year-over-year. 
The guidance continues to include an FX headwind of approximately $175 million. We are also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.74 to $0.75 or $0.03 at the high end of the range, which is approximately $0.02 as a result of our outperformance and about $0.01 as a result of our lower full year non-GAAP tax rate. 
Now, let me take a minute to discuss our non-GAAP tax rate. We are adjusting our projected full year non-GAAP tax rate to 35.5% in light of a recent Altera tax opinion. You may recall that we began to compute and used a fixed long-term non-GAAP tax rate during FY '15. And as we said, we would reevaluate this rate annually and/or as the situation arises where we need to reevaluate that, and that is exactly the case as it relates to Altera, and that's just the situation where we needed to true that up. So we'll continue to reevaluate that and give you updates as we need to.
For Q4, our full year guidance implies revenue growth of approximately $1.782 billion to $1.792 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and a billed deferred revenue growth of approximately 23% to 24%. And as you heard from Marc, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal revenue guidance of approximately $8 billion to $8.1 billion for a year-over-year growth of 20% to 22%. In fact, FY '17 feels very similar to last year as we continue to deliver strong growth at scale, and we will provide additional details about our outlook for FY '17 on our fourth quarter call in February.
To close, we had a strong third quarter and we are well-positioned for a great finish to FY '16 and to deliver another solid year in FY '17. Thanks to all of our employees for continuing to deliver these outstanding results. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

I have a question on Service Cloud because obviously, the revenue there, which is obviously lagging a bit, continues to grow just phenomenally and no sort of sign of deceleration there. If it continues at this pace, you could almost see within a couple of years Service Cloud overtaking Sales Cloud. So the question is what are the dynamics that are going on there? How would you compare them to the Sales Cloud when it was at sort of this point of its life cycle? And then are you displacing more legacy vendors? Is this net new? Is it replacing custom-developed software? How should we think about Service Cloud?"

Sales, Service, Marketing, Analytics, these are all multibillion-dollar markets. We actually call them internally swimmers, and we call them swimmers in their lanes. And we look at these products each going down their own lane. And yes, you're right, Service is performing incredibly well. But so is Sales, so is Analytics, so is Community, so is our platform, so is Marketing. We have many, many, many high-performing swimmers. Then we don't just look at it that way, by the way. We not only see that. We see it by geography, which -- and we also look at it in verticals. And in each of the strategic areas that we've made these big bets, we continue to see very high performance. And in customer service and support, if you've read Gartner's most recent customer engagement Magic Quadrant, you'll see Salesforce is #1. We've displaced Oracle. We've displaced SAP. These were traditionally the leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. And so we're not only now the #1 in the Magic Quadrant on sales, which we have been for a few years, but now we're #1 in the Magic Quadrant for service, which means we absolutely have the best product possible. Our customers just have phenomenal success. We have great examples of customers, who have tens of thousands of users deployed on this product. We have examples of customers, who have tens of customers, tens of users, hundreds of users. But what's unusual about our Service Cloud is you could be a very small company or you could be a massive company and you can use our Service Cloud. And when you look at the requirements for customers to provide extended customer service, especially in regards to areas like the Internet of Things, when our core customers like Cisco or Philips or even Coca-Cola are more connected to their customer than ever before, the first point of access with those customers is customer service. So they better have their customer service act together if they're going to drive the customer revolution. So of course, we continue to do well in all of our core products, but also customer service is a critical part of our portfolio. Keith, do you want to add anything to that?"

So there is no doubt we are at a tipping point in cloud platforms. And companies who have been cloud deniers like SAP and Oracle are paying a horrible price in single digit and negative growth because companies are not buying their products because they're not modern and they're not built in this kind of modern architecture. When you look at the cloud opportunities, there's different opportunities. And one opportunity is at the applications layer, where we dominate in sales and service, in marketing, where we have these multi -- multiple billion dollar clouds all kind of underway, which I just talked about in the last question. At the next layer down, which is declared as in programmatic application development and deployment, especially in rapid application development and deployment, this is an area where we also have incredible success. Gartner calls this aPaas, Application Platform as a Service. You look at our products like our App Cloud, Salesforce1, Lightning, Heroku, this is an area that's very strategic to us because our core applications are built with our platform, which gives our customers basically the plasticity necessary to kind of take our applications apart and putting them back together. This is an area that's very important to us. The next layer down is the kind of what we kind of traditionally call Infrastructure as a Service. Amazon Web Services, which we are a huge customer of Amazon Web Services. Amazon is also a huge customer of Salesforce, and we use Amazon Web Services to build our products. For example, Heroku is one of the most successful platforms on Amazon Web Services and has been an incredible success for salesforce.com, and also demonstrates the power of Amazon's platform. Salesforce also has been working with Microsoft on how we're going to be using Azure as part of our product line as well. We're very excited about Microsoft. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We've talked about that, and I think Azure is terrific. And Google, by the way, who's a huge customer of Salesforce, we use Google's platform very extensively at Salesforce as well. And I'll tell you something that it's critical for the operations of our company and Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud platforms. We're a very modern company in how we've deployed IT internally that's given us the flexibility to grow. We tutor and mentor other CIOs and industry leaders and show them what we've done to build a modern company using this highly flexible IT infrastructure. But it's because we're doing all 3 of these layers: one, very flexible dynamic, highly innovative, 3 releases a year, applications at the top; in the middle, rapid application development and deployment of apps, like I was talking about new apps appearing on my phone instantly from my IT department in the -- in that aPaas area. And also in Infrastructure as a Service where we partner with Amazon, we partner with Microsoft and we partner with Google. Those are our 3 core strategic partners in Infrastructure as a Service. And that's the modern IT infrastructure. And today -- and, of course, what do we all run it on? We don't run it on our laptops, but we run it on our phones. And that's the power of the modern age. And this gives you the level of speed in IT. It gives you much lower total cost of ownership, and it gives you a rate of innovation because you're not waiting 3 or 4 years for a new release. You're waiting 3 or 4 months, sometimes 3 or 4 days before you're getting incredible new features and functionality. And so yes, we're at a tipping point. You could see that in the results of Amazon. You can see it in the results of Microsoft. You can see it in the results of Google, and you can see it in the results of Salesforce. And for companies who have denied that this shift is happening, for companies who have told customers to be afraid of this shift and for companies who have tried to stop this shift, look at where they are today. It's quite a good example of Clayton Christensen's theories regarding the innovator's dilemma."

Happy to field that question. Look, across the board, I mean, if you look at the wins in this quarter, we had some terrific experiences with financial services, obviously, with American Express; in automotive, with General Motors; in consumer packaged goods, with AB InBev and Mattel. So financial services is very strong. Health care and life sciences is very strong. Retail is really picking up. CPG is really picking up. Manufacturing has always been a strength of the company, but we continue to do very, very well. I alluded to that deal that we closed earlier. So it really has become a situation where, and no surprise, customers want to speak to us, and we should be speaking to them in their language. And that is the whole idea behind the industry strategy, and it starts with that. It starts with the messaging and the creation of the solution. It also moves into making sure they're organized carefully, and we've done that very carefully over the last 2.5 years in physical organizations that focus on vertical markets. And then the third is to start delivering product, which we announced again just before Dreamforce around Health Cloud and Financial Services Cloud. So it's really a 3-pronged industry strategy, and it is resonating with our customers. They want more of it. They certainly don't want less of it. And we already had a very compelling and differentiated solution, but when you also add this sort of layer on it with the industry messaging and going to market by industry and also adding to this product set, it becomes super compelling and customers really, really like what we're doing."

When you look at a company from $1 billion to $5 billion, Service Cloud really led that engine of growth. As you look to expand the business up about 50% to a $10 billion revenue company, what are the lead engines here? Obviously, service and sales, as big as they are, they're not going to continue to grow as rapidly. So are we going to see other engines come to the forefront in order to help you increase your business by 50% be it analytics or platform or verticals? And one for you, Mark Hawkins, is the renewal business becomes larger and larger. What kind of impact does it have on your margins?"

And when you look at the great success of a lot of these core products, we want to continue to fuel them. Certainly, Service Cloud is amazing. Marketing Cloud, obviously, is also amazing. And Sales Cloud, of course, has achieved a level of revenue that we never could have anticipated and continues to grow. And we have other, as I said, kind of swimmers in their lanes doing be very, very well. Now, in addition to those core products, especially with a tip to Marketing Cloud and its outstanding performance, especially since we acquired ExactTarget and integrated that very deeply into the company, I think also, you have to look at what Keith has done with public sector, which is very exciting for us. It is a huge opportunity for our company. And of course, the verticals where we're continuing to build some new products, including our wealth management product that we've announced and our health product and other applications, categories that we see. And that I will also have to say ISVs. So ISVs remains a really powerful growth channel as well. So if we have any problem at Salesforce, it's that we have a huge amount to invest next year, but we can't just peanut butter and give everybody something. We have to make some bets and to invest in some of these winners that I'm talking about because we have had some phenomenal results as well."

So one of the things that I just want to jump in on, Mark on that point is the second aspect of the question, which is around renewals and what we saw there from a margins, Kash, happy to address. The first thing we always think about obviously is customer success, and we want to make sure that happens and that really promotes renewals, and we love the attrition rate cash that's been happening. You've tracked the company for a long, long time, and you've watched that come down now into the approximately 9% range and that really helps us. And so as we think about margins going forward as it relates to renewals, one of the things I just would almost level it up and say, all of our unit economics suggest that we can hit a mid-30s in terms of our operating margin over the long term at mature revenue growth rates. And part of that is because we're taking good care of the customer, part of that is because we keep the attrition rate low and part of that is we continue to get scale with the unit economics that we can see today. So Kash, I think the long and the short of it is as that renewal business continues to grow, our #1 priority is to take care of the customer and #2 is we will fulfill the operating margin in the mid-30s long, long term."

Aneel Bhusri recently said that if the first 10 years was about cloud, the next 10 years is going to be about data and analytics. And he commented that there won't be any difference between the transaction systems and the analytical systems. So I was wondering first off, Marc, what do you think of that statement? And how far do you want to push the boundaries of data science at Salesforce? In other words, do you think you would have more of a focus on analytics to support Sales, Service and Marketing? Or are you thinking of very broadly pushing into machine learning, predictive behavioral unstructured data, massive data volumes for Internet of Things and really becoming a hub for essentially any kind of data?"

And I look at it differently and I'll tell you why. I think the next 10 years is the age of the customer. I don't think it's the age of data science or the age of machine intelligence or the age of cognitive or the age of mobility or the age of social or the age of cloud or whatever, okay? Because all of those things are going to be important in the next 10 years. All of those things, the cloud, social, mobile, data science, deep learning, NLP, machine intelligence on and on, those are table stakes. Those are table stakes. What are you going to do with that technology? Who's not using those technologies? Philips is using that technology. GE is using that technology. Apple is using that technology. Cisco is using that technology. Coca-Cola, Unilever, they're all using it. Look, it's the next 10 years for these companies is going to be about customer. What are they doing to build a world-class customer experience? How do they transform from being product companies to customer experience companies? And as millennials take over in these enterprises, they are going to be much more focused on experiences. And that is going to be the transformational lever for growth with these companies. And I think that if we get too into any one particular technology or if I was to all of a sudden wave the flag like I used to do 15 or 16 years ago for Cloud, okay, that would be a huge mistake for our company because the #1 thing, most important thing for this company, is the customer. So there was a really good discussion between Ginni Rometty, the CEO of IBM; and John Stumpf, who is the CEO of Wells Fargo Bank at a conference that I was just at put on by Fortune Magazine here in San Francisco, and I'm sure that the transcript is available online. But you'll see that when she is discussing her strategy, it's to become the cognitive company. And when he is discussing his strategy, it's to become the customer company. And I think that we do have to decide what kind of companies are we going to be. I'm going with customer company. I want to be a customer company like John Stumpf does. He is all about the customer, maintaining the integrity and the fidelity of the customer relationship, and I want to help him do that. And yes, will cognitive help him do that? Yes. Will Cloud help him do that? Yes. It's doing it. Is mobile? Yes. Social? Yes. IoT? Yes, all of these things. But let's keep our eye on the ball, which there is a transformational force that is wasting it's way through all of these companies, and every company is afraid that they're going to be uberized out of the world. And they see it happening, and it could be financial services, it could be IBM, okay? Every company is worried about -- look at the decline of IBM over the last decade. Technology is shaking every company at its roots. So that's why the companies who will be the most successful are the ones who are most connected to the customers because the customers are the ones who guide us into the future. They are the ones with the true vision of where we have to go. So I'm going with customer on this one."

Let's just talk about the second question first, and then we'll go back to the renewals. I'd say the first thing is that we are pleased, we have been on a path to just increase our invoices to annual from FY '12. We've been on a steady path of continuous improvement and we reported out when we make progress. And last quarter, we continued to make progress as you noted, Karl, year-on-year, we went from 74% of our invoices being annual to 79%. And so that is just good progress, good execution. We're pleased to see it. It works well for lots and lots of different reasons. And that added and as I called out about roughly 2 points of growth to the deferred revenue year-on-year. But I think we have continued runway on this in the sense that the more enterprise business we get, the more natural it is for people to go to the annual terms that we're looking for, so I wouldn't expect any sharp turns, Karl. I think about this as a steady progression with yes, more runway in the future. Keith thinks about it as moderate, and that's what we're intending and I think it's just good execution, that's number one. Number two, in terms of renewals and one of the things, for everybody on the call, just as a reminder, we just talked about the quantum of our renewals. If you think about when they show up and Q4 is when they show up the most when you think about the kind of the historical patterns of our business and in fact, that is what we expect, and that's all comprehended in our guidance, which we feel really good about both for Q4, the strong finish and also as we point into next year. Obviously, hitting something worth $8 billion to $8.1 billion on top line revenue, we feel really good about for the company to continue to grow and execute at this scale. So those are my answers on both points, Karl."
