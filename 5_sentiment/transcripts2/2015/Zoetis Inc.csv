In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, the recent milestones set from the portfolio and end with our outlook for 2015. 2",1425,"Thank you, John, and good morning to everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, the recent milestones set from the portfolio and end with our outlook for 2015. 
2014 was a year when we made significant progress in creating value. We are growing revenue faster than the market. We improved our margins despite absorbing additional costs required to operate as a fully independent company. We continue to advance our product portfolio through internal R&D initiatives. We communicated a 15% increase in our dividend and $500 million shares repurchase program, and this week, we announced that we completed the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health. 
We also continue to build a culture that delivers results, creates a high sense of ownership from our colleagues and focuses on generating short and long-term value for customers and shareholders. For the year, we delivered operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11%. Both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. 
Here are some details of 2014 revenue various pieces on an operational basis. In livestock, total revenue grew 9% to $3.1 billion. These reflect several market conditions for producers and a strong performance of our key [indiscernible] brands across anti-infective vaccines and medicated feed additives. Livestock markets benefited from strong meat and weaker prices as well as less expensive animal feed. These generated strong producer profits, and this market for producers [indiscernible] medical treatment of animals to preserve their value. This has benefited many premium brands. 
cattle, growing revenues by 10% to $1.7 billion with exceptional growth coming from big cattle markets like U.S. Brazil and Canada as well as from our China business. In some key markets, we see signs that the process of cattle expansion has begun. In the near term, the high value of animals will continue to support our growth as producers place a premium on the sales of their herds. Swine revenue grew 9% to $695 million with a strong growth in many countries around the world. New and recent product introduction such as ENGAIN, DRAXXIN 25, Rui Lan An and our PCV 2 franchise continue to grow in a market that experience challenges due to disease outbreaks and trade restrictions. 
Poultry revenue grew 6% to $568 million with strong growth coming from the U.S. and Latin America. Our growth portfolio in poultry and related [indiscernible] margin in the programs [indiscernible] brought value to producers and led to customer penetration in key markets. 
Turning to companion animal. Revenue grew 4% to $1.6 billion. Across all regions, we saw strong growth of key brands, including APOQUEL, ProHeart 6 CONVENIA, CERENIA and feline evolution. These gains were partially offset by declines in vaccines and [indiscernible] due to increased competition. 
For 2014, APOQUEL achieved sales of $34 million in an environment of constrained supply. For 2015, we are on track to increase supply in [indiscernible], and we expect APOQUEL revenues to be between $150 million and $175 million this year. Building on several years of solid revenue performance, we continue to deliver stronger revenue growth in 2014. We are also pleased that Zoetis continues to outpace the animal health industry. According to the latest data, for the 12 months ending Q3 2014, Zoetis revenue grew 5.5% while the animal health care market grew by 4.6%. This growth includes the negative impact of currency movements. 
The steady interaction of our new products and investment in lifecycle management contributed to a steady revenue growth. In 2014, Zoetis achieved more than 180 product approvals, representing new products, new indications, new formulations, new combinations and the [indiscernible] expansion of our portfolio. 
We recorded several important product response in recent months. This past November, Zoetis submitted to the FDA a filing for [indiscernible] which is the active ingredient of a new flea and tick oral parasiticides for dogs. And last month, we completed filing for the same product in EU [ph] and Canada. The global market for flea and tick parasiticides is about $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion and launching a new product in these categories and opportunity, with growth faster potential for Zoetis, a blockbuster for the animal [indiscernible] it, a product generating more than $100 million a year.
Now let me turn to another milestone that illustrate continuing relation from our R&D investment. We are pleased to announce that Zoetis has submitted a filing to the USDA for another antibody therapy to treat atopic dermatitis in dogs. Based on USDA guidance, we are expecting a conditional license this year. Our product in this specific area further reinforce our industry leadership generation. We have been active in building a platform in monoclonal antibodies that will have a broad application across the species and medical conditions. The first potential product from this platform builds on our knowledge base in the area of canine dermatology. We are excited to bring another treatment option to veterinarians. 
In addition to novel products, Zoetis continues to drive demand in certain diverse product portfolio through investments in product lifecycle development. This past November, the FDA granted new label [indiscernible] for DRAXXIN 25 in the U.S. to treat smaller cats. This follows the approval of DRAXXIn 25 label claims for pigs in July 2013. We also received additional label claims for the Fostera PRRS or vaccine swine bushes which is now licensed in the U.S. for reproductive protection. This product was first approved for respiratory protection in 2012. 
Zoetis PEDv vaccine continued to expand geographically, receiving permission to import and sell in Canada. Zoetis also launches vaccine in highland China, which broadens our range of vaccines in the world's largest swine market. As I mentioned, with just growth or the purchase of Abbott Animal Health. This business is focused on the veterinarian surgical market. It will strengthen our pain and sedation product portfolio and expand our diagnostic business. This position is aligned with our value creation strategy to enhance our portfolio. We are adding leading brands, and we believe Zoetis scale industry-leading [indiscernible] force and global presence will expand both reach penetration of the new portfolio. 
Zoetis also invests in animal health innovation through research partnerships. We recently announced the Zoetis was chosen to meet a researcher team to develop digital technologies for improved swine health and production efficiency. Fourth, we addressed our 2015 guidance majoring the call, but I would like to give the our perspective on the animal health industry and some factors that will drive Zoetis in 2015. 
The animal health industry is forecasted to grow in the 5% to 6% range operationally over the next 5 years, with growth in any given year above or below this rate. Looking to 2015, we expect operational revenue growth for Zoetis to keep pace with or outpace the animal health market. We also expect adjusted net income to grow faster than revenue as we leverage our business model and continue to focus on improving the cost efficiencies. 
Now our perspective by species. The outlook for companion animal is positive. Increased pet ownership and higher pet treatment rates are driving growth in emerging markets, while specialty care is contributing to growth in more developed markets. For Zoetis, we will expect that sales of APOQUEL will have a positive impact on growth in this segment. The outlook for livestock in 2015 is also positive. Producers will remain very profitable although at lower levels than in 2014. For Zoetis, our premium products will remain an important factor to protect the health and body of livestock animals. Underlying demand for animal health problems remained strong despite economic events such as slower growth in GDP, significant movements int he exchange rate, low oil prices or international trade developments. 
We are monitoring the current business environment and overall achieved rate, we don't see any significant impact on our business from these factors. As the past has shown, the animal health industry is resilient to these and other macroeconomic factors. [indiscernible] Zoetis is highly justified [ph] across many dimensions, and this diversity has allowed us to successfully manage through many market conditions in the past. The drivers of growth in animal health remain unchanged. Animal proteins and companionship from pets are basic needs. So we are confident about the future of our prospects and our ability to grow under various market conditions. So I will now turn it over to Paul to talk about the results for the fourth quarter, the year and guidance for 2015."

Thanks for joining us.

I",2684,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm going to review our performance compared with our full year 2014 guidance, provide some color on the fourth quarter results and update you on our full year guidance for 2015. I hope to do all that quickly so that we have plenty of time for Q&A. So here we go. 
Starting with full year 2014 results. The big stories here are revenue, revenue growth and revenue growth from a variety of sources. In 2014, we delivered 7% operational growth in revenue, the second consecutive year of 7% of operational growth and second consecutive year of growth above the long-term industry trend, pretty good, right? Even better, in the fourth quarter, we delivered 9% operational growth versus Q4 2013, overcoming some significant FX headwinds to post 5% reported growth with positive operational trends that are heading right into 2015. Changes in FX rates do start Q4 reported growth rate but we were able to overcome that and still put a solid number on the board, good stuff indeed. Since mid-November, FX rates have continued moved against us. I'll help you think about the impact of FX rates on 2015 in a minute. 
Now for a look at our full year performance versus guidance. As you can see on the webcast slides, our revenue of $4.8 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. The operating growth of 7% was driven by 9% growth in livestock and 4% in companion animal. On a regional basis, the U.S. accounted for almost half of our growth, up 8% compared with 2013. CLAR accounted for about 1/3 of our operational growth, up 13%. APAC was about 11% of our operational growth, up 5%. And EuAfME accounted for about 8% of our operational growth. It was up 2% versus 2013, but [indiscernible] all growth rates are on an operational basis. 
Continuing with 2014 performance compared with our guidance. Our adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue was 35.1%, a bit better than our guidance of 35.5%, and that's primarily due to the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A, meanwhile, was $1.507 billion for the full year, approximately $27 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. There were a number of factors that contributed to the increased SG&A above expectations. 
First, as we trended above our revenue forecast to the latter part of the quarter, we saw an increase in costs associated with higher revenues such as sales incentive compensation and distribution expenses. We also authorized the additional promotional spending in the quarter, spending that is expected to support revenue growth into 2015. Next, we accelerated some actions in Q4 that triggered additional G&A expenses in the quarter, including, for example, severance, software license expense and some additional business development expenses. As successful as we've been in driving our top line, we're still a young company just finishing up our second year on our own. We have plenty of work remain to build and fine-tune our G&A organizations and the systems needed to support our global business model. As that process continues, there will be opportunities to move forward and towards a more efficient cost structure. 
In other items, adjusted R&D expense came in at $393 million, in line with our full year guidance. This continues to be an essential investment for both developing new products and managing the lifecycle of the more than 300 product lines that provide us with our durable and growing revenue streams. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was almost 27% and 18% in the fourth quarter. This reflected the full year impact of the R&D tax credit, which, you will recall, was not anticipated in our guidance. Also contributing to the lower-than-expected tax rate was a resolution of prior tax matters and changes in the mix of our earnings. It's important to know that the elements that drove the rate down below our and your expectations were not structural, and we continue to expect that our tax rate in 2015 will be approximately 29%. As with our 2014 guidance, our tax rate guidance for 2015 does not include the potential benefit of an extension of the R&D tax credit. 
We exceeded the top end of our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 a share, posting $1.57 per share for the full year. This was due to the strong revenues and the lower-than-expected tax rates, offset in part by increased spending in the fourth quarter. And finally, we exceeded our range on certain significant items and acquisition-related costs for 2014. This will result costs associated with certain shareholder activities and some changes associated with our global manufacturing organizations. As a result, our reported diluted EPS came in at $1.16, the lower end of our guidance range. 
Now let me switch gears and dive a bit more into the fourth quarter results. You can see our income statement and adjusted income statement slides on our webcast. Repeating from my opening remarks, fourth quarter revenue grew 9% operationally and 5% on a reported basis, and while 9 minus 5 equals 4, there's some rounding in there, so the negative impact of currency movements on our growth rate was roughly 330 basis points. Our U.S. and core segments demonstrated strong double-digit sales growth leading the way for Zoetis while the APAC segment grew more modestly and EuAfME declined 1% on an operational basis. 
On the last call, I talked about the hazards of reading too much into any one quarter in isolation. EuAfME illustrates that point. In Q1, revenue was down 4% operationally, and in Q2, revenue was up 4% operationally. In Q3, it was up 12% operationally, and in Q4, it declined 1%, but for the year, operational growth for EuAfME was about 2%, broadly in line with the long-term expected growth rate for that segment. 
Moving to SG&A. Our adjusted SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 14% operationally due to the timing of promotional spending and other items that I called out earlier in my discussion of the full year. Our adjusted R&D expense was up 4% operationally in the quarter. R&D, as I have noted before, can vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of clinical trials and other factors. For the full year, we performed in line with our guidance. 
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, our tax rate in the quarter was 18% due to a number of factors that got worked out in the fourth quarter. We also have a full set of regional tables and quarterly commentaries in the press release and webcast slides. With that material available to you, let me just highlight a few takeaways on the revenue and profitability for each segment. 
Beginning with the U.S. Fourth quarter revenue increased 14% driven by very livestock, which were up 19%, a truly stellar quarter for the largest segment of our business. The growth in livestock products, especially cattle in the United States, was based on the higher demand for our premium products as producers continue to benefit from strong market conditions, some of which Juan Ramón just touched on. In companion animal products in the U.S., we generated growth of 7%, driven by APOQUEL and other key brands and despite continued competition for revenue and competitive pressure in vaccines and parasiticides. Based on the U.S. segment strong sales and more relative expense growth, their segment earnings increased by 20%. 
In Europe/Africa/Middle East, revenue decreased 1% on our operational basis compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This was a result of revenue increases in southern Europe and Germany driven by livestock as well as APOQUEL's sales in the U.K. and Germany with those increases more than offset by declines in other markets such as France and Russia. In France, we had anticipated some softness in the fourth quarter based on the fact that customers bought large amounts of anti-infectives in the third quarter and had a more restrictive legislative changes that went into effect January 1. The EuAfME segment earnings decreased by 4% operationally in the quarter, primarily due to the declines in revenue and the timing of promotional spending. 
Moving to CLAR, which is our Canada and Latin American segment we generated an increase of 16% operationally compared with the fourth quarter 2013. Brazil and Canada are the principal drivers in the CLAR region given their relative size and we saw growth in both livestock and companion animal products in these 2 countries. In Canada, we saw a significant cattle product sales due to strong market conditions for producers. Increased medicalization rates for companion animals in Brazil have been a driver of growth there as well. We also saw strong growth in Venezuela and other emerging markets in central and South America. These high inflationary markets support attractive growth opportunities but need to be carefully monitored. The CLAR segment earnings increased 20% on an operational basis driven by the revenue growth and limited growth on operational expenses. 
Finally, in Asia Pacific we had an increase of 4% operationally compared to the fourth quarter 2013. Sales of livestock products did well, particularly in Australia, Southeast Asia and across the board in emerging markets. A growing vaccine portfolio for swine and new parasiticide products continued to drive our performance there. Sales of companion animal products, however, declined 6% operationally primarily due to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan that we talked about last quarter. The APAC segment operating earnings increased 6% operationally due to the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses. 
Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2015, which we first provided at our Investor Day in mid-November. We're updating certain elements of our full year guidance today that reflect 3 things. First, the effect, over which we have no control and FX rates. We are adjusting our guidance based on the changes in foreign currency exchange rates from mid-November when we first reported our guidance for 2015 to reflect rates as of late January. In those roughly 70 days, the U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all of the major currencies in which we transact. For emphasis, and in round numbers, the dollar was up 9% versus the euro, 8% versus the Canadian dollar, 8% versus the Aussie dollar, 4% versus the British pound, 1% against the Japanese yen, and against the Brazilian real, it was flat. Those are our top 6 currencies. The movement in exchange rates since mid-November reduced our revenue expectations for full year 2015 by $125 million or 255 basis points based on the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We now expect the full year impact of FX to be about 600 basis points or almost $300 million on a full year 2015 revenue as compared with our 2014 actual results. I want to repeat that for emphasis. Since mid-November, the change in FX rate reduced our expectations for the full year 2015 by 255 basis points or $125 million comparing our revised expectations for 2015 back to 2014 actual results. The changes in FX rates account for a 600 basis point reduction in our expected growth rate. 
So natural hedging from expenses denominated in foreign currency, we do see the dollar impact of the movements in FX at adjusted income with a negative impact of the change rate was roughly $30 million or roughly 360 basis points down from the midpoint of our initial guidance range. Something for you to be aware of. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against our major currencies, that can put upward pressure on our effective tax rate. 
At this point, we are affirming our guidance for our tax rate at approximately 29%, not including the R&D tax credit, but for emphasis, I'm going to repeat something I just said. Continued strength in the U.S. dollar could cause us to revisit that guidance. So that's another part we can monitor but don't control. The part we can control are our operating expenses in 2015. In addition to the expense reductions driven by the change in FX rates, we revised our range of expectations for SG&A expenses by an additional $35 million. This reflects quality reductions in spending intended to help offset the FX impact on 2015 adjusted net income. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health this week. With that done now, we'll begin integration and expect a positive impact of approximately $75 million to revenue for our full year 2015 results, an accretion of $0.01 per share to adjusted diluted EPS for the full year 2015. 
Taking the FX rate changes and a reduction of expected SG&A into account as well as the added transaction, our revised guidance calls for revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and results in our holding our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. The net $50 million reduction in the revenue range represents a roughly $125 million or 2.5% decrease, driven by the change in the FX rates. Meanwhile, the combination of the natural FX hedges inherent in our business and our targeted $35 million of OpEx reductions, annual impact of Abbott, all those things combined enabled us to maintain our earlier adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2015. 
When we provided our guidance in November, we expressed growth targets based on the midpoints of our 2014 guidance ranges. With 2014 now final, it's worth refreshing the growth rates implied by our guidance. With the more significant revenue base that we delivered in 2014 and our guidance as revised to date to include Abbott and the expected expense reductions, we are expecting revenue growth on an operational basis in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% and growth of adjusted net income in the range of 11% to 16%. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. 
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, I'll remind you of a comment I made at our Investor Day in November about the trajectory of our overall performance in 2015. We still expect the year to start low and then high. A key driver of our growth in 2015 will be the additional supply of APOQUEL, but we will not see that supply increase until Q2. I also want to note to the revenue impact for the Abbott acquisition in Q1 is nominal, less than $5 million, and that there will be a negative impact on recorded Q1 results based on the changes in FX rates since my comments in November. 
So to sum up the quarter and the year, we continue with very strong revenue and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our global business model. The diversity of our business across species, product lines, geographies, and therapeutic areas is one of our core strengths. Our global footprint enables us to overcome weaknesses in some regions and deliver consistent revenue and earnings growth. We demonstrated this ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense contained our regional statements, while continuing to absorb some of the impact of the buildup on cost for our corporate functions. Foreign currency was a significant factor on a reported results in the quarter and for the year, and we have updated our full year 2015 guidance based on the rates in effect as of late January 2015. We expect to deliver strong revenue and profit growth on an operational basis in 2015, 6.5% to 8.5% for revenue and 11% to 16% for adjusted net income. While the currency headwinds are expected to be a drag on our reported results and growth rates, we have taken steps to mitigate some of those impacts and we'll continue to pursue meaning to protecting and growing our adjusted net income throughout the year. That concludes my prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line for your questions. Operator?"

You gave a little bit of detail during your prepared remarks, but I'd be interested in knowing more if possible, like how board this program really is. Are you pursuing antibodies outside of companion animal dermatology? Or should we think of this as mainly a derm program. And in fact, if any, do you think if antibody program will have on your P&L once commercial gross margins in the human health side tend to be a bit lower in the antibodies than they are for small molecule. And also of course, on the CapEx, long-term CapEx projections, sometimes building plants capable producing large quantities of biologics can expensive.

I will take a stab at that and Juan Ramón may want to come in as well. [indiscernible] asked a question earlier about expansion. I just want to point out that so far we've done a pretty good job over the course of the last several years. If you look at our reported operating margin going back to 2011 and up to '14, I mean it's been a nice progression sort of 18 to 21 to 24 to circa 25, and that was broadly by rolling the top line while having some expense discipline meaning, holding the line on expenses. Wise man once said to me, said it's not all that impressive to grow into and expanding margin. But I'd say it may not be in impressive, but it is a good thing. Now that said, that sort of sets the stage. Even with respect to thinking about our 2015, we saw some headwinds in FX and we took some actions with respect to our operating expenses in order to be [indiscernible] as best we could, but impacting our business model reduce our expected operating expenses for 2015. The areas where we have most likely to have long-term opportunity are those areas that are away from revenue production and R&D and manufacturing, and manufacturing will be more efficient to that process and we would hope this goes to the market at some point in the future. The area really is around what we call enabling functions in G&A. We are still in the process of our standup. I know that it is frustrating to a lot of people that we just really completed our second year on our own, and we continue to have challenges in implementing systems and building out the infrastructure that will were able to grow, control and manage what is a very complicated global business. As we make progress along the lines of the implementation, for example, of our global ERP package SAP, it will give us opportunities to be more efficient in our enabling functions. Now we look at all types of expenses. I'd say, and I do dsay it constantly, in investor meetings, we can always do better. So we want to look at ways that we can deploy our capital within our business to the areas where we think we'll get the most bang for our buck. And to the extent that we are successful in doing that over the next several years, we expect that we can expand our operating margin potentially beyond what you would be or what would be implied by our current long-term guidance. And to refresh everybody what we said on Investor Day was you look out to 2015, '16 and '17 based on what you have in front of you, is you have a company that can grow from now roughly 25% operating margin and add 500 basis points to that by growing revenues and being disciplined with respect to expense. To the extent we see opportunities to be more efficient, that will certainly be more additive to that."

An evidence of that if there is restructuring you probably wouldn't call out in onetime costs and certain significant items restructuring charge. This was, what I'll call, a normal course of business looking at 2015, looking at where we are relative to where we want to be and us taking actions around categories that we did not think will influence that top line, so by definition they are away from revenue generation, mainly enabling type functions."

In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, review recent milestones from the total portfolio and end with our outlook for 2015",1438,"Thank you, John, and good morning to everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, review recent milestones from the total portfolio and end with our outlook for 2015. 
2014 was a year when we made significant progress in creating value. We are growing revenue faster than the market. We improved our margins despite absorbing additional costs required to operate as a fully independent company. We continue to advance our product portfolio through internal R&D initiatives. We communicated a 15% increase in our dividend and $500 million shares repurchase program. And this week, we announced that we completed the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health. 
We also continue to build a culture that delivers the results, creates a high sense of ownership from our colleagues and focuses on generating short and long-term value for customers and shareholders. For the year, we delivered operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11%. Both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. 
Here are some details of 2014 revenue various pieces on an operational basis. In livestock, total revenue grew 9% to $3.1 billion. These reflect favorable market conditions for producers and a strong performance of our key Zoetis brands across anti-infective vaccines and medicated feed additives. Livestock markets benefited from strong meat and milk prices, as well as less expensive animal feed. These generated strong producers profits, and this market producers increased the medical treatment of animals to preserve their value. This has benefited many premium Zoetis brands. 
Cattle. Growing revenues by 10% to $1.7 billion with exceptional growth coming from big cattle markets like U.S. Brazil and Canada, as well as from our China business. In some key markets, we see signs that the process of cattle expansion has begun. In the near term, the high value of animals will continue to support our growth as producers place a premium on the sales of their herds. Swine revenue grew 9% to $695 million with a strong growth in many countries around the world. New and recent product introduction such as ENGAIN, DRAXXIN 25, Rui Lan An and our PCV2 franchise contributed to grow in a market that experienced challenges due to disease outbreaks and trade restrictions. 
Poultry revenue grew 6% to $568 million with a strong growth coming from the U.S. and Latin America. Our growth portfolio in poultry and integrated coccidiosis management programs, named Rotecc, brought value to producers and led to increased customer penetration in key markets. 
Turning to companion animal. Revenue grew 4% to $1.6 billion. Across all regions, we saw strong growth of key brands, including APOQUEL, ProHeart 6 CONVENIA, CERENIA and feline REVOLUTION. These gains were partially offset by declines in vaccines and Rimadyl due to increased competition. 
For 2014, APOQUEL achieved sales of $34 million in an environment of constrained supply. For 2015, we are on track to increase supply in April and we expect APOQUEL revenues to be between $150 million and $175 million this year. 
Building on several years of solid revenue performance, we continue to deliver strong revenue growth in 2014. We are also pleased that Zoetis continues to outpace the animal health industry. According to the latest data, for the 12 months ending Q3 2014, Zoetis revenue grew 5.5% while the animal health care market grew by 4.6%. This growth includes the negative impact of currency movements. 
The steady interaction of our new products and investment in lifecycle management contributed to a steady revenue growth. In 2014, Zoetis achieved more than 180 product approvals, representing new products, new indications, new formulations, new combinations and geographic expansion of our portfolio. 
We recorded several important product milestones in the recent months. This past November, Zoetis submitted to the FDA a filing for Sarolaner, which is the active ingredient of our new flea and tick oral parasiticide for dogs. And last month, we completed the filing for the same product in EU and Canada. The global market for flea and ticks parasiticides is about $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion and launching a new product in these categories and opportunity, with a broader potential for Zoetis. A blockbuster for the animal contingency is generally a product generating more than $100 million a year.
Now let me turn to another milestone that illustrate continuing relation from our R&D investment. We are pleased to announce that Zoetis has submitted a filing to the USDA for another antibody therapy to treat atopic dermatitis in dogs. Based on USDA guidance, we are expecting a conditional license this year. Our product in this specific area further reinforce our industry leadership innovation. We have been active in building a platform in monoclonal antibodies that will have a broad application across the species and medical conditions. The first potential product from this platform builds on our knowledge base in the area of canine dermatology. We are excited to bring another treatment option to veterinarians. 
In addition to novel products, Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse product portfolio through investments in product lifecycle development. The past November, the FDA granted new label claims for DRAXXIN 25 in the U.S. to treat smaller cats. This follows the approval of DRAXXIN 25 label claims for pigs in July 2013. We also received additional label claims for the Fostera PRRS or vaccine for swine, which is now licensed in the U.S. for reproductive protection. This product was first approved for respiratory protection in 2012. 
Zoetis PEDv vaccine continued to expand geographically, receiving the permission to import and sell in Canada. Zoetis also launches vaccine in Huinan, China, which broadens our range of vaccines in the world's largest swine market. As I mentioned, with just the close or the purchase of Abbott Animal Health. This business is focused on the veterinarian surgical market. It will strengthen our pain and sedation product portfolio and expand our diagnostic business. This acquisition is aligned with our value creation strategy to enhance our portfolio. We are adding leading brands, and we believe Zoetis scale industry-leading field force and global presence will expand both the reach penetration of the new portfolio. 
Zoetis also invests in animal health innovation through research partnerships. We recently announced that Zoetis was chosen to meet a researcher team to develop digital technologies for improved swine health and production efficiency. Paul will address our 2015 guidance later in the call. But I would like to give you our perspective on the animal health industry and some factors that will drive Zoetis in 2015. 
The animal health industry is forecasted to grow in the 5% to 6% range operationally over the next 5 years, with a growth in any given year above or below this rate. Looking to 2015, we expect operational revenue growth for Zoetis to keep pace with or outpace the animal health market. We also expect adjusted net income to grow faster than revenue as we leverage our business model and continue to focus on improving net cost efficiencies. 
Now our perspective by species. The outlook for companion animal is positive. Increased pet ownership and higher pet treatment rates are driving growth in emerging markets, while specialty care is contributing to growth in more developed markets. For Zoetis, we will suspect that sales of APOQUEL will have a positive impact on growth in this segment. The outlook for livestock in 2015 is also positive. Producers will remain very profitable although at lower levels than in 2014. For Zoetis, our premium products will remain an important factor to protect the health and value of livestock animals. Underlying demand for animal health products have remained strong despite economic events such as slower growth in the GDP, significant movements in exchange rate, low oil prices or international trade developments. 
We are monitoring the current business environment and all around exchange rates, we don't see any significant impact on our business from these factors. As the past has shown, the animal health industry is resilient to these and other macroeconomic factors. Within the industry, Zoetis is highly diversified across many dimensions, and this diversity has allowed us to successfully manage it through many market conditions in the past. The drivers of growth in animal health remain unchanged. Animal proteins and companionship from pets are basic needs. So we are confident about the future of our prospects and our ability to grow under various market conditions. 
So I will now turn it over to Paul to talk about the results for the fourth quarter, the year and guidance for 2015."

I",2694,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm going to review our performance compared with our full year 2014 guidance, provide some color on the fourth quarter results and update you on our full year guidance for 2015. I hope to do all that quickly so that we have plenty of time for Q&A. So here we go. 
Starting with full year 2014 results. The big stories here are revenue, revenue growth and revenue growth from a variety of sources. In 2014, we delivered 7% operational growth in revenue, the second consecutive year of 7% operational growth and second consecutive year of growth above the long-term industry trend. Pretty good, right? 
Even better, in the fourth quarter, we delivered 9% operational growth versus Q4 of 2013, overcoming some significant FX headwinds to post 5% reported growth with positive operational trends that are heading right into 2015. Changes in FX rates reduced our Q4 reported growth rate, but we were able to overcome that and still put a solid number on the board. Good stuff, indeed. Since mid-November, FX rates have continued to move against us. I'll help you think about the impact of FX rates on 2015 in a minute. 
Now for a look at our full year performance versus guidance. As you can see on the webcast slides, our revenue of $4.8 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. The operating growth of 7% was driven by 9% growth in livestock and 4% in companion animal. On a regional basis, the U.S. accounted for almost half of our growth, up 8% compared with 2013. CLAR accounted for about 1/3 of our operational growth, up 13%. APAC was about 11% of our operational growth, up 5%. And EuAfME accounted for about 8% of our operational growth, it was up 2% versus 2013. If we're going to bout, all growth rates are on an operational basis. 
Continuing with our 2014 performance compared with our guidance. Our adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue was 35.1%, a bit better than our guidance of 35.5%, and that's primarily due to the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A, meanwhile, was $1.507 billion for the full year, approximately $27 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. There were a number of factors that contributed to the increased SG&A above expectations. 
First, as we trended above our revenue forecast to the latter part of the quarter, we saw an increase in costs associated with higher revenues such as sales incentive compensation and distribution expenses. We also authorized the additional promotional spending in the quarter, spending that is expected to support revenue growth into 2015. Next, we accelerated some actions in Q4 that triggered additional G&A expense in the quarter including, for example, severance, software license expense and some additional business development expenses. 
As successful as we've been in driving our top line, we're still a young company just finishing up our second year on our own. We have plenty of work remaining to build and fine-tune our G&A organizations and the systems needed to support our global business model. As that process continues, there will be opportunities to move forward and towards a more efficient cost structure. 
In other items, adjusted R&D expense came in at $393 million, in line with our full year guidance. This continues to be an essential investment for both developing new products and managing the lifecycle of the more than 300 product lines that provide us with our durable and growing revenue streams. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was almost 27% and 18% in the fourth quarter. This reflected the full year impact of the R&D tax credit which, you will recall, was not anticipated in our guidance. Also contributing to the lower-than-expected tax rate was a resolution of prior tax matters and changes in the mix of our earnings. It's important to know that the elements that drove the rate down below our and your expectations were not structural, and we continue to expect that our tax rate in 2015 will be approximately 29%. As with our 2014 guidance, our tax rate guidance for 2015 does not include the potential benefit of an extension of the R&D tax credit. 
We exceeded the top end of our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 a share, posting $1.57 per share for the full year. This was due to the strong revenues and the lower-than-expected tax rate, offset in part by increased spending in the fourth quarter. And finally, we exceeded our range on certain significant items and acquisition-related costs for 2014. This will yield result costs associated with certain shareholder activities and some changes associated with our global manufacturing organizations. As a result, our reported diluted EPS came in at $1.16, the lower end of our guidance range. 
Now let me switch gears and dive a bit more into the fourth quarter results. You can see our income statement and adjusted income statement slides on our webcast. Repeating from my opening remarks, fourth quarter revenue grew 9% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. And while 9 minus 5 equals 4, there's some rounding in there so the negative impact of currency movements on our growth rate was roughly 330 basis points. Our U.S. and core segments demonstrated strong double-digit sales growth leading the way for Zoetis, while the APAC segment grew more modestly and EuAfME declined 1% on an operational basis. 
On the last call, I talked about the hazards of reading too much into any one quarter in isolation. EuAfME illustrates that point. In Q1, revenue was down 4% operationally and in Q2, revenue was up 4% operationally. In Q3, it was up 12% operationally, and in Q4 it declined 1%. But for the year, operational growth for EuAfME was about 2%, broadly in line with the long-term expected growth rate for that segment. 
Moving to SG&A. Our adjusted SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 14% operationally due to the timing of promotional spending and other items that I called out earlier in my discussion of the full year. Our adjusted R&D expense was up 4% operationally in the quarter. R&D, as I have noted before, can vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of clinical trials and other factors. For the full year, we performed in line with our guidance. 
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, our tax rate in the quarter was 18% due to a number of factors that got worked out in the fourth quarter. We also have a full set of regional tables and quarterly commentaries in the press release and webcast slides. With that material available to you, let me just highlight a few takeaways on the revenue and profitability for each segment. 
Beginning with the U.S. Fourth quarter revenue increased 14% driven by very strong livestock sales which were up 19%. A truly stellar quarter for the largest segment of our business. The growth in livestock products, especially cattle in the United States, was based on the higher demand for our premium products as producers continue to benefit from strong market conditions, some of which Juan Ramón just touched on. In companion animal products in the U.S., we generated growth of 7% driven by APOQUEL and other key brands, and despite continued competition for Rimadyl and competitive pressure in vaccines and parasiticides. Based on the U.S. segment strong sales and more relative expense growth, their segment earnings increased by 20%. 
In Europe/Africa/Middle East, revenue decreased 1% on our operational basis compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This was a result of revenue increases in southern Europe and Germany driven by livestock as well as APOQUEL's sales in the U.K. and Germany, with those increases more than offset by declines in other markets such as France and Russia. In France, we had anticipated some softness in the fourth quarter based on the fact that customers bought large amounts of anti-infectives in the third quarter and had a more restrictive legislative changes that went into effect January 1. The EuAfME segment earnings decreased by 4% operationally in the quarter, primarily due to the declines in revenue and the timing of promotional spending. 
Moving to CLAR, which is our Canada and Latin American segment. We generated an increase of 16% operationally compared with the fourth quarter 2013. Brazil and Canada are the principal drivers in the CLAR region given their relative size and we saw growth in both livestock and companion animal products in these 2 countries. In Canada, we saw a significant cattle product sales due to strong market conditions for producers. Increased medicalization rates for companion animals in Brazil have been a driver of growth there, as well. We also saw strong growth in Venezuela and other emerging markets in Central and South America. These high inflationary markets support attractive growth opportunities but need to be carefully monitored. The CLAR segment earnings increased 20% on an operational basis driven by the revenue growth and limited growth on operating expenses. 
Finally, in Asia Pacific, we had an increase of 4% operationally compared to the fourth quarter 2013. Sales of livestock products did well, particularly in Australia, Southeast Asia and across-the-board in emerging markets. A growing vaccine portfolio for swine and new parasiticide products continued to drive our performance there. Sales of companion animal products, however, declined 6% operationally, primarily due to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan that we talked about last quarter. The APAC segment operating earnings increased 6% operationally due to the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses. 
Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2015, which we first provided at our Investor Day in mid-November. We're updating certain elements of our full year guidance today to reflect 3 things. First, effect over which we have no control and FX rates. We're adjusting our guidance based on the changes in foreign currency exchange rates from mid-November, when we first reported our guidance for 2015, to reflect rates as of late January. In those roughly 70 days, the U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all of the major currencies in which we transact. For emphasis, and in round numbers, the dollar was up 9% versus the euro, 8% versus the Canadian dollar, 8% versus the Aussie dollar, 4% versus the British pound, 1% against the Japanese yen, and against the Brazilian real, it was flat. Those are our top 6 currencies. 
The movement in the exchange rates since mid-November reduced our revenue expectations for the full year 2015 by $125 million or 255 basis points based on the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We now expect the full year impact of FX to be about 600 basis points or almost $300 million on a full year 2015 revenue as compared with our 2014 actual results. I want to repeat that for emphasis. Since mid-November, the change in FX rate reduced our expectations for the full year 2015 by 255 basis points or $125 million. Comparing our revised expectations for 2015 back to 2014 actual results, the changes in FX rates account for a 600 basis point reduction on our expected growth rate. 
So natural hedging from expenses denominated in foreign currencies reduces the dollar impact of the movements in FX at adjusted net income, where the negative impact of the change rate was roughly $30 million or roughly 360 basis points down from the midpoint of our initial guidance range. Something for you to be aware of. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against our major currencies, that can put upward pressure on our effective tax rate. 
At this point, we are affirming our guidance for our tax rate at approximately 29%, not including the R&D tax credit. But for emphasis, I'm going to repeat something I just said. Continued strength in the U.S. dollar could cause us to have to revisit that guidance. So that's another part we can monitor but don't control. 
The part we can control are our operating expenses in 2015. In addition to the expense reductions driven by the change in FX rates, we revised downward our range of expectations for SG&A expenses by an additional $35 million. This reflects targeted reductions in spending intended to help offset the FX impact on 2015 adjusted net income. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health this week. With that done now, we'll begin integration and expect a positive impact of approximately $75 million to revenue for our full year 2015 results, an accretion of $0.01 per share to adjusted diluted EPS for the full year 2015. 
Taking the FX rate changes and our reduction of expected SG&A into account as well as the added transaction, our revised guidance calls for revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and results in our holding our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. The net $50 million reduction in the revenue range represents a roughly $125 million or 2.5% decrease, driven by the change in the FX rates. Meanwhile, the combination of the natural FX hedges inherent in our business and our targeted $35 million of OpEx reductions, and the overall impact of Abbott, all those things combined enabled us to maintain our earlier adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2015. 
While we provided our guidance in November, we expressed growth targets based on the midpoints of our 2014 guidance ranges. With 2014 now final, it's worth refreshing the growth rates implied by our guidance. With the more significant revenue base that we delivered in 2014, and our guidance as revised today to include Abbott and the expected expense reductions, we are expecting revenue growth on an operational basis in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% and growth of adjusted net income in the range of 11% to 16%. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. 
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, I'll remind you of a comment I made at our Investor Day in November about the trajectory of our overall performance in 2015. We still expect the year to start low and end high. A key driver of our growth in 2015 will be the additional supply of APOQUEL, but we will not see that supply increase until Q2. I also want to note that the revenue impact of the Abbott acquisition in Q1 is nominal, less than $5 million. And that there will be a negative impact on recorded Q1 results based on the changes in FX rates since my comments in November. 
So to sum up the quarter and the year. We continue with very strong revenue and earnings growth demonstrating the strength of our global business model. The diversity of our business across species, product lines, geographies, and therapeutic areas is one of our core strengths. Our global footprint enables us to overcome weaknesses in some regions and deliver consistent revenue and earnings growth. We demonstrated this ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional statements, while continuing to absorb some of the impact of the buildup on cost for our corporate functions. 
Foreign currency was a significant factor on our reported results in the quarter and for the year, and we have updated our full year 2015 guidance based on the rates in effect as of late January 2015. We expect to deliver strong revenue and profit growth on an operational basis in 2015, 6.5% to 8.5% for revenue and 11% to 16% for adjusted net income. While the currency headwinds are expected to be a drag on our reported results and growth rates, we have taken steps to mitigate some of those impacts and we'll continue to pursue means of protecting and growing our adjusted net income throughout the year. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line for your questions. Operator?"

And as a follow-up, can you remind us of the agreement with Pfizer and how it would impact a potential sale of the company? Is Zoetis too large for an acquisition by a competitor? Or would it have to be acquired by a company with essentially no animal health presence?"

I will take a stab at that and Juan Ramón may want to come in as well. We -- Louise asked a question earlier on about margin expansion and I just want to point out that, so far, we've done a pretty good job over the course of the last several years. If you had looked at our reported operating margin going back to 2011 and up to '14, I mean, it's been a nice progression from sort of 18 to 21 to 24 to circa 25, and that was broadly by rolling the top line while having some expense discipline meaning, holding the line on expenses. Now a wise man once said to me, said it's not all that impressive to grow into and expanding margin. But I'd say, it may not be impressive but it is a good thing. Now that said, that sort of sets the stage. Even with respect to thinking about our 2015, we saw some headwinds in FX and we took some actions with respect to our operating expenses in order to be able to, as best we could, without impacting our business model, reduce our expected operating expenses for 2015. The areas where we have most likely to have long-term opportunity are those areas that are away from revenue production and R&D and manufacturing. And manufacturing will be more efficient to that process and we would hope to disclose to the market at some point here in the future. The area really is around those what we call enabling functions in G&A. We are still in the process of our standup. I know that it is frustrating to a lot of people where we just really completed our second year on our own, and we continue to have challenges in implementing systems and building out the infrastructure that will enable us to grow, control and manage what is a very complicated global business. As we make progress along the lines of the implementation, for example, of our global ERP package SAP, it will give us opportunities to be more efficient in our enabling functions. Now we look at all types of expenses. And I say, and I do say it constantly in investor meetings, we can always do better. So we want to look at ways that we can deploy our capital within our business to the areas where we think we'll get the most bang for our buck. And to the extent that we are successful in doing that over the next several years, we expect that we can expand our operating margin potentially beyond what you would be or what would be implied by our current long-term guidance. And to refresh what -- for everybody, what we said on Investor Day was you look out to 2015, '16 and '17 based on what you have in front of you. If you have a company that can grow from now a roughly 25% operating margin and add 500 basis points to that by growing revenues and being disciplined with respect to expense. To the extent we see opportunities to be more efficient, that would certainly be additive to that."

So there -- I wouldn't describe the items in there as so much as onetime. This is the ones that are within our adjusted SG&A. They were expenses that, in large part, were managed by us in the quarter and reflect sort of a robust revenue quarter for us and looking ahead to 2015. Thinking about the SG&A for 2015 full year, we did reduce the range by some $35 million. I mean, no, it does not reflect any sort of a restructuring or anything. I think if it did, evidence of that is, if it had been a restructuring, we probably would have called out in onetime costs and certain significant items restructuring charge. This was, what I'll call, a normal course of business. Looking at 2015, looking at where we are relative to where we want to be and us taking actions around categories that we do not think will influence that top line. So by definition, away from revenue generation, mainly in enabling type functions. I hope that answers the question."

In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, review recent milestones from the total portfolio and end with our outlook for 2015",1436,"Thank you, John, and good morning to everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, review recent milestones from the total portfolio and end with our outlook for 2015. 
2014 was a year when we made significant progress in creating value. We are growing revenue faster than the market. We improved our margins despite absorbing additional costs required to operate as a fully independent company. We continue to advance our product portfolio through internal R&D initiatives. We communicated a 15% increase in our dividend and $500 million shares repurchase program. And this week, we announced that we completed the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health. 
We also continue to build a culture that delivers the results, creates a high sense of ownership from our colleagues and focuses on generating short and long-term value for customers and shareholders. For the year, we delivered operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11%. Both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. 
Here are some details of 2014 revenue various pieces on an operational basis. In livestock, total revenue grew 9% to $3.1 billion. These reflect favorable market conditions for producers and a strong performance of our key Zoetis brands across anti-infective vaccines and medicated feed additives. Livestock markets benefited from strong meat and milk prices, as well as less expensive animal feed. These generated strong producers profits, and this market producers increased the medical treatment of animals to preserve their value. This has benefited many premium Zoetis brands. 
Cattle. Growing revenues by 10% to $1.7 billion with exceptional growth coming from big cattle markets like U.S. Brazil and Canada, as well as from our China business. In some key markets, we see signs that the process of cattle expansion has begun. In the near term, the high value of animals will continue to support our growth as producers place a premium on the sales of their herds. Swine revenue grew 9% to $695 million with a strong growth in many countries around the world. New and recent product introduction such as ENGAIN, DRAXXIN 25, Rui Lan An and our PCV2 franchise contributed to grow in a market that experienced challenges due to disease outbreaks and trade restrictions. 
Poultry revenue grew 6% to $568 million with a strong growth coming from the U.S. and Latin America. Our growth portfolio in poultry and integrated coccidiosis management programs, named Rotecc, brought value to producers and led to increased customer penetration in key markets. 
Turning to companion animal. Revenue grew 4% to $1.6 billion. Across all regions, we saw strong growth of key brands, including APOQUEL, ProHeart 6, CONVENIA, CERENIA and feline REVOLUTION. These gains were partially offset by declines in vaccines and Rimadyl due to increased competition. 
For 2014, APOQUEL achieved sales of $34 million in an environment of constrained supply. For 2015, we are on track to increase supply in April and we expect APOQUEL revenues to be between $150 million and $175 million this year. 
Building on several years of solid revenue performance, we continue to deliver strong revenue growth in 2014. We are also pleased that Zoetis continues to outpace the animal health industry. According to the latest data, for the 12 months ending Q3 2014, Zoetis revenue grew 5.5% while the animal health care market grew by 4.6%. This growth includes the negative impact of currency movements. 
The steady interaction of our new products and investment in lifecycle management contributed to a steady revenue growth. In 2014, Zoetis achieved more than 180 product approvals, representing new products, new indications, new formulations, new combinations and geographic expansion of our portfolio. 
We recorded several important product milestones in the recent months. This past November, Zoetis submitted to the FDA a filing for Sarolaner, which is the active ingredient of our new flea and tick oral parasiticide for dogs. And last month, we completed the filing for the same product in EU and Canada. The global market for flea and ticks parasiticides is about $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion and launching a new product in these categories and opportunity, with a broader potential for Zoetis. A blockbuster for the animal contingency is generally a product generating more than $100 million a year.
Now let me turn to another milestone that illustrate continuing relation from our R&D investment. We are pleased to announce that Zoetis has submitted a filing to the USDA for another antibody therapy to treat atopic dermatitis in dogs. Based on USDA guidance, we are expecting a conditional license this year. Our product in this specific area further reinforce our industry leadership innovation. We have been active in building a platform in monoclonal antibodies that will have a broad application across the species and medical conditions. The first potential product from this platform builds on our knowledge base in the area of canine dermatology. We are excited to bring another treatment option to veterinarians. 
In addition to novel products, Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse product portfolio through investments in product lifecycle development. This past November, the FDA granted new label claims for DRAXXIN 25 in the U.S. to treat smaller cats. This follows the approval of DRAXXIN 25 label claims for pigs in July 2013. We also received additional label claims for the Fostera PRRS or vaccine for swine, which is now licensed in the U.S. for reproductive protection. This product was first approved for respiratory protection in 2012. 
Zoetis PEDv vaccine continued to expand geographically, receiving the permission to import and sell in Canada. Zoetis also launches vaccine in Huinan, China, which broadens our range of vaccines in the world's largest swine market. As I mentioned, we just close the purchase of Abbott Animal Health. This business is focused on the veterinarian surgical market. It will strengthen our pain and sedation product portfolio and expand our diagnostic business. This acquisition is aligned with our value creation strategy to enhance our portfolio. We are adding leading brands, and we believe Zoetis scale industry-leading field force and global presence will expand both the reach penetration of the new portfolio. 
Zoetis also invests in animal health innovation through research partnerships. We recently announced that Zoetis was chosen to meet a researcher team to develop digital technologies for improved swine health and production efficiency. Paul will address our 2015 guidance later in the call. But I would like to give you our perspective on the animal health industry and some factors that will drive Zoetis in 2015. 
The animal health industry is forecasted to grow in the 5% to 6% range operationally over the next 5 years, with a growth in any given year above or below this rate. Looking to 2015, we expect operational revenue growth for Zoetis to keep pace with or outpace the animal health market. We also expect adjusted net income to grow faster than revenue as we leverage our business model and continue to focus on improving net cost efficiencies. 
Now our perspective by species. The outlook for companion animal is positive. Increased pet ownership and higher pet treatment rates are driving growth in emerging markets, while specialty care is contributing to growth in more developed markets. For Zoetis, we will suspect that sales of APOQUEL will have a positive impact on growth in this segment. The outlook for livestock in 2015 is also positive. Producers will remain very profitable although at lower levels than in 2014. For Zoetis, our premium products will remain an important factor to protect the health and value of livestock animals. Underlying demand for animal health products have remained strong despite economic events such as slower growth in the GDP, significant movements in exchange rate, low oil prices or international trade developments. 
We are monitoring the current business environment and all around exchange rates, we don't see any significant impact on our business from these factors. As the past has shown, the animal health industry is resilient to these and other macroeconomic factors. Within the industry, Zoetis is highly diversified across many dimensions, and this diversity has allowed us to successfully manage it through many market conditions in the past. The drivers of growth in animal health remain unchanged. Animal proteins and companionship from pets are basic needs. So we are confident about the future of our prospects and our ability to grow under various market conditions. 
So I will now turn it over to Paul to talk about the results for the fourth quarter, the year and guidance for 2015."

I",2694,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm going to review our performance compared with our full year 2014 guidance, provide some color on the fourth quarter results and update you on our full year guidance for 2015. I hope to do all that quickly so that we have plenty of time for Q&A. So here we go. 
Starting with full year 2014 results. The big stories here are revenue, revenue growth and revenue growth from a variety of sources. In 2014, we delivered 7% operational growth in revenue, the second consecutive year of 7% operational growth and second consecutive year of growth above the long-term industry trend. Pretty good, right? 
Even better, in the fourth quarter, we delivered 9% operational growth versus Q4 of 2013, overcoming some significant FX headwinds to post 5% reported growth with positive operational trends that are heading right into 2015. Changes in FX rates reduced our Q4 reported growth rate, but we were able to overcome that and still put a solid number on the board. Good stuff, indeed. Since mid-November, FX rates have continued to move against us. I'll help you think about the impact of FX rates on 2015 in a minute. 
Now for a look at our full year performance versus guidance. As you can see on the webcast slides, our revenue of $4.8 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. The operating growth of 7% was driven by 9% growth in livestock and 4% in companion animal. On a regional basis, the U.S. accounted for almost half of our growth, up 8% compared with 2013. CLAR accounted for about 1/3 of our operational growth, up 13%. APAC was about 11% of our operational growth, up 5%. And EuAfME accounted for about 8% of our operational growth, it was up 2% versus 2013. If we're going to bout, all growth rates are on an operational basis. 
Continuing with our 2014 performance compared with our guidance. Our adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue was 35.1%, a bit better than our guidance of 35.5%, and that's primarily due to the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A, meanwhile, was $1.507 billion for the full year, approximately $27 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. There were a number of factors that contributed to the increased SG&A above expectations. 
First, as we trended above our revenue forecast to the latter part of the quarter, we saw an increase in costs associated with higher revenues such as sales incentive compensation and distribution expenses. We also authorized the additional promotional spending in the quarter, spending that is expected to support revenue growth into 2015. Next, we accelerated some actions in Q4 that triggered additional G&A expense in the quarter including, for example, severance, software license expense and some additional business development expenses. 
As successful as we've been in driving our top line, we're still a young company just finishing up our second year on our own. We have plenty of work remaining to build and fine-tune our G&A organizations and the systems needed to support our global business model. As that process continues, there will be opportunities to move forward and towards a more efficient cost structure. 
In other items, adjusted R&D expense came in at $393 million, in line with our full year guidance. This continues to be an essential investment for both developing new products and managing the lifecycle of the more than 300 product lines that provide us with our durable and growing revenue streams. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was almost 27% and 18% in the fourth quarter. This reflected the full year impact of the R&D tax credit which, you will recall, was not anticipated in our guidance. Also contributing to the lower-than-expected tax rate was a resolution of prior tax matters and changes in the mix of our earnings. It's important to know that the elements that drove the rate down below our and your expectations were not structural, and we continue to expect that our tax rate in 2015 will be approximately 29%. As with our 2014 guidance, our tax rate guidance for 2015 does not include the potential benefit of an extension of the R&D tax credit. 
We exceeded the top end of our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 a share, posting $1.57 per share for the full year. This was due to the strong revenues and the lower-than-expected tax rate, offset in part by increased spending in the fourth quarter. And finally, we exceeded our range on certain significant items and acquisition-related costs for 2014. This will yield result costs associated with certain shareholder activities and some changes associated with our global manufacturing organizations. As a result, our reported diluted EPS came in at $1.16, the lower end of our guidance range. 
Now let me switch gears and dive a bit more into the fourth quarter results. You can see our income statement and adjusted income statement slides on our webcast. Repeating from my opening remarks, fourth quarter revenue grew 9% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. And while 9 minus 5 equals 4, there's some rounding in there so the negative impact of currency movements on our growth rate was roughly 330 basis points. Our U.S. and core segments demonstrated strong double-digit sales growth leading the way for Zoetis, while the APAC segment grew more modestly and EuAfME declined 1% on an operational basis. 
On the last call, I talked about the hazards of reading too much into any one quarter in isolation. EuAfME illustrates that point. In Q1, revenue was down 4% operationally and in Q2, revenue was up 4% operationally. In Q3, it was up 12% operationally, and in Q4 it declined 1%. But for the year, operational growth for EuAfME was about 2%, broadly in line with the long-term expected growth rate for that segment. 
Moving to SG&A. Our adjusted SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 14% operationally due to the timing of promotional spending and other items that I called out earlier in my discussion of the full year. Our adjusted R&D expense was up 4% operationally in the quarter. R&D, as I have noted before, can vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of clinical trials and other factors. For the full year, we performed in line with our guidance. 
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, our tax rate in the quarter was 18% due to a number of factors that got worked out in the fourth quarter. We also have a full set of regional tables and quarterly commentaries in the press release and webcast slides. With that material available to you, let me just highlight a few takeaways on the revenue and profitability for each segment. 
Beginning with the U.S. Fourth quarter revenue increased 14% driven by very strong livestock sales which were up 19%. A truly stellar quarter for the largest segment of our business. The growth in livestock products, especially cattle in the United States, was based on the higher demand for our premium products as producers continue to benefit from strong market conditions, some of which Juan Ramón just touched on. In companion animal products in the U.S., we generated growth of 7% driven by APOQUEL and other key brands, and despite continued competition for Rimadyl and competitive pressure in vaccines and parasiticides. Based on the U.S. segment strong sales and more relative expense growth, their segment earnings increased by 20%. 
In Europe/Africa/Middle East, revenue decreased 1% on our operational basis compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This was a result of revenue increases in southern Europe and Germany driven by livestock as well as APOQUEL's sales in the U.K. and Germany, with those increases more than offset by declines in other markets such as France and Russia. In France, we had anticipated some softness in the fourth quarter based on the fact that customers bought large amounts of anti-infectives in the third quarter and had a more restrictive legislative changes that went into effect January 1. The EuAfME segment earnings decreased by 4% operationally in the quarter, primarily due to the declines in revenue and the timing of promotional spending. 
Moving to CLAR, which is our Canada and Latin American segment. We generated an increase of 16% operationally compared with the fourth quarter 2013. Brazil and Canada are the principal drivers in the CLAR region given their relative size and we saw growth in both livestock and companion animal products in these 2 countries. In Canada, we saw a significant cattle product sales due to strong market conditions for producers. Increased medicalization rates for companion animals in Brazil have been a driver of growth there, as well. We also saw strong growth in Venezuela and other emerging markets in Central and South America. These high inflationary markets support attractive growth opportunities but need to be carefully monitored. The CLAR segment earnings increased 20% on an operational basis driven by the revenue growth and limited growth on operating expenses. 
Finally, in Asia Pacific, we had an increase of 4% operationally compared to the fourth quarter 2013. Sales of livestock products did well, particularly in Australia, Southeast Asia and across-the-board in emerging markets. A growing vaccine portfolio for swine and new parasiticide products continued to drive our performance there. Sales of companion animal products, however, declined 6% operationally, primarily due to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan that we talked about last quarter. The APAC segment operating earnings increased 6% operationally due to the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses. 
Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2015, which we first provided at our Investor Day in mid-November. We're updating certain elements of our full year guidance today to reflect 3 things. First, effect over which we have no control and FX rates. We're adjusting our guidance based on the changes in foreign currency exchange rates from mid-November, when we first reported our guidance for 2015, to reflect rates as of late January. In those roughly 70 days, the U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all of the major currencies in which we transact. For emphasis, and in round numbers, the dollar was up 9% versus the euro, 8% versus the Canadian dollar, 8% versus the Aussie dollar, 4% versus the British pound, 1% against the Japanese yen, and against the Brazilian real, it was flat. Those are our top 6 currencies. 
The movement in the exchange rates since mid-November reduced our revenue expectations for the full year 2015 by $125 million or 255 basis points based on the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We now expect the full year impact of FX to be about 600 basis points or almost $300 million on a full year 2015 revenue as compared with our 2014 actual results. I want to repeat that for emphasis. Since mid-November, the change in FX rate reduced our expectations for the full year 2015 by 255 basis points or $125 million. Comparing our revised expectations for 2015 back to 2014 actual results, the changes in FX rates account for a 600 basis point reduction on our expected growth rate. 
So natural hedging from expenses denominated in foreign currencies reduces the dollar impact of the movements in FX at adjusted net income, where the negative impact of the change rate was roughly $30 million or roughly 360 basis points down from the midpoint of our initial guidance range. Something for you to be aware of. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against our major currencies, that can put upward pressure on our effective tax rate. 
At this point, we are affirming our guidance for our tax rate at approximately 29%, not including the R&D tax credit. But for emphasis, I'm going to repeat something I just said. Continued strength in the U.S. dollar could cause us to have to revisit that guidance. So that's another part we can monitor but don't control. 
The part we can control are our operating expenses in 2015. In addition to the expense reductions driven by the change in FX rates, we revised downward our range of expectations for SG&A expenses by an additional $35 million. This reflects targeted reductions in spending intended to help offset the FX impact on 2015 adjusted net income. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health this week. With that done now, we'll begin integration and expect a positive impact of approximately $75 million to revenue for our full year 2015 results, an accretion of $0.01 per share to adjusted diluted EPS for the full year 2015. 
Taking the FX rate changes and our reduction of expected SG&A into account as well as the added transaction, our revised guidance calls for revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and results in our holding our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. The net $50 million reduction in the revenue range represents a roughly $125 million or 2.5% decrease, driven by the change in the FX rates. Meanwhile, the combination of the natural FX hedges inherent in our business and our targeted $35 million of OpEx reductions, and the overall impact of Abbott, all those things combined enabled us to maintain our earlier adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2015. 
While we provided our guidance in November, we expressed growth targets based on the midpoints of our 2014 guidance ranges. With 2014 now final, it's worth refreshing the growth rates implied by our guidance. With the more significant revenue base that we delivered in 2014, and our guidance as revised today to include Abbott and the expected expense reductions, we are expecting revenue growth on an operational basis in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% and growth of adjusted net income in the range of 11% to 16%. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. 
While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, I'll remind you of a comment I made at our Investor Day in November about the trajectory of our overall performance in 2015. We still expect the year to start low and end high. A key driver of our growth in 2015 will be the additional supply of APOQUEL, but we will not see that supply increase until Q2. I also want to note that the revenue impact of the Abbott acquisition in Q1 is nominal, less than $5 million. And that there will be a negative impact on recorded Q1 results based on the changes in FX rates since my comments in November. 
So to sum up the quarter and the year. We continue with very strong revenue and earnings growth demonstrating the strength of our global business model. The diversity of our business across species, product lines, geographies, and therapeutic areas is one of our core strengths. Our global footprint enables us to overcome weaknesses in some regions and deliver consistent revenue and earnings growth. We demonstrated this ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional statements, while continuing to absorb some of the impact of the buildup on cost for our corporate functions. 
Foreign currency was a significant factor on our reported results in the quarter and for the year, and we have updated our full year 2015 guidance based on the rates in effect as of late January 2015. We expect to deliver strong revenue and profit growth on an operational basis in 2015, 6.5% to 8.5% for revenue and 11% to 16% for adjusted net income. While the currency headwinds are expected to be a drag on our reported results and growth rates, we have taken steps to mitigate some of those impacts and we'll continue to pursue means of protecting and growing our adjusted net income throughout the year. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line for your questions. Operator?"

I will take a stab at that and Juan Ramón may want to come in as well. We -- Louise asked a question earlier on about margin expansion and I just want to point out that, so far, we've done a pretty good job over the course of the last several years. If you had looked at our reported operating margin going back to 2011 and up to '14, I mean, it's been a nice progression from sort of 18 to 21 to 24 to circa 25, and that was broadly by rolling the top line while having some expense discipline meaning, holding the line on expenses. Now a wise man once said to me, said it's not all that impressive to grow into and expanding margin. But I'd say, it may not be impressive but it is a good thing. Now that said, that sort of sets the stage. Even with respect to thinking about our 2015, we saw some headwinds in FX and we took some actions with respect to our operating expenses in order to be able to, as best we could, without impacting our business model, reduce our expected operating expenses for 2015. The areas where we have most likely to have long-term opportunity are those areas that are away from revenue production and R&D and manufacturing. And manufacturing will be more efficient to that process and we would hope to disclose to the market at some point here in the future. The area really is around those what we call enabling functions in G&A. We are still in the process of our standup. I know that it is frustrating to a lot of people where we just really completed our second year on our own, and we continue to have challenges in implementing systems and building out the infrastructure that will enable us to grow, control and manage what is a very complicated global business. As we make progress along the lines of the implementation, for example, of our global ERP package SAP, it will give us opportunities to be more efficient in our enabling functions. Now we look at all types of expenses. And I say, and I do say it constantly in investor meetings, we can always do better. So we want to look at ways that we can deploy our capital within our business to the areas where we think we'll get the most bang for our buck. And to the extent that we are successful in doing that over the next several years, we expect that we can expand our operating margin potentially beyond what you would be or what would be implied by our current long-term guidance. And to refresh what -- for everybody, what we said on Investor Day was you look out to 2015, '16 and '17 based on what you have in front of you. If you have a company that can grow from now a roughly 25% operating margin and add 500 basis points to that by growing revenues and being disciplined with respect to expense. To the extent we see opportunities to be more efficient, that would certainly be additive to that."

So there -- I wouldn't describe the items in there as so much as onetime. This is the ones that are within our adjusted SG&A. They were expenses that, in large part, were managed by us in the quarter and reflect sort of a robust revenue quarter for us and looking ahead to 2015. Thinking about the SG&A for 2015 full year, we did reduce the range by some $35 million. I mean, no, it does not reflect any sort of a restructuring or anything. I think if it did, evidence of that is, if it had been a restructuring, we probably would have called out in onetime costs and certain significant items restructuring charge. This was, what I'll call, a normal course of business. Looking at 2015, looking at where we are relative to where we want to be and us taking actions around categories that we do not think will influence that top line. So by definition, away from revenue generation, mainly in enabling type functions. I hope that answers the question."

And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning. Paul will then walk you through our results for the quarter and discuss the financial impact of the operational efficiency program, including an update to guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. 
During the first quarter, we generated operational growth of 6% in revenue and 14% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 per share. During the quarter, half of our operational growth or 3% [ph] was attributed to price. [indiscernible] such as ACTOGAIN, programs from Abbott Animal Health accounted for 2% while [indiscernible] contributed to 1% of revenue growth for the quarter. As a note, all the following growth rates that I will discuss are operational. In livestock, we grew 7% to $715 million with all species contributing to growth. Cattle revenue grew 7% to $397 million with the favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil, driving growth across the portfolio, while weather and the [indiscernible] health science relate to declines in Australia and New Zealand. Swine revenue, which grew 13% to $170 million even from increases our size in the U.S. after a winter of a lower piglet mortality from PEDv plus positive industry momentum in the CLAR region. Poultry revenue grew 1% to $129 million as the U.S. the introduction of [indiscernible], a medicated feed additive helped offset a negative impact from the timing of [indiscernible] rotations in several countries. 
Turning to animal health, companion animal health. Revenues grew 4% to $377 million due to the continued performance of key brands and overall strong growth in China and Latin American markets. We closed on the purchase of Abbott Animal Health assets in early February. So sales of newly acquired Abbott products also contributed to results. They were recorded primarily in the U.S. where we have seen additional competition in the pain and [indiscernible] markets. These results continue to demonstrate the strength of the business model as defined by our 3 interconnected capabilities, the largest and most capable field force in the industry with direct customer interactions investing more in the ration than any other company and having the highest quality products and more reliable supply at a competitive cost. These 3 capabilities form an essential foundation for long-term success in animal health. Going forward, we are committed to investing in these capabilities but also seeing an opportunity to use them in more focused ways to enhance competitiveness and drive greater value for our customers and shareholders. 
Over the last 2 years since we become an independent company, we have delivered on our operating and financial targets, created to have shareholder value and continue to meet our customer needs while standing up and grow our company and infrastructure. We are certainly proud of what we have achieved. And as we transition out of our standup phase, we are focused on driving efficiency and reducing complexity that is a value to productivity. The program we announced today is a comprehensive plan that we designed to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate our resources. We entered this next stage building on solid business performance, and we'll emerge as a stronger, simpler and more cost-efficient organization. 
We expect to generate cost savings of $300 million in 2017 and see our adjusted EBIT margin improve from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve a greater focus on key brands and markets. We are fully aligned to achieve these goals and have the plans in place to incentivize our leaders to exceed these targets. These initiatives will allow us to derive additional value by taking full advantage of our scale. It will allow us to invest in the products, markets and infrastructure that will drive profitable growth and continued leadership in the animal health industry. 
There are several important reasons why we are indicating [ph] this program. First, after 2 years of separating from Pfizer, we now have full control of our operations among manufacturing and corporate systems and we have identified significant opportunities for improvement. Second, while the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint remain strength of our business, we have seen certain elements of our breadth generate complexity that is a value to delivering value to our customers and to generating long-term growth. Third, we are beginning to see the benefits of implementing our ERP system. The resulting standardization and potential to simplify our business through our new ERP system will allow us to increase productivity and streamline operations. And finally, we remain focused on growing revenues and finding the most productive ways to allocate resources, investments and business development activities. 
We have 3 main objectives for this operational efficiency initiative. First, we want to reduce complexity that does not add value for our customers and our business. Second, we want to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency. And third, we want better position for Zoetis long-term profitable growth. We will deliver our first objective to reduce complexity by enhancing our focus on products, markets and manufacturing plants that are most important to our future. We will eliminate approximately 5,000 lower revenue and lower margin products to use out of a total of 13,000. This will drive higher focus and more reliable supply of our products and services. We'll enhance our manufacturing operations and accelerate the implementation of our supply network study. We plan to sell or exit about 10 manufacturing sites over the long term. 
Reflecting the strategic importance of manufacturing to our business model, Roman [ph] [indiscernible] president of global manufacturing and supply, will now report direct lead to me as part of the executive team. We will change our selling approach in approximately 30 markets by shifting to a new [indiscernible] or reducing our presence in certain countries. We reduced the number of regional report in the segments from 4 to 2, the U.S. and international. We expect these changes to result in greater decision-making authority closer to the customers while leveraging our scale through efficiency and deliver marketing and other operational support. The U.S. region will be led by Christine Pegg and the international region will be led by Dana Lewis. Both are current members of our executive team and will continue reporting to me. 
To deliver on our second objective, to optimize resource allocation and efficiency, we will take the following actions. We will leverage the efficiency and standardization of our newly implemented ERP system to significantly reduce general and administrative costs in corporate functions. In addition to the ERP benefits, another important efficiency driver will be a reduction of [indiscernible] layers and increase span of control through the organization. We'll improve our ability to be more dynamic and agile in responding to customer needs by shifting marketing resources closer to the customer and simplifying all areas of noncustomer-facing commercial infrastructure. And we will enhance our R&D focus to support a smaller portfolio of products as well as better prioritize the R&D portfolio to invest in price with the highest returns. 
In the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to improve our operations and be more efficient. In 2009, we achieved a successful transformation when we became the first [ph] largest animal health business to several acquisitions. Then, in 2013, we became a large global independent company followed by 2 consecutive years of industry-leading performance. So each of these changes we have made ourselves better, improve how we serve customers and create new and greater value to our shareholders. I'm confident that the comprehensive plan we have announced today will allow us to transform again, building on our successful business model to deliver high-quality profitable revenue growth and becoming a more competitive company. 
These are significant initiatives that will drive us to be a more focused and streamlined company. As a result, we'll see a reduction in the number of positions and Zoetis of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 over the next 12 to 18 months subject to any consultation with work consoles and unions in certain markets. With the implementation of these initiatives, we will better align Zoetis resources and operating structure with our 3 interconnected capabilities: supply products, more reliable and competitive cost; increased capacity to invest in future business drivers; and finally, tailor the [indiscernible] portfolio and improve efficiency of the operating model so we can pursue then next horizon of opportunity as a world leader with a single focus on animal health. So this process will be more competitive and better positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth. 
Before Paul call on the financial details, I would like to thank all our colleagues who have contributed to our success to an environment of intense change. Our next set of information will be key to supporting our future success, and I know that we have the capabilities and the team to implement these significant changes. Paul?"

We have lots of things to talk about on this call as we just revealed our plans to improve the efficiency of our operating model.

We have lots of things to talk about on this call as we just revealed our plans to improve the efficiency of our operating model. But before we get to that, I don't want us to lose sight of the terrific quarter that we just put on the board, so let's get started. 
As you remember, our fourth quarter 2014 featured strong operational growth and we're able to carry that momentum forward into Q1 of 2015 to give us a good start to the year. We delivered on our primary value drivers posting revenue and adjusted net income growth on an operational basis of 6% and 14%, respectively, pretty good, right? 
Like other U.S. multinational companies, FX rates had a major impact on our reported results. On a reported basis, FX rates decreased our reported revenue by $58 million, resulting in a reported revenue growth being flat with Q1 of 2014. The impact on our adjusted net income was $16 million and so reduced our growth in adjusted net income of from 14% on an operational basis to 8% on a reported basis. So FX impacts our top line by some 600 basis points and adjusted net income by 600 basis points. I said this before and I'll say it again today, we can't control FX rates. We manage our bills on an operational basis, and on that basis, we're continuing to deliver strong fundamental growth in revenue and profits. 
You can read about the regional segment results in the press release and tables, so I won't spend too much time on them here, but I do want to cover a few highlights. The U.S. continued to perform very well, up 9% versus Q1 of '14, with strong livestock performance, which was up 14%. We continue to gain share in U.S. livestock segment, especially cattle based on producers' confidence in the reliability of our products to protect their investment in their animals. In companion animal, which was up 3%, we anticipate even more positive results through the balance of the year as we now have increased supply for APOQUEL. CLAR also continues performing well, with revenue up 13% on an operating basis, and that's driven by Brazil and other emerging markets. Later, when I talk about our go forward plans to streamline and adjust our global footprint, I'll speak to our plan to deemphasize our efforts in Venezuela where the business and economic climates are becoming more challenging. 
In APAC, were we posted 1% operating growth in revenue, we're seeing good performance in emerging markets like China but [indiscernible] conditions in developed markets, including Australia and New Zealand are having an impact. In EuAfME, where revenue was flat compared with Q1 of 2014, the takeaway is that good performance on our key brands in companion animal are being offset by declines in anti-infectives, primarily due to legislative changes in France. 
Now let me turn to what I will call our operational efficiency initiative. This initiative is a natural next step in the evolution of our company as a stand-alone entity with a singular focus on animal health. While we enjoy an enviable position in animal health today, our current product portfolio, footprint and organization came about ways that were to some extent unplanned. The makeup of our partner portfolio was heavily influenced by human health acquisitions made by Pfizer that had animal health components. These are very important building our scale and portfolio, but the animal health assets were not the focus of those deals. And while we spend a lot of time and energy standing up on our own organization and building our own culture, we quite naturally carried across organization designs, processes and practices that work well when we were a division of Pfizer but may not represent the best options for a pure play animal health company. Said another way, it does [indiscernible] that we serendipitously came upon the best possible structure and organization to maximize our opportunity in the animal health industry. 
Our first priority over the last few years has been to build out the functions that we need to support our business on a stand-alone basis. We had to establish our supply chain, build our own IP  infrastructure and put in place the G&A functions like finance, HR and legal to support a global public company. While we did that, we elected to lead our commercial and R&D organizations largely as is to minimize the impact of our standup on our customers and on our business. I think our track record of revenue and profit growth over the last 2 years and so far into 2015 support the wisdom of that approach. But now with the completion of the standup activities in sight, it's time to look at the entirety of our current state and take steps to improve the design and efficiency of our company. Importantly, we are not questioning the fundamental elements of our business model. Our model relies on what we refer to as our 3 interconnected capabilities: one, face-to-face interaction with our customers to drive revenue; two, investment and product innovation to sustaining our revenue base and our growth prospects; and three, the ability to meet our customers' demand for quality products. These capabilities form the basis of our competitive advantage of the global animal health industry and changes to these areas will fall into the category of continuous improvement, not major changes. 
The bulk of our future cost savings will not impact these areas. Our field force, the personnel in the front lines with our customers, will remain largely intact. The scope of our activities in R&D will also remain substantially the same, and we will continue to invest in programs to build and improve our supply chain. 
Let me separate the 2015 program into 2 parts as I see them and then add on the previously announced supply network strategy to think about 3 areas of focus. Part 1 is what I'll call rationalizing our footprint. Part 2 is driving improved efficiency and our operating expenses and Part 3 is streamlining and improving the efficiency of our supply chain. 
Starting with rationalizing our footprint. This work included a review of a number of SKUs that make up our product portfolio, consideration of moving to indirect sales models in a number of markets where we currently have a direct presence and evaluations of markets where we might choose to reduce our efforts. The headline here is that we will be eliminating nearly 40% of our total SKUs. These SKUs create significant complexity across multiple functions within our company. Of course, this will reduce our revenue and growth profits in the near term, but it will enable us to substantially improve the efficiency of our operations from our supply chain and sales support to G&A expenses and the product maintenance costs as part of our R&D. With a leading portfolio comprised of our more profitable product assets, we will have a better growth prospects. 
We also intend to move from direct sales models to indirect distributor models in certain countries and reduce our efforts or exit some markets. When complete, the streamlining of our portfolio and global footprint will reduce our expected 2017 sales by some $280 million and gross profit by about $100 million. For the [indiscernible] those numbers are based on current FX rates. The estimated revenue and gross profit impacts are reflected in our revised guidance for 2016 and 2017. 
Part 2 of the initiative is driving improved efficiency within our SG&A expenses and our investment in R&D. We're collapsing from 4 regions to 2 as we go forward. We're reorganizing the support for countries, including enabling functions, like finance, IT, HR and legal but also the noncustomer-facing resources that support our field sales forces. We're taking steps to improve the focus of our R&D activities, supporting a smaller portfolio of products, identifying greater efficiency on our regulatory practices and better prioritizing our R&D spend. And yes, our expected spend for customer-facing resources will be less as well, mainly driven by the reduction in the number of markets where we'll have a direct presence and the deemphasis of certain other markets but also through improvements in efficiency. 
In total, by calendar 2017, we, expect our total operating expenses, that is the sum of SG&A plus R&D, to be roughly $300 million less than it would have been before this initiative. As I said just a moment ago, we are not changing our business model here and that is reflected in the way you should think about the sources of the $300 million of future savings. Roughly 1/3 is expected to come from reduced G&A and another 1/3 from commercial resources that are not customer-facing. That's roughly 2/3 of the expected savings coming from areas that should not impact our ability to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth. Of the remaining cost savings, about 10% is expected to come from improvements in efficiency within our R&D organization. About 5% is expected to come from the reduction of our field resources tied to our revise global footprint and reduced emphasis in some emerging markets, and the balance of the cost savings is expected to come from reducing complexity and increasing efficiency in other areas. 
The third and final piece of the initiative is the supply network strategy that Kristin Peck outlined at our Investor Day last November. Most of the benefits of that will be realized after 2017. So for now let's set the supply network strategy aside and focus on the activities that will impact our results in the period from 2015 to 2017, but keep in mind that the supply network strategy initiative is expected to add some 200 basis points to our gross margin by 2020 on top of the improvements driven by the 2015 initiative. 
You've heard me say this many times in the past that when we're looking at our operating efficiency, there are opportunities for us to do better. Today we back those words up, providing you with a framework of our plans to improve the operating performance of Zoetis while preserving the key elements of our value proposition. In our 2b state in calendar 2017, we'll be an even better company than we are today, more profitable on a slightly lower revenue base, positioned to deliver but it was for a more focused product portfolio and working off of a leaner cost structure that can be leveraged to support revenue and profit growth over the long term. After completing the change we're announcing today, we'll still be the leader in the animal health and we will continue to be the biggest investor in innovation in animal health and we will continue to have the largest direct sales network in the industry. Our improved efficiency will provide us with more flexibility to allocate resources where we can best serve our customers' needs and to further distance ourselves from the competition. 
The efficiency initiative adds an estimated $200 million to our expectations for pretax earnings in 2017, driven by the $300 million in operating expense savings offset in part by the $100 million of projected decrease in gross profit attributable to the streamlining of our product portfolio and the rationalizing of our global footprint. This initiative adds roughly $0.28 to our prior estimate of 2017 adjusted net income per share. So some remains the same, only better. we're a company that can grow its rebased revenues in line or faster than the mid-single digit growth of our markets while holding the growth that our leaned-out operating expenses to the inflation rate and thereby delivering long-term profit growth greater than our revenue growth, and that's off of a higher profit base and that's a winner. 
Of course, the improvements in our future financial model don't come free. So I want to take a few minutes to talk about one-time cost generally and to specifically address the cost associated with the efficiency initiative. First, it's important for you to know that we have a high standard when it comes to cost what we would characterize as one time and, therefore, excluded from adjusted net income. Our policy [indiscernible] are purchase accounting acquisition-related costs and certain significant items that we evaluate on an individual basis. These include direct and incremental cost required to complete the standup of the company and those direct cost that we will incur to execute our efficiency plant. 
Next, we want to be transparent about the amount and nature of these costs, so our intention is to provide disclosure of our one-time cost in 3 buckets. the buckets of standup costs and other one-time costs that you're already familiar with, a new bucket for the efficiency initiative that we announced today; a third bucket for the cost associated with the longer-term elements of the supply network strategy. We estimate our remaining pretax standup and other one-time costs at $180 million to $210 million with those costs to be recorded primarily in the remainder of 2015 and through 2017. These are primarily all cash costs. 
We estimate the one-time pretax cash costs associated with the efficiency initiative to be in the range of $340 million to $400 million and to be included in 2015, 2016 and some [indiscernible] portion moving into 2017. We expect actual cash payouts to occur over the next few years. Note that they will also be noncash charges triggered by this initiative. We are not providing an estimate of these charges as both the amounts and timing could vary widely. As we include these noncash charges, we'll call them out for you when recognized. 
Finally, the supply network strategy one-time pretax cash costs are currently estimated at $60 million to $100 million and are expected to be incurred over the term of the plan. It's worth noting that we are still in the early phases of architecting the supply network strategy and the final one-time cost for this activity could be substantially differ depending on the final outcome of our ongoing analysis of our supply network and the timing or nature of any specific site exits. There will also be noncash charges triggered by the supply network strategy, and we will call those out to you when recognized. Note that the estimates are one time pretax costs for both the efficiency initiative and the supply network strategy ignoring the possible proceeds that we may receive from the sale of certain assets, which could potentially offset some of the one-time cash costs. We provided a webcast slide that summarizes our current estimates of the one-time pretax cash costs associated with each of the 3 buckets over the period of 2015 through 2017. We will refresh our view of the various buckets of one-time cost as appropriate. 
I want to call your attention now to an unrelated change to our go-forward outlook, and that's our decision to decrease our activities in Venezuela. The animal health industry in Venezuela features solid underlying fundamentals and our business there has performed well. However, these economic developments necessitate an evaluation of our efforts there. While our business in Venezuela is profitable, it has become increasingly difficult to realize those profits in U.S. dollars. Unless we [indiscernible] that environment changes, sales and profits there will drive low quality earnings, so we're significantly carrying back our activities there. To be clear, Venezuela is a solid local market and we will maintain the presence there as we believe that the environment will improve over time. However, in the interim, we believe it's prudent to reduce our activities and exposure there. The decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela impacts our revenue and profit expectations for 2015, '16 and '17. The impact on 2015 can be seen [indiscernible] to our press release that [indiscernible] from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. We've also provided a slide on the webcast that shows the impact of Venezuela on 2017, which decreases our expectations for adjusted net income in 2017 by $0.07 per share. 
Now let me provide an update on our guidance for full year 2015 in light of the changes in FX rates since our last guidance update, the anticipated impacts of the efficiency program and our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. I also want to update you on our expectation for 2016 and '17 and to provide you more detail about those years. We felt it was important to say more about 2016 and '17 as there are a lot of moving parts here, and we want you to have a clear picture of our expectations. 
First, 2015 full year guidance. In our press release and in the webcast slide, we provided a bridge from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. The headline is that despite the continued headwinds from changes in FX rates and our decision to reduce our business in Venezuela, we're holding our guidance for adjusted net income per share for 2015 in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. This includes pluses and minuses. FX is a minus again. This change in FX rates from late January underlying our last updated guidance from late April decreased our revenue expectation for 2015 by some $75 million or 155 basis points while the impact on adjusted net income was much less, only about $5 million or 60 basis points. Then our decision to pare back our efforts in Venezuela reduces our revenue expectations by $50 million, operating expenses by $5 million and decreased our expectations for adjusted net income by $25 million. 
Finally the big plus. That's the impact of the efficiency initiative, which reduced our expectations for operating incentive expenses by $45 million compared with our prior guidance and increased our expected adjusted net income by $30 million. So when the dust settles, we expect our reported revenue to be down by $125 million from our prior guidance range and our adjusted net income to be consistent with our prior guidance, $1.61 to $1.68 per share. 
It's worth pointing out that we decreased our 2015 guidance for revenue growth on an operational basis by 100 basis points to the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The reduction in the growth rate is due to the expected reduction in sales in Venezuela. We translate Venezuela revenues at the fixed official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 to the dollar, so the $30 [ph] million expected reduction in revenue [indiscernible] the operational growth rate. And the adjusted net income operational growth rate is estimated to increase 1% as a contribution from our efficiency program should more than offset the impact of Venezuela. 
Turning to 2016 and '17. We provided a lot of detail for you so that you can recalibrate your expectations for us through 2017. As you can see how this longer-term guidance compares with your prior expectations, I submit that you must first revise your prior expectations to reflect the change to FX rates. To help you do that, the change in FX rates from late January to late April should reduce your 2016 and 2017 revenue expectations by roughly 215 -- excuse me, 215, 2 1 5, 215 basis points cost of goods sold by 260, 2 6 0 basis points and operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D by 170 basis points with the result being a roughly 235 basis point decrease in projected adjusted net income driven by the changes in FX rates. Using that rebased forecast in comparison with our revised guidance for 2016 and '17 will enable you to isolate and evaluate the impacts of the 2015 efficiency initiative together with our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. In a nutshell, and looking at 2017, when the full benefits of our efficiency initiative are expected to be realized, the efficiency initiative increases our expectations for 2017 pretax income by roughly $200 million. Meanwhile, the Venezuela action reduces our pretax expectations by $55 million. Net, we add $145 million to our pretax expectations for 2017, roughly $100 million in adjusted net income or $0.20 per share. As Juan Ramón mentioned, the steps we are taking over the next several years are expected to enable us to improve our EBIT margin by some 500 basis points in 2017 to circa 34%. 
Here are a few other factors for you to consider. Our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. We expect a slightly higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year of 2015 higher than 27% [ph] that we had in the fourth quarter of 2015. The operating expense benefits that we are seeking will begin to be most evident in Q4, and our guidance assumes a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. This includes share repurchases totaling an estimated $100 million in the first half of 2015, which are partially offset by actual and projected dilution related to employees' equity-based compensation. We also assumed a corporate level of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2016 and '17 as we intend for our share repurchase program to at least offset projected dilution from future employee compensation programs, including the acceleration impacts of our operational efficiency initiative. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. 
Finally, we covered a lot of ground on this call. To assist with clear communications, as John said, we will be posting copies of Juan Ramón's and my scripts to our Investor Relations website following this call. That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open up the line for your questions. Operator?"

We're not providing -- we provided an awful lot of detail on the operating side here through 2017. We're not, at this time, providing a forecast of cash flow in our balance sheet, but suffice it to say that we talked in the past about our desire to improve our asset efficiency. For example, through the implementation of our global ERP system SAP, we expect that over time we'll be able to reduce our investment area for you and unlock some cash there. Frankly, by pairing down our business and pooling with portfolio with the SKUs, that will unlock some cash as cash as well. We do have an awful lot of calls on our cash here coming up in the very near term. I mean if you think about it in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. We do continue to use cash to fund the one-time costs associated with our separation from Pfizer, and we provided an estimate of the remaining amount of that to be somewhere in the range of $180 million to $210 million. We provided you with an estimate of cost of the efficiency initiative that we announced today and the early stages of our supplier network strategy, and those costs are estimated in the range of $300 million or $400 million to $500 million over the next several years. And we have called out for you the $400 million debt maturity coming up next spring and then we have our regular dividend coming up. So we do have some sizable calls on our cash. We have actually provided you also with some guidance, a little bit of guidance at this stage around our share repurchases. We indicated that we expect to purchase in aggregate $100 million worth of shares over the first half of 2015 and that we can expect to continue acquiring shares in [indiscernible] that will at least offset the ongoing dilution from our equity-based compensation plans. And I said in the past, I'll say it again. The share repurchase will be an ongoing part of our plans for our capital allocation. I think of it as share purchase activity that underlies our 2017 guidance as a baseline for that activity. As we generate either free cash or debt capacity, we'll adjust our plans there as appropriate. Did I cover all? Sorry, the deleveraging question as well. We have stated in the past that we have kind of a notional, when we talk about our capital structure, a notional floor of gross debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA of 2.5x. So while we reiterate that there is a permanent role for debt in our capital structure, and when we think about that cap structure, we remain committed to be responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital and our hierarchy for that capital allocation will be first and foremost inside our business; second for business development activity that is value-generative; and lastly, the transaction and shareholders including both the regular dividend and the ongoing share repurchases. So again, taking that 2.5x as a floor and think of our higher capital allocation as I outlined it for you. I hope I answered your question."

We have extremely successful in identifying these opportunities, and APOQUEL is a good example, but also our progress on bringing back vaccines to the market like PEDv vaccine and many others vaccines that we have been introducing is a good example of being focused identifying these opportunities. It's a great opportunity for us like this. We will remain doing that and we are not changing our approach in R&D, but we are trying to identify those projects that would generate the highest return to our company. In terms of CERENIA, we are working with the FDA. We are presenting all the information that the FDA is requesting, and we expect that the program will be launched in 2016."

In my remarks today, I will briefly comment on our performance for the quarter. And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning.

And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning. Paul will then walk you through our result for the quarter and discuss the financial impact of the operational efficiency program, including an update to guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. 
During the first quarter, we generated operational growth of 6% in revenue and 14% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 per share. During the quarter, half of our operational growth or 3% was attributed to price. New products, such as ACTOGAIN an acquired products from Abbott Animal Health, accounted for 2% while in-line products contributed to 1% of revenue growth for the quarter. 
As a note, all the following growth rates that I will discuss are operational. In livestock, we grew 7% to $715 million with all species contributing to growth. Cattle revenue grew 7% to $397 million with favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil driving growth across the portfolio, while weather and reduced herd size led to declines in Australia and New Zealand. Swine revenue, which grew 13% to $170 million, is benefiting from increased herd size in the U.S. after a winter of lower piglet mortality from PEDv plus positive industry momentum in the CLAR region. Poultry revenue grew 1% to $129 million as the U.S. reintroduction of Zoamix, a medicated feed additive, helped to offset a negative impact from the timing of product rotations in several countries. 
Turning to animal health -- companion animal health. Revenues grew 4% to $377 million due to the continued performance of key brands and overall strong growth in China and Latin American markets. We closed on the purchase of Abbott Animal Health assets in early February, so sales of newly acquired Abbott products also contributed to results. They were recorded primarily in the U.S. where we have seen additional competition in the pain and sedation markets. 
These results continue to demonstrate the strength of the business model as defined by our 3 interconnected capabilities: the largest and most capable field force in the industry with direct customer interactions, investing more innovation than any other company, and having the highest quality products and more reliable supply at a competitive cost. These 3 capabilities form an essential foundation for long-term success in animal health. Going forward, we are committed to investing in these capabilities but also see an opportunity to use them in more focused ways to enhance competitiveness and drive greater value for our customers and shareholders. 
Over the last 2 years since becoming an independent company, we have delivered on our operating and financial targets, created shareholder value and continue to meet our customer needs while standing up a new global company and infrastructure. We are certainly proud of what we have achieved. And as we transition out of our stand-up phase, we are focused on driving efficiency and reducing complexity that is a barrier to productivity. The program we announced today is a comprehensive plan that is designed to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources. We enter this next stage building on solid business performance, and we'll emerge as a stronger, simpler and more cost-efficient organization. 
We expect to generate cost savings of $300 million in 2017 and see our adjusted EBIT margin improve from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve a greater focus on key brands and markets. We are fully aligned to achieve these goals and have the plans in place to incentivize our leaders to exceed these targets. 
These initiatives will allow us to derive additional value by taking full advantage of our scale. It will allow us to invest in the products, markets and infrastructure that will drive profitable growth and continued leadership in the animal health industry. 
There are several important reasons why we are initiating this program. First, after 2 years of separating from Pfizer, we now have full control of our operations, manufacturing and corporate systems and we have identified significant opportunities for improvement. Second, while the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint remain strength of our business, we have seen certain elements of our breadth generate complexity that is a barrier to delivering value to our customers and to generating long-term growth. Third, we are beginning to see the benefits of implementing our ERP system. The resulting standardization and potential to simplify our business through our new ERP system will allow us to increase productivity and streamline operations. And finally, we remain focused on growing revenues and finding the most productive ways to allocate resources to internal investments and business development activities. 
We have 3 main objectives for this operational efficiency initiative. First, we want to reduce complexity that does not add value for our customers and our business. Second, we want to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency. And third, we want to better position Zoetis for long-term profitable growth. 
We'll deliver our first objective to reduce complexity by enhancing our focus on products, markets and manufacturing plants that are most important to our future. We'll eliminate approximately 5,000 lower-revenue and lower-margin product SKUs out of a total of 13,000. This will drive higher focus and more reliable supply of our products and services. 
We'll enhance our manufacturing operations and accelerate the implementation of our supply network strategy. We plan to sell or exit about 10 manufacturing sites over the long term. 
Reflecting the strategic importance of manufacturing to our business model, Roman Trawicki, President of Global Manufacturing and Supply, will now report directly to me as part of the executive team. We will change our selling approach in approximately 30 markets by shifting to an indirect sales model or reducing our presence in certain countries. 
We reduce the number of regional reporting segments from 4 to 2: the U.S. and International. We expect these changes to result in greater decision-making authority closer to the customers while leveraging our scale to efficiently deliver marketing and other operational support. The U.S. Region will be led by Kristin Peck and the International Region will be led by Clint Lewis. Both are current members of our executive team and will continue reporting to me. 
To deliver on our second objective, to optimize resource allocation and efficiency, we will take the following actions: We will leverage the efficiency and standardization of our newly implemented ERP system to significantly reduce general and administrative costs in corporate functions. In addition to the ERP benefits, another important efficiency driver will be a reduction of management layers and increased span of control through the organization. We'll improve our ability to be more dynamic and agile in responding to customer needs by shifting marketing resources closer to the customer and simplifying all areas of noncustomer-facing commercial infrastructure. And we'll enhance our R&D focus to support a smaller portfolio of products as well as better prioritize the R&D portfolio to invest in projects with the highest returns. 
In the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to improve our operations and be more efficient. In 2009, we achieved a successful transformation when we became the world's largest animal health business through several acquisitions. Then in 2013, we became a large, global independent company followed by 2 consecutive years of industry-leading performance. Through each of these changes we have made ourselves better, improve how we serve customers and create new and greater value to our stakeholders. I'm confident that the comprehensive plan we have announced today will allow us to transform again, building on our successful business model to deliver high-quality profitable revenue growth and becoming a more competitive company. 
These are significant initiatives that will drive us to be a more focused and streamlined company. As a result, we'll see a reduction in the number of positions and Zoetis of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 over the next 12 to 18 months, subject to any consultation with work councils and unions in certain markets. 
With the implementation of these initiatives, we will better align Zoetis' resources and operating structure with our 3 interconnected capabilities; supply products, more reliable and at a competitive cost; increase capacity to invest in future business drivers; and finally, tailor the product portfolio and improve efficiency of the operating model so we can pursue the next horizon of opportunity as a world leader with a single focus on animal health. Through this process, we'll be more competitive and better positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth. 
Before Paul cover the financial details, I would like to thank all our colleagues who have contributed to our success through an environment of intense change. Our next transformation will be key to supporting our future success, and I know that we have the capabilities and the team to implement these significant changes.

We have lots of important things to talk about on this call, as we just revealed our plans to improve the efficiency of our operating model. But before we get to that, I don't want us to lose sight of the terrific quarter that we just put on the board. So let's get started. 
As you'll remember, our fourth quarter of 2014 featured strong operational growth and we're able to carry that momentum forward into Q1 of 2015 and give us a good start to the year. We delivered on our primary value drivers posting revenue and adjusted net income growth on an operational basis of 6% and 14%, respectively. Pretty good, right? 
Like other U.S. multinational companies, FX rates had a major impact on our reported results. On a reported basis, FX rates decreased our reported revenue by $58 million, resulting in our reported revenue growth being flat with Q1 of 2014. The impact on our adjusted net income was $16 million and so reduced our growth in adjusted net income from 14% on an operational basis to 8% on a reported basis. So FX impacted our top line by some 600 basis points and adjusted net income by 600 basis points. 
I said this before and I'll say it again today, we can't control FX rates. We manage our business on an operational basis, and on that basis, we're continuing to deliver strong fundamental growth in revenue and profits. 
You can read about the regional segment results in the press release and tables, so I won't spend too much time on them here, but I do want to cover a few highlights. The U.S. continued to perform very well, up 9% versus Q1 of '14, with strong livestock performance, which was up 14%. We continue to gain share in the U.S. livestock segment, especially cattle based on producers' confidence in the reliability of our products to protect their investment in their animals. In companion animal, which was up 3%, we anticipate even more positive results through the balance of the year as we now have increased supply for APOQUEL. CLAR also continues performing well, with revenue up 13% on an operating basis, and that's driven by Brazil and other emerging markets. Later, when I talk about our go-forward plans to streamline and adjust our global footprint, I'll speak to our plans to deemphasize our efforts in Venezuela where the business and economic climates are becoming more challenging. 
In APAC, where we posted 1% operating growth in revenue, we're seeing good performance in emerging markets like China but drought conditions in developed markets, including Australia and New Zealand are having an impact. In EuAfME, where revenue was flat compared with Q1 of 2014, the takeaway is that good performance on our key brands in companion animal are being offset by declines in anti-infectives, primarily due to legislative changes in France. 
Now let me turn to what I will call our operational efficiency initiative. This initiative is a natural next step in the evolution of our company as a stand-alone entity with a singular focus on animal health. While we enjoy an enviable position in animal health today, our current product portfolio, footprint and organization came about in ways that were, to some extent, unplanned. The makeup of our partner portfolio was heavily influenced by human health acquisitions made by Pfizer that had animal health components. These were very important to building our scale and portfolio, but the animal health assets were not the focus of those deals. And while we spend a lot of time and energy standing up our own organization and building our own culture, we quite naturally carried across organizational designs, processes and practices that worked well when we were a division of Pfizer, but may not represent the best options for a pure-play animal health company. Said another way, it's doubtful that we serendipitously came upon the best possible structure and organization to maximize our opportunity in the animal health industry. 
Our first priority over the last few years has been to build out the functions that we need to support our business on a stand-alone basis. We had to establish our own supply chain, build our own IT infrastructure and put in place the G&A functions like finance, HR and legal to support a global public company. While we did that, we elected to leave our commercial and R&D organizations largely as is to minimize the impact of our stand-up on our customers and on our business. 
I think our track record of revenue and profit growth over the last 2 years and so far into 2015, support the wisdom of that approach. But now with the completion of the stand-up activities in sight, it's time to look at the entirety of our current state and take steps to improve the design and efficiency of our company. 
Importantly, we are not questioning the fundamental elements of our business model. Our model relies on what we refer to as our 3 interconnected capabilities: one, face-to-face interaction with our customers to drive revenue; two, investment in product innovation to sustain our revenue base and our growth prospects; and three, the ability to meet our customers' demand with quality products. These capabilities form the basis of our competitive advantage in the global animal health industry and changes to these areas will fall into the category of continuous improvement, not major changes. 
The bulk of our future cost savings will not impact these areas. Our field force, the personnel in the front lines with our customers, will remain largely intact. The scope of our activities in R&D will also remain substantially the same, and we will continue to invest in programs to build and improve our supply chain. 
Let me separate the 2015 program into 2 parts as I see them and then add on the previously announced supply network strategy to think about 3 areas of focus. Part 1 is what I'll call rationalizing our footprint, part 2 is driving improved efficiency in our operating expenses, and part 3 is streamlining and improving the efficiency of our supply chain. 
Starting with rationalizing our footprint. This work included a review of the number of SKUs that make up our product portfolio, consideration of moving to indirect sales models in a number of markets where we currently have a direct presence and evaluations of markets where we might choose to reduce our efforts. The headline here is that we will be eliminating nearly 40% of our total SKUs. These SKUs create significant complexity across multiple functions within our company. Of course, this will reduce our revenue and growth profits in the near term, but it will enable us to substantially improve the efficiency of our operations, from our supply chain and sales support, to G&A expenses and the product maintenance costs that are part of our R&D. With a leaner portfolio comprised of our more profitable product assets, we will have better growth prospects. 
We also intend to move from direct sales models to indirect distributor models in certain countries and reduce our efforts or exit some markets. When complete, the streamlining of our portfolio and global footprint will reduce our expected 2017 sales by some $280 million and gross profit by about $100 million. For the avoidance of doubt, those numbers are based on current FX rates. The estimated revenue and gross profit impacts are reflected in our revised guidance for 2016 and 2017. 
Part 2 of the initiative is driving improved efficiency within our SG&A expenses and our investment in R&D. We're collapsing from 4 regions to 2 as we go forward. We're reorganizing the support for countries, including enabling functions, like finance, IT, HR and legal, but also the noncustomer-facing resources that support our field sales forces. We're taking steps to improve the focus of our R&D activities, supporting a smaller portfolio of products, identifying greater efficiency on our regulatory practices and better prioritizing our R&D spend. And yes, our expected spend for customer-facing resources will be less as well, mainly driven by the reduction in the number of markets where we'll have a direct presence and the deemphasis of certain other markets, but also through improvements in efficiency. 
In total, by calendar 2017, we, expect our total operating expenses, that is the sum of SG&A plus R&D, to be roughly $300 million less than it would have been but for this initiative. 
As I said just a moment ago, we are not changing our business model here and that's reflected in the way you should think about the sources of the $300 million of future savings. Roughly 1/3 is expected to come from reduced G&A and another 1/3 from commercial resources that are not customer-facing. That's roughly 2/3 of the expected savings coming from areas that should not impact our ability to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth. 
Of the remaining cost savings, about 10% is expected to come from improvements in efficiency within our R&D organization. About 5% is expected to come from the reduction of our field resources tied to our revised global footprint and reduced emphasis in some emerging markets, and the balance of the cost savings here is expected to come from reducing complexity and increasing efficiency in other areas. 
The third and final piece of the initiative is the supply network strategy that Kristin Peck outlined at our Investor Day last November. Most of the benefits of that work will be realized after 2017. So for now let's set the supply network strategy aside and focus on the activities that will impact our results in the period from 2015 to 2017, but keep in mind that the supply network strategy initiative is expected to add some 200 basis points to our gross margin by 2020 on top of the improvements driven by the 2015 initiative. 
You've heard me say this many times in the past that when we're looking at our operating efficiency, there are opportunities for us to do better. Today we back those words up, providing you with a framework of our plans to improve the operating performance of Zoetis while preserving the key elements of our value proposition. In our to be state in calendar 2017, we'll be an even better company than we are today, more profitable on a slightly smaller revenue base, positioned to deliver better growth from a more focused product portfolio and working off of a leaner cost structure that can be leveraged to support revenue and profit growth over the long term. 
After completing the change we're announcing today, we'll still be the leader in the animal health and we will continue to be the biggest investor in innovation in animal health. And we will continue to have the largest direct sales network in the industry. Our improved efficiency will provide us with more flexibility to allocate resources where we can best serve our customers' needs and to further distance ourselves from the competition. 
The efficiency initiative adds an estimated $200 million to our expectations for pretax earnings in 2017, driven by the $300 million in operating expense savings offset in part by the $100 million of projected decrease in gross profit attributable to the streamlining of our product portfolio and the rationalizing of our global footprint. This initiative adds roughly $0.28 to our prior estimate of 2017 adjusted net income per share. 
So the song remains the same, only better. We're a company that can grow its re-based revenues in line with or faster than the mid-single-digit growth of our markets while holding the growth in our leaned-out operating expenses to the inflation rate and thereby delivering long-term profit growth greater than our revenue growth. And that's off of a higher profit base, and that's a winner. 
Of course, the improvements in our future financial model don't come free. So I want to take a few minutes to talk about one-time costs generally and to specifically address the cost associated with the efficiency initiative. First, it's important for you to know that we have a high standard when it comes to costs that we characterize as onetime and, therefore, excluded from adjusted net income. Our policy limits such adjustments to purchase accounting, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items that we evaluate on an individual basis. These include direct and incremental cost required to complete the stand-up of the company and those direct costs that we will incur to execute our efficiency plan. 
Next, we want to be transparent about the amount and nature of these costs, so our intention is to provide disclosure of our onetime costs in 3 buckets. The bucket for stand-up costs and other onetime costs that you're already familiar with; a new bucket for the efficiency initiative that we announced today; and a third bucket for the cost associated with the longer-term elements of the supply network strategy. We estimate our remaining pretax stand-up and other onetime costs at $180 million to $210 million with those costs to be recorded primarily in the remainder of 2015 and through 2017. These are primarily all cash costs. 
We estimate the onetime pretax cash costs associated with the efficiency initiative to be in the range of $340 million to $400 million and to be incurred in 2015, 2016 and with some modest portion moving into 2017. We expect actual cash payouts to occur over the next few years. Note that there will also be noncash charges triggered by this initiative. We are not providing an estimate of these charges as both the amounts and timing could vary widely. As we incur these noncash charges, we'll call them out for you when recognized. 
Finally, the supply network strategy onetime pretax cash costs are currently estimated at $60 million to $100 million and are expected to be incurred over the term of the plan. It's worth noting that we are still in the early phases of architecting the supply network strategy and the final onetime costs for this activity could be substantially different depending on the final outcome of our ongoing analysis of our supply network and the timing or nature of any specific site exits. There will also be noncash charges triggered by the supply network strategy, and we will call those out to you when recognized. 
Note that the estimates of onetime pretax costs for both the efficiency initiative and the supply network strategy ignore the possible proceeds that we may receive from the sale of certain assets, which could potentially offset some of the onetime cash costs. We provided a webcast slide that summarizes our current estimates of the onetime pretax cash costs associated with each of the 3 buckets over the period from 2015 to 2017. We will refresh our view of the various buckets of onetime costs as appropriate. 
I want to call your attention now to an unrelated change to our go-forward outlook, and that's our decision to decrease our activities in Venezuela. The animal health industry in Venezuela features solid underlying fundamentals and our business there has performed well. However, recent economic developments necessitate an evaluation of our efforts there. While our business in Venezuela is profitable, it has become increasingly difficult to realize those profits in U.S. dollars. Unless and until that environment changes, sales and profits there will drive low quality earnings, so we're significantly paring back our activities there. 
To be clear, Venezuela is a solid local market and we will maintain a presence there as we believe that the environment will improve over time. However, in the interim, we believe it's prudent to reduce our activities and exposure there. 
The decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela impacts our revenue and profit expectations for 2015, '16 and '17. The impact on 2015 can be seen on the exhibit to our press release that bridges from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. We've also provided a slide on the webcast that shows the impact of Venezuela on 2017, which decreases our expectations for adjusted net income in 2017 by $0.07 per share. 
Now let me provide an update on our guidance for the full year 2015 in light of the changes in FX rates since our last guidance update, the anticipated impacts of the efficiency program and our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. I also want to update you on our expectation for 2016 and '17 and to provide you with more detail about those years. We felt it was important to say more about 2016 and '17 as there are a lot of moving parts here, and we want you to have a clear picture of our expectations. 
First, 2015 full year guidance. In our press release and in the webcast slide, we provided a bridge from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. The headline is that despite the continued headwinds from changes in FX rates and our decision to reduce our business in Venezuela, we're holding our guidance for adjusted net income per share for 2015 in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. This includes pluses and minuses. FX is a minus again. The changes in FX rates from late January, underlying our last updated guidance, to late April decreased our revenue expectation for 2015 by some $75 million or 155 basis points while the impact on adjusted net income was much less, only about $5 million or 60 basis points. Then our decision to pare back our efforts in Venezuela reduces our revenue expectations by $50 million, operating expenses by $5 million and decreased our expectations for adjusted net income by $25 million. 
Finally, the big plus, and that's the impact of the efficiency initiative, which reduced our expectations for operating expenses by $45 million compared with our prior guidance and increased our expected adjusted net income by $30 million. So when the dust settles, we expect our reported revenue to be down by $125 million from our prior guidance range and our adjusted net income to be consistent with our prior guidance, $1.61 to $1.68 per share. 
It's worth pointing out that we decreased our 2015 guidance for revenue growth on an operational basis by 100 basis points to the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The reduction in the growth rate is due to the expected reduction in sales in Venezuela. We translate Venezuela revenues at the fixed official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 to the dollar, so the $50 million expected reduction in revenue shifts the operational growth rate. And the adjusted net income operational growth rate is estimated to increase 1% as a contribution from our efficiency program should more than offset the impact of Venezuela. 
Turning to 2016 and '17. We provided a lot of detail for you so that you can recalibrate your expectations for us through 2017. As you can see how this longer-term guidance compares with your prior expectations, I submit that you must first revise your prior expectations to reflect the change to FX rates. To help you do that, the change in FX rates from late January to late April should reduce your 2016 and 2017 revenue expectations by roughly 215 -- excuse me, 215, 2-1-5 basis points, cost of goods sold by 260, 2-6-0 basis points and operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D by 170 basis points, with the result being a roughly 235 basis point decrease in projected adjusted net income driven by the changes in FX rates. Using that re-based forecast in comparison with our revised guidance for 2016 and '17 will enable you to isolate and evaluate the impacts of the 2015 efficiency initiative together with our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. In a nutshell, and looking at 2017, when the full benefits of our efficiency initiative are expected to be realized, the efficiency initiative increases our expectations for 2017 pretax income by roughly $200 million. Meanwhile, the Venezuela action reduces our pretax expectations by $55 million. Net, we add $145 million to our pretax expectations for 2017, roughly $100 million in adjusted net income or $0.20 per share. As Juan Ramón mentioned, the steps we are taking over the next several years are expected to enable us to improve our EBIT margin by some 500 basis points in 2017 to circa 34%. 
Here are a few other factors for you to consider. Our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. We expect a slightly higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year of 2015 higher than the 27% that we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 (sic) [ 2014] the operating expense benefits that we are seeking will begin to be most evident in Q4, and our guidance assumes a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. This includes share repurchases totaling an estimated $100 million in the first half of 2015, which are partially offset by actual and projected dilution related to employees' equity-based compensation. We also assumed a comparable level of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2016 and '17 as we intend for our share repurchase program to at least offset projected dilution from future employee compensation programs, including the acceleration impacts of our operational efficiency initiative. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release.
Finally, we covered a lot of ground on this call. To assist with clear communications, as John said, we will be posting copies of Juan Ramón's and my scripts to our Investor Relations website following this call. That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open up the line for your questions. Operator?"

We're not providing -- we provided an awful lot of detail on the operating side here through 2017. We're not, at this time, providing a forecast of cash flow in our balance sheet, but suffice it to say that we talked in the past about our desire to improve our asset efficiency. For example, through the implementation of our global ERP system, SAP, we expect that over time, we'll be able to reduce our investment in our inventory and unlock some cash there. Frankly, by pairing down our business and pooling with portfolio with the SKUs, that will unlock some cash as cash as well. We do have an awful lot of calls on our cash here coming up in the very near term. I mean, if you think about it in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. We do continue to use cash to fund the one-time costs associated with our separation from Pfizer, and we've provided an estimate of the remaining amount of that to be somewhere in the range of $180 million to $210 million. We provided you with an estimate of cost of the efficiency initiative that we announced today and the early stages of our supplier network strategy, and those costs are estimated in the range of $300 million or $400 million to $500 million over the next several years. And we have called it out for you, the $400 million debt maturity coming up next spring. And then we have our regular dividend coming up. So we do have some sizable calls on our cash. We have actually provided you also with some guidance, a little bit of guidance at this stage around our share repurchases. We indicated that we expect to purchase, in aggregate, $100 million worth of shares over the first half of 2015 and that we can expect to continue acquiring shares in the amount that will at least offset the ongoing dilution from our equity-based compensation plans. And I said in the past, I'll say it again. The share repurchase will be an ongoing part of our plans for our capital allocation. I think of it as a share purchase activity that underlies our 2017 guidance as a baseline for that activity. As we generate either free cash or debt capacity, we'll adjust our plans there as appropriate. Did I cover all? Sorry, the de-leveraging question as well. Yes, we have stated in the past that we have kind of a notional, and when we talk about our capital structure, a notional floor of gross debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA of 2.5x. So I want to reiterate there's a permanent role for debt in our capital structure, and when you think about debt cap structure, we remain committed to be responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital and our hierarchy for that capital allocation will be first and foremost inside our business; second for business development activity that is value-generative; and lastly, the transaction and shareholders including both the regular dividend and the ongoing share repurchases. So again, think of that 2.5x as a floor and think of our hierarchy of capital allocation as I outlined it for you. I hope I answered the question."

So let me start by mentioning maybe the difference between companion animal and livestock in terms of gross profit. So in terms of gross profit companion animal, it's generating the highest margins, and you know that we have a margin of a gross profit of 65%. The net companion animal is much higher than the 65%. And then livestock, we have a different margin depending on cattle, swine or poultry. Being in poultry, the lowest in terms of our gross profit and cattle, the highest in terms of our gross profit in livestock. But then you also need to add what is their cost to win these products to the customers. And then in that case, I think the total margins are much more equalized. So companion animal require a significant much more field force and promotional activities because the number of our customers in companion animal is much higher than in livestock. And then poultry is the most consolidated industry, so it required fewer individuals to reach to customers while cattle still require a significant number of people to reach these customers. So this gross profit across different species in terms of the total margin, the margins are much more similar. And we think that there are opportunities in both.

In some cases, like Tyson, we have been already working with Tyson some years ago to eliminate these products.

In my remarks today, I will briefly comment on our performance for the quarter. And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning.

And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning. Paul will then walk you through our result for the quarter and discuss the financial impact of the operational efficiency program, including an update to guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. 
During the first quarter, we generated operational growth of 6% in revenue and 14% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 per share. During the quarter, half of our operational growth or 3% was attributed to price. New products, such as ACTOGAIN an acquired product from Abbott Animal Health, accounted for 2% while in-line products contributed to 1% of revenue growth for the quarter. 
As a note, all the following growth rates that I will discuss are operational. In livestock, we grew 7% to $715 million with all species contributing to growth. Cattle revenue grew 7% to $397 million with favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil driving growth across the portfolio, while weather and reduced herd size led to declines in Australia and New Zealand. Swine revenue, which grew 13% to $170 million, is benefiting from increased herd size in the U.S. after a winter of lower piglet mortality from PEDv plus positive industry momentum in the CLAR region. Poultry revenue grew 1% to $129 million as the U.S. reintroduction of Zoamix, a medicated feed additive, helped to offset a negative impact from the timing of product rotations in several countries. 
Turning to animal health -- companion animal health. Revenues grew 4% to $377 million due to the continued performance of key brands and overall strong growth in China and Latin American markets. We closed on the purchase of Abbott Animal Health assets in early February, so sales of newly acquired Abbott products also contributed to results. They were recorded primarily in the U.S. where we have seen additional competition in the pain and sedation markets. 
These results continue to demonstrate the strength of the business model as defined by our 3 interconnected capabilities: the largest and most capable field force in the industry with direct customer interactions, investing more innovation than any other company, and having the highest quality products and more reliable supply at a competitive cost. These 3 capabilities form an essential foundation for long-term success in animal health. Going forward, we are committed to investing in these capabilities but also see an opportunity to use them in more focused ways to enhance competitiveness and drive greater value for our customers and shareholders. 
Over the last 2 years, since becoming an independent company, we have delivered on our operating and financial targets, created shareholder value and continue to meet our customer needs while standing up a new global company and infrastructure. We are certainly proud of what we have achieved. And as we transition out of our stand-up phase, we are focused on driving efficiency and reducing complexity that is a barrier to productivity. The program we announced today is a comprehensive plan that is designed to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources. We enter this next stage building on solid business performance, and we'll emerge as a stronger, simpler and more cost-efficient organization. 
We expect to generate cost savings of $300 million in 2017 and see our adjusted EBIT margin improve from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve a greater focus on key brands and markets. We are fully aligned to achieve these goals and have the plans in place to incentivize our leaders to exceed these targets. 
These initiatives will allow us to derive additional value by taking full advantage of our scale. It will allow us to invest in the products, markets and infrastructure that will drive profitable growth and continued leadership in the animal health industry. 
There are several important reasons why we are initiating this program. First, after 2 years of separating from Pfizer, we now have full control of our operations, manufacturing and corporate systems and we have identified significant opportunities for improvement. Second, while the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint remain strength of our business, we have seen certain elements of our breadth generate complexity that is a barrier to delivering value to our customers and to generating long-term growth. Third, we are beginning to see the benefits of implementing our ERP system. The resulting standardization and potential to simplify our business through our new ERP system will allow us to increase productivity and streamline operations. And finally, we remain focused on growing revenues and finding the most productive ways to allocate resources to internal investments and business development activities. 
We have 3 main objectives for this operational efficiency initiative. First, we want to reduce complexity that does not add value for our customers and our business. Second, we want to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency. And third, we want to better position Zoetis for long-term profitable growth. 
We'll deliver our first objective to reduce complexity by enhancing our focus on products, markets and manufacturing plants that are most important to our future. We'll eliminate approximately 5,000 lower-revenue and lower-margin product SKUs out of a total of 13,000. This will drive higher focus and more reliable supply of our products and services. 
We'll enhance our manufacturing operations and accelerate the implementation of our supply network strategy. We plan to sell or exit about 10 manufacturing sites over the long term. 
Reflecting the strategic importance of manufacturing to our business model, Roman Trawicki, President of Global Manufacturing and Supply, will now report directly to me as part of the executive team. We will change our selling approach in approximately 30 markets by shifting to an indirect sales model or reducing our presence in certain countries. 
We reduce the number of regional reporting segments from 4 to 2: the U.S. and International. We expect these changes to result in greater decision-making authority closer to the customers while leveraging our scale to efficiently deliver marketing and other operational support. The U.S. Region will be led by Kristin Peck and the International Region will be led by Clint Lewis. Both are current members of our executive team and will continue reporting to me. 
To deliver on our second objective, to optimize resource allocation and efficiency, we will take the following actions: We will leverage the efficiency and standardization of our newly implemented ERP system to significantly reduce general and administrative costs in corporate functions. In addition to the ERP benefits, another important efficiency driver will be a reduction of management layers and increased span of control through the organization. We'll improve our ability to be more dynamic and agile in responding to customer needs by shifting marketing resources closer to the customer and simplifying all areas of noncustomer-facing commercial infrastructure. And we'll enhance our R&D focus to support a smaller portfolio of products as well as better prioritize the R&D portfolio to invest in projects with the highest returns. 
In the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to improve our operations and be more efficient. In 2009, we achieved a successful transformation when we became the world's largest animal health business through several acquisitions. Then in 2013, we became a large, global independent company followed by 2 consecutive years of industry-leading performance. Through each of these changes we have made ourselves better, improve how we serve customers and create new and greater value to our stakeholders. I'm confident that the comprehensive plan we have announced today will allow us to transform again, building on our successful business model to deliver high-quality profitable revenue growth and becoming a more competitive company. 
These are significant initiatives that will drive us to be a more focused and streamlined company. As a result, we'll see a reduction in the number of positions at Zoetis of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 over the next 12 to 18 months, subject to any consultation with work councils and unions in certain markets. 
With the implementation of this initiative, we will better align Zoetis' resources and operating structure with our 3 interconnected capabilities; supply products, more reliable and at a competitive cost; increase capacity to invest in future business drivers; and finally, tailor the product portfolio and improve efficiency of the operating model so we can pursue the next horizon of opportunity as a world leader with a single focus on animal health. Through this process, we'll be more competitive and better positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth. 
Before Paul cover the financial details, I would like to thank all our colleagues who have contributed to our success through an environment of intense change. Our next transformation will be key to supporting our future success, and I know that we have the capabilities and the team to implement these significant changes.

We have lots of important things to talk about on this call, as we just revealed our plans to improve the efficiency of our operating model. But before we get to that, I don't want us to lose sight of the terrific quarter that we just put on the board. So let's get started. 
As you'll remember, our fourth quarter of 2014 featured strong operational growth and we were able to carry that momentum forward into Q1 of 2015 and give us a good start to the year. We delivered on our primary value drivers posting revenue and adjusted net income growth on an operational basis of 6% and 14%, respectively. Pretty good, right? 
Like other U.S. multinational companies, FX rates had a major impact on our reported results. On a reported basis, FX rates decreased our reported revenue by $58 million, resulting in our reported revenue growth being flat with Q1 of 2014. The impact on our adjusted net income was $16 million and so reduced our growth in adjusted net income from 14% on an operational basis to 8% on a reported basis. So FX impacted our top line by some 600 basis points and adjusted net income by 600 basis points. 
I said this before and I'll say it again today, we can't control FX rates. We manage our business on an operational basis, and on that basis, we're continuing to deliver strong fundamental growth in revenue and profits. 
You can read about the regional segment results in the press release and tables, so I won't spend too much time on them here, but I do want to cover a few highlights. The U.S. continued to perform very well, up 9% versus Q1 of '14, with strong livestock performance, which was up 14%. We continue to gain share in the U.S. livestock segment, especially cattle, based on producers' confidence in the reliability of our products to protect their investment in their animals. In companion animal, which was up 3%, we anticipate even more positive results through the balance of the year as we now have increased supply for APOQUEL. CLAR also continues performing well, with revenue up 13% on an operating basis, and that's driven by Brazil and other emerging markets. Later, when I talk about our go-forward plans to streamline and adjust our global footprint, I'll speak to our plans to deemphasize our efforts in Venezuela where the business and economic climates are becoming more challenging. 
In APAC, where we posted 1% operating growth in revenue, we're seeing good performance in emerging markets like China but drought conditions in developed markets, including Australia and New Zealand are having an impact. In EuAfME, where revenue was flat compared with Q1 of 2014, the takeaway is that good performance on our key brands in companion animal are being offset by declines in anti-infectives, primarily due to legislative changes in France. 
Now let me turn to what I will call our operational efficiency initiative. This initiative is a natural next step in the evolution of our company as a stand-alone entity with a singular focus on animal health. While we enjoy an enviable position in animal health today, our current product portfolio, footprint and organization came about in ways that were, to some extent, unplanned. The makeup of our product portfolio was heavily influenced by human health acquisitions made by Pfizer that had animal health components. These were very important to building our scale and portfolio, but the animal health assets were not the focus of those deals. And while we spend a lot of time and energy standing up our own organization and building our own culture, we quite naturally carried across organizational designs, processes and practices that worked well when we were a division of Pfizer, but may not represent the best options for a pure-play animal health company. Said another way, it's doubtful that we serendipitously came upon the best possible structure and organization to maximize our opportunity in the animal health industry. 
Our first priority over the last few years has been to build out the functions that we need to support our business on a stand-alone basis. We had to establish our own supply chain, build our own IT infrastructure and put in place the G&A functions like finance, HR and legal to support a global public company. While we did that, we elected to leave our commercial and R&D organizations largely as is to minimize the impact of our stand-up on our customers and on our business. 
I think our track record of revenue and profit growth over the last 2 years, and so far into 2015, support the wisdom of that approach. But now with the completion of the stand-up activities in sight, it's time to look at the entirety of our current state and take steps to improve the design and efficiency of our company. 
Importantly, we are not questioning the fundamental elements of our business model. Our model relies on what we refer to as our 3 interconnected capabilities: one, face-to-face interaction with our customers to drive revenue; two, investment in product innovation to sustain our revenue base and our growth prospects; and three, the ability to meet our customers' demand with quality products. These capabilities form the basis of our competitive advantage in the global animal health industry and changes to these areas will fall into the category of continuous improvement, not major changes. 
The bulk of our future cost savings will not impact these areas. Our field force, the personnel in the front lines with our customers, will remain largely intact. The scope of our activities in R&D will also remain substantially the same, and we will continue to invest in programs to build and improve our supply chain. 
Let me separate the 2015 program into 2 parts as I see them and then add on the previously announced supply network strategy to think about 3 areas of focus. Part 1 is what I'll call rationalizing our footprint, part 2 is driving improved efficiency in our operating expenses, and part 3 is streamlining and improving the efficiency of our supply chain. 
Starting with rationalizing our footprint. This work included a review of the number of SKUs that make up our product portfolio, consideration of moving to indirect sales models in a number of markets where we currently have a direct presence and evaluations of markets where we might choose to reduce our efforts. The headline here is that we will be eliminating nearly 40% of our total SKUs. These SKUs create significant complexity across multiple functions within our company. Of course, this will reduce our revenue and gross profits in the near term, but it will enable us to substantially improve the efficiency of our operations, from our supply chain and sales support, to G&A expenses and the product maintenance costs that are part of our R&D. With a leaner portfolio comprised of our more profitable product assets, we will have better growth prospects. 
We also intend to move from direct sales models to indirect distributor models in certain countries and reduce our efforts or exit some markets. When complete, the streamlining of our portfolio and global footprint will reduce our expected 2017 sales by some $280 million and gross profit by about $100 million. For the avoidance of doubt, those numbers are based on current FX rates. The estimated revenue and gross profit impacts are reflected in our revised guidance for 2016 and 2017. 
Part 2 of the initiative is driving improved efficiency within our SG&A expenses and our investment in R&D. We're collapsing from 4 regions to 2 as we go forward. We're reorganizing the support for countries, including enabling functions, like finance, IT, HR and legal, but also the noncustomer-facing resources that support our field sales forces. We're taking steps to improve the focus of our R&D activities, supporting a smaller portfolio of products, identifying greater efficiency in our regulatory practices and better prioritizing our R&D spend. And yes, our expected spend for customer-facing resources will be less as well, mainly driven by the reduction in the number of markets where we'll have a direct presence, and the deemphasis of certain other markets but also through improvements in efficiency. 
In total, by calendar 2017, we expect our total operating expenses, that is the sum of SG&A plus R&D, to be roughly $300 million less than it would have been but for this initiative. 
As I said just a moment ago, we are not changing our business model here and that should be reflected in the way you should think about the sources of the $300 million of future savings. Roughly 1/3 is expected to come from reduced G&A and another 1/3 from commercial resources that are not customer-facing. That's roughly 2/3 of the expected savings coming from areas that should not impact our ability to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth. 
Of the remaining cost savings, about 10% is expected to come from improvements in efficiency within our R&D organization. About 5% is expected to come from the reduction of our field resources tied to our revised global footprint and reduced emphasis in some emerging markets, and the balance of the cost savings here is expected to come from reducing complexity and increasing efficiency in other areas. 
The third and final piece of the initiative is the supply network strategy that Kristin Peck outlined at our Investor Day last November. Most of the benefits of that work will be realized after 2017. So for now let's set the supply network strategy aside and focus on the activities that will impact our results in the period from 2015 to 2017, but keep in mind that the supply network strategy initiative is expected to add some 200 basis points to our gross margin by 2020 on top of the improvements driven by the 2015 initiative. 
You've heard me say this many times in the past that when we're looking at our operating efficiency, there are opportunities for us to do better. Today we back those words up, providing you with a framework of our plans to improve the operating performance of Zoetis while preserving the key elements of our value proposition. In our to be state in calendar 2017, we'll be an even better company than we are today, more profitable on a slightly smaller revenue base, positioned to deliver better growth from a more focused product portfolio and working off of a leaner cost structure that can be leveraged to support revenue and profit growth over the long term. 
After completing the change we're announcing today, we'll still be the leader in animal health, and we will continue to be the biggest investor in innovation in animal health. And we will continue to have the largest direct sales network in the industry. Our improved efficiency will provide us with more flexibility to allocate resources where we can best serve our customers' needs and to further distance ourselves from the competition. 
The efficiency initiative adds an estimated $200 million to our expectations for pretax earnings in 2017, driven by the $300 million in operating expense savings, offset in part by the $100 million of projected decrease in gross profit attributable to the streamlining of our product portfolio and the rationalizing of our global footprint. This initiative adds roughly $0.28 to our prior estimate of 2017 adjusted net income per share. 
So the song remains the same, only better. We're a company that can grow its re-based revenues in line with or faster than the mid-single-digit growth of our markets while holding the growth in our leaned-out operating expenses to the inflation rate and thereby delivering long-term profit growth greater than our revenue growth. And that's off of a higher profit base, and that's a winner. 
Of course, the improvements in our future financial model don't come free. So I want to take a few minutes to talk about one-time costs generally and to specifically address the costs associated with the efficiency initiative. First, it's important for you to know that we have a high standard when it comes to costs that we characterize as onetime and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted net income. Our policy limits such adjustments to purchase accounting, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items that we evaluate on an individual basis. These include direct and incremental costs required to complete the stand-up of the company and those direct costs that we will incur to execute our efficiency plan. 
Next, we want to be transparent about the amount and nature of these costs, so our intention is to provide disclosure of our onetime costs in 3 buckets. The bucket for stand-up costs and other onetime costs that you're already familiar with; a new bucket for the efficiency initiative that we announced today; and a third bucket for the cost associated with the longer-term elements of the supply network strategy. We estimate our remaining pretax stand-up and other onetime costs at $180 million to $210 million with those costs to be recorded primarily in the remainder of 2015 and through 2017. These are primarily all-cash costs. 
We estimate the onetime pretax cash costs associated with the efficiency initiative to be in the range of $340 million to $400 million and to be incurred in 2015, 2016 and with some modest portion moving into 2017. We expect actual cash payouts to occur over the next few years. Note that there will also be noncash charges triggered by this initiative. We are not providing an estimate of these charges as both the amounts and timing could vary widely. As we incur these noncash charges, we'll call them out for you when recognized. 
Finally, the supply-network strategy. onetime-pretax cash costs are currently estimated at $60 million to $100 million and are expected to be incurred over the term of the plan. It's worth noting that we are still in the early phases of architecting the supply network strategy, and the final onetime costs for this activity could be substantially different depending on the final outcome of our ongoing analysis of our supply network and the timing or nature of any specific site exits. There will also be noncash charges triggered by the supply network strategy, and we will call those out to you when recognized. 
Note that the estimates of onetime pretax costs for both the efficiency initiative and the supply network strategy ignore the possible proceeds that we may receive from the sale of certain assets, which could potentially offset some of the onetime cash costs. We provided a webcast slide that summarizes our current estimates of the onetime pretax cash costs associated with each of the 3 buckets over the period from 2015 to 2017. We will refresh our view of the various buckets of onetime costs as appropriate. 
I want to call your attention now to an unrelated change to our go-forward outlook, and that's our decision to decrease our activities in Venezuela. The animal health industry in Venezuela features solid underlying fundamentals and our business there has performed well. However, recent economic developments necessitate an evaluation of our efforts there. While our business in Venezuela is profitable, it has become increasingly difficult to realize those profits in U.S. dollars. Unless and until that environment changes, sales and profits there will drive low quality earnings, so we're significantly paring back our activities there. 
To be clear, Venezuela is a solid local market and we will maintain a presence there as we believe that the environment will improve over time. However, in the interim, we believe it's prudent to reduce our activities and exposure there. 
The decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela impacts our revenue and profit expectations for 2015, '16 and '17. The impact on 2015 can be seen in the exhibit to our press release that bridges from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. We've also provided a slide on the webcast that shows the impact of Venezuela on 2017, which decreases our expectations for adjusted net income in 2017 by $0.07 per share. 
Now let me provide an update on our guidance for the full year 2015 in light of the changes in FX rates since our last guidance update, the anticipated impacts of the efficiency program and our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. I also want to update you on our expectation for 2016 and '17 and to provide you with more detail about those years. We felt it was important to say more about 2016 and '17 as there are a lot of moving parts here, and we want you to have a clear picture of our expectations. 
First, 2015 full year guidance. In our press release and in a webcast slide, we provided a bridge from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. The headline is that despite the continued headwinds from changes in FX rates and our decision to reduce our business in Venezuela, we're holding our guidance for adjusted net income per share for 2015 in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. This includes pluses and minuses. FX is a minus again. The changes in FX rates from late January, underlying our last updated guidance, to late April, decreased our revenue expectation for 2015 by some $75 million or 155 basis points, while the impact on adjusted net income was much less, only about $5 million or 60 basis points. Then our decision to pare back our efforts in Venezuela reduces our revenue expectations by $50 million, operating expenses by $5 million and decreased our expectations for adjusted net income by $25 million. 
Finally, the big plus, and that's the impact of the efficiency initiative, which reduced our expectations for operating expenses by $45 million compared with our prior guidance and increased our expected adjusted net income by $30 million. So when the dust settles, we expect our reported revenue to be down by $125 million from our prior guidance range and our adjusted net income to be consistent with our prior guidance, $1.61 to $1.68 per share. 
It's worth pointing out that we decreased our 2015 guidance for revenue growth on an operational basis by 100 basis points to the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The reduction in the growth rate is due to the expected reduction in sales in Venezuela. We translate Venezuela revenues at the fixed official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 to the dollar, so the $50 million expected reduction in revenue shifts the operational growth rate. And the adjusted net income operational growth rate is estimated to increase 1% as a contribution from our efficiency program should more than offset the impact of Venezuela. 
Turning to 2016 and '17. We provided a lot of detail for you so that you can recalibrate your expectations for us through 2017. As you can see how this longer-term guidance compares with your prior expectations, I submit that you must first revise your prior expectations to reflect the changed FX rates. To help you do that, the change in FX rates from late January to late April should reduce your 2016 and 2017 revenue expectations by roughly 215 -- excuse me, 215, 2-1-5 basis points, cost of goods sold by 260, 2-6-0 basis points and operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D by 170 basis points, with the result being a roughly 235 basis point decrease in projected adjusted net income driven by the changes in FX rates. Using that re-based forecast in comparison with our revised guidance for 2016 and '17 will enable you to isolate and evaluate the impacts of the 2015 efficiency initiative together with our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. In a nutshell, and looking at 2017, when the full benefits of our efficiency initiative are expected to be realized, the efficiency initiative increases our expectations for 2017 pretax income by roughly $200 million. Meanwhile, the Venezuela action reduces our pretax expectations by $55 million. Net, we add $145 million to our pretax expectations for 2017, roughly $100 million in adjusted net income or $0.20 per share. As Juan Ramón mentioned, the steps we are taking over the next several years are expected to enable us to improve our EBIT margin by some 500 basis points in 2017 to circa 34%. 
Here are a few other factors for you to consider. Our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. We expect a slightly higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year 2015, higher than the 27% that we had in the first quarter of 2015. The operating expense benefits that we are seeking will begin to be most evident in Q4, and our guidance assumes a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. This includes share repurchases totaling an estimated $100 million in the first half of 2015, which are partially offset by actual and projected dilution relating to employees' equity-based compensation. We also assumed a comparable level of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2016 and '17 as we intend for our share repurchase program to at least offset projected dilution from future employee compensation programs, including the acceleration impacts of our operational efficiency initiative. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release.
Finally, we covered a lot of ground on this call. To assist with clear communications, as John said, we will be posting copies of Juan Ramón's and my scripts to our Investor Relations website following this call. That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open up the line for your questions. Operator?"

So 2 things affecting '16: one, as you correctly point out, is Venezuela hitting the operational rate; and the second is, the timing of the SKUs that we're pruning from the portfolio when we start to see a decrease in sales. You note that we, for the balance of '15, expect -- did not show you a line item reducing our revenue expectations associated with the reduction in the SKUs in the portfolio.

We're not providing -- we provided an awful lot of detail on the operating side here through 2017. We're not, at this time, providing a forecast of cash flow and our balance sheet, but suffice it to say that we talked in the past about our desire to improve our asset efficiency. For example, through the implementation of our global ERP system, SAP, we expect that over time, we'll be able to reduce our investment in our inventory and unlock some cash there. Frankly, by paring down our business and pruning our portfolio, with the SKUs, that will unlock some cash -- cash as well. We do have an awful lot of calls on our cash here coming up in the very near term. I mean, if you think about it in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. We do continue to use cash to fund the onetime costs associated with our separation from Pfizer, and we've provided an estimate of the remaining amount of that to be somewhere in the range of $180 million to $210 million. We provided you with an estimate of the cost of the efficiency initiative that we announced today and the early stages of our supply network strategy, and those costs are estimated in the range of $300 million or $400 million to $500 million over the next several years. And we have, I'll call it out for you, the $400 million debt maturity coming up next spring. And then we have our regular dividend coming up. So we do have some sizable calls on our cash. We have actually provided you also with some guidance, a little bit of guidance at this stage around our share repurchases. We indicated that we expect to purchase, in aggregate, $100 million worth of shares over the first half of 2015 and that we can -- expect to continue acquiring shares in the amount that will at least offset the ongoing dilution from our equity-based compensation plans. And I said in the past, I'll say it again, the share repurchase will be an ongoing part of our plans for our capital allocation. I think of it -- share purchase activity that underlies our 2017 guidance as a baseline for that activity. As we generate either free cash or debt capacity, we'll adjust our plans there as appropriate. Did I cover it all? Sorry, the deleveraging question as well. Yes, we have stated in the past that we have kind of a notional -- when we talk about our capital structure, a notional floor of gross debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA of 2.5x. So I want to reiterate there's a permanent role for debt in our capital structure, and when you think about that cap structure, we remain committed to be responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital. And our hierarchy for that capital allocation will be first and foremost inside our business; second for business development activity that is value-generative; and lastly, transactions and shareholders including both the regular dividend and the ongoing share repurchases. So again, think of that 2.5x as a floor and think of our hierarchy of capital allocation as I outlined it for you. I hope I answered the question."

So let me start by mentioning maybe the difference between companion animal and livestock in terms of gross profit. So in terms of gross profit, companion animal, it's generating the highest margins, and you know that we have a margin of -- a gross profit of 65%. The net companion animal is much higher than this 65%. And then livestock, we have a different margin depending on cattle, swine or poultry. Being in poultry, the lowest in terms of our gross profit and, cattle, the highest in terms of our gross profit in livestock. But then you also need to add what is the cost to win these products to the customers. And then in that case, I think the total margins are much more equalized. So companion animal require a significant much more field force and promotional activities because the number of our customers in companion animal it's much higher than in livestock. And then poultry is the most consolidated industry, so it require fewer individuals to reach the customers, while cattle still require a significant number of people to reach these customers. So even gross profit are different across different species. In terms of the total margin, the margins are much more similar. And we think that there are opportunities in both. We have been growing livestock faster than companion animal in the recent years. Now with APOQUEL, with Sarolaner, with Abbott, with IL-31, we expect that companion animal will generate a significant growth in our operations."

In some cases, like Tyson, we have been already working with Tyson some years ago to eliminate these products.

Today, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter and provide updates related to the integration of Abbott Animal Health, the performance of new products and progress on our operational efficiency program. Paul will then provide additional perspective on the quarter and comment on our guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. All rate -- growth rates that I am discussing today are rational excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
I'm very pleased to report that this quarter, we generated very strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on the strength and diversity of our additions [ph]. The growth this quarter was driven by the positive performance of our portfolio in both companion animal and livestock. The addition of Abbott Animal Health, the growth of APOQUEL and other new products and continued [indiscernible] on operating expenses.
In the quarter, we generated operational growth of 11% in revenue and 20% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.43 per share. This performance continued to demonstrate our long-term net value proposition to grow adjusted earnings faster than sales. During the quarter, APOQUEL contributed 2% of the revenue growth or $19 [ph] million. Abbott Animal Health accounted for 2% of the revenue growth or $25 million and another 2% came from new product launches. The remaining 5% is related to 9 [indiscernible] performance including a 2% price increase. In livestock, we grew 8%, driven by strong growth in cattle and swine. Cattle revenue grew 9% with continued favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil, partially offset by the impact of the transactions in Australia. Swine products also made significant contributions this quarter, growing at 14% based on strong sales in the U.S. and China. In the U.S., the markets for the swine population were building after the recent impact of PEDv. We continue adoption of our key brands and a positive impact for new products like our beta [indiscernible]. Poultry revenue grew 1%, reflecting new product launches, which were partially offset by the customer rotation of a medicated feed additive in certain Latin American markets. 
Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 15% due to additional sales from the Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brand such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space and Stronghold and [indiscernible] parasiticides. We feel very good about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health, and we expect to achieve the target we set from the acquisition in terms of revenue and cost synergies.
Now switching to some operational updates. We completed the go live of our ERP system in the U.S. and at the beginning of May as scheduled. From a systems and controlled point of view, the implementation was successful. However, due to a large number of our customers directly impacted by our change of systems, we have had customers experiencing a reduction in their services. The availability of these achievement and new issues has been resolved and customers, should see the level of service improving and returning to the quality they expect and deserve from us. For implementation in other countries, we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 2016. 
As for APOQUEL, since April this year, we had significant increase from supply, and today, more than 13,000 veterinarians have access to APOQUEL in the U.S. and more in markets outside the U.S. We have the manufacturing capacity to meet future demands of the product but, the process of scaling up the [indiscernible] pharmaceutical ingredient or API has been challenging. We have now made the necessary changes to improve the process, and we are continuing to ramp pattern manufacturing. While the situation is improving, we are not yet meeting all market demand, and our first priority has been to manage the solution of available supply to our locations and to fulfill orders for our current customers. With this in mind, we have temporarily suspended taking new first time customers orders for APOQUEL in most markets. We remain committed in making APOQUEL available to more new customers as soon as possible.
Given this change in our supply expectations, we now expect revenue for APOQUEL to be about $150 million in 2015 and to increase significantly in 2016. The productivity of our investment in neutral [indiscernible] and product life cycle development continue to support our future growth targets. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has granted an additional license for our first of each kind antibody therapy that targets interleukin-31 or IL-31 to help use in clinical science associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs, even presents another major breakthrough from our R&D platform based on new scientific insight into the pathway of allergic skin conditions. 
We continue to receive approvals for [indiscernible] and formulations of our key programs and to expand products into new markets. In the second quarter, for example, we received approval of a new label claims in the U.S. and European union for CERENIA, an antiemetic to treat and prevent acute vomiting in dogs and cats. We continue expanding the breadth of our Fostera swine vaccine franchise with new label claims in Canada and Latin America. In DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective, which [indiscernible] an important market for swine, was launched in major European markets such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. 
We now shift to some comments and updates on the operational efficiency program we announced last quarter. As you will recall, the program we announced the design to simplify our operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources for future long-term growth. We expect to generate cost savings of at least $300 million in 2017 and improve our adjusted EBIT margin from 25 in 2014 to approximately 34 in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve a greater focus on key brands and markets. Our [indiscernible] are moving ahead with the elimination of approximately 5,000 SKUs from a total of 13,000 and changing our solution model in about 25 markets. Approximately 45 countries will remain with a direct sales model and generate 95% of our revenue. Meanwhile, we have begun the process of selling or exiting 7 manufacturing sites and another 3 sites will be sold or exited in in the later phase as part of our supply network strategy. We have also strengthened job reductions as we reorganized and streamlined our operations. 
We are making very good progress on implementation of our operational efficiency program, and I'm very optimistic about delivering or exceeding the target of $300 million in savings by 2017. While we are making these changes for efficiency, we remain absolutely committed to this moment that have been driving our success: our direct selling approach and world-class field force that differentiate us from the competition. Our investment enumeration that drive [indiscernible] progress and also ensure the life cycle development of our portfolio; and our high-quality manufacturing and supply. 
In summary, we delivered excellent second quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, diverse portfolio and focus on expense control, and we are seeing good initial progress on the efficiency program that will make us even more competitive and profitable for the long term.
I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?"

The financial highlights of the quarter are revenue growth and cost discipline. Revenue grew 11% operational compared to Q2 of 2014, with growth coming principally from the addition of required Abbott Animal Health products, the ramp-up of APOQUEL and strengthen our livestock portfolio. With respect to operating expenses, the [indiscernible] earnings reduced expenses in order to preserve our 2015 profit guidance in the face of currency headwinds enable us to hold the growth of our operating expense to 2% on an operational basis compared with the prior year quarter and keeps us on track to deliver on the 2015 [indiscernible] of the efficiency initiative that we announced back in May. The strong revenue performance [indiscernible] gross profit margins mainly due to the favorable impact of FX on cost of goods sold and expense control enable us to reflect very strong adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally and 14% on a reported basis. 
All of you that know me know what's coming next. While good performance in the 98 window looks great in the headline, we think about our business in terms of a year or even years with no guided quarters and we don't manage the quarters. So please, view this quarter as a strong quarter and view it as what it is, and then [indiscernible] we remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2015 guidance and beyond. With that as a backdrop, I want to know that we narrowed our 2015 guidance towards the upper end of the range, good stuff indeed.
I mentioned FX rates and I want to again call your attention to the impact of FX on our reported results. Foreign exchange rates continued to mute to our reported revenue and profit growth. FX rates reduced our reported [indiscernible] by some $106 million compared with Q2 of '14 or roughly 1,000 basis points, while our adjusted net income growth was reduced by $12 million or roughly 600 basis points compared with the prior year's second quarter. [indiscernible] business and measure our performance on an operational basis or on a constant currency basis, and on that basis, we delivered. 
As part of the operational efficiency program we announced in May, we've consolidated from 4 reporting segments to 2, U.S. and international. From here forward, our financial reporting will reflect this new structure. A few weeks ago, we issued an 8-K to provide you with a historical view of our 2014 and first quarter 2015 results in this new reporting structure, and I hope this helped you update the financial models in preparing for today's call. 
The consolidation of our business into 2 segments will reduce the cost and complexity of our operations. It also improves our decision-making accountability at the local market level where we drive value. For your own concerns that the consolidation of segments might reduce visibility into our performance, let me say that we believe that the revised disclosure, providing revenue details on most -- on excuse me providing revenue details on our most important countries rather than a somewhat arbitrary geographic grouping should give you better visibility into the results and how we drive our results. 
In today's earnings release, you will see revenue for the U.S. and international segments as well as additional breakdowns showing revenue for our top 11 international countries. This gives you visibility into the markets [indiscernible] 80% of our sales. Approximately 20% of the remaining have [indiscernible] group and reported as other developed markets in other emerging markets. I will caution you that with the increased granularity of the revenue reporting, you use the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and I wouldn't read too much into that if you look at it on a single quarter in a single market in isolation. What will strengthen our business model is the geographic diversity of our revenue and profit streams, particularly in livestock. The participating global markets and strengthened weaknesses in individual markets are generally offset by performance in other markets. 
Finally, we also provided a [indiscernible] disclosure to the 2 segments showing revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses and pretax earnings. I hope you agree that our new financial reporting model is the improvement over the prior model.
Let me call your attention to a few highlights in the quarter. Juan Ramón mentioned this earlier, but it's worth repeating since it's a great way to  illustrate the ways in which we can grow our top line. Top line revenue, we delivered operational growth of 11% in the quarter, of which 3% was unit growth of in-line products, 2% was in primes, 2% was from growth of APOQUEL, 2% was from the additional acquired animal health and 2% was from a range of new product options. I think in the second quarter, we covered all of the ways that we can deliver operational revenue growth.
Next, looking at the U.S., very strong growth of 17% over the prior year quarter. We delivered growth in all species, companion animal, cattle, swine, poultry and equine. In companion animal, the big drivers were the addition of the Abbott products and APOQUEL. In cattle, we had a continuation of favorable conditions supporting needs of our premium products, and we increased sales of ACTOGAIN. In swine, hog sizes are recovering from PEDv outbreak and we have a positive impact on new products and the portfolio and the PEDv vaccine and endgame. Finally, poultry grew largely from the introduction of our Zoamix products. 
In the international group, which grew 6% operationally, the top 3 countries contributing to the growth were Brazil, up 9%, mainly due to favorable conditions in the livestock segment and new product launches; China, which was up 26% with our livestock business benefiting from higher anti-infective use in some key swine accounts and growth in companion animal driven by momentum from [indiscernible]; and then finally in the U.K., which was up 12% based on strong performance on Stronghold and the addition of the Abbott Animal Health products.
Looking at species in the international group, livestock was up 6%, with cattle and swine offsetting lower sales of poultry products. Companion animal grew 8% operationally, primarily from sales of APOQUEL in Spain, Italy and Germany, a pickup in sales of pesticide products in Western Europe, Australia, Canada and China and strong vaccine sales in China. I should note that other emerging markets grew 10% operationally and that included growth in Venezuela. You'll recall that we are reducing our activities in Venezuela pending an improvement in the economic environment there for multinational companies. We're selling down on inventories in the country and we limit our future exploits to Venezuela. Accordingly, sales and growth in this market will trend down over the balance of the year and continuing into 2016 at significantly lower levels. This impact of our reduced emphasis in Venezuela is reflected in our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Turning to our operational efficiency initiative and I'll give this from the financial guidance perspective, I'll start with the punch line. We're on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of operating expense reductions by calendar 2017. And as we implement the changes we need to deliver those savings, [indiscernible] interconnected capabilities to form our competitive advantage, our industry-leading direct salesforce, our highly productive R&D engine and our global supply chain. When we enter 2017, we'll reduce the direct presence in all of the markets around the world that matter, and we will be promoting a portfolio comprised of the products that matter to our customers and have the best prospects for delivering revenue and profit growth. 
We want to be transparent with respect to onetime costs, and I want to call your attention in the chart in the second quarter and broken down into 3 buckets: first, the standup and other onetime costs, which are mainly associated with our separation with Pfizer, holding $39 million in the quarter. The lion's share of the standup costs should be behind us after Q2 in 2016. Next, we recorded $263 million of cost associated with the operational efficiency initiative mainly for severance and asset impairments driven by the changes to our organization. This included about $25 million in noncash charges. And finally, there's a bucket for our supply network strategy, which had $15 million of charges as we're still in the early stages of this initiative.
You can see on our webcast slide the current estimates of onetime cost expected to be recorded in 2015 through 2017. Please cash flow cash for these projects remained the same at our previous guidance.
Next, guidance for 2015. Based on our strong performance from Q2, we're narrowing our range for both revenue and adjusted EPS towards the top end of our range: for revenue, to $4.7 billion to $4.775 billion; and adjusted EPS to $1.63 to $1.68 per share. 
With respect to operating expenses, as I said earlier, we made excellent progress paring back operating expenses for the first half of 2015. It's worth pointing out that there are some natural trends to how we incur expenses. In 2014, we incurred 45% of our total operating expenses in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with Q4 being our highest expense quarter. That's a trend that you expect to see continued into 2015, but we expect to have more balance between Q3 and Q4 than in the past, which was more heavily weighted in Q4. Please keep that in mind as you think about the balance of this year.
Turning to our longer-term guidance for 2016 and 2017. We're affirming our expectations for 2016 and '17 and call your attention to the tables included as part of our press release. While thinking about the longer term, I want to point out that we have seen a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. As we said on our last call, but worth repeating, we intend to use our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilution related to the equity-based compensation that we provide to our colleagues, and I want to reiterate that the efficiency initiative will trigger an acceleration of some dilution under those plans. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $98 million at an average price of $46.19 per share. Next, you saw that we recently filed a shelf registration statement. While we have more immediate plans to raise capital, the shelf provides us with the financial flexibility, access to capital markets quickly when it is appropriate. Looking ahead over the next 6 quarters or so, we had a number of [indiscernible] in our cash including for standup costs, the cost implemented efficiency initiative, our dividend, our ongoing share repurchases and a $400 million debt maturity in February next year. So it makes sense to be prepared for that, right?
That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the line for your questions."

IN API, as we explained in some of our comments, it's a very complex manufacturing process and we had some delay in terms of producing all of the needs for finished goods. Now we have approximately, in our opinion, we meet the demands of the market, and we expect that very soon that we will be able to meet all the market demands in line with our expectations. So in 2015, as I said there, we plan to sell about $150 million, 1 5 0 and significantly increase the revenues in 2016. So I'm very confident that the situation is under control.

Let me start by saying, when we went live with the implementation of SAP in the U.S. at beginning of May, from a high level, the go live was and continues to be a success, and that's not to say that everything is perfect. I'd say on the good side, as Juan Ramón referenced, we have full control of our key business processes, and we have full integrity of our financial information. We have work to do is to address our ways in which our system changes has impacted on our customers. In the U.S. segment of our business our systems interface with tens of thousands of customers, and I'd say, the overwhelming majority of instances, the new system is working well, but that doesn't matter if you're a customer where our systems change has led to issues with respect to you and you being the customers.

So realistically, from a revenue perspective, we are going to be within our guidance range and we think that's pretty good. We're on track for '15. We're on track for '16. We're on track for '17.

And again, I don't want to focus too much on 1 quarter, but then if you look at our quarter, the second quarter of this year, we delivered 2% of our growth year-over-year from the introduction of products that have been in line less than a year, products like ACTOGAIN, our PEDv vaccine, Zoamix and a collection of all other products that are in line for less than a year.

We're not [indiscernible] of what we would for the line in terms of leverage, but what we have said is, we're generally thinking about target for us that's roughly 2.5 turns of EBITDA in our cash structure and the expectation is that the normal course ranging 2.5 to 3.5 turns somewhere in that vicinity. Now what we've also said is that given the right opportunity, we will be more aggressive in the use of that capital in order to be able to complete a value-generative transaction. So what does that mean? It means that we would look to balance our desire to maintain a solid credit profile and access to capital with how much debt can we put on a now and having a cliff halfway to reducing the leverage over a period of time. We really have the capacity to do good-sized deals within our company. And as I've said, the best time to do deals is when there's opportunity in front of you and we would use all available efforts in order to be able to fund and conclude the transaction that we felt was value-generative for all our shareholders."

Out of this 30%, 25% it's companion animal and where we see low risk, and then the rest, it's between MFAs and also injectable products there, which again we see less risk than probably which are provided to animals in feed. There are different levels of categories on the use of antibiotics that we can use on [indiscernible] duration and also different species in where the products are used. There have been significant rumors of comments made in poultry in where some of the producers have decided to move away from medical important antibiotics and to use nonmedical important antibiotics. So we have in our portfolio both and we think that we can provide to our producers mainly the poultry activity products that will meet their demand and also meet also consumer demand. So in our opinion, I think it's a risk that is manageable. And the advantage that I mentioned in many occasions is that we have a portfolio which is extremely diverse in terms of species, in terms of geographies, in terms of therapeutic carriers. And also very important in terms of [indiscernible] carriers when they move away from antibiotics, they need to increase significantly the use of vaccines to protect these animals. So again, we have a significant presence in vaccines so we can compensate any kind of impact on certain areas where we've increased in others."

Today, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter and provide updates related to the integration of Abbott Animal Health, the performance of new products and progress on our operational efficiency pr",1228,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter and provide updates related to the integration of Abbott Animal Health, the performance of new products and progress on our operational efficiency program. Paul will then provide additional perspective on the quarter and comment on our guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. All the growth rate that I am discussing today are rational, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
I'm very pleased to report that this quarter, we generated very strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on the strength and diversity of our business. The growth this quarter was driven by the positive performance of our portfolio in both companion animal and livestock. The addition of Abbott Animal Health, the growth of APOQUEL and other new products and continued discipline on operating expenses.
In the quarter, we generated operational growth of 11% in revenue and 20% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.43 per share. This performance continued to demonstrate our long-term net value proposition to grow adjusted earnings faster than sales. During the quarter, APOQUEL contributed 2% of the revenue growth or $19 million. Abbott Animal Health accounted for 2% of the revenue growth or $25 million and another 2% came from new product launches. The remaining 5% is related to the line of product performance including a 2% price increase. 
In livestock, we grew 8%, driven by strong growth in cattle and swine. Cattle revenue grew 9% with continued favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil, partially offset by the impact of the herd reductions in Australia. Swine products also made significant contributions this quarter, growing at 14% based on strong sales in the U.S. and China. In the U.S., the markets for the swine population were building after the recent impact of PEDv. We continue adoption of our key brands and a positive impact for new products like our beta-agonist ENGAIN. Poultry revenue grew 1%, reflecting new product launches, which were partially offset by the customer rotation of a medicated feed additive in certain Latin American markets. 
Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 15% due to additional sales from the Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of our key brand, such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space; and Stronghold and PROHEART in parasiticides. We feel very good about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health, and we expect to achieve the target we set from the acquisition in terms of revenue and cost synergies.
Now switching to some operational updates. We completed the go-live profile of our ERP system in the U.S. at the beginning of May as scheduled. From a systems and controlled point of view, the implementation was successful. However, due to a large number of our customers directly impacted by our change of systems, we have had customers experiencing a disruption in their services. The variability of these shipments and billing issues has been resolved, and customers should see the level of service improving and returning to the quality they expect and deserve from us. For implementation in other countries, we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 2016. 
As for APOQUEL, since April this year, we had significant increase from supply, and today, more than 13,000 veterinarians have access to APOQUEL in the U.S. and more in markets outside the U.S. We have the manufacturing capacity to meet future demands of the product, but the process of scaling up the active pharmaceutical ingredient or API has been challenging. We have now made necessary changes to improve the process, and we are continuing to ramp pattern [ph] manufacturing. While the situation is improving, we are not yet meeting all market demand. And our first priority has been to manage the solution of available supply to our locations and to fulfill orders for our current customers. With this in mind, we have temporarily suspended taking new first-time customers' orders for APOQUEL in most markets. We remain committed in making APOQUEL available to more new customers as soon as possible.
Given this change in our supply expectations, we now expect revenue for APOQUEL to be about $150 million in 2015 and to increase significantly in 2016. The productivity of our investment in new product innovations and product lifecycle development continue to support our future growth targets. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has granted us a conditional license for a first-of-its-kind antibody therapy that targets interleukin-31 or IL-31 to help reduce clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs. It represents another major breakthrough from our R&D platform based on new scientific insight into the pathway of allergic skin conditions. 
We continue to receive approvals for new indications and formulations of our key products and to expand our major products into new markets. In the second quarter, for example, we received approval of a new label claims in the U.S. and European Union for CERENIA, an antiemetic to treat and prevent acute vomiting in dogs and cats. We continue expanding the breadth of our Fostera swine vaccine franchise with new label claims in Canada and Latin America. And DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective, which has tapped an important market for swine, was launched in major European markets such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. 
We now shift to some comments and updates on the operational efficiency program we announced last quarter. As you will recall, the program we announced was designed to simplify our operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources for future long-term growth. We expect to generate cost savings of at least $300 million in 2017 and improve our adjusted EBIT margin from 25 in 2014 to approximately 34 in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve greater focus on key brands and markets. Our business leaders are moving ahead with the elimination of approximately 5,000 SKUs from a total of 13,000 and changing our distribution model in about 25 markets. Approximately 45 countries will remain with a direct sales model and generate 95% of our revenue. Meanwhile, we have begun the process of selling or exiting 7 manufacturing sites, and another 3 sites will be sold or exited in a later phase as part of our supply network strategy. We have also started job reductions as we reorganize and streamline our operations. 
We are making very good progress on implementation of our operational efficiency program, and I'm very optimistic about delivering or exceeding the target of $300 million in savings by 2017. While we are making these changes for efficiency, we remain absolutely committed to the business model that have been driving our success: our direct selling approach and world-class field force that differentiate us from the competition; our investment in innovation that drive [indiscernible] products and also ensure the lifecycle development of our portfolio; and our high-quality manufacturing and supply. 
In summary, we delivered excellent second quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, diverse portfolio and focus on expense control. And we are seeing good initial progress on the efficiency program that will make us even more competitive and profitable for the long term.
I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?"

The financial highlights of the quarter are revenue growth and cost discipline. Revenue grew 11% operational compared to Q2 of 2014, with growth coming principally from the addition of the acquired animal health -- excuse me, the Abbott Animal Health products, the ramp-up of APOQUEL sales and strength in our livestock portfolio. With respect to operating expenses, the steps we took early this year to reduce expenses in order to preserve our 2015 profit guidance in the face of currency headwinds enable us to hold the growth of our operating expense to 2% on an operational basis compared with the prior year quarter and keeps us on track to deliver on the 2015 portion of the efficiency initiative that we announced back in May. The strong revenue performance, favorable gross profit margins mainly due to the favorable impact of FX on cost of goods sold, and expense controls enable us to report very strong adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally and 14% on a reported basis. 
All of you that know me know what's coming next. While good performance in the 98 window looks great in the headline, we think about our business in terms of a year or even years. We don't guide the quarters and we don't manage the quarters. So please, view this quarter as a strong quarter and view it as what it is, an indication we remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2015 guidance and beyond. With that as a backdrop, I want you to know that we narrowed our 2015 guidance towards the upper end of the range, good stuff indeed.
I mentioned FX rates, and I want to again call your attention to the impact of FX on our reported results. Foreign exchange rates continued to mute our reported revenue and profit growth. FX rates reduced our reported sales by some $106 million compared with Q2 of '14 or roughly 1,000 basis points, while our adjusted net income growth was reduced by $12 million or roughly 600 basis points compared with the prior year's second quarter. The main objective is to measure our performance on an operational basis or on a constant currency basis, and on that basis, we delivered. 
As part of the operational efficiency program we announced in May, we've consolidated from 4 reporting segments to 2, U.S. and international. From here forward, our financial reporting will reflect this new structure. A few weeks ago, we issued an 8-K to provide you with a historical view of our 2014 and first quarter 2015 results in this new reporting structure, and I hope this helped you update the financial models in preparing for today's call. 
The consolidation of our business into 2 segments will reduce the cost and complexity of our operations. It also improves our decision-making accountability at the local market level, where we drive value. If you are really concerned that the consolidation of segments might reduce visibility into our performance, let me say that we believe that the revised disclosure, providing revenue details on most -- on -- excuse me, providing revenue details on our most important countries rather than a somewhat arbitrary geographic grouping should give you better visibility into the results and how we drive our results. 
In today's earnings release, you will see revenue for the U.S. and international segments as well as additional breakdown showing revenue for our top 11 international countries. This gives you visibility into the markets and the company are 80% of our sales. Approximately 20% of the remaining we have are being grouped and reported as other developed markets in other emerging markets. I will caution you that with the increased granularity of the revenue reporting, you use the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and I wouldn't read too much into that if you look at it on a single quarter in a single market in isolation. 
One of the strengths of our business model is the geographic diversity of our revenue and profit streams, particularly in livestock. we participate in global markets, and strengths and weaknesses in individual markets are generally offset by performance in other markets. 
Finally, we also provided a [indiscernible] disclosure the 2 segments showing revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses and pretax earnings. I hope you agree that our new financial reporting model is an improvement over the prior model.
Let me call your attention to a few highlights in the quarter. Juan Ramón mentioned this earlier, but it's worth repeating since it's a great way to  illustrate the ways in which we can grow our top line. Top line revenue, we delivered operational growth of 11% in the quarter, of which 3% was unit growth of in-line products, 2% was in price, 2% was from growth of APOQUEL, 2% was from the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products and 2% was from a range of new product introductions. I think in the second quarter, we covered all of the ways that we can deliver operational revenue growth.
Next, looking at the U.S., very strong growth of 17% over the prior year quarter. We delivered growth in all species, companion animal, cattle, swine, poultry and equine. In companion animal, the big drivers were the addition of the Abbott products and APOQUEL. In cattle, we had a continuation of favorable conditions supporting needs of our premium products, and we increased sales of ACTOGAIN. In swine, hog sizes are recovering from PEDv outbreak, and we have a positive impact on new products in the portfolio, the PEDv vaccine and ENGAIN. Finally, poultry grew largely from the reintroduction of our Zoamix products. 
In the international group, which grew 6% operationally, the top 3 countries contributing to the growth were Brazil, up 9%, mainly due to favorable conditions in the livestock segment and new product launches; China, which was up 26% with our livestock business benefiting from higher anti-infective use in some key swine accounts and growth in companion animal driven by momentum from Vanguard; and then finally, in the U.K., which was up 12% based on strong performance on Stronghold and the addition of the Abbott Animal Health products.
Looking at species in the international group, livestock was up 6%, with cattle and swine offsetting lower sales of poultry products. Companion animal grew 8% operationally, primarily from sales of APOQUEL in Spain, Italy and Germany, a pickup in sales of parasiticide products in Western Europe, Australia, Canada and China and strong vaccine sales in China. 
I should note that other emerging markets grew 10% operationally and that included growth in Venezuela. You'll recall that we are reducing our activities in Venezuela pending an improvement in the economic environment there for multinational companies. We're selling down on inventories in the country, and we limit our future exploits to Venezuela. Accordingly, sales and growth in this market will trend down over the balance of the year and continuing into 2016 at significantly lower levels. This impact of our reduced emphasis in Venezuela is reflected in our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Turning for a minute to our operational efficiency initiative, and I'll give this from the financial guidance perspective, I'll start with the punch line. We're on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of operating expense reductions by calendar 2017. And as we implement changes we need to deliver those savings, we are [indiscernible] interconnected capabilities that form our competitive advantage, our industry-leading direct salesforce, our highly productive R&D engine and our global supply chain. When we enter 2017, we will do so with a the direct presence in all of the markets around the world that matter, and we will be promoting a portfolio comprised of the products that matter to our customers and have the best prospects for delivering revenue and profit growth. 
We want to be transparent with respect to onetime costs, and I want to call your attention in the progress in the second quarter, and that's broken down into 3 buckets: first, the standup and other onetime costs, which are mainly associated with our separation with Pfizer, holding $39 million in the quarter. The lion's share of the standup costs should be behind us after Q2 of 2016. Next, we recorded $263 million of cost associated with the operational efficiency initiative, mainly for severance and asset impairments driven by the changes to our organization. This included about $25 million in noncash charges. And finally, there's a bucket for our supply network strategy, which had $15 million of charges as we're still in the early stages of this initiative.
You can see on our webcast slide the current estimates of onetime cost expected to be recorded in 2015 through 2017. Please note that cash flow cash for these projects remained the same as our previous guidance.
Next, guidance for 2015. Based on our strong performance from Q2, we're narrowing our range for both revenue and adjusted EPS towards the top end of our range: for revenue, to $4.7 billion to $4.775 billion; and adjusted EPS to $1.63 to $1.68 per share. 
With respect to operating expenses, as I said earlier, we made excellent progress paring back operating expenses for the first half of 2015. It's worth pointing out that there are some natural single trends to how we incur expenses. In 2014, we incurred 45% of our total operating expenses in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with Q4 being our highest expense quarter. That's a trend that you'd expect to see continued into 2015, but we expect to have more balance between Q3 and Q4 than in the past, which was more heavily noted in Q4. Please keep that in mind as you think about the balance of this year.
Turning to our longer-term guidance for 2016 and 2017. We're affirming our expectations for 2016 and '17 and call your attention to the tables included as part of our press release. While thinking about the longer term, I want to point out that we have seen a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. As we said on our last call, but worth repeating, we intend to use our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilution related to the equity-based compensation that we provide to our colleagues. And I want to reiterate that the efficiency initiative will trigger an acceleration of some dilution under those plans. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $98 million at an average price of $46.19 per share. 
Next, you saw that we recently filed a shelf registration statement. While we have more immediate plans to raise capital, the shelf provides us with the financial flexibility to access to capital markets quickly when it is appropriate. Looking ahead over the next 6 quarters or so, we had a number of costs in our cash included for standup costs, the cost in implementing the efficiency initiative, our dividend, our ongoing share repurchases and a $400 million debt maturity in February next year. So it makes sense to be prepared for that, right?
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line for your questions."

And API, as we explained in some of our comments, it's a very complex manufacturing process, and we had some delays in terms of producing all of the needs for finished goods. Now we have a process that in our opinion we meet the demands of the market, and we expect that very soon that we will be able to meet all the market demands in line with our expectations. So in 2015, as I said, we plan to sell about $150 million, 1-5-0, and significantly increase the revenues in 2016. So I'm very confident that the situation is under control.

Where we have work to do is in addressing the ways in which our system changes has impacted on our customers. In the U.S. segment of our business, our systems interface with tens of thousands of customers.

Let's talk about the year, and let's think about it in 2 halves. And please keep in mind that, as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, the net revenue as well will be ratcheting down over the second half of the year. And as Juan Ramón covered, we pared our expectations back for APOQUEL to the lower end of our communicated range. We still expect we will solve more than 4x last year's volumes but towards the low end of our formal year or previous year I think range for APOQUEL. Also bear in mind, when you're looking at our business in the second half of the year, our livestock, and that's been tagging along quite nicely, faces some very tough comps in the second half of the year. So realistically, from a revenue perspective, we are going to be within our guidance range, and we think that's pretty good. We're on track for '15. We're on track for '16. We're on track for '17. Now on the expense side, which I think will do have some more of the question around income, the income, where should you be. I did call on my prepared remarks the phasing in our OpEx. I said, 55% of our OpEx in the last year came in the second half of our year. We're expecting similar phasing in the second half of this year, although less pronounced than what you saw last year between Q3 and Q4. So you really need to take that into account in order to think about the full year. We tightened our guidance range. We continue to be on track. And we think for a very strong 2015 with a lot of moving parts and onto '16 and '17."

Our goal is to deliver more from self-developed products to that 1%. And again, I don't want to focus too much on 1 quarter, but then if you look at our quarter, the second quarter of this year, we delivered 2% of our growth year-over-year from the introduction of products that have been in line less than a year, products like ACTOGAIN, ENGAIN, PEDv vaccine, Zoamix and a collection of all other products that are in line for less than a year.

There are precious few companies that would make sense for us to work with. And the second thing that we talked about at our Investor Day back in November of last year is that based on our particular set of circumstances, we feel that in the an inversion transaction, the benefit, if you focus on the entity that is currently called Zoetis, that on offshore party could get would be roughly to reduce our tax rate by some 600 basis points. Market folks have suggested that there are other ways that it could be pretty dramatically beyond that.

And then the rest, it's between MFAs and also injectable products, which again we see less risk than probably which are provided to animals in feed. There are different levels of categories on the use of antibiotics that we could use to control duration, and also different species in where the products are used. There have been significant rumors or comments made in poultry in where some of the producers have decided to move away from medically important antibiotics and to use nonmedically important antibiotics. So we have in our portfolio both, and we think that we can provide to our producers, mainly the poultry activity products that will meet their demand and will also meet also consumer demand. So in our opinion, I think it's a risk that is manageable. And the advantage that I mentioned in many occasions is that we have a portfolio which is extremely diverse in terms of species, in terms of geographies, in terms of [indiscernible] carriers. And also very important in terms of [indiscernible] carriers when they move away from antibiotics, they need to increase significantly the use of vaccines to protect these animals.

Today, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter and provide updates related to the integration of Abbott Animal Health, the performance of new products and progress on our operational efficiency pr",1228,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter and provide updates related to the integration of Abbott Animal Health, the performance of new products and progress on our operational efficiency program. Paul will then provide additional perspective on the quarter and comment on our guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. All the growth rate that I am discussing today are rational, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
I'm very pleased to report that this quarter, we generated very strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on the strength and diversity of our business. The growth this quarter was driven by the positive performance of our portfolio in both companion animal and livestock. The addition of Abbott Animal Health, the growth of APOQUEL and other new products and continued discipline on operating expenses.
In the quarter, we generated operational growth of 11% in revenue and 20% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.43 per share. This performance continued to demonstrate our long-term net value proposition to grow adjusted earnings faster than sales. During the quarter, APOQUEL contributed 2% of the revenue growth or $19 million. Abbott Animal Health accounted for 2% of the revenue growth or $25 million and another 2% came from new product launches. The remaining 5% is related to the line of product performance including a 2% price increase. 
In livestock, we grew 8%, driven by strong growth in cattle and swine. Cattle revenue grew 9% with continued favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil, partially offset by the impact of the herd reductions in Australia. Swine products also made significant contributions this quarter, growing at 14% based on strong sales in the U.S. and China. In the U.S., the markets for the swine population were building after the recent impact of PEDv. We continue adoption of our key brands and a positive impact for new products like our beta-agonist ENGAIN. Poultry revenue grew 1%, reflecting new product launches, which were partially offset by the customer rotation of a medicated feed additive in certain Latin American markets. 
Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 15% due to additional sales from the Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of our key brand, such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space; and Stronghold and PROHEART in parasiticides. We feel very good about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health, and we expect to achieve the target we set from the acquisition in terms of revenue and cost synergies.
Now switching to some operational updates. We completed the go-live profile of our ERP system in the U.S. at the beginning of May as scheduled. From a systems and controlled point of view, the implementation was successful. However, due to a large number of our customers directly impacted by our change of systems, we have had customers experiencing a disruption in their services. The variability of these shipments and billing issues has been resolved, and customers should see the level of service improving and returning to the quality they expect and deserve from us. For implementation in other countries, we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 2016. 
As for APOQUEL, since April this year, we had significant increase from supply, and today, more than 13,000 veterinarians have access to APOQUEL in the U.S. and more in markets outside the U.S. We have the manufacturing capacity to meet future demands of the product, but the process of scaling up the active pharmaceutical ingredient or API has been challenging. We have now made necessary changes to improve the process, and we are continuing to ramp pattern [ph] manufacturing. While the situation is improving, we are not yet meeting all market demand. And our first priority has been to manage the solution of available supply to our locations and to fulfill orders for our current customers. With this in mind, we have temporarily suspended taking new first-time customers' orders for APOQUEL in most markets. We remain committed in making APOQUEL available to more new customers as soon as possible.
Given this change in our supply expectations, we now expect revenue for APOQUEL to be about $150 million in 2015 and to increase significantly in 2016. The productivity of our investment in new product innovations and product lifecycle development continue to support our future growth targets. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has granted us a conditional license for a first-of-its-kind antibody therapy that targets interleukin-31 or IL-31 to help reduce clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs. It represents another major breakthrough from our R&D platform based on new scientific insight into the pathway of allergic skin conditions. 
We continue to receive approvals for new indications and formulations of our key products and to expand our major products into new markets. In the second quarter, for example, we received approval of a new label claims in the U.S. and European Union for CERENIA, an antiemetic to treat and prevent acute vomiting in dogs and cats. We continue expanding the breadth of our Fostera swine vaccine franchise with new label claims in Canada and Latin America. And DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective, which has tapped an important market for swine, was launched in major European markets such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. 
We now shift to some comments and updates on the operational efficiency program we announced last quarter. As you will recall, the program we announced was designed to simplify our operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources for future long-term growth. We expect to generate cost savings of at least $300 million in 2017 and improve our adjusted EBIT margin from 25 in 2014 to approximately 34 in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve greater focus on key brands and markets. Our business leaders are moving ahead with the elimination of approximately 5,000 SKUs from a total of 13,000 and changing our distribution model in about 25 markets. Approximately 45 countries will remain with a direct sales model and generate 95% of our revenue. Meanwhile, we have begun the process of selling or exiting 7 manufacturing sites, and another 3 sites will be sold or exited in a later phase as part of our supply network strategy. We have also started job reductions as we reorganize and streamline our operations. 
We are making very good progress on implementation of our operational efficiency program, and I'm very optimistic about delivering or exceeding the target of $300 million in savings by 2017. While we are making these changes for efficiency, we remain absolutely committed to the business model that have been driving our success: our direct selling approach and world-class field force that differentiate us from the competition; our investment in innovation that drive break-through products and also ensure the lifecycle development of our portfolio; and our high-quality manufacturing and supply. 
In summary, we delivered excellent second quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, diverse portfolio and focus on expense control. And we are seeing good initial progress on the efficiency program that will make us even more competitive and profitable for the long term.
I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?"

The financial highlights of the quarter are revenue growth and cost discipline. Revenue were up 11% operational compared to Q2 of 2014, with growth coming principally from the addition of the acquired animal health -- excuse me, the Abbott Animal Health products, the ramp-up of APOQUEL sales and strength in our livestock portfolio. With respect to operating expenses, the steps we took early this year to reduce expenses in order to preserve our 2015 profit guidance in the face of currency headwinds enable us to hold the growth of our operating expense to 2% on an operational basis compared with the prior year quarter and keeps us on track to deliver on the 2015 portion of the efficiency initiative that we announced back in May. The strong revenue performance, favorable gross profit margins mainly due to the favorable impact of FX on cost of goods sold, and expense controls enable us to report very strong adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally and 14% on a reported basis. 
All of you that know me know what's coming next. While good performance in the 98 window looks great in the headline, we think about our business in terms of a year or even years. We don't guide the quarters and we don't manage the quarters. So please, view this quarter as a strong quarter and view it as what it is, an indication we remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2015 guidance and beyond. With that as a backdrop, I want you to know that we narrowed our 2015 guidance towards the upper end of the range, good stuff indeed.
I mentioned FX rates, and I want to again call your attention to the impact of FX on our reported results. Foreign exchange rates continued to mute our reported revenue and profit growth. FX rates reduced our reported sales by some $106 million compared with Q2 of '14 or roughly 1,000 basis points, while our adjusted net income growth was reduced by $12 million or roughly 600 basis points compared with the prior year's second quarter. The main objective is to measure our performance on an operational basis or on a constant currency basis, and on that basis, we delivered. 
As part of the operational efficiency program we announced in May, we've consolidated from 4 reporting segments to 2, U.S. and international. From here forward, our financial reporting will reflect this new structure. A few weeks ago, we issued an 8-K to provide you with a historical view of our 2014 and first quarter 2015 results in this new reporting structure, and I hope this helped you update the financial models in preparing for today's call. 
The consolidation of our business into 2 segments will reduce the cost and complexity of our operations. It also improves our decision-making accountability at the local market level, where we drive value. If you are really concerned that the consolidation of segments might reduce visibility into our performance, let me say that we believe that the revised disclosure, providing revenue details on most -- on -- excuse me, providing revenue details on our most important countries rather than a somewhat arbitrary geographic grouping should give you better visibility into the results and how we drive our results. 
In today's earnings release, you will see revenue for the U.S. and international segments as well as additional breakdown showing revenue for our top 11 international countries. This gives you visibility into the markets and the company are 80% of our sales. Approximately 20% of the remaining we have are being grouped and reported as other developed markets in other emerging markets. I will caution you that with the increased granularity of the revenue reporting, you will see the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and I wouldn't read too much into that if you look at it on a single quarter in a single market in isolation. 
One of the strengths of our business model is the geographic diversity of our revenue and profit streams, particularly in livestock. we participate in global markets, and strengths and weaknesses in individual markets are generally offset by performance in other markets. 
Finally, we also provided enhanced disclosure the 2 segments showing revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses and pretax earnings. I hope you agree that our new financial reporting model is an improvement over the prior model.
Let me call your attention to a few highlights in the quarter. Juan Ramón mentioned this earlier, but it's worth repeating since it's a great way to  illustrate the ways in which we can grow our top line. Top line revenue, we delivered operational growth of 11% in the quarter, of which 3% was unit growth of in-line products, 2% was in price, 2% was from growth of APOQUEL, 2% was from the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products and 2% was from a range of new product introductions. I think in the second quarter, we covered all of the ways that we can deliver operational revenue growth.
Next, looking at the U.S., very strong growth of 17% over the prior year quarter. We delivered growth in all species, companion animal, cattle, swine, poultry and equine. In companion animal, the big drivers were the addition of the Abbott products and APOQUEL. In cattle, we had a continuation of favorable conditions supporting needs of our premium products, and we increased sales of ACTOGAIN. In swine, hog sizes are recovering from PEDv outbreak, and we have a positive impact on new products in the portfolio, the PEDv vaccine and ENGAIN. Finally, poultry grew largely from the reintroduction of our Zoamix products. 
In the international group, which grew 6% operationally, the top 3 countries contributing to the growth were Brazil, up 9%, mainly due to favorable conditions in the livestock segment and new product launches; China, which was up 26% with our livestock business benefiting from higher anti-infective use in some key swine accounts and growth in companion animal driven by momentum from Vanguard; and then finally, in the U.K., which was up 12% based on strong performance on Stronghold and the addition of the Abbott Animal Health products.
Looking at species in the international group, livestock was up 6%, with cattle and swine offsetting lower sales of poultry products. Companion animal grew 8% operationally, primarily from sales of APOQUEL in Spain, Italy and Germany, a pickup in sales of parasiticide products in Western Europe, Australia, Canada and China and strong vaccine sales in China. 
I should note that other emerging markets grew 10% operationally and that included growth in Venezuela. You'll recall that we are reducing our activities in Venezuela pending an improvement in the economic environment there for multinational companies. We're selling down on inventories in the country, and we limit our future exports to Venezuela. Accordingly, sales and growth in this market will trend down over the balance of the year and continuing into 2016 at significantly lower levels. This impact of our reduced emphasis in Venezuela is reflected in our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Turning for a minute to our operational efficiency initiative, and I'll give this from the financial guidance perspective, I'll start with the punch line. We're on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of operating expense reductions by calendar 2017. And as we implement changes we need to deliver those savings, we are leaving intact the 3 interconnected capabilities that form our competitive advantage, our industry-leading direct salesforce, our highly productive R&D engine and our global supply chain. When we enter 2017, we will do so with a the direct presence in all of the markets around the world that matter, and we will be promoting a portfolio comprised of the products that matter to our customers and have the best prospects for delivering revenue and profit growth. 
We want to be transparent with respect to onetime costs, and I want to call your attention in the progress in the second quarter, and that's broken down into 3 buckets: first, the standup and other onetime costs, which are mainly associated with our separation with Pfizer, totaling $39 million in the quarter. The lion's share of the standup costs should be behind us after Q2 of 2016. Next, we recorded $263 million of cost associated with the operational efficiency initiative, mainly for severance and asset impairments attributed by the changes to our organization. This included about $25 million in noncash charges. And finally, there's a bucket for our supply network strategy, which had $15 million of charges as we're still in the early stages of this initiative.
You can see on our webcast slide the current estimates of onetime cost expected to be recorded in 2015 through 2017. Please note that cash flow cash for these projects remained the same as our previous guidance.
Next, guidance for 2015. Based on our strong performance from Q2, we're narrowing our range for both revenue and adjusted EPS towards the top end of our range: for revenue, to $4.7 billion to $4.775 billion; and adjusted EPS to $1.63 to $1.68 per share. 
With respect to operating expenses, as I said earlier, we made excellent progress paring back operating expenses for the first half of 2015. It's worth pointing out that there are some natural single trends to how we incur expenses. In 2014, we incurred 45% of our total operating expenses in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with Q4 being our highest expense quarter. That's a trend that you'd expect to see continued into 2015, but we expect to have more balance between Q3 and Q4 than in the past, which was more heavily noted in Q4. Please keep that in mind as you think about the balance of this year.
Turning to our longer-term guidance for 2016 and 2017. We're affirming our expectations for 2016 and '17 and call your attention to the tables included as part of our press release. While thinking about the longer term, I want to point out that we have seen a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. As we said on our last call, but worth repeating, we intend to use our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilution related to the equity-based compensation that we provide to our colleagues. And I want to reiterate that the efficiency initiative will trigger an acceleration of some dilution under those plans. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $98 million at an average price of $46.19 per share. 
Next, you saw that we recently filed a shelf registration statement. While we have more immediate plans to raise capital, the shelf provides us with the financial flexibility to access to capital markets quickly when it is appropriate. Looking ahead over the next 6 quarters or so, we had a number of calls on our cash included for standup costs, the cost in implementing the efficiency initiative, our dividend, our ongoing share repurchases and a $400 million debt maturity in February next year. So it makes sense to be prepared for that, right?
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line for your questions."

So in terms of APOQUEL, as I said, we were able to increase significantly the supply from equine, but still, we are facing some challenging ramping up in the manufacturing of API. And API, as we explained in some of our comments, it's a very complex manufacturing process, and we had some delays in terms of producing all of the needs for finished goods. Now we have a process that in our opinion we meet the demands of the market, and we expect that very soon that we will be able to meet all the market demands in line with our expectations. So in 2015, as I said, we plan to sell about $150 million, 1-5-0, and significantly increase the revenues in 2016. So I'm very confident that the situation is under control. We have all the capacity that we need to produce the API and also to produce the finished goods. And very soon, the market would start getting all the needs from our customers.

And I got an e-mail here, it said, it sounded like I was talking through a tin can, so I changed microphones, so I hope this is better sound quality for everybody. Let me start by saying, when we went live with the implementation of SAP in the U.S. at the beginning of May, from a high level, the go live was and continues to be a success. And that's not to say that everything is perfect. I'd say on a good side, as Juan Ramón referenced, we have full control of our key business processes, and we have full integrity of our financial information. Where we have work to do is in addressing the ways in which our system changes has impacted on our customers. In the U.S. segment of our business, our systems interface with tens of thousands of customers. And I'd say, in the overwhelming majority of instances, the new system is working well, but that doesn't matter if you're a customer where our systems change has led to issues with respect to you, you being the customer. So addressing all of those issues is and continues to be a top priority for us, and we will continue to commit resources for resolving outstanding issues. I can assure you, and I'm sure others on the line, including I'm sure some of our customers, this is something that Juan Ramón and I think about every day. Last thing on this I hope is -- I've been involved in a number of SAP implementations and all of them have been successful, and none of them have been without bumps in the road. We're going to call this implementation a success when our customers are happy with the level of our customer service. And we've got work to do there, and we're on it, and we're on it every day."

Let's talk about the year, and let's think about it in 2 halves. And please keep in mind that, as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, the net revenue as well will be ratcheting down over the second half of the year. And as Juan Ramón covered, we pared our expectations back for APOQUEL to the lower end of our communicated range. We still expect we will sell more than 4x last year's volumes but towards the low end of our formal year or previous year I think range for APOQUEL. Also bear in mind, when you're looking at our business in the second half of the year, our livestock business, and that's been chugging along quite nicely, faces some very tough comps in the second half of the year. So realistically, from a revenue perspective, we are going to be within our guidance range, and we think that's pretty good. We're on track for '15. We're on track for '16. We're on track for '17. Now on the expense side, which I think really drives more of the question around income, the income, where should you be. I did call on my prepared remarks the phasing in our OpEx. I said, 55% of our OpEx in the last year came in the second half of our year. We're expecting similar phasing in the second half of this year, although less pronounced than what you saw last year between Q3 and Q4. So you really need to take that into account in order to think about the full year. We tightened our guidance range. We continue to be on track. And we think for a very strong 2015 with a lot of moving parts and onto '16 and '17."

We look at in-market products and technologies, and we will look at company acquisitions. I want to point out that we use a return-based framework to evaluate transactions. We're looking for deals that add value and cash flow and we feel it will be value-generative to our shareholders as we look to pursue those deals.

We talked many times that we look for every opportunity to grind that rate down, and it is a grind. It's not something that there's a magic bullet that we can put in place a new structure and magically reduce our tax rate by several 100 basis points. We do what we can. We think we have a good solid supportable structure, and that's what's included in our guidance over the long term. Yes, with respect to an inversion, we've talked about this as well. There are precious few companies that would make sense for us to work with. And the second thing that we talked about at our Investor Day back in November of last year is that based on our particular set of circumstances, we feel that in the an inversion transaction, the benefit, if you focus on the entity that is currently called Zoetis, that on offshore party could get would be roughly to reduce our tax rate by some 600 basis points. Market folks have suggested that there are other ways that it could be pretty dramatically beyond that. That's our point of view, and that's what we said back in November, and we continue to believe that. So an inversion transaction, well, could be helpful. It's not something that for us would take our tax rate down into the low double digits or single digits."

There have been significant rumors or comments mainly in poultry in where some of the producers have decided to move away from medically important antibiotics and to use nonmedically important antibiotics.

Today, I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for '15, '16 and '17. All of the growth rates I'm discussing today are operational excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
I'm very pleased to report that this quarter, we continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on our diverse portfolio of high-quality products, excellence in execution and our continued discipline on cost and expenses. Despite some [indiscernible] economic challenges, the animal health industry remained resilient based on the strong fundamental drivers for improved protein production and healthier FX. Our growth strategies and resources are aligned against drivers to expand our market leadership in the industry. The addition of PHARMAQ, a market-leading company in aquatic health, is an example of this growth strategy and will bring us another platform to strengthen our livestock business. 
[indiscernible] quarters ago was largely due to the performance of our livestock business in the U.S., the integration of Abbott Animal Health product into our business and the growth of the recent product launches led by APOQUEL. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 9% in revenue and 31% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 per share 5 0, and thanks to our efficiency improvement, reported adjusted net income due [ph] 22% despite a negative impact of foreign currency, which resulted in flat revenue growth. 
As we break down our third quarter revenue by species, companion animal grew 18% due to the recent death from Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space, REVOLUTION in pesticides as well as CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. I'm very positive about the progress we have made on the duration of Abbott Animal Health, and we expect to exceed the target we set for this acquisition in terms of revenues and cost synergies. 
In livestock, we grew 5%, driven by strong growth in cattle, which was tempered by relatively flat sales in swine and poultry. Cattle grew 8%. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil with our key brands and some recent product launches. This growth was also partially offset by the impact of our business reduction in Venezuela, a lower sales in France. As you may recall, we have increased customers orders in France. Last year, that came ahead of the introduction of the new anti-infective regulation. Swine products grew 1%. We delivered exceptional growth in China as a result of our strong portfolio and improving market conditions, which was offset by lower sales in Europe and Venezuela. Poultry sales were flat based on growth in Latin America including Brazil, which was offset by lower sales in other emerging markets and the U.S. The diversity of our portfolio across species, geographies and [indiscernible] areas continue to help us maximize opportunities in animal health while mitigating the risk that can arise in certain markets.
Now let me talk for a minute about our business in 2 markets with economies that have been getting our attention and where we continue to produce strong results despite overall economic volatility. In Brazil, the animal health industry is very resilient and not being impacted by the current economic decline there. Consumers are reducing their spending in other areas while maintaining their consumption of animal proteins. In some cases, we may see them switching from more expensive to less expensive meat. But since we are well positioned in other species, we have been able to sustain a strong livestock business. We are also at a very positive point in the cattle cycle in Brazil with tight supplies of animal and higher prices for meat. These place a premium on animal health and create incentive for our customers to build their health. 
In China, we also see exceptional revenue growth for our business despite some recent reports of a slowdown in their economy. Demand for proteins, especially pork, are showing strong growth, and we are seeing higher prices for meat in the market. The long-term trend of smaller farms consolidating into larger operations will also add to our growth as the swine population becomes increasingly medicalized and production becomes more efficient. While the economic challenge in China may impact other sectors, it wouldn't have a significant impact on the animal health industry, and China continues to focus on improving the quality and stability of its food chain.
Through the first 9 months of the year, we have continued to deliver on our [indiscernible] evolution by growing adjusted net income faster than revenues. Our production growth and revenue and adjusted net income were 9% and 22% year-to-date, and despite the impact of foreign currency, we have delivered 1% and 15% growth.
As I have said many times, our industry-leading salesforce, high-quality manufacturing and focus on new product innovation and enhancement remain key elements of our competitive advantage. 
Now let me turn to some of our updates. Last night, we announced our agreement to purchase PHARMAQ, the global leader in vaccine [indiscernible] for aquatic health. The acquisition is a great strategy that brings to Zoetis an animal health leader with similar competitive advantage and industry-leading portfolio, strong cash [indiscernible] and world-class innovation and manufacturing. PHARMAQ strengthens our livestock business by providing a market-leading portfolio and strong late-stage pipeline. Fish is the world's largest category of animal proteins and they are leaders in the fast-growing animal health market, farmed fish. The acquisition strengthens our core business in 3 key ways: pharma, expand our customer base into the farmed fish segment. It adds to our diverse portfolio a leader in vaccine for farmed fish and innovative parasiticide as well. PHARMAQ is the market leader in vaccine for farmed fish, a market growing 10% annually. And finally, it expands our R&D products in aquatic health with strong late-stage pipeline expected to deliver new solutions to the market in the near term. Zoetis has an excellent track record of identifying and integrating their businesses and this one meets all of our criteria in terms of [indiscernible] and value. We view the acquisition expected to close on or about November 10. I'm very excited to welcome the PHARMAQ team to Zoetis. Our companies share a passion for supporting customers and keeping animals healthy and productive, and that is a strong foundation to build upon.
We also continue to see steady progress in the new product innovation and life cycle development coming from our internal R&D team. In September, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for the initial marketing authorization of SIMPARICA, a 1-monthly dual medication for the treatment of fleas, ticks and [indiscernible] infestations in dogs beginning at 8 weeks of age. We await further news in Europe and the U.S. on potential approvals of SIMPARICA. I will keep you informed of future developments.
[indiscernible] to maintain our global R&D leadership and to grow in critical emerging markets. Just last week, we have strengthened our commitment to China. We announced the opening of a new research and development center near Beijing and the opening of a new global manufacturing facility in Suzhou, which replaces our regional plan that has been there since 1995. These investments are a strong foundation for future growth in China and the broader Asian markets.
Now let me turn to another topic that I mentioned last quarter, ERP implementation and APOQUEL supply. The [indiscernible] of the ERP implementation issues in the U.S. are being resolved and customers should be seeing the level of service improvement. And the third quarter, we have continued with successful implementation in another 27 markets, which cover Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 '16. 
As for APOQUEL, we have been able to resolve manufacturing issues related to our active pharmaceutical ingredient or API. We're also in the process of bringing on a second source for API supply in the near future. We continue ramping up production of finished goods in the first quarter of 2015. Although we now expect slightly lower sales of $125 million in full year 2015 than previously anticipated, we expect to be in a stronger supply position as we head into 2016. With the strong demand we have seen even though we have not yet fully launched this product to our customers, we are increasing our view of peak sales for the [indiscernible] to more than $300 million. We look forward [indiscernible] customers access to APOQUEL in markets like the U.S. and launching in additional markets around the world in 2016.
In summary, we delivered excellent third quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We continue to implement changes to reduce complexity and cost in our business and to strengthen our ability to execute on the market opportunities before us. And we'll remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, our diverse portfolio and continued investments in the areas that matter for our customers, high-quality customer service, relevant innovation and reliable supply. 
I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?"

Now I'll sound like a broken record, but I want to emphasize that we manage our business for the long term. And when we measure how we're doing, we look at years, not quarters. A lot of noise can creep in to any one quarter in isolation. For example, we have seasonal elements through our business that impact our customers' buying patterns and those patterns are not necessarily consistent year-to-year. The high productivity that we enjoyed from our R&D engine increase revenue growth but not necessarily in a linear fashion. My point is that 9% operational growth of revenue and 31% operational growth in adjusted net income for Q3 as compared with Q3 of '14 is good, but the year-to-date operational revenue growth of 9% and the adjusted net income growth of 22% and our revised guidance for the full year 2015, '16 and '17 are better indicators of our performance and prospects, and they look pretty good, right?
While we believe that the best way to evaluate our performance is on an operational basis, our guidance in your financial models are focused on expectations for our reported results. I bring this up because we've been able to maintain and now improve our 2015 guidance for adjusted net income per share in the face of unrelenting FX headwinds, and we're proud of that. 
Before I provide some comments around our guidance, let me call your attention to a few items of note in our quarterly results. Once again, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect the multiple ways that we can and do deliver revenue growth. Of the 9% operational growth in revenue in the quarter, 3% came from the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health products, 2% was driven by increased sales of APOQUEL, 3% came from the impact of increased selling prices and about 1% came from other new product introductions.
We have unit growth in our other in-line products other than APOQUEL of about 1% but that growth was offset by reduced sales in Venezuela. Now there's a real balance in how we generate revenue growth and continuing evidence that we can tap all of these forces to drive growth at or faster than the projected mid-single-digit growth rates of the markets in which we compete. 
A few highlights. The U.S. business was very strong, posting 19% growth Q3 over Q3 of '14. The companion animal business was up 27% and livestock was up 13%. Within companion animal, the big drivers were the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products, increased sales of APOQUEL as we continue to ramp up the supply of the product and strength across other key products including REVOLUTION, CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. 
In livestock, strong sales of cattle products, for example DRAXXIN and ceftiofur led the way while we had more modest gains in swine and a slight decline in poultry. Buying patterns, particularly in the livestock segment, can fluctuate due to weather patterns and herd movements. Q3 of 2015 saw seasonal demand for livestock products pick up earlier in the year than we observed in 2014. The outlook for the second half of 2015 remains solid but with revenue skewed more towards Q3 than we saw in 2014.
Turning to the international segment, which grew 2% operationally for the quarter. Let me highlight 5 countries that contributed to this growth in Japan China and Brazil and 2 countries, [indiscernible] and Venezuela where we saw declines compared with the year ago quarter. First, Japan. The significant increase in Japan, up 56%, is mainly due to the comparison with the weak Q3 of '14 when we bought back inventory in connection with the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Revenue in China increased 24% operationally as higher pork prices created favorable conditions for pork producers and supported strong demand for our vaccine products. Revenue in Brazil was up 12% operationally, fueled by price growth, new product launches and successful promotional efforts by our Brazilian colleagues in what is despite the broader economic climate a favorable environment of cattle producers.
Growth in Japan, China, Brazil and other markets were offset mainly by declines in France, which was down 27% operationally, and Venezuela. In France, Q3 '14 revenue was substantially higher than normal as customers bought product ahead of changes to France's regulation of anti-infective sales. In Venezuela, as we reported back in May, we are reducing our efforts in the country in light of this uncertain economic situation there.
Before I move on, I want to put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's comments around Brazil and China. There's been a lot of talk recently about the challenging economic environments in Brazil and China and the impact of those economies on global companies like ours. I won't repeat everything Juan Ramón said, but I do want to add a finance guy's perspective. The challenges in Brazil and China are real, but just how challenging they are depends on the segments in which you compete and other fundamental factors. Our business and our company tend to be less impacted by general economic conditions, and Zoetis' prospects in China, Brazil and related markets remain good. Our operational growth in China of 24% in Q3 was actually faster than was posted for the first half of the year. And in Brazil, our operational growth in the quarter of 12% was the same as our operational growth through the first half of the year. I bring this up because they will continue to be [indiscernible] about impact of these economies on global businesses and appropriately so. However, our belief is that our industry and our company are far less exposed to weakness in these economies than other companies and industries, and our historical results and our results so far in 2014 support that belief.
Quick update on our operational efficiency initiative. We're making excellent progress implementing the structural and organizational changes that will drive the cost reductions we outlined to you in May. We remain on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of cost reductions entering calendar 2017. I want to repeat that we have been, and continue to be, thoughtful in how we achieve those cost savings with a focus on efficiency and the preservation of the core strengths of our business model, our direct sales forces, our productive R&D engine and our supply chain.
In terms of one-time costs, you recall that I got [indiscernible] these cost in 3 buckets our standup and other one-time costs, the costs associated our efficiency initiatives and the costs associated with our supply network strategy. In the quarter, we incurred $28 million of standup and other one-time costs. The standup costs associated with our separation from Pfizer are largely behind us and should be complete in 2016. We recorded $21 million of one-time costs associated with efficiency initiative in the quarter, much of these cost -- much of the cost of the initiatives we recorded in Q2 '15. And finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with the supply network strategy. We continue to be in the early days of this initiative.
We've provided a slide summarizing our current estimates of the total cash costs associated with each bucket. Now here's the payoff pitch, updates to our guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. The good news here is that there's a lot of good news. Let's start with 2015. We narrowed and revised our guidance range for revenue. Let's not lose sight of the negative impact of FX rates but reduce the rate by some $25 million since our last update. We reduced the top end of the range by $25 million but held the low end of the range. Next, we have reduced the expectation for adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue by some 50 to 100 basis points to now be approximately 35%. Of this improvement, some comes from the favorable impact of FX rates, so those benefits may be judicious but some of improvement is structural and it represents improvements in the management of the supply chain. For SG&A, we narrowed the range towards the upper boundary. For R&D, we decreased the range by $30 million to a range of $350 million to $370 million, reflecting a more rapid realization of some of the savings from the efficiency initiative. I want to point out that even though we're spending less in R&D, we continue to commit the necessary resources to support our rationalized product portfolio and to develop new innovative products to fuel our long-term growth. 
Finally, we revised our guidance for our tax rate on adjusted income down by about 100 basis points to approximately 28%. Part of this favorability is structural, coming from finance and simplification of our operating model as well as several discrete items that occurred during the quarter. All of these things together enabled us to raise and narrow our range for full year 2015 adjusted net income per share to $1.70 to $1.74 with the entire range of our revised guidance above the high end of our previous guidance. As I said, good news. 
Looking out to 2016, the negative impact of FX rates would've lowered our prior revenue guidance by some $105 million. However, a combination of factors has enabled us to increase 2016 revenue guidance by $75 million to $100 million. Supporting the increase are the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired -- Abbott products and APOQUEL and the addition of new products including IL-31 and SIMPARICA. New revenue guidance range for 2016 implies operational growth versus 2015 in the range of 3% to 5%. As a reminder, this growth rate is suppressed by the impact of the ongoing SKU rationalization and our decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela.
The increase of the range for SG&A cost is a result of several factors including cost [indiscernible] as a function of our now higher revenue outlook; second is the inclusion of SG&A cost to PHARMAQ; and finally, cost to support the launches of IL-31 and SIMPARICA. So I will point out launch costs for Animal Health products tend to be more modest and of shorter duration as compared with launch cost in human health. We reduced our outlook for R&D cost consistent with my comments around 2015, but then we added in cost associated with aquatic health R&D, which is embedded within PHARMAQ. 
The other significant change is the reduced expected tax rate on adjusted income from 30% to 28%. This reflects some structural benefits coming from the actions to further refine and simplify our global operating model which are expected to continue into future years. The net result of all the changes we are making to our outlook for 2016 is that we are revising upward our guidance for 2016 adjusted net income to the range of $925 million to $975 million with implied operational growth moving from 12% to 19% to the range of 14% to 20%. The range for 2016 adjusted EPS moves up to $1.84 to $1.94 especially in light of the FX headwinds, this is good stuff.
Finally, and I'll spend less time on it, 2017 guidance. In a nutshell, the negative impact of changed FX rates on previously provided revenue range is a reduction of about $115 million, but we are increasing 2017 revenue guidance by $175 million. The increase is driven by the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the inclusion of the new products IL-31 and SIMPARICA, where previously we are guiding to operational revenue growth in '17 versus '16 in the range of 3% to 7%, we now not guiding through a range of 4% to 9% and this is truly organic growth as the acquisitions from both the Abbott products and PHARMAQ are fully reflected in our 2016 guidance. 
I call your attention to the tables that contain all the details of our guidance in '17 and the changes from prior guidance and I'll just skip to the end. We're increasing our guidance of 2017 adjusted net income by $30 million to the range of $1.125 billion to $1.195 billion, implying growth on our operational basis in '17 versus '16 of 18% to 26%. And our guidance for adjusted EPS has been increased by $0.06 per share to the range of $2.24 to $2.38 per share. Again, strong and reflective of the team here taking all steps to drive profitable growth. 
Please note that in 2016 and '17, we assume cost a diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares as we expect our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilutive impact of our share-based comp plans. 
Speaking of our share repurchase program, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares for about $50 million at an average price of $46.92 per share. Through the third quarter, we purchased the third quarter year-to-date in 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for an aggregate $148.1 million with an average price of $46.45 per share. 
Before we move to Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the strength of our industry and our company in turbulent times. I have to say, we've been a little frustrated watching our share price drop lower while at the same time knowing that we are delivering across a range of activities that we believe are building the value of our company. We ended 2014 with a share price of roughly $43, not a lot different from our closing price last night. But here's a short list of the things that we've accomplished since the beginning of the year. In January, we closed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health business. In February, we put a strong full year 2014 on the board, delivering operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%. In May, we unveiled our operational efficiency program and provided you with a road map in the form of longer-term guidance as to how we intend to increase profit levels and improve our adjusted operating margin to the mid-30s. And we reported a strong Q1 2015 with operational revenue growth of 6% and adjusted net income growth of 14%. In August, we put a strong Q2 on the board. Year-to-date operational revenue growth of 8% and adjusted net income growth of 17% and we announced that we received a conditional license on the innovative monoclonal antibody for canine atopic dermatitis that which we call IL-31. Today, we posted strong Q3 of 2015 with year-to-date operational growth of revenue of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 22%. And we announced the acquisition of PHARMAQ, providing us with a market-leading presence in aquatic health, the fastest-growing segment of the Animal Health industry. That's a heckuva year. We're only through Q3. 
Our industry has continued to improve its many positive attributes, and coming up on 3 years since our IPO, we believe the team here has proven the strength of the Zoetis business model and our capability to deliver to you value. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. And so let's open the line for questions. Keith?"

I would say that the cattle, it's still facing maybe some limited production. Although the demand there has been reduced slightly because of the limited production, it seems that most of the producers are reducing the herd and sending less animals to their slaughterhouses. At the same time, in some markets, we have seen that the demand for beef has been changing slightly, but we remain very positive in terms of the cattle business in the U.S. In terms of poultry, the demand continued very strong. And I think we expect also that not a significant impact in terms of the avian flu affecting the meat part of the poultry segment, although these are affecting the egg production. And in swine, in 2015, we have seen a significant increase in the supply because of the PEDv, it's affecting and the farmers have been able to increase significantly the number of animals, and this also has been making pressure in terms of prices.

And I think your question, Erin, was around how do you think about this business [indiscernible] and personally, I would point out a couple of things. This is a business that shares a lot of the characteristics of our business, and these are long-duration assets participating in solid growth markets that are supported by a productive R&D engine. It's very similar to our business. There are cost synergies associated with our acquisition here. However, there's not a cost synergy yield. PHARMAQ have solid operations on the sales and marketing side as well as on the R&D side and of course in the manufacturing arena. And so from a cost perspective, this is not like the classic cost synergy deal. This is a transaction that puts a swirling in the space that's going to go quickly, that comes to us with a well-developed pipeline, featuring near-term opportunities to continue the attractive growth that they've delivered, and I'll get the start date wrong, but I believe that they've been growing a compound rate of about 2 14 about 17% in that business. And so that -- thinking about this business, this is more about supplementing our livestock business, getting into a space where we're not presently represented, and we love this deal. We love the value of this deal and we think you would too once it starts to play out over the course of the next couple of years. I think there was the third question where there was kind of capacity for the deal to say, we've had a great year so far in 2015. When you look at the Abbott transaction, it's a classic good deal for us. That came up a couple of times in our prepared remarks. We're doing better both in terms of guidance and driving revenue synergies and cost synergies on that deal. I wish there were 10 of those out there to be done every year. There just aren't. But when they come up, we would certainly look to pursue additional transactions on that, larger, more strategic transactions like a PHARMAQ. There are a handful of opportunities out there. Do we have the capacity to do it? Well we haven't closed this one yet. So then as this one goes up and that will continue to process looking for what that next opportunity is, M&A will continue to be an element of our strategy."

Now there were small productions or even back [indiscernible] productions. We have seen that it has a significant shift from this kind of production to more sophisticated production, and this is what is generating a significant opportunity for animal health industry that can provide the quality of produce that can increase the productivity of these farms.

Brazil remains a very strong market in terms of production of animal proteins for export. Brazil is one of the key markets in terms of export and they also have the benefit now of low cost in the country and also lower prices because of the real has been reducing against the dollar. So these elements are creating a very good momentum in Brazil. We have seen also Brazil that the cattle industry is increasing their herd. Prices of meat are also very positive.

It is supporting and has been supporting a substantial investment in R&D and continues to be -- continue to be a profitable business. But sure we want to providing the entire P&L for PHARMAQ and say, oh, here's exactly what they're doing but suffice it to say, do we think that the company, as part of Zoetis, fits with our model of long-term revenue growth and driving that over an extended period of time, and clearly, we see a lot of value there. I want to provide a P&L for PHARMAQ for 2014. I don't think it would tell you the whole story. The salient points again, I keep coming back to this, a base business growing very rapidly, a base business that has supported the investment of R&D and help them develop a pipeline that we see a great deal of value in as we go forward. With respect to gross margins, one thing you got to take into consideration, I called it out in my remarks, is that FX has a favorable impact on our reported gross margin, and that was, I believe, roughly 100 basis points, someone will correct me if I get that wrong, but I think it was about 100 basis points. As I say, that turns around if FX rates happen to go in the opposite direction, but yes, it's roughly 100 basis points. The rest of the structure of things that we've done in early stages of our supply level of strategy to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and, therefore, improve margins through doing things more efficiently in the supply chain, and those are permanent and structural, and that, over time, if this just the early start with respect to the supply network strategy, we've articulated in 2020, we expected another couple of 100 basis points of gross margin from the broader supply network strategy, which we're really at the very early stages."

There are movements mainly in Western Europe and we are talking on that, and this business has been incorporated in our guidance for '15, '16 and '17. Still, we consider that today, there are no alternative to treat animals. I think over than antibiotics. And in many cases, the only way to achieve the productivity that customers need, they also need to prevent disease with antibiotics. What we have seen in many markets including the U.S. mainly a reduction of antibiotics which are medically important for human.

If you asked us in June of 2014 so [indiscernible] can do 2 right down in the middle of a fair way business development deals in 2015, we would've had confidence that we can do that. But as we all know, whether or not you can actually do those 2 deals is always good material for debate. We're very fortunate that in '15 we had 2 different -- 2 very good and 2 very different type of deals present themselves, one the classic tuck-in acquisition, where as I mentioned before, it's worth mentioning again, we acquired at the beginning of the year. We have achieving greater than our target number on cost synergies and we're delivering revenue synergy. That's a great deal. I will do that deal 100 out of 100x. And then secondarily, for PHARMAQ, which for us, from a strategic perspective, is a value perspective, is one of those rare deals that comes around not all that often. When you think about the aquatic health industry, it's a roughly $400 million industry, and here's a company that in the very near term you'd expect to have a 25% or greater share of that rapidly growing segment, and it happen's to be a business that we know a lot about. I mean if you think about ourselves on a fundamental levels, what do we do? We are excellent at developing and promoting products to producers of animal proteins for human consumption. This is right in the middle of the fairway. But if you asked us a year ago or more than a year ago, gee, are you going to be able to do a deal like that, we would've been hopeful, but the opportunity is to present itself. Two important points. One is we will maintain the discipline to focus on business development opportunities where we can leverage our particular competitive strengths to build and drive value for our shareholders. We think that there are other opportunities for us as we look out into 2016 and 2017, and we will continue to pursue those opportunities. But I want to be clear, we're more likely to fall in the category of an Abbott type deal than a PHARMAQ type deal. That said, there's always opportunity. I'll stop there."

Today, I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make some comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for '15, '16 and '17",1564,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make some comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for '15, '16 and '17. All of the growth rates I'm discussing today are operational, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
I'm very pleased to report that this quarter, we continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on our diverse portfolio of high-quality products, excellence in execution and our continued discipline on cost and expenses. Despite some global economic challenges, the animal health industry remain resilient based on the strong fundamental drivers for improved protein production and healthier pets. Our growth strategies and resources are aligned against drivers to expand our market leadership in the industry. The addition of PHARMAQ, a market-leading company in aquatic health, is an example of this growth strategy and will bring us another platform to strengthen our livestock business. 
This quarter's growth was largely due to the performance of our livestock business in the U.S., the integration of Abbott Animal Health products into our business and the growth of recent product launches, led by APOQUEL. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 9% in revenue and 31% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 per share, 5-0. And thanks to our efficiency improvement, reported adjusted net income grew 22% despite a negative impact of foreign currency, which resulted in flat revenue growth. 
As we break down our third quarter revenue by species, companion animal grew 18% due to the additional sales from Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands, such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space, REVOLUTION in parasiticide as well as CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. I'm very positive about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health, and we expect to exceed the target we set for this acquisition in terms of revenues and cost synergies. 
In livestock, we grew 5%, driven by strong growth in cattle, which was tempered by relatively flat sales in swine and poultry. Cattle grew 8%. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil with our key brands and some recent product launches. This growth was also partially offset by the impact of our business reduction in Venezuela and lower sales in France. As you may recall, we have increased customers' orders in France. Last year, that came ahead of the introduction of a new anti-infective legislation. Swine products grew 1%. We delivered exceptional growth in China as a result of our strong portfolio and improving market conditions, which was offset by lower sales in Europe and Venezuela. Poultry sales were flat based on growth in Latin America including Brazil, which was offset by lower sales in other emerging markets and the U.S. The diversity of our portfolio across species, geographies and [indiscernible] areas continue to help us maximize opportunities in animal health while mitigating the risk that can arise in certain markets.
Now let me talk for a minute about our business in 2 markets, which economies that have been getting a lot of attention and where we continue to produce strong results despite overall economic volatility. In Brazil, the animal health industry is very resilient and not been impacted by the current economic decline there. Consumers are reducing their spending in other areas while maintaining their consumption of animal proteins. In some cases, we may see them switching from more expensive to less expensive meat. But since we are well positioned in other species, we have been able to sustain a strong livestock business. We are also at a very positive point in the cattle cycle in Brazil with tight supplies of animal and higher prices for meat. This place a premium on animal health and create incentive for our customers to build their herds. 
In China, we also see an exceptional revenue growth for our business despite some recent reports of a slowdown in their economy. Demand for proteins, especially pork, are showing strong growth, and we are seeing higher prices for meat in the market. The long-term trend of smaller farms consolidating into larger operations will also add to our growth as the swine population become increasingly medicalized and production become more efficient. While the economic challenge in China may impact other sectors, it wouldn't have a significant impact on the animal health industry, and China continues to focus on improving the quality and stability of its food chain.
Through the first 9 months of the year, we have continued to deliver on our value proposition by growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Our production growth and revenue and adjusted net income were 9% and 22% year-to-date. And despite the impact of foreign currency, we have delivered 1% and 15% growth. As I have said many times, our industry-leading sales force, high-quality manufacturing and focus on new product innovation and enhancement remain key elements of our competitive advantage. 
Now let me turn to some other updates. Last night, we announced our agreement to purchase PHARMAQ, the global leader in vaccines and innovation for aquatic health. The acquisition is a great strategic fit that brings to Zoetis an animal health leader with similar competitive advantage and industry-leading portfolio, strong customer relationship and world-class innovation and manufacturing. PHARMAQ strengthens our livestock business by providing a market-leading portfolio and strong late-stage pipeline. Fish is the world largest category of animal proteins, and they are leaders in the fast-growing animal health market: farmed fish. 
The acquisition strengthen our core business in 3 key ways: pharma, expand our customer base into the farmed fish segment. It add to our diverse portfolio a leader in a vaccine for farmed fish and innovative parasiticide as well. PHARMAQ is the market leader in vaccine for farmed fish, a market growing 10% annually. And finally, it expand our R&D program in aquatic health with a strong late-stage pipeline expected to deliver new solutions to the market in the near term. 
Zoetis has an excellent track record of identifying and integrating businesses, and this one meets all our criteria in terms of economic fit and value. With this acquisition expected to close on or about November 10, I'm very excited to welcome the PHARMAQ team to Zoetis. Our companies share a passion for supporting customers and keeping animals healthy and productive, and that gives us a strong foundation to build on.
We also continue to see steady progress in the new product innovation and life-cycle developments coming from our internal R&D team. In September, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for the initial marketing authorization of SIMPARICA, a 1-monthly chewable medication for the treatment of fleas, ticks and mange mite infestations in dogs beginning at 8 weeks of age. We await further news in Europe and the U.S. on potential approvals of SIMPARICA. I will keep you informed of future developments.
In our step to maintain our global R&D leadership and to grow in critical emerging market, just last week, we strengthened our commitment to China. We announced the opening of a new research and development center near Beijing and the opening of a new global manufacturing facility in Suzhou, which replace our regional plant that has been there since 1995. These investments are a strong foundation for future growth in China and the broader Asian market.
Now let me turn to another topic that I mentioned last quarter: ERP implementation and APOQUEL supply. The vast majority of the ERP implementation issues in the U.S. are being resolved, and customers should be seeing the level of service improving. In the third quarter, we had continued with the successful implementation in another 27 markets, which cover Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 '16. 
As for APOQUEL, we have been able to resolve manufacturing issues related to our active pharmaceutical ingredient or API. We're also in the process of bringing on a second source for API supply in the near future. We continue ramping up production of finished goods in the first quarter of 2015. Although we now expect slightly lower sales of $125 million in full year 2015 than previously anticipated, we expect to be in a stronger supply position as we head into 2016. With the strong demand we have seen, even though we have not yet fully launched this product to our customers, we are increasing our view of peak sales for the product to more than $300 million. We look forward broadening customer access to APOQUEL in markets like the U.S. and launching in additional markets around the world in 2016.
In summary, we delivered excellent third quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We continue to implement changes to reduce complexity and cost in our business and to strengthen our ability to execute on the market opportunities before us. And we'll remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, our diverse portfolio and continued investments in the areas that matter for our customers: high-quality customer service, relevant innovation and reliable supply. 
I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?"

The financial highlights of the quarter are, once again, strong operational revenue growth of 9% coming from a variety of sources and cost discipline that together, were the major factors in driving significant operational growth in adjusted net income, as Juan Ramón said, up 31% from Q3 of '14. 
Now I'll sound like a broken record, but I want to emphasize that we manage our business for the long term. And when we measure how we're doing, we look at years, not quarters. A lot of noise can creep in to any one quarter in isolation. For example, we have seasonal elements to our business that impact our customers' buying patterns, and those patterns are not necessarily consistent year-to-year. The high productivity that we enjoyed from our R&D engine feeds revenue growth, but not necessarily in a linear fashion. My point is that 9% operational growth of revenue and 31% operational growth in adjusted net income for Q3 as compared with Q3 of '14 is good, but the year-to-date operational revenue growth of 9% and the adjusted net income growth of 22% and our revised guidance for the full years 2015, '16 and '17 are better indicators of our performance and prospects, and they look pretty good, right?
While we believe that the best way to evaluate our performance is on an operational basis, our guidance and your financial models are focused on expectations for our reported results. I bring this up because we've been able to maintain and now improve our 2015 guidance for adjusted net income per share in the face of unrelenting FX headwinds, and we're proud of that. 
Before I provide some comments around our guidance, let me call your attention to a few items of note in our quarterly results. Once again, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect the multiple ways that we can and do deliver revenue growth. Of the 9% operational growth in revenue in the quarter, 3% came from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% was driven by increased sales of APOQUEL, 3% came from the impact of increased selling prices and about 1% came from other new product introductions. We had unit growth in our other in-line products other than APOQUEL of about 1%, but that growth was offset by reduced sales in Venezuela. Now there's a real balance in how we generate revenue growth and continuing evidence that we can tap all of these forces to drive growth at or faster than the projected mid-single-digit growth rates of the markets in which we compete. 
A few highlights. The U.S. business was very strong, posting 19% growth Q3 over Q3 of '14. The companion animal business was up 27%, and livestock was up 13%. Within companion animal, the big drivers were the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products; increased sales of APOQUEL, as we continue to ramp up the supply of the product; and strength across other key brands, including REVOLUTION, CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. 
In livestock, strong sales of cattle products, for example DRAXXIN and ceftiofur, led the way, while we had more modest gains in swine and a slight decline in poultry. Buying patterns, particularly in the livestock segment, can fluctuate due to weather patterns and herd movements. Q3 of 2015 saw seasonal demand for livestock products pick up earlier in the year than we observed in 2014. The outlook for the second half of 2015 remains solid but with revenue skewed more towards Q3 than we saw in 2014.
Turning to the International segment, which grew 2% operationally for the quarter. Let me highlight 5 countries: 3 that contributed to growth, Japan, China and Brazil; and 2 countries, France and Venezuela, where we saw declines compared with the year-ago quarter. First, Japan. The significant increase in Japan, up 56%, is mainly due to the comparison with a weak Q3 of '14 when we bought back inventory in connection with the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Revenue in China increased 24% operationally as higher pork prices created favorable conditions for pork producers and supported strong demand for our vaccine products. Revenue in Brazil was up 12% operationally, fueled by price growth, new product launches and successful promotional efforts by our Brazilian colleagues in what is, despite the broader economic climate, a favorable environment of cattle producers.
Growth in Japan, China, Brazil and other markets were offset mainly by declines in France, which was down 27% operationally; and Venezuela. In France, Q3 '14 revenue was substantially higher than normal as customers bought product ahead of changes to France's regulation of anti-infective sales. In Venezuela, as we reported back in May, we are reducing our efforts in the country in light of the uncertain economic situation there.
Before I move on, I want to put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's comments around Brazil and China. There's been a lot of talk recently about the challenging economic environments in Brazil and China and the impact of those economies on global companies like ours. I won't repeat everything Juan Ramón said, but I do want to add a finance guy's perspective. 
The challenges in Brazil and China are real, but just how challenging they are depends on the segments in which you compete and other fundamental factors. Our business and our company tend to be less impacted by general economic conditions, and Zoetis' prospects in China, Brazil and related markets remain good. Our operational growth in China of 24% in Q3 was actually faster than was posted for the first half of the year. And in Brazil, our operational growth in the quarter of 12% was the same as our operational growth through the first half of the year. I bring this up because there will continue to be hand-wringing about the impact of these economies on global businesses, and appropriately so. However, our belief is that our industry and our company are far less exposed to weakness in these economies than other companies and industries, and our historical results and our results so far in 2014 support that belief.
Quick update on our operational efficiency initiative. We're making excellent progress implementing the structural and organizational changes that will drive the cost reductions we outlined to you in May. We remain on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of cost reductions entering calendar 2017. I want to repeat that we have been, and continue to be, thoughtful in how we achieve those cost savings with a focus on efficiency and the preservation of the core strengths of our business model: our direct sales forces, our productive R&D engine and our supply chain.
In terms of onetime costs, you'll recall that I talked about these costs in 3 buckets: our stand-up and other onetime costs, the costs associated with our efficiency initiative and the costs associated with our supply network strategy. In the quarter, we incurred $28 million of stand-up and other onetime costs. The stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer are largely behind us and should be complete in 2016. We recorded $21 million of onetime costs associated with the efficiency initiative in the quarter, much of these costs -- much of the costs of the initiative, we recorded in Q2 '15. And finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with the supply network strategy. We continue to be in the early days of this initiative. We've provided a slide summarizing our current estimates of the total cash costs associated with each bucket. 
Now here's the payoff pitch, updates to our guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. The good news here is that there's a lot of good news. Let's start with 2015. We narrowed and revised our guidance range for revenue. Let's not lose sight of the negative impact of FX rates, but reduce the range by some $25 million since our last update. We reduced the top end of the range by $25 million but held the low end of the range. Next, we have reduced the expectation for adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue by some 50 to 100 basis points to now being approximately 35%. Of this improvement, some comes from the favorable impact of FX rates, so those benefits may be fugacious, but some of improvement is structural in that it represents improvements in the management of the supply chain. 
For SG&A, we narrowed the range towards the upper boundary. For R&D, we decreased the range by $30 million to a range of $350 million to $370 million, reflecting a more rapid realization of some of the savings from the efficiency initiative. I want to point out that even though we are spending less in R&D, we continue to commit the necessary resources to support our rationalized product portfolio and to develop new innovative products to fuel our long-term growth. 
Finally, we revised our guidance for our tax rate on adjusted income down by about 100 basis points to approximately 28%. Part of this favorability is structural, coming from the finance and simplification of our operating model as well as several discrete items that occurred during the quarter. 
All of these things together enabled us to raise and narrow our range for full year 2015 adjusted net income per share to $1.70 to $1.74 with the entire range of our revised guidance above the high end of our previous guidance. As I said, good news. 
Looking out to 2016. The negative impact of FX rates would have lowered our prior revenue guidance by some $105 million. However, a combination of factors has enabled us to increase 2016 revenue guidance by $75 million to $100 million. Supporting the increase are the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired -- Abbott products and APOQUEL and the addition of new products, including IL-31 and SIMPARICA. The new revenue guidance range for 2016 implies operational growth versus 2015 in the range of 3% to 5%. As a reminder, this growth rate is suppressed by the impact of the ongoing SKU rationalization and our decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela.
The increase to the range for SG&A cost is a result of several factors, including costs that move as a function of our now higher revenue outlook; second is the inclusion of SG&A cost for PHARMAQ; and finally, costs to support the launches of IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Well, I point out launch costs for animal health products tend to be more modest and of shorter duration as compared with launch costs in human health. We reduced our outlook for R&D costs consistent with my comments around 2015, but then we added in costs associated with aquatic health R&D, which is embedded within PHARMAQ. 
The other significant change is the reduced expected tax rate on adjusted income from 30% to 28%. This reflects some structural benefits coming from actions to further refine and simplify our global operating model, which are expected to continue into future years. 
The net result of all the changes we are making to our outlook for 2016 is that we are revising upward our guidance for 2016 adjusted net income to the range of $925 million to $975 million with implied operational growth moving from 12% to 19% to the range of 14% to 20%. The range for 2016 adjusted EPS moves up to $1.84 to $1.94, and especially in light of the FX headwinds, this is good stuff.
Finally, and I'll spend less time on it, 2017 guidance. In a nutshell, the negative impact of changed FX rates on the previously provided revenue range is a reduction of about $115 million, but we are increasing 2017 revenue guidance by $175 million. The increase is driven by the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the inclusion of the new products, IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Where previously we are guiding to operational revenue growth in '17 versus '16 in the range of 3% to 7%, we're now guiding to the range of 4% to 9%. And this is truly organic growth, as the acquisitions of both the Abbott products and PHARMAQ are fully reflected in our 2016 guidance. 
I call your attention to the tables that contain all the details of our guidance in '17 and the changes from prior guidance, and I'll just skip to the end. We're increasing our guidance for 2017 adjusted net income by $30 million to the range of $1.125 billion to $1.195 billion, implying growth on our operational basis in '17 versus '16 of 18% to 26%. And our guidance for adjusted EPS has been increased by $0.06 per share to the range of $2.24 to $2.38 per share, again, strong and reflective of the team here taking all steps to drive profitable growth. Please note that for 2016 and '17, we've assumed a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares, as we expect our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilutive impact of our share-based comp plans. 
Speaking of our share repurchase program, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares for about $50 million in average price of $46.92 per share. Through the third quarter, we purchased -- in third quarter and year-to-date in 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for an aggregate $148.1 million on average price of $46.45 per share. 
Before we move to Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the strength of our industry and our company in turbulent times. I have to say, we've been a little frustrated watching our share price drip lower, while at the same time knowing that we are delivering across a range of activities that we believe are building the value of our company. 
We ended 2014 with a share price of roughly $43, not a lot different from our closing price last night. But here's a short list of the things that we've accomplished since the beginning of the year. In January, we closed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health business. In February, we put a strong full year 2014 on the board, delivering operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%. In May, we unveiled our operational efficiency program and provided you with a road map in the form of longer-term guidance as to how we intend to increase profit levels and improve our adjusted operating margin to the mid-30s. And we reported a strong Q1 2015, with operational revenue growth of 6% and adjusted net income growth of 14%. In August, we put a strong Q2 on the board, year-to-date operational revenue growth of 8% and adjusted net income growth of 17%. And we announced that we received a conditional license on innovative monoclonal antibody for canine atopic dermatitis that -- which we call IL-31. 
Today, we posted strong Q3 of 2015, with year-to-date operational growth of revenue of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 22%. And we announced the acquisition of PHARMAQ, providing us with a market-leading presence in aquatic health, the fastest-growing segment of the animal health industry. That's a heck of a year and we're only through Q3. 
Our industry has continued to prove its many positive attributes. And coming up on 3 years since our IPO, we believe the team here has proven the strength of Zoetis' business model and our capability to deliver to you value. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. And so let's open the line for questions. Keith?"

I would say that the cattle, it's still facing maybe some limited production. Although the demand has been reduced slightly because of the limited production. It seems most of the producers are rebuilding the herd and sending less animals to the slaughterhouses. At the same time, in some markets, we have seen that the demand for beef has been changing slightly, but we remain very positive in terms of the cattle business in the U.S. In terms of poultry, the demand continue very strong. And I think we expect also that the not a significant impact in terms of the avian flu affecting the meat part of the poultry segment, although these are affecting the egg production.

This is a business that shares a lot of the characteristics of our business, and these are long-duration assets participating in solid growth markets that are supported by a productive R&D engine. It's very similar to our business. There are cost synergies associated with our acquisition here. However, this is not a cost synergy yield. They, PHARMAQ, have solid operations on the sales and marketing side as well as in the R&D side and, of course, in the manufacturing arena. And so from a cost perspective, this is not like your classic cost synergy deal. This is a transaction that puts us squarely in the space that's going to go quickly, that comes to us with a well-developed pipeline featuring near-term opportunities to continue the attractive growth that they've delivered. And I'll get the start date wrong, but I believe that they've been growing at compound rate of about -- through '14, of about 17% in that business. And so that -- thinking about this business, this is more about supplementing our livestock business, getting into a space where we're not presently represented, and we love this deal. We love the value of this deal, and we think you will too once it starts to play out over the course of the next couple of years. I think there was a third question where it was kind of capacity for more deals. I'd say, look, we've had a great year so far in 2015. Look at the Abbott transaction. It was a classic -- good deal for us. That came up a couple of times in our prepared remarks that we're doing better, both in terms of driving revenue synergies and cost synergies on that deal. I wish there were 10 of those out there to be done every year. There just aren't. But when they come up, we would certainly look to pursue additional transactions like that. Larger, more strategic transactions like a PHARMAQ, there are a handful of opportunities out there. Do we have the capacity to do it? Well, we haven't closed this one yet.

Let me start with China. China remains a market with significant growth potential. And we mentioned several times that the assumption there is increasing very fast because of the increase of middle class, but also very important for our industry. They are changing also the way they are raising animals. So in the past in China, there was a significant part of animals. I'm talking about pigs. Now they were small productions or even backyard productions. We have seen that it has significant shift from this kind of production to more sophisticated production, and this is what is generating a significant opportunity for animal health industry that can provide the quality of products that can increase the productivity of these farms. We have been also investing in China since many years. We have in China the infrastructure to maximize any new products that we are bringing to the market. We have been launching new products in China, some of them as a result of a JV that we formed a couple of years ago. And we are very pleased with all the things that are going on in China. As I said, we don't see that this economic slowdown is affecting the animal health industry. In Brazil, the situation is different. Brazil remains a very strong market in terms of production of animal proteins for export. Brazil is one of the key markets in terms of export, and they also have the benefit now of low cost in the country and also lower prices because of the real has been reducing against the dollar. So these elements are creating a very good momentum in Brazil. We have seen also Brazil that the cattle industry, it's increasing their herd. Prices of meat are also very positive. The only comment in Brazil is that we have not seen any reduction in terms of internal consumption. What may have seen, it's switching from more expensive meat to less expensive. If the situation remain in the future in terms of economic crisis, we need to assess if internal consumption will be affected. But so far, we have not seen any kind of reduction of meat consumption in Brazil. So the production for this country remain very positive. Yes, Paul will talk about the acquisition."

What did they do? They advanced -- they have advanced pipeline, which, for us, is a very important factor. And while they were doing that, they continued to deliver growth in their base business and build that company. So that company is worth a heck of a lot more today than it was in 2013, number one.

And clearly, we see a lot of value there. I want to provide a P&L for PHARMAQ for 2014. I don't think it would tell you the whole story. The salient points, again, and I'll keep coming back to this, is a base business growing very rapidly, a base business that has supported the investment of R&D and helped them develop a pipeline that we see a great deal of value in as we go forward. With respect to gross margins, one thing you got to take into consideration -- I called it out in my remarks, is that FX has a favorable impact on our reported gross margin, and that was, I believe, roughly 100 basis points. Someone will correct me if I get that wrong, but I think it was about 100 basis points. As I say, that turns around if rates -- if FX rates happen to go in the opposite direction, but yes, it's roughly 100 basis points. The were some structural things that we've done in the early stages of our supply network strategy to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and, therefore, improve margins through doing things more efficiently in the supply chain. And those are permanent and structural, and that, over time -- this just the early stop with respect to the supply network strategy.

If you'd asked us in June of 2014, so like, ""Gee, do you think you can do 2, right down the middle of a fairway, business development deals in 2015?"" We would've had some degree of confidence that we could do that. But as we all know, whether or not you can actually do those 2 deals is good material for a debate. We're very fortunate in that '15, we've had 2 different -- 2 very good and 2 very different type of deals present themselves: one, the classic tuck-in acquisition, where -- so I mentioned before, but it's worth mentioning again, we acquired in the beginning of the year. We have -- are achieving greater than our target level on what are cost synergies and we're delivering revenue streams. That's a great deal. I would do that deal 100 out of 100 times. And then secondarily, PHARMAQ, which for us, from a strategic perspective and a value perspective, is one of those rare deals that comes around not all that often. Yes, you think about the aquatic health industry, it's roughly a $400 million industry, and here's a company that in the very near term, you'd expect to have a 25% or greater share of that rapidly growing segment, and it happen's to be a business that we know a lot about. I mean, if you think about ourselves on a fundamental level, what do we do? We are excellent at developing and promoting products to producers of animal protein for human consumption. This is right in the middle of the fairway. But if you'd asked us a year ago or more than a year ago, ""Well, gee, are you going to be able to do a deal like that?"" We would've been hopeful, but the opportunity needs to present itself. Two important points: One is we will maintain the discipline to focus on business development opportunities where we can leverage our particular competitive strengths to build and drive value for our shareholders. We think that there are other opportunities for us as we look out into 2016 and 2017, and we will continue to pursue those opportunities. But I want to be clear, they're more likely to fall in the category of an Abbott-type deal than a PHARMAQ-type deal. That said, there's always opportunity. I'll stop there."

I start with the first question on macro environment, and then Paul will answer the tax rate. So the first thing it's -- we are not a human health company, and we try from the beginning to explain how different is animal health to human health. And the most important difference is that our business, it's a business-to-business model. We are not dealing with third-party payers. So our prices are defined by just a few market dynamics. So we sell what our customers, that are also paying, are willing to pay for based on the value that we can demonstrate to them. So regulating prices in an industry, which is just a market-driven industry, will not make any sense, but it's something that definitely, we don't see that happening. And in terms of what is the macro environment, we describe that our industry is very resilient to economic dynamics. We saw that in 2008 and '09. We also saw that in 2012 and the time of the drought, that our industry responded extremely well. So one of the characteristic of the animal health, it's predictability and sustainability. And we think that this is one of the attributes that make our industry very attractive to investors."

We are convinced that we have all what we need to compete in this space. We are #1 in swine, and we are #3 in poultry.

Today, I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make some comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for '15, '16 and '17",1567,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make some comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for '15, '16 and '17. All of the growth rates I'm discussing today are operational, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
I'm very pleased to report that this quarter, we continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on our diverse portfolio of high-quality products, excellence in execution and our continued discipline on cost and expenses. Despite some global economic challenges, the animal health industry remain resilient based on the strong fundamental drivers for improved protein production and healthier pets. Our growth strategies and resources are aligned against these drivers to expand our market leadership in the industry. The addition of PHARMAQ, a market-leading company in aquatic health, is an example of this growth strategy and will bring us another platform to strengthen our livestock business. 
This quarter's growth was largely due to the performance of our livestock business in the U.S., the integration of Abbott Animal Health products into our business and the growth of recent product launches, led by APOQUEL. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 9% in revenue and 31% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 per share, 5-0. And thanks to our efficiency improvement, reported adjusted net income grew 22% despite a negative impact of foreign currency, which resulted in flat revenue growth. 
As we break down our third quarter revenue by species, companion animal grew 18% due to the additional sales from Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands, such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space, REVOLUTION in parasiticide as well as CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. I'm very positive about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health, and we expect to exceed the target we set for this acquisition in terms of revenues and cost synergies. 
In livestock, we grew 5%, driven by strong growth in cattle, which was tempered by relatively flat sales in swine and poultry. Cattle grew 8%. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil with our key brands and some recent product launches. This growth was also partially offset by the impact of our business reduction in Venezuela and lower sales in France. As you may recall, we have increased customers' orders in France. Last year, that came ahead of the introduction of a new anti-infective legislation. Swine products grew 1%. We delivered exceptional growth in China as a result of our strong portfolio and improving market conditions, which was offset by lower sales in Europe and Venezuela. Poultry sales were flat based on growth in Latin America including Brazil, which was offset by lower sales in other emerging markets and the U.S. The diversity of our portfolio across species, geographies are terrific [ph] areas continue to help us maximize opportunities in animal health while mitigating the risk that can arise in certain markets.
Now let me talk for a minute about our business in 2 markets, with economies that have been getting a lot of attention and where we continue to produce strong results despite overall economic volatility. In Brazil, the animal health industry is very resilient and not been impacted by the current economic decline there. Consumers are reducing their spending in other areas while maintaining their consumption of animal proteins. In some cases, we may see them switching from more expensive to less expensive meat. But since we are well positioned in other species, we have been able to sustain a strong livestock business. We are also at a very positive point in the cattle cycle in Brazil with tight supplies of animal and high prices for meat. This place a premium on animal health and create incentive for our customers to build their herds. 
In China, we also see an exceptional revenue growth for our business despite some recent reports of a slowdown in their economy. Demand for proteins, especially pork, are showing strong growth, and we are seeing higher prices for meat in the market. The long-term trend of smaller farms consolidating into larger operations will also add to our growth as the swine population become increasingly medicalized and production become more efficient. While the economic challenge in China may impact other sectors, it wouldn't have a significant impact on the animal health industry, and China continues to focus on improving the quality and stability of its food chain.
Through the first 9 months of the year, we have continued to deliver on our value proposition by growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Our production growth and revenue and adjusted net income were 9% and 22% year-to-date. And despite the impact of foreign currency, we have delivered 1% and 15% growth. As I have said many times, our industry-leading sales force, high-quality manufacturing and focus on new product innovation and enhancement remain key elements of our competitive advantage. 
Now let me turn to some other updates. Last night, we announced our agreement to purchase PHARMAQ, the global leader in vaccines and innovation for aquatic health. The acquisition is a great strategic fit that brings to Zoetis an animal health leader with similar competitive advantage and industry-leading portfolio, strong customer relationship and world-class innovation and manufacturing. PHARMAQ strengthens our livestock business by providing a market-leading portfolio and a strong late-stage pipeline. Fish is the world largest category of animal proteins, and they are leaders in the fast-growing animal health market: farmed fish. 
The acquisition strengthen our core business in 3 key ways: pharma, expand our customer base into the farmed fish segment. It add to our diverse portfolio a leader in a vaccine for farmed fish and innovative parasiticide as well. PHARMAQ is the market leader in vaccine for farmed fish, a market growing 10% annually. And finally, it expand our R&D program in aquatic health with a strong late-stage pipeline expected to deliver new solutions to the market in the near term. 
Zoetis has an excellent track record of identifying and integrating businesses, and this one meets all our criteria in terms of economic fit and value. With this acquisition expected to close on or about November 10, I'm very excited to welcome the PHARMAQ team to Zoetis. Our companies share a passion for supporting customers and keeping animals healthy and productive, and that gives us a strong foundation to build on.
We also continue to see steady progress in the new product innovation and life-cycle developments coming from our internal R&D team. In September, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for the initial marketing authorization of SIMPARICA, a 1-monthly chewable medication for the treatment of fleas, ticks and mange mite infestations in dogs beginning at 8 weeks of age. We await further news in Europe and the U.S. on potential approvals of SIMPARICA. I will keep you informed of future developments.
In our step to maintain our global R&D leadership and to grow in critical emerging market, just last week, we strengthened our commitment to China. We announced the opening of a new research and development center near Beijing and the opening of a new global manufacturing facility in Suzhou, which replace our regional plant that has been there since 1995. These investments are a strong foundation for future growth in China and the broader Asian market.
Now let me turn to another topic that I mentioned last quarter: ERP implementation and APOQUEL supply. The vast majority of the ERP implementation issues in the U.S. are being resolved, and customers should be seeing the level of service improving. In the third quarter, we had continued with the successful implementation in another 27 markets, which cover Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 '16. 
As for APOQUEL, we have been able to resolve manufacturing issues related to our active pharmaceutical ingredient or API. We're also in the process of bringing on a second source for API supply in the near future. We continue ramping up production of finished goods in the first quarter of 2015. Although we now expect slightly lower sales of $125 million in full year 2015 than previously anticipated, we expect to be in a stronger supply position as we head into 2016. With the strong demand we have seen, even though we have not yet fully launched this product to our customers, we are increasing our view of peak sales for the product to more than $300 million. We look forward broadening customer access to APOQUEL in markets like the U.S. and launching in additional markets around the world in 2016.
In summary, we delivered excellent third quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We continue to implement changes to reduce complexity and cost in our business and to strengthen our ability to execute on the market opportunities before us. And we'll remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, our diverse portfolio and continued investments in the areas that matter for our customers: high-quality customer service, relevant innovation and reliable supply. 
I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?"

The financial highlights of the quarter are, once again, strong operational revenue growth of 9% coming from a variety of sources and cost discipline that together, were the major factors in driving significant operational growth i",2589,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. The financial highlights of the quarter are, once again, strong operational revenue growth of 9% coming from a variety of sources and cost discipline that together, were the major factors in driving significant operational growth in adjusted net income, as Juan Ramón said, up 31% from Q3 of '14. 
Now I'll sound like a broken record, but I want to emphasize that we manage our business for the long term. And when we measure how we're doing, we look at years, not quarters. A lot of noise can creep in to any one quarter in isolation. For example, we have seasonal elements to our business that impact our customers' buying patterns, and those patterns are not necessarily consistent year-to-year. The high productivity that we enjoyed from our R&D engine feeds revenue growth, but not necessarily in a linear fashion. My point is that 9% operational growth of revenue and 31% operational growth in adjusted net income for Q3 as compared with Q3 of '14 is good, but the year-to-date operational revenue growth of 9% and the adjusted net income growth of 22% and our revised guidance for the full years 2015, '16 and '17 are better indicators of our performance and prospects, and they look pretty good, right?
While we believe that the best way to evaluate our performance is on an operational basis, our guidance and your financial models are focused on expectations for our reported results. I bring this up because we've been able to maintain and now improve our 2015 guidance for adjusted net income per share in the face of unrelenting FX headwinds, and we're proud of that. 
Before I provide some comments around our guidance, let me call your attention to a few items of note in our quarterly results. Once again, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect the multiple ways that we can and do deliver revenue growth. Of the 9% operational growth in revenue in the quarter, 3% came from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% was driven by increased sales of APOQUEL, 3% came from the impact of increased selling prices and about 1% came from other new product introductions. We had unit growth in our other in-line products other than APOQUEL of about 1%, but that growth was offset by reduced sales in Venezuela. Now there's a real balance in how we generate revenue growth and continuing evidence that we can tap all of these forces to drive growth at or faster than the projected mid-single-digit growth rates of the markets in which we compete. 
A few highlights. The U.S. business was very strong, posting 19% growth Q3 over Q3 of '14. The companion animal business was up 27%, and livestock was up 13%. Within companion animal, the big drivers were the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products; increased sales of APOQUEL, as we continue to ramp up the supply of the product; and strength across other key brands, including REVOLUTION, CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. 
In livestock, strong sales of cattle products, for example DRAXXIN and ceftiofur, led the way, while we had more modest gains in swine and a slight decline in poultry. Buying patterns, particularly in the livestock segment, can fluctuate due to weather patterns and herd movements. Q3 of 2015 saw seasonal demand for livestock products pick up earlier in the year than we observed in 2014. The outlook for the second half of 2015 remains solid but with revenue skewed more towards Q3 than we saw in 2014.
Turning to the International segment, which grew 2% operationally for the quarter. Let me highlight 5 countries: 3 that contributed to growth, Japan, China and Brazil; and 2 countries, France and Venezuela, where we saw declines compared with the year-ago quarter. First, Japan. The significant increase in Japan, up 56%, is mainly due to the comparison with a weak Q3 of '14 when we bought back inventory in connection with the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Revenue in China increased 24% operationally as higher pork prices created favorable conditions for pork producers and supported strong demand for our vaccine products. Revenue in Brazil was up 12% operationally, fueled by price growth, new product launches and successful promotional efforts by our Brazilian colleagues in what is, despite the broader economic climate, a favorable environment for cattle producers.
Growth in Japan, China, Brazil and other markets were offset mainly by declines in France, which was down 27% operationally; and Venezuela. In France, Q3 '14 revenue was substantially higher than normal as customers bought product ahead of changes to France's regulation of anti-infective sales. In Venezuela, as we reported back in May, we are reducing our efforts in the country in light of this uncertain economic situation there.
Before I move on, I want to put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's comments around Brazil and China. There's been a lot of talk recently about the challenging economic environments in Brazil and China and the impact of those economies on global companies like ours. I won't repeat everything Juan Ramón said, but I do want to add a finance guy's perspective. 
The challenges in Brazil and China are real, but just how challenging they are depends on the segments in which you compete and other fundamental factors. Our business and our company tend to be less impacted by general economic conditions, and Zoetis' prospects in China, Brazil and related markets remain good. Our operational growth in China of 24% in Q3 was actually faster than was posted for the first half of the year. And in Brazil, our operational growth in the quarter of 12% was the same as our operational growth through the first half of the year. I bring this up because there will continue to be hand-wringing about the impact of these economies on global businesses, and appropriately so. However, our belief is that our industry and our company are far less exposed to weakness in these economies than other companies and industries, and our historical results and our results so far in 2014 support that belief.
Quick update on our operational efficiency initiative. We're making excellent progress implementing the structural and organizational changes that will drive the cost reductions we outlined to you in May. We remain on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of cost reductions entering calendar 2017. I want to repeat that we have been, and continue to be, thoughtful in how we achieve those cost savings with a focus on efficiency and the preservation of the core strengths of our business model: our direct sales forces, our productive R&D engine and our supply chain.
In terms of onetime costs, you'll recall that I talked about these costs in 3 buckets: our stand-up and other onetime costs, the costs associated with our efficiency initiative and the costs associated with our supply network strategy. In the quarter, we incurred $28 million of stand-up and other onetime costs. The stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer are largely behind us and should be complete in 2016. We recorded $21 million of onetime costs associated with the efficiency initiative in the quarter, much of these costs -- much of the costs of the initiative, we recorded in Q2 '15. And finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with the supply network strategy. We continue to be in the early days of this initiative. We've provided a slide summarizing our current estimates of the total cash costs associated with each bucket. 
Now here's the payoff pitch, updates to our guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. The good news here is that there's a lot of good news. Let's start with 2015. We narrowed and revised our guidance range for revenue. Let's not lose sight of the negative impact of FX rates that reduce the range by some $25 million since our last update. We reduced the top end of the range by $25 million but held the low end of the range. Next, we have reduced the expectation for adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue by some 50 to 100 basis points to now being approximately 35%. Of this improvement, some comes from the favorable impact of FX rates, so those benefits may be fugacious, but some of the improvement is structural in that it represents improvements in the management of the supply chain. 
For SG&A, we narrowed the range towards the upper boundary. For R&D, we decreased the range by $30 million to a range of $350 million to $370 million, reflecting a more rapid realization of some of the savings from the efficiency initiative. I want to point out that even though we are spending less in R&D, we continue to commit the necessary resources to support our rationalized product portfolio and to develop new innovative products to fuel our long-term growth. 
Finally, we revised our guidance for our tax rate on adjusted income down by about 100 basis points to approximately 28%. Part of this favorability is structural, coming from refinements and simplification of our operating model as well as several discrete items that occurred during the quarter. 
All of these things together enabled us to raise and narrow our range for full year 2015 adjusted net income per share to $1.70 to $1.74 with the entire range of our revised guidance above the high end of our previous guidance. As I said, good news. 
Looking out to 2016. The negative impact of FX rates would have lowered our prior revenue guidance by some $105 million. However, a combination of factors has enabled us to increase 2016 revenue guidance by $75 million to $100 million. Supporting the increase are the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired -- Abbott products and APOQUEL and the addition of new products, including IL-31 and SIMPARICA. The new revenue guidance range for 2016 implies operational growth versus 2015 in the range of 3% to 5%. As a reminder, this growth rate is suppressed by the impact of the ongoing SKU rationalization and our decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela.
The increase to the range for SG&A cost is a result of several factors, including costs that move as a function of our now higher revenue outlook; second is the inclusion of SG&A cost for PHARMAQ; and finally, costs to support the launches of IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Well, I point out launch costs for animal health products tend to be more modest and of shorter duration as compared with launch costs in human health. We reduced our outlook for R&D costs consistent with my comments around 2015, but then we added in costs associated with aquatic health R&D, which is embedded within PHARMAQ. 
The other significant change is the reduced expected tax rate on adjusted income from 30% to 28%. This reflects some structural benefits coming from actions to further refine and simplify our global operating model, which are expected to continue into future years. 
The net result of all the changes we are making to our outlook for 2016 is that we are revising upward our guidance for 2016 adjusted net income to the range of $925 million to $975 million with implied operational growth moving from 12% to 19% to the range of 14% to 20%. The range for 2016 adjusted EPS moves up to $1.84 to $1.94, and especially in light of the FX headwinds, this is good stuff.
Finally, and I'll spend less time on it, 2017 guidance. In a nutshell, the negative impact of changed FX rates on the previously provided revenue range is a reduction of about $115 million, but we are increasing 2017 revenue guidance by $175 million. The increase is driven by the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the inclusion of the new products, IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Where previously we were guiding to operational revenue growth in '17 versus '16 in the range of 3% to 7%, we're now guiding to the range of 4% to 9%. And this is truly organic growth, as the acquisitions of both the Abbott products and PHARMAQ are fully reflected in our 2016 guidance. 
I call your attention to the tables that contain all the details of our guidance in '17 and the changes from prior guidance, and I'll just skip to the end. We're increasing our guidance for 2017 adjusted net income by $30 million to the range of $1.125 billion to $1.195 billion, implying growth on our operational basis in '17 versus '16 of 18% to 26%. And our guidance for adjusted EPS has been increased by $0.06 per share to the range of $2.24 to $2.38 per share, again, strong and reflective of the team here taking all steps to drive profitable growth. Please note that for 2016 and '17, we've assumed a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares, as we expect our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilutive impact of our share-based comp plans. 
Speaking of our share repurchase program, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares for about $50 million, an average price of $46.92 per share. Through the third quarter, we purchased -- in third quarter and year-to-date in 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for an aggregate $148.1 million, an average price of $46.45 per share. 
Before we move to Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the strength of our industry and our company in turbulent times. I have to say, we've been a little frustrated watching our share price drip lower, while at the same time knowing that we are delivering across a range of activities that we believe are building the value of our company. 
We ended 2014 with a share price of roughly $43, not a lot different from our closing price last night. But here's a short list of the things that we've accomplished since the beginning of the year. In January, we closed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health business. In February, we put a strong full year 2014 on the board, delivering operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%. In May, we unveiled our operational efficiency program and provided you with a road map in the form of longer-term guidance as to how we intend to increase profit levels and improve our adjusted operating margin to the mid-30s. And we reported a strong Q1 2015, with operational revenue growth of 6% and adjusted net income growth of 14%. In August, we put a strong Q2 on the board, year-to-date operational revenue growth of 8% and adjusted net income growth of 17%. And we announced that we received a conditional license on the innovative monoclonal antibody for canine atopic dermatitis that -- which we call IL-31. 
Today, we posted strong Q3 of 2015, with year-to-date operational growth of revenue of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 22%. And we announced the acquisition of PHARMAQ, providing us with a market-leading presence in aquatic health, the fastest-growing segment of the animal health industry. That's a heck of a year and we're only through Q3. 
Our industry has continued to prove its many positive attributes. And coming up on 3 years since our IPO, we believe the team here has proven the strength of Zoetis' business model and our capability to deliver to you value. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. And so let's open the line for questions. Keith?"

I would say that the cattle, it's still facing maybe some limited production. Although the demand has been reduced slightly because of the limited production. It seems most of the producers are rebuilding the herd and sending less animals to the slaughterhouses. At the same time, in some markets, we have seen that the demand for beef has been changing slightly, but we remain very positive in terms of the cattle business in the U.S. In terms of poultry, the demand continue very strong. And I think we expect also that the not a significant impact in terms of the avian flu affecting the meat part of the poultry segment, although these are affecting the egg production. And in swine, in 2015, we have seen a significant increase in the supply because of the PEDv, it's not affecting and the farmer has been able to increase significantly the number of animals, and this also has been making a pressure in terms of prices. But for the animal health industry, it has been positive because there are more animals and more animals to be treated and protected.

I mean, first thing -- I want to point out a couple of things. This is a business that shares a lot of the characteristics of our business, and these are long-duration assets participating in solid growth markets that are supported by a productive R&D engine. It's very similar to our business. There are cost synergies associated with our acquisition here. However, this is not a cost synergy deal. They, PHARMAQ, have solid operations on the sales and marketing side as well as in the R&D side and, of course, in the manufacturing arena. And so from a cost perspective, this is not like your classic cost synergy deal. This is a transaction that puts us squarely in the space that's going to go quickly, that comes to us with a well-developed pipeline featuring near-term opportunities to continue the attractive growth that they've delivered. And I'll get the start date wrong, but I believe that they've been growing at compound rate of about -- through '14, of about 17% in that business. And so that -- thinking about this business, this is more about supplementing our livestock business, getting us into a space where we're not presently represented, and we love this deal. We love the value of this deal, and we think you will too once it starts to play out over the course of the next couple of years. I think there was a third question where it was kind of capacity for more deals. I'd say, look, we've had a great year so far in 2015. Look at the Abbott transaction. It was a classic good deal for us. That came up a couple of times in our prepared remarks that we're doing better, both in terms of driving revenue synergies and cost synergies on that deal. I wish there were 10 of those out there to be done every year. There just aren't. But when they come up, we would certainly look to pursue additional transactions like that. Larger, more strategic transactions like a PHARMAQ, there are a handful of opportunities out there. Do we have the capacity to do it? Well, we haven't closed this one yet. So we'll get this one closed up, and then we'll start -- or continue the process of looking for what that next opportunity is. M&A will continue to be an element of our strategy."

Let me start with China. China remains a market with significant growth potential. And we mentioned several times that the consumption there is increasing very fast because of the increase of middle class, but also very important for our industry. They are changing also the way they are raising animals. So in the past in China, there was a significant part of animals. I'm talking about pigs. Now they were small productions or even backyard productions. We have seen that it has significant shift from this kind of production to more sophisticated production, and this is what is generating a significant opportunity for animal health industry that can provide the quality of products that can increase the productivity of these farms. We have been also investing in China since many years. We have in China the infrastructure to maximize any new products that we are bringing to the market. We have been launching new products in China, some of them as a result of a JV that we formed a couple of years ago. And we are very pleased with all the things that are going on in China. As I said, we don't see that this economic slowdown is affecting the animal health industry. In Brazil, the situation is different. Brazil remains a very strong market in terms of production of animal proteins for export. Brazil is one of the key markets in terms of export, and they also have the benefit now of low cost in the country and also lower prices because of the real has been reducing against the dollar. So these elements are creating a very good momentum in Brazil. We have seen also Brazil that the cattle industry, it's increasing their herd. Prices of meat are also very positive. The only comment in Brazil is that we have not seen any reduction in terms of internal consumption. What may have seen, it's switching from more expensive meat to less expensive. If the situation remain in the future in terms of economic crisis, we need to assess if internal consumption will be affected. But so far, we have not seen any kind of reduction of meat consumption in Brazil. So the production for this country remain very positive. Yes, Paul will talk about the acquisition."

Yes, if you look at this deal on a near-term basis and say, ""Gee, you have accretion, it's neutral in the first year and then it's accretive thereafter.""

The salient points, again, and I'll keep coming back to this, is a base business growing very rapidly, a base business that has supported the investment of R&D and helped them develop a pipeline that we see a great deal of value in as we go forward. With respect to gross margins, one thing you got to take into consideration -- I called it out in my remarks, is that FX has a favorable impact on our reported gross margin, and that was, I believe, roughly 100 basis points. Someone will correct me if I get that wrong, but I think it was about 100 basis points. As I say, that turns around if rates -- if FX rates happen to go in the opposite direction, but yes, it's roughly 100 basis points. The were some structural things that we've done in the early stages of our supply network strategy to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and, therefore, improve margins through doing things more efficiently in the supply chain. And those are permanent and structural, and that, over time -- this is just the early stuff with respect to the supply network strategy.

It will always depend on FDA approval, but we are preparing for this launch in the U.S. and also the launch in European markets. In terms of France. France, we reported that last year, there was a change of regulation. So the change in their legislation was mainly eliminating rebates on sales of antibiotics. And then customers bought in anticipation of this new legislation. Definitely, we are monitoring any kind of changes in terms of restriction on the use of antibiotics. There are movements mainly in Western Europe, and we are talking of that. And this has been incorporated in our guidance for '15, '16 and '17. Still, we consider that today, there are no alternative to treat animals, just seek other than antibiotics. And in many cases, the only way to achieve the productivity that customers need, they also need to prevent disease with antibiotics. What we have seen in many markets, including the U.S., merely a reduction of antibiotics, which are medically important for human. But again, so we don't see that these are changing significantly our revenues in the U.S. for poultry because they will be moving to other antibiotics that we also have in our portfolio."

I guess my question is just how many more assets like PHARMAQ or Abbott are out there? Is it a large universe or is that a fairly targeted group of companies or divisions of companies you can target?

In 2016, we do not expect to have any limitation in terms of capacity, and it's just the timing for introducing the product in more customers. It goes to markets in where we have already introduced the product, and also launching in new markets. But we don't expect to have capacity issues. We have solved the API. We have a second source of API also in 2016, and now the manufacturing group, it's working to produce all the tablets that will be available to customers in 2016. In terms of BD, opportunities like PHARMAQ are unique, so I don't think that we'll find so many opportunities like PHARMAQ in the market, but there may be some assets that can be attractive to us, not many but it will be maybe in some countries, maybe some companies that will be for sale in the future. But again, so we need to understand that because of our share, our market share, we're facing some limitations in terms of antitrust that we need to incorporate in our valuation. But we have been demonstrating that we are understanding the opportunities in the market: Abbott Animal Health, KL, PHARMAQ, and we'll continue assessing these opportunities in the future."

If you'd asked us in June of 2014, say, ""Gee, do you think you can do 2, right down the middle of the fairway, business development deals in 2015?"" We would've had some degree of confidence that we could do that. But as we all know, whether or not you can actually do those 2 deals is good material for a debate. We're very fortunate in that '15, we've had 2 different -- 2 very good and 2 very different type of deals present themselves: one, the classic tuck-in acquisition, where -- so I mentioned before, but it's worth mentioning again, we acquired in the beginning of the year. We have -- are achieving greater than our target level on what are cost synergies and we're delivering revenue streams. That's a great deal. I would do that deal 100 out of 100 times. And then secondarily, PHARMAQ, which for us, from a strategic perspective and a value perspective, is one of those rare deals that comes around not all that often. Yes, you think about the aquatic health industry, it's roughly a $400 million industry, and here's a company that in the very near term, you'd expect to have a 25% or greater share of that rapidly growing segment, and it happens to be a business that we know a lot about. I mean, if you think about us on a fundamental level, what do we do? We are excellent at developing and promoting products to producers of animal protein for human consumption. This is right in the middle of the fairway. But if you'd asked us a year ago or more than a year ago, ""Well, gee, are you going to be able to do a deal like that?"" We would've been hopeful, but the opportunity needs to present itself. Two important points: One is we will maintain the discipline to focus on business development opportunities where we can leverage our particular competitive strengths to build and drive value for our shareholders. We think that there are other opportunities for us as we look out into 2016 and 2017, and we will continue to pursue those opportunities. But I want to be clear, they're more likely to fall in the category of an Abbott-type deal than a PHARMAQ-type deal. That said, there's always opportunity. I'll stop there."

And Zoetis looks like been a victim of overall sell-off in biotech. And so I just want to hear your perspective on any fronts from -- of potential regulation or even just headline risk from political and noise from human health on animal health and your ability -- Zoetis' ability to continue increasing prices on something like 2% or 3% per year.

I start with the first question on macro environment, and then Paul will answer the tax rate. So the first thing it's -- we are not a human health company, and we try from the beginning to explain how different is animal health to human health. And the most important difference is that our business, it's a business-to-business model. We are not dealing with third-party payers. So our prices are defined by just a few market dynamics. So we sell what our customers, that are also paying, are willing to pay for based on the value that we can demonstrate to them. So regulating prices in an industry, which is just a market-driven industry, will not make any sense, but it's something that definitely, we don't see that happening. And in terms of what is the macro environment, we describe that our industry is very resilient to economic dynamics. We saw that in 2008 and '09. We also saw that in 2012 and the time of the drought, that our industry responded extremely well. So one of the characteristic of the animal health, it's predictability and sustainability.

Beginning of the year, we allocated capital to the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. Great place to put our money. Secondarily, here we are, hopefully on or about November 10, we'll close on the PHARMAQ acquisition. These are -- represent the permanent capital ways that will continue to build value for our shareholders over the long term. While we're doing that, we continue to buy back shares. To the extent that we found ourselves in an environment where we had lots of cash flow and nowhere to deploy it in a way that we felt was value generative, we could increase the scale of our share buyback.

So it's -- definitely, before the acquisition of PHARMAQ, the only area that it was significant for animal health in where we were not participating there was aquaculture or this aquatic health. Now with the addition of PHARMAQ, we have filled this gap. So now we are #1 in cattle. We are #2 in companion animal, but I think, we have been taking all the actions to have a strong opportunity in this category with the launch of APOQUEL, the division of Abbott Animal Health, and also our internal efforts in terms of R&D, to bring new parasiticides that it was an area in where we were underrepresented. We are convinced that we have all what we need to compete in this space. We are #1 in swine, and we are #3 in poultry. And definitely, in poultry, we see opportunities if they come to consider some acquisitions of products or other assets. We incorporated small acquisition in poultry this year, mainly on devices, and we are also working internally to develop the portfolio of the pipeline that will bring us to a stronger position. In terms of geographies, we have raised on position in all the markets. And very important, in those markets in where we don't have yet the position that we have, it's not because we don't have the portfolio. It's only a question of registering the portfolio and bringing this portfolio to the market. So I see in terms of geographies, more opportunistic than need.

Today, I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make some comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for '15, '16 and '17. All of the growth rates I'm discussing today are operational, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
I'm very pleased to report that this quarter, we continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on our diverse portfolio of high-quality products, excellence in execution and our continued discipline on cost and expenses. Despite some global economic challenges, the animal health industry remain resilient based on the strong fundamental drivers for improved protein production and healthier pets. Our growth strategies and resources are aligned against these drivers to expand our market leadership in the industry. The addition of PHARMAQ, a market-leading company in aquatic health, is an example of this growth strategy and will bring us another platform to strengthen our livestock business. 
This quarter's growth was largely due to the performance of our livestock business in the U.S., the integration of Abbott Animal Health products into our business and the growth of recent product launches, led by APOQUEL. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 9% in revenue and 31% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 per share, 5-0. And thanks to our efficiency improvement, reported adjusted net income grew 22% despite a negative impact of foreign currency, which resulted in flat revenue growth. 
As we break down our third quarter revenue by species, companion animal grew 18% due to the additional sales from Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands, such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space, REVOLUTION in parasiticide as well as CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. I'm very positive about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health, and we expect to exceed the target we set for this acquisition in terms of revenues and cost synergies. 
In livestock, we grew 5%, driven by strong growth in cattle, which was tempered by relatively flat sales in swine and poultry. Cattle grew 8%. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil with our key brands and some recent product launches. This growth was also partially offset by the impact of our business reduction in Venezuela and lower sales in France. As you may recall, we have increased customers' orders in France. Last year, that came ahead of the introduction of a new anti-infective legislation. Swine products grew 1%. We delivered exceptional growth in China as a result of our strong portfolio and improving market conditions, which was offset by lower sales in Europe and Venezuela. Poultry sales were flat based on growth in Latin America including Brazil, which was offset by lower sales in other emerging markets and the U.S. The diversity of our portfolio across species, geographies are terrific [ph] areas continue to help us maximize opportunities in animal health while mitigating the risk that can arise in certain markets.
Now let me talk for a minute about our business in 2 markets, with economies that have been getting a lot of attention and where we continue to produce strong results despite overall economic volatility. In Brazil, the animal health industry is very resilient and not been impacted by the current economic decline there. Consumers are reducing their spending in other areas while maintaining their consumption of animal proteins. In some cases, we may see them switching from more expensive to less expensive meat. But since we are well positioned in other species, we have been able to sustain a strong livestock business. We are also at a very positive point in the cattle cycle in Brazil with tight supplies of animal and high prices for meat. This place a premium on animal health and create incentive for our customers to build their herds. 
In China, we also see an exceptional revenue growth for our business despite some recent reports of a slowdown in their economy. Demand for proteins, especially pork, are showing strong growth, and we are seeing higher prices for meat in the market. The long-term trend of smaller farms consolidating into larger operations will also add to our growth as the swine population become increasingly medicalized and production become more efficient. While the economic challenge in China may impact other sectors, it wouldn't have a significant impact on the animal health industry, and China continues to focus on improving the quality and stability of its food chain.
Through the first 9 months of the year, we have continued to deliver on our value proposition by growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Our production growth and revenue and adjusted net income were 9% and 22% year-to-date. And despite the impact of foreign currency, we have delivered 1% and 15% growth. As I have said many times, our industry-leading sales force, high-quality manufacturing and focus on new product innovation and enhancement remain key elements of our competitive advantage. 
Now let me turn to some other updates. Last night, we announced our agreement to purchase PHARMAQ, the global leader in vaccines and innovation for aquatic health. The acquisition is a great strategic fit that brings to Zoetis an animal health leader with similar competitive advantage and industry-leading portfolio, strong customer relationship and world-class innovation and manufacturing. PHARMAQ strengthens our livestock business by providing a market-leading portfolio and a strong late-stage pipeline. Fish is the world largest category of animal proteins, and they are leaders in the fast-growing animal health market: farmed fish. 
The acquisition strengthen our core business in 3 key ways: pharma, expand our customer base into the farmed fish segment. It add to our diverse portfolio a leader in a vaccine for farmed fish and innovative parasiticide as well. PHARMAQ is the market leader in vaccine for farmed fish, a market growing 10% annually. And finally, it expand our R&D program in aquatic health with a strong late-stage pipeline expected to deliver new solutions to the market in the near term. 
Zoetis has an excellent track record of identifying and integrating businesses, and this one meets all our criteria in terms of economic fit and value. With this acquisition expected to close on or about November 10, I'm very excited to welcome the PHARMAQ team to Zoetis. Our companies share a passion for supporting customers and keeping animals healthy and productive, and that gives us a strong foundation to build on.
We also continue to see steady progress in the new product innovation and life-cycle developments coming from our internal R&D team. In September, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for the initial marketing authorization of SIMPARICA, a 1-monthly chewable medication for the treatment of fleas, ticks and mange mite infestations in dogs beginning at 8 weeks of age. We await further news in Europe and the U.S. on potential approvals of SIMPARICA. I will keep you informed of future developments.
In our step to maintain our global R&D leadership and to grow in critical emerging market, just last week, we strengthened our commitment to China. We announced the opening of a new research and development center near Beijing and the opening of a new global manufacturing facility in Suzhou, which replace our regional plant that has been there since 1995. These investments are a strong foundation for future growth in China and the broader Asian market.
Now let me turn to another topic that I mentioned last quarter: ERP implementation and APOQUEL supply. The vast majority of the ERP implementation issues in the U.S. are being resolved, and customers should be seeing the level of service improving. In the third quarter, we had continued with the successful implementation in another 27 markets, which cover Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 '16. 
As for APOQUEL, we have been able to resolve manufacturing issues related to our active pharmaceutical ingredient or API. We're also in the process of bringing on a second source for API supply in the near future. We continue ramping up production of finished goods in the first quarter of 2015. Although we now expect slightly lower sales of $125 million in full year 2015 than previously anticipated, we expect to be in a stronger supply position as we head into 2016. With the strong demand we have seen, even though we have not yet fully launched this product to our customers, we are increasing our view of peak sales for the product to more than $300 million. We look forward broadening customer access to APOQUEL in markets like the U.S. and launching in additional markets around the world in 2016.
In summary, we delivered excellent third quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We continue to implement changes to reduce complexity and cost in our business and to strengthen our ability to execute on the market opportunities before us. And we'll remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, our diverse portfolio and continued investments in the areas that matter for our customers: high-quality customer service, relevant innovation and reliable supply. 
I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?"

The financial highlights of the quarter are, once again, strong operational revenue growth of 9% coming from a variety of sources and cost discipline that together, were the major factors in driving significant operational growth in adjusted net income, as Juan Ramón said, up 31% from Q3 of '14. 
Now I'll sound like a broken record, but I want to emphasize that we manage our business for the long term. And when we measure how we're doing, we look at years, not quarters. A lot of noise can creep in to any one quarter in isolation. For example, we have seasonal elements to our business that impact our customers' buying patterns, and those patterns are not necessarily consistent year-to-year. The high productivity that we enjoyed from our R&D engine feeds revenue growth, but not necessarily in a linear fashion. My point is that 9% operational growth of revenue and 31% operational growth in adjusted net income for Q3 as compared with Q3 of '14 is good, but the year-to-date operational revenue growth of 9% and the adjusted net income growth of 22% and our revised guidance for the full years 2015, '16 and '17 are better indicators of our performance and prospects, and they look pretty good, right?
While we believe that the best way to evaluate our performance is on an operational basis, our guidance and your financial models are focused on expectations for our reported results. I bring this up because we've been able to maintain and now improve our 2015 guidance for adjusted net income per share in the face of unrelenting FX headwinds, and we're proud of that. 
Before I provide some comments around our guidance, let me call your attention to a few items of note in our quarterly results. Once again, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect the multiple ways that we can and do deliver revenue growth. Of the 9% operational growth in revenue in the quarter, 3% came from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% was driven by increased sales of APOQUEL, 3% came from the impact of increased selling prices and about 1% came from other new product introductions. We had unit growth in our other in-line products other than APOQUEL of about 1%, but that growth was offset by reduced sales in Venezuela. Now there's a real balance in how we generate revenue growth and continuing evidence that we can tap all of these forces to drive growth at or faster than the projected mid-single-digit growth rates of the markets in which we compete. 
A few highlights. The U.S. business was very strong, posting 19% growth Q3 over Q3 of '14. The companion animal business was up 27%, and livestock was up 13%. Within companion animal, the big drivers were the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products; increased sales of APOQUEL, as we continue to ramp up the supply of the product; and strength across other key brands, including REVOLUTION, CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. 
In livestock, strong sales of cattle products, for example DRAXXIN and ceftiofur, led the way, while we had more modest gains in swine and a slight decline in poultry. Buying patterns, particularly in the livestock segment, can fluctuate due to weather patterns and herd movements. Q3 of 2015 saw seasonal demand for livestock products pick up earlier in the year than we observed in 2014. The outlook for the second half of 2015 remains solid but with revenue skewed more towards Q3 than we saw in 2014.
Turning to the International segment, which grew 2% operationally for the quarter. Let me highlight 5 countries: 3 that contributed to growth, Japan, China and Brazil; and 2 countries, France and Venezuela, where we saw declines compared with the year-ago quarter. First, Japan. The significant increase in Japan, up 56%, is mainly due to the comparison with a weak Q3 of '14 when we bought back inventory in connection with the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Revenue in China increased 24% operationally as higher pork prices created favorable conditions for pork producers and supported strong demand for our vaccine products. Revenue in Brazil was up 12% operationally, fueled by price growth, new product launches and successful promotional efforts by our Brazilian colleagues in what is, despite the broader economic climate, a favorable environment for cattle producers.
Growth in Japan, China, Brazil and other markets were offset mainly by declines in France, which was down 27% operationally; and Venezuela. In France, Q3 '14 revenue was substantially higher than normal as customers bought product ahead of changes to France's regulation of anti-infective sales. In Venezuela, as we reported back in May, we are reducing our efforts in the country in light of this uncertain economic situation there.
Before I move on, I want to put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's comments around Brazil and China. There's been a lot of talk recently about the challenging economic environments in Brazil and China and the impact of those economies on global companies like ours. I won't repeat everything Juan Ramón said, but I do want to add a finance guy's perspective. 
The challenges in Brazil and China are real, but just how challenging they are depends on the segments in which you compete and other fundamental factors. Our business and our company tend to be less impacted by general economic conditions, and Zoetis' prospects in China, Brazil and related markets remain good. Our operational growth in China of 24% in Q3 was actually faster than was posted for the first half of the year. And in Brazil, our operational growth in the quarter of 12% was the same as our operational growth through the first half of the year. I bring this up because there will continue to be hand-wringing about the impact of these economies on global businesses, and appropriately so. However, our belief is that our industry and our company are far less exposed to weakness in these economies than other companies and industries, and our historical results and our results so far in 2014 support that belief.
Quick update on our operational efficiency initiative. We're making excellent progress implementing the structural and organizational changes that will drive the cost reductions we outlined to you in May. We remain on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of cost reductions entering calendar 2017. I want to repeat that we have been, and continue to be, thoughtful in how we achieve those cost savings with a focus on efficiency and the preservation of the core strengths of our business model: our direct sales forces, our productive R&D engine and our supply chain.
In terms of onetime costs, you'll recall that I talked about these costs in 3 buckets: our stand-up and other onetime costs, the costs associated with our efficiency initiative and the costs associated with our supply network strategy. In the quarter, we incurred $28 million of stand-up and other onetime costs. The stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer are largely behind us and should be complete in 2016. We recorded $21 million of onetime costs associated with the efficiency initiative in the quarter, much of these costs -- much of the costs of the initiative, we recorded in Q2 '15. And finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with the supply network strategy. We continue to be in the early days of this initiative. We've provided a slide summarizing our current estimates of the total cash costs associated with each bucket. 
Now here's the payoff pitch, updates to our guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. The good news here is that there's a lot of good news. Let's start with 2015. We narrowed and revised our guidance range for revenue. Let's not lose sight of the negative impact of FX rates that reduce the range by some $25 million since our last update. We reduced the top end of the range by $25 million but held the low end of the range. Next, we have reduced the expectation for adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue by some 50 to 100 basis points to now being approximately 35%. Of this improvement, some comes from the favorable impact of FX rates, so those benefits may be fugacious, but some of the improvement is structural in that it represents improvements in the management of the supply chain. 
For SG&A, we narrowed the range towards the upper boundary. For R&D, we decreased the range by $30 million to a range of $350 million to $370 million, reflecting a more rapid realization of some of the savings from the efficiency initiative. I want to point out that even though we are spending less in R&D, we continue to commit the necessary resources to support our rationalized product portfolio and to develop new innovative products to fuel our long-term growth. 
Finally, we revised our guidance for our tax rate on adjusted income down by about 100 basis points to approximately 28%. Part of this favorability is structural, coming from refinements and simplification of our operating model as well as several discrete items that occurred during the quarter. 
All of these things together enabled us to raise and narrow our range for full year 2015 adjusted net income per share to $1.70 to $1.74 with the entire range of our revised guidance above the high end of our previous guidance. As I said, good news. 
Looking out to 2016. The negative impact of FX rates would have lowered our prior revenue guidance by some $105 million. However, a combination of factors has enabled us to increase 2016 revenue guidance by $75 million to $100 million. Supporting the increase are the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired -- Abbott products and APOQUEL and the addition of new products, including IL-31 and SIMPARICA. The new revenue guidance range for 2016 implies operational growth versus 2015 in the range of 3% to 5%. As a reminder, this growth rate is suppressed by the impact of the ongoing SKU rationalization and our decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela.
The increase to the range for SG&A cost is a result of several factors, including costs that move as a function of our now higher revenue outlook; second is the inclusion of SG&A cost for PHARMAQ; and finally, costs to support the launches of IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Well, I point out launch costs for animal health products tend to be more modest and of shorter duration as compared with launch costs in human health. We reduced our outlook for R&D costs consistent with my comments around 2015, but then we added in costs associated with aquatic health R&D, which is embedded within PHARMAQ. 
The other significant change is the reduced expected tax rate on adjusted income from 30% to 28%. This reflects some structural benefits coming from actions to further refine and simplify our global operating model, which are expected to continue into future years. 
The net result of all the changes we are making to our outlook for 2016 is that we are revising upward our guidance for 2016 adjusted net income to the range of $925 million to $975 million with implied operational growth moving from 12% to 19% to the range of 14% to 20%. The range for 2016 adjusted EPS moves up to $1.84 to $1.94, and especially in light of the FX headwinds, this is good stuff.
Finally, and I'll spend less time on it, 2017 guidance. In a nutshell, the negative impact of changed FX rates on the previously provided revenue range is a reduction of about $115 million, but we are increasing 2017 revenue guidance by $175 million. The increase is driven by the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the inclusion of the new products, IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Where previously we were guiding to operational revenue growth in '17 versus '16 in the range of 3% to 7%, we're now guiding to the range of 4% to 9%. And this is truly organic growth, as the acquisitions of both the Abbott products and PHARMAQ are fully reflected in our 2016 guidance. 
I call your attention to the tables that contain all the details of our guidance in '17 and the changes from prior guidance, and I'll just skip to the end. We're increasing our guidance for 2017 adjusted net income by $30 million to the range of $1.125 billion to $1.195 billion, implying growth on our operational basis in '17 versus '16 of 18% to 26%. And our guidance for adjusted EPS has been increased by $0.06 per share to the range of $2.24 to $2.38 per share, again, strong and reflective of the team here taking all steps to drive profitable growth. Please note that for 2016 and '17, we've assumed a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares, as we expect our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilutive impact of our share-based comp plans. 
Speaking of our share repurchase program, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares for about $50 million, an average price of $46.92 per share. Through the third quarter, we purchased -- in third quarter and year-to-date in 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for an aggregate $148.1 million, an average price of $46.45 per share. 
Before we move to Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the strength of our industry and our company in turbulent times. I have to say, we've been a little frustrated watching our share price drip lower, while at the same time knowing that we are delivering across a range of activities that we believe are building the value of our company. 
We ended 2014 with a share price of roughly $43, not a lot different from our closing price last night. But here's a short list of the things that we've accomplished since the beginning of the year. In January, we closed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health business. In February, we put a strong full year 2014 on the board, delivering operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%. In May, we unveiled our operational efficiency program and provided you with a road map in the form of longer-term guidance as to how we intend to increase profit levels and improve our adjusted operating margin to the mid-30s. And we reported a strong Q1 2015, with operational revenue growth of 6% and adjusted net income growth of 14%. In August, we put a strong Q2 on the board, year-to-date operational revenue growth of 8% and adjusted net income growth of 17%. And we announced that we received a conditional license on the innovative monoclonal antibody for canine atopic dermatitis that -- which we call IL-31. 
Today, we posted strong Q3 of 2015, with year-to-date operational growth of revenue of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 22%. And we announced the acquisition of PHARMAQ, providing us with a market-leading presence in aquatic health, the fastest-growing segment of the animal health industry. That's a heck of a year and we're only through Q3. 
Our industry has continued to prove its many positive attributes. And coming up on 3 years since our IPO, we believe the team here has proven the strength of Zoetis' business model and our capability to deliver to you value. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. And so let's open the line for questions. Keith?"

I would say that the cattle, it's still facing maybe some limited production. Although the demand has been reduced slightly because of the limited production. It seems most of the producers are rebuilding the herd and sending less animals to the slaughterhouses. At the same time, in some markets, we have seen that the demand for beef has been changing slightly, but we remain very positive in terms of the cattle business in the U.S. In terms of poultry, the demand continue very strong. And I think we expect also that the not a significant impact in terms of the avian flu affecting the meat part of the poultry segment, although these are affecting the egg production. And in swine, in 2015, we have seen a significant increase in the supply because of the PEDv, it's not affecting and the farmer has been able to increase significantly the number of animals, and this also has been making a pressure in terms of prices.

I mean, first thing -- I want to point out a couple of things. This is a business that shares a lot of the characteristics of our business, and these are long-duration assets participating in solid growth markets that are supported by a productive R&D engine. It's very similar to our business. There are cost synergies associated with our acquisition here. However, this is not a cost synergy deal. They, PHARMAQ, have solid operations on the sales and marketing side as well as in the R&D side and, of course, in the manufacturing arena. And so from a cost perspective, this is not like your classic cost synergy deal. This is a transaction that puts us squarely in the space that's going to go quickly, that comes to us with a well-developed pipeline featuring near-term opportunities to continue the attractive growth that they've delivered. And I'll get the start date wrong, but I believe that they've been growing at compound rate of about -- through '14, of about 17% in that business. And so that -- thinking about this business, this is more about supplementing our livestock business, getting us into a space where we're not presently represented, and we love this deal. We love the value of this deal, and we think you will too once it starts to play out over the course of the next couple of years. I think there was a third question where it was kind of capacity for more deals. I'd say, look, we've had a great year so far in 2015. Look at the Abbott transaction. It was a classic good deal for us. That came up a couple of times in our prepared remarks that we're doing better, both in terms of driving revenue synergies and cost synergies on that deal. I wish there were 10 of those out there to be done every year. There just aren't. But when they come up, we would certainly look to pursue additional transactions like that. Larger, more strategic transactions like a PHARMAQ, there are a handful of opportunities out there. Do we have the capacity to do it? Well, we haven't closed this one yet. So we'll get this one closed up, and then we'll start -- or continue the process of looking for what that next opportunity is. M&A will continue to be an element of our strategy."

And we mentioned several times that the consumption there is increasing very fast because of the increase of middle class, but also very important for our industry. They are changing also the way they are raising animals. So in the past in China, there was a significant part of animals. I'm talking about pigs. Now they were small productions or even backyard productions. We have seen that it has significant shift from this kind of production to more sophisticated production, and this is what is generating a significant opportunity for animal health industry that can provide the quality of products that can increase the productivity of these farms. We have been also investing in China since many years. We have in China the infrastructure to maximize any new products that we are bringing to the market. We have been launching new products in China, some of them as a result of a JV that we formed a couple of years ago. And we are very pleased with all the things that are going on in China. As I said, we don't see that this economic slowdown is affecting the animal health industry. In Brazil, the situation is different. Brazil remains a very strong market in terms of production of animal proteins for export. Brazil is one of the key markets in terms of export, and they also have the benefit now of low cost in the country and also lower prices because of the real has been reducing against the dollar. So these elements are creating a very good momentum in Brazil. We have seen also Brazil that the cattle industry, it's increasing their herd. Prices of meat are also very positive. The only comment in Brazil is that we have not seen any reduction in terms of internal consumption. What may have seen, it's switching from more expensive meat to less expensive. If the situation remain in the future in terms of economic crisis, we need to assess if internal consumption will be affected. But so far, we have not seen any kind of reduction of meat consumption in Brazil. So the production for this country remain very positive. Yes, Paul will talk about the acquisition."

That said, earlier, thinking about -- I think in response to Erin's question, you've got to look at this business as being one that's very similar to ours in that it enjoys that long duration, long durability of the revenue streams, and that includes taking into consideration the near-time pipeline opportunities. Yes, if you look at this deal on a near-term basis and say, ""Gee, you have accretion, it's neutral in the first year and then it's accretive thereafter."" This is a deal that goes on and enjoys that long period of sustainable growth of profit and cash flow as added into our business. And so that's how we value.

What did they do? They advanced -- they have advanced the pipeline, which, for us, is a very important factor. And while they were doing that, they continued to deliver growth in their base business and build that company. So that company is worth a heck of a lot more today than it was in 2013, number one.

And clearly, we see a lot of value there. I want to provide a P&L for PHARMAQ for 2014. I don't think it would tell you the whole story. The salient points, again, and I'll keep coming back to this, is a base business growing very rapidly, a base business that has supported the investment of R&D and helped them develop a pipeline that we see a great deal of value in as we go forward. With respect to gross margins, one thing you got to take into consideration -- I called it out in my remarks, is that FX has a favorable impact on our reported gross margin, and that was, I believe, roughly 100 basis points. Someone will correct me if I get that wrong, but I think it was about 100 basis points. As I say, that turns around if rates -- if FX rates happen to go in the opposite direction, but yes, it's roughly 100 basis points. The were some structural things that we've done in the early stages of our supply network strategy to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and, therefore, improve margins through doing things more efficiently in the supply chain. And those are permanent and structural, and that, over time -- this is just the early stuff with respect to the supply network strategy. We've articulated in 2020, we expected another couple of hundred basis points of gross margin from the broader supply network strategy, which we're really at just at the very early stages."

If you'd asked us in June of 2014, say, ""Gee, do you think you can do 2, right down the middle of the fairway, business development deals in 2015?"" We would've had some degree of confidence that we could do that. But as we all know, whether or not you can actually do those 2 deals is good material for a debate. We're very fortunate in that '15, we've had 2 different -- 2 very good and 2 very different type of deals present themselves: one, the classic tuck-in acquisition, where -- so I mentioned before, but it's worth mentioning again, we acquired in the beginning of the year. We have -- are achieving greater than our target level on what are cost synergies and we're delivering revenue streams. That's a great deal. I would do that deal 100 out of 100 times. And then secondarily, PHARMAQ, which for us, from a strategic perspective and a value perspective, is one of those rare deals that comes around not all that often. Yes, you think about the aquatic health industry, it's roughly a $400 million industry, and here's a company that in the very near term, you'd expect to have a 25% or greater share of that rapidly growing segment, and it happens to be a business that we know a lot about. I mean, if you think about us on a fundamental level, what do we do? We are excellent at developing and promoting products to producers of animal protein for human consumption. This is right in the middle of the fairway. But if you'd asked us a year ago or more than a year ago, ""Well, gee, are you going to be able to do a deal like that?"" We would've been hopeful, but the opportunity needs to present itself. Two important points: One is we will maintain the discipline to focus on business development opportunities where we can leverage our particular competitive strengths to build and drive value for our shareholders. We think that there are other opportunities for us as we look out into 2016 and 2017, and we will continue to pursue those opportunities. But I want to be clear, they're more likely to fall in the category of an Abbott-type deal than a PHARMAQ-type deal. That said, there's always opportunity. I'll stop there."

What is your capacity for embarking on a very large share buyback program? I would think you'd want to put your money where your mouth is. And if you think the stock is so cheap, why aren't you guys announcing a big buyback program? And then secondly, Juan Ramón, I'm sorry if I missed this. I was sort of in and out of the call. But you talked about making an aqua health acquisition for the past couple of years. What other areas -- where are there holes in your overall business areas or business segments? Where do you feel that, geographical, that you'd like to fill in? Or is it actually product related? What are the other businesses that you would like to beef up in? I mean, you were very clear about aqua health for the past couple of years. So what other businesses are you seeking to add to your portfolio?"

I know it's modest and we continue to buy back shares and have been buying them back since the beginning of the year. And this is a balance between allocating capital to those activities that we think will build the most value over the long term. And for this year, again, it's, I think so far, a remarkable year. Beginning of the year, we allocated capital to the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. Great place to put our money. Secondarily, here we are, hopefully on or about November 10, we'll close on the PHARMAQ acquisition. These are -- represent the permanent capital ways that will continue to build value for our shareholders over the long term. While we're doing that, we continue to buy back shares. To the extent that we found ourselves in an environment where we had lots of cash flow and nowhere to deploy it in a way that we felt was value generative, we could increase the scale of our share buyback. But right now going out and, what, levering up the company to buy back a bunch of shares is not something that we're going to do."

And let me describe where we are now. So it's -- definitely, before the acquisition of PHARMAQ, the only area that it was significant for animal health in where we were not participating there was aquaculture or this aquatic health. Now with the addition of PHARMAQ, we have filled this gap. So now we are #1 in cattle. We are #2 in companion animal, but I think, we have been taking all the actions to have a strong opportunity in this category with the launch of APOQUEL, the division of Abbott Animal Health, and also our internal efforts in terms of R&D, to bring new parasiticides that it was an area in where we were underrepresented. We are convinced that we have all what we need to compete in this space. We are #1 in swine, and we are #3 in poultry. And definitely, in poultry, we see opportunities if they come to consider some acquisitions of products or other assets. We incorporated small acquisition in poultry this year, mainly on devices, and we are also working internally to develop the portfolio of the pipeline that will bring us to a stronger position. In terms of geographies, we have raised on position in all the markets. And very important, in those markets in where we don't have yet the position that we have, it's not because we don't have the portfolio. It's only a question of registering the portfolio and bringing this portfolio to the market. So I see in terms of geographies, more opportunistic than need. And then moving to what will be other opportunities, definitely any area that will be complementary to our core business, which are medicines, that can enhance this core business and create additional revenues and profits will be part of our assessment."
