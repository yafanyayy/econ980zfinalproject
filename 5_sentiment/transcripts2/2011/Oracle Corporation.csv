Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a positive 2% currency",459,"Thank you, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. 
This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a positive 2% currency effect to both New License revenue and total revenue. In short, Q3 was another excellent quarter for Oracle. In the third quarter, New Stock License revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29%, well above our guidance range of 10% to 20% growth. The Americas grew 35% in U.S. dollars, EMEA was up 19% and Asia was up 32%. With each region up 20% or higher on a constant dollar basis, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. 
Technology New License revenues were $1.6 billion, up 27%. As the Americas grew 40%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia was up 28%. Applications New License revenues were $639 million, up 34% from last year. The Americas grew 26%. EMEA was up 47% and Asia was up 45%. Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.8 million, up 13% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. 
Revenues from our Hardware System products were $1.0 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support was $656 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 23% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins.  Our total revenues were $8.8 billion, up 36% from last year. 
Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 35%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 44% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 25.4%, which was below our guidance due primarily to the extension and catch-up of United States research and development tax credits. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.54, above our EPS guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. Earnings per share were up 40% from last year. 
In Q3, we repurchased 7.9 million shares at an average price of $31.54 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $24.3 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 46 days compared to 47 days last year and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated a record $9.5 billion in free cash flow and a record $9.9 billion in operating cash flow during the last four quarters. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

I'll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Mark. As you can see, we have yet another excellent quarter. We just continued to execute extremely well.

As you can see, we have yet another excellent quarter. We just continued to execute extremely well. We easily exceeded the high point of our New License guidance. We beat the high end of our to revenue guidance and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.04. So far this year, we have delivered 38% earnings per share growth in Q1, 33% earnings per share growth in Q2. And now, 40% earnings per share growth in Q3 and we've got Q4 still to come. 
So the real highlight of the quarter, of course, is our 29% growth in Software License growth which was a strong in both Technology and Applications, and strong in every region of the world. You can really see our momentum in our Apps business as we continue to take share from SAP. Applications grew 34% this quarter, off a 21% growth compare from a year ago. So over the last couple of years, our New License revenue for Applications has grown 53% in constant currency or about more than 10x faster than SAP over the same period. 
In addition to our strong topline performance overall, we also delivered very strong operating margins. Our operating margins for the quarter was 44%, just about the same as it was last year except this year includes a full quarter with Hardware business. This quarter, we delivered 55% gross margins on our Hardware business. This is a result of the fact that really, under the covers of the Hardware number, the Sun products are growing and the non-Sun products that are resold, that we resell are shrinking dramatically. 
In addition, we're selling a lot more of Exadata, Exalogic lines and remember that these systems are sold at good margins and also pull a lot of software with them, like partitioning and storage management. Now as I told you a couple quarters ago, we are really no longer able to identify the exact contributions Sun has made to our operating profits this year. But based on our results, we fully expect to exceed our goal of $1.5 billion in operating profit in the first full fiscal year. 
Remember, we paid $5.7 billion for Sun, net of cash. And had we paid for Sun based on the HP three prime multiple, it would've cost us nearly $140 billion. Don't worry, we wouldn't do that. 
Now finally, let me mention on a more somber note, our sympathies for the ongoing plight for the people of Japan. We have, of course, instituted our dollar-for-dollar charitable match. And fortunately, all of our Japanese employees are safe and our building at Tokyo is essentially undamaged. And frankly though, it's too early to be definitive. We do not expect material impact in our Q4. 
As we have always said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividends. So as you have heard, we did announce today 20% increased our quarterly dividend or $0.06 per share and this would be the third consecutive fiscal year-over-year increase in our dividend. 
Now to the guidance. As your remember, we had a spectacular Q4 last year with New License up 15% in constant dollars and non-GAAP EPS up 30% and GAAP EPS up 24%. So assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a positive five points, so five percentage currency effect on License growth and on total revenue growth, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 9% to 19% at current exchange rates or 4% to 14% in constant currency; Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from 6% to 12% at current exchange rates and 2% to 8% in constant currency, now that doesn't include the Hardware support revenue; total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 9% to 13% at current exchange rates and 4% to 8% in constant currency; on a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 10% to 14% at current exchange rates and 5% to 9% in constant currency; non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.69 to $0.73 assuming current exchange rates up from $0.60 last year and $0.65 to $0.69 in constant currency; GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.56 to $0.60 assuming current exchange rates up from $0.46 last year and $0.53 to $0.57 in constant currency. 
Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 28.5 and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28%, of course, it may end up being different. And in our documents, the lower rate we had this past quarter was the result of a number of things, but mostly the catch-up from the R&D tax credit. There won't be any catch-up in Q4. 
Now with that, I would usually turn this call over to Larry for his comments. However, he is sitting on a jury today on a trial that started two days ago. So with that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments."

And I decided to do this a long time, Q3 was just a great quarter. Revenue earnings growth pulled up over 45%. Customers were energized by our product direction. And frankly, we're just simply executing on all fronts. Our Software business continues to grow faster than the market significantly. 
We saw strength across all regions, industries and product segments. Engineered systems have fundamentally changed the game. The systems actually changed the entire value proposition of both hardware and software, which is why all our competitors are scrambling to react. 
Now in terms of what pays the bills around here, our topline 39% New Software license growth stands out. Net software is broad-based, Technology and Applications, every region. Our GBUs, each of these custom dollar growth at 20% or higher. If you look at our Apps number, 34% growth off of 21% last year's stands out. Going forward, it is usually the only Applications vendor with a modern set of Applications built on modern infrastructure. 
Let's go right and talk about our industry-focused business units and we want to do it again. Telecom, retail, banking, insurance, energy, all had a great quarters. We are the only vendor with the industry solutions across a wide range of industries. For our customers these Applications are even more important than ERP and they position Oracle for more strategically with customers. 
And of course, Exadata continues to sell itself. The price performance ratio with Exadata is just off the charts. When you consider the performance increases obtainable with little or no re-engineering effort to get it up and running, it's hard to think about Oracle workload that doesn't make sense on Exadata. 
We saw sequentially unit and revenue growth of over 50% in Exadata and Exalogic. As we head into Q4, we expect to see even higher growth. The pipeline for Exalogic is building very rapidly as well with customers building out their private clouds with both Exalogic and Exadata. And yes, we are in the cloud, whether it's collaborating with Amazon, so the customers can launch an entire Oracle software stack on EC2 or whether it's working directly with a very large federal law agency to build out a private cloud gain a 10x performance increase as they improve their mission and better protect the United States. Public or private, we're in the cloud. 
With Exalogic, we have the most high-performance scalable cloud offering out there today. Modern, Java, Linux, standard space, virtualized. And like a lot of other cloud offerings, Exalogic is already shipping and requires no so-called cloud services to get up and running. And we've added over 1,500 sales resources in the last year. For the strength of our product portfolio, we see opportunities out there and we think we can get them by hiring more sales resources. 
Again, let me close by saying our performance was broad-based. We have solid organic growth, strength across all regions, industries and product segments, which together drew a spectacular quarter for Oracle. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken."

I mean this, there is no shot at Sun in the rearview mirror. But with Oracle, you are certainly taking one issue that did concern some customers, which was the viability of the entity. Was the company sustainable? Was the company going to be in a position? Because as you know, many of these customers made commitments and they look to be on this platform for years. And so when they make those decisions they want to know that the company is going to be there and be behind them. So one, is sustainability, I think very positive. Second, I think as Larry has been very clear, there's more investment going to Technology. There is more investment in Solaris. There's more investment into SPARC. And so from that perspective, the investment I think is extremely positive. Third, you get the leverage and the opportunity to now get optimized software with the hardware. You can see some technology at the base of Exadata, the base of Exalogic. And even as we try to do work with our M-series, you can see more opportunities. So you combine that with the support capabilities of Oracle. I think what you'll hear from customers is much more confidence in the overall value proposition. So I'd say positive. Listen, I don't want to sound that we don't have work to do. I think this is a company that have been through several years of turmoil. But when you net it together, I think the overall view is very positive, Jason."

I mean the first thing we needed to address was our supply chain, frankly, and getting it that under control, which is it now really is and that really optimizing the size that we are and not being very broadly and widely distributed all over. So part of it is the cost, just the cost of the supply chain itself. Secondly, it's also what we sell. And it's very important, the mix of business is important. I mean it's always frankly, it's very easy to sell a couple hundred million more Web new in the quarter and decide not to make any money doing it. It's very easy. People will absolutely buy from you, claims that you are offering too cheaply. We are not in that business. We really are in a value business. We are in the business of selling things that are valuable to customers. And for them, they have to, they really understand what it is we are bringing to the party. So the mix of the business is also very important. And then finally just making sure that the way we go-to-market, we really are focusing on what customers care about and what's important to them, and not a lot of kind of extraneous activities that though they spend a lot of money doing are not necessarily really meeting the needs of customers. So we continue to invest in the things customers care about, which frankly is R&D, support and high quality, and some of the software products, also by the way, we got from Sun, Java, et cetera. These are areas of importance to our customers. And that's really what we spend money on. And I think now, actually, in Q4, you will finally start to see a real growth pattern here for the business because though we still have some third-party hardware that we are reselling, it's a much smaller percentage than it used to be, and that continues as now we start to actually really grow the Sun intellectual property hardware platform, that's where margins will continue to improve."

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. 
This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a positive 2% currency effect to both New License revenue and total revenue. In short, Q3 was another excellent quarter for Oracle. In the third quarter, New Software License revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29%, well above our guidance range of 10% to 20% growth. The Americas grew 35% in U.S. dollars, EMEA was up 19% and Asia was up 32%. With each region up 20% or higher on a constant dollar basis, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals.
Technology New License revenues were $1.6 billion, up 27%. As the Americas grew 40%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia was up 28%. Applications New License revenues were $639 million, up 34% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 47% and Asia was up 45%. Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.8 million, up 13% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels.
Revenues from our Hardware System products were $1.0 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support was $656 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 23%, as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $8.8 billion, up 36% from last year.
Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 35%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 44% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 25.4%, which was below our guidance due primarily to the extension and catch-up of United States research and development tax credits. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.54, above our EPS guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. Earnings per share were up 40% from last year.
In Q3, we repurchased 7.9 million shares at an average price of $31.54 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $24.3 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 46 days compared to 47 days last year and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated a record $9.5 billion in free cash flow and a record $9.9 billion in operating cash flow during the last four quarters.
Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."
22247,127788383,112629,"Oracle Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2011",2011-03-24,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

I'll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Mark. As you can see, we had yet another excellent quarter. We just continued to execute extremely well. We easily exceeded the high point of our New License guidance. We beat the high end of our total revenue guidance and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.04. So far this year, we've delivered 38% earnings per share growth in Q1, 33% earnings per share growth in Q2. And now, 40% earnings per share growth in Q3 and we've got Q4 still to come.
So the real highlight of the quarter, of course, is our 29% growth in Software License growth, which was strong in both Technology and Applications and strong in every region of the world. You can really see our momentum in our Apps business as we continue to take share from SAP. Applications grew 34% this quarter, off a 21% growth compare from a year ago. So over the last couple of years, our New License revenue for Applications has grown 53% in constant currency or about more than 10x faster than SAP over the same period.
In addition to our strong topline performance overall, we also delivered very strong operating margins. Our operating margins for the quarter was 44%, just about the same as it was last year except this year, includes a full quarter with Hardware business. This quarter, we delivered 55% gross margins on our Hardware business. This is the result of the fact that, really, under the covers of the Hardware number, the Sun products are growing and the non-Sun products that are resold, that we resell are shrinking dramatically.
In addition, we're selling a lot more of the Exadata, Exalogic lines and remember that these systems are sold at good margins and also pull a lot of software with them, like rack, partitioning and storage management. Now as I told you a couple quarters ago, we are really no longer able to identify the exact contributions Sun has made to our operating profits this year. But based on our results, we fully expect to exceed our goal of $1.5 billion in operating profit in the first full fiscal year.
Remember, we paid $5.7 billion for Sun, net of cash. And had we paid for Sun based on the HP 3PAR multiple, it would've cost us nearly $140 billion. Don't worry, we wouldn't do that.
Now finally, let me mention on a more somber note, our sympathies for the ongoing plight of the people of Japan. We have, of course, instituted our dollar-for-dollar charitable match. And fortunately, all of our Japanese employees are safe and our building in Tokyo is essentially undamaged. And frankly though, it's too early to be definitive. We do not expect material impact in our Q4.
As we have always said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividends. So as you've heard, we did announce today a 20% increased to our quarterly dividend or $0.06 per share, and this would be the third consecutive fiscal year-over-year increase in our dividend.
Now to the guidance. As your remember, we had a spectacular Q4 last year with New License up 15% in constant dollars and non-GAAP EPS up 30% and GAAP EPS up 24%. So assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a positive five points, so five percentage currency effect on License growth and on total revenue growth, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 9% to 19% at current exchange rates or 4% to 14% in constant currency; Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from 6% to 12% at current exchange rates and 2% to 8% in constant currency, now that doesn't include the Hardware Support revenue. Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 9% to 13% at current exchange rates and 4% to 8% in constant currency; on a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 10% to 14% at current exchange rates and 5% to 9% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.69 to $0.73 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.60 last year and $0.65 to $0.69 in constant currency, GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.56 to $0.60 assuming current exchange rates up from $0.46 last year and $0.53 to $0.57 in constant currency.
Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 28.5 and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28%, of course, it may end up being different. And as is in our documents, the lower rate we had this past quarter was the result of a number of things, but mostly the catch-up from the R&D tax credit. There won't be any catch-up in Q4.
Now with that, I would usually turn this call over to Larry for his comments. However, he is sitting on a jury today on a trial that started two days ago. So with that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments."

And I also apologize for my voice, it's just the weather a bit out here. And I -- of course, I've been doing this a long time, Q3 was just a great quarter. Revenue earnings growth both up over 45%",535,"Thanks, Safra. I won't comment on the Larry jury activity. And I also apologize for my voice, it's just the weather a bit out here. And I -- of course, I've been doing this a long time, Q3 was just a great quarter. Revenue earnings growth both up over 45%. Customers were energized by our product direction. And frankly, we're just simply executing on all fronts. The Software business continues to grow faster than the market significantly. 
We saw strength across all regions, industries and product segments. Engineered systems have fundamentally changed the game. The systems actually changed the entire value proposition of both Hardware and Software, which is why all our competitors are scrambling to react. 
Now in terms of what pays the bills around here, our top line 29% New Software license growth stands out. That's software interbridge broad-based, Technology and Applications, every region. Our GBUs, each of these custom dollar growth at 20% or higher. If you look at our Apps number, 34% growth off of 21% last year stands out. Going forward, as usual, we're going to be the only Applications vendor with a modern set of Applications built on modern infrastructure.
Last call I talked about our industry-focused business units and I want to do it again. Telecom, retail, banking, insurance, energy, all had their great quarters. We are the only vendor with the industry solutions across a wide range of industries. For our customers these Applications are even more important than ERP and they position Oracle more strategically with customers.
And of course, Exadata continues to sell itself. The price performance ratio with Exadata is just off the charts. When you consider the performance increases obtainable with little or no re-engineering effort to get it up and running, it's hard to think about Oracle workload that doesn't make sense on Exadata.
We saw sequential unit and revenue growth of over 50% in Exadata and Exalogic. As we head into Q4, we expect to see even higher growth. The pipeline for Exalogic is building very rapidly as well with customers building out their private clouds with both Exalogic and Exadata.
And yes, we're in the cloud, whether it's collaborating with Amazon, so the customers can launch an entire Oracle software stack on EC2 or whether it's working directly with a very large federal law agency to build out a private cloud, gain a 10x performance increase as they improve their mission and better protect the United States. Public or private, we're in the cloud.
With Exalogic, we have the most high-performance scalable cloud offering out there today. Modern, Java, Linux, standard spaced, virtualized. And unlike a lot of other cloud offering, Exalogic is already shipping and requires no so-called cloud services to get up and running. And we've added over 1,500 sales resources in the last year. For the strength of our product portfolio, we see opportunities out there and we think we can get them by hiring more sales resources.
Again, let me close by saying our performance was broad-based. We're solid organic growth. Strength across all regions, industries and product segments, which together drew a spectacular quarter for Oracle. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken."

You can consolidate lots of infrastructure, whether that's servers, whether that's storage, you can bring it together. You can get a material change in performance.

I mean it's-- there's no shot at Sun in the rearview mirror. But with Oracle, you're certainly taking one issue that did concern Sun customers, which was the viability of the entity. Was the company sustainable? Was the company going to be in a position? Because as you know, many of these customers made commitments and they look to be on this platform for years. And so when they make those decisions they want to know that the company is going to be there and be behind it. So point one is sustainability, I think very positive. Second, I think as Larry has been very clear, there's more investment going into the Technology. There's more investment into Solaris. There's more investment into SPARC. And so from that perspective, the investment, I think, is extremely positive. Third, you get the leverage and the opportunity to now get optimized software with the hardware. You can see Sun technology at the base of Exadata, the base of Exalogic. And even as we try to do work with our M-series, you can see more opportunities. So you combine that with the support capabilities of Oracle, I think what you'll hear from customers is much more confidence in the overall value proposition. So I'd say positive.

I mean, the first thing we needed to address was our supply chain, frankly, and getting it that under control, which it now really is. And really optimizing the size that we are and not being very broadly and widely distributed all over. So part of it is the cost, just the cost of the supply chain itself. Secondly, it's also what we sell. And it's very important, the mix of business is important. I mean it's always, frankly, it's very easy to sell a couple hundred million more brand new in a quarter and decide not to make any money doing it. It's very easy. People will absolutely buy from you things that you are offering too cheaply. We're not in that business. We really are in the value business. We're in the business of selling things that are valuable to customers. And for them, they have to -- is they really understand what it is we're bringing to the party. So the mix of the business is also very important. And then finally, just making sure that the way we go-to-market, we really are focusing on what customers care about and what's important to them, and not a lot of kind of extraneous activities, that though you spend a lot of money doing, are not necessarily really meeting the needs of customers. So we continue to invest in the things customers care about, which frankly is R&D, support and high quality, and some of the software products. Also, by the way, we got from Sun, Java, et cetera. These are areas of importance to our customers. And that's really what we spend money on. And I think now, actually, in Q4, you'll finally start to see -- you'll start to see a real growth pattern here for the business because though we still have some third-party hardware that we are reselling, it's a much smaller percentage than it used to be. And as that continues, as now we start to actually really grow the Sun intellectual property hardware platform, that's where margins will continue to improve."

Let me add, a lot of cores, I guess, right now, but that's where your bread is buttered.

This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a positive 2% currency effect to both New License revenue and total revenue. In short, Q3 was another excellent quarter for Oracle. In the third quarter, New Software License revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29%, well above our guidance range of 10% to 20% growth. The Americas grew 35% in U.S. dollars, EMEA was up 19% and Asia was up 32%. With each region up 20% or higher on a constant dollar basis, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals.
Technology New License revenues were $1.6 billion, up 27%. As the Americas grew 40%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia was up 28%. Applications New License revenues were $639 million, up 34% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 47% and Asia was up 45%. Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.8 billion, up 13% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels.
Revenues from our Hardware System products were $1.0 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support were $656 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 23%, as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $8.8 billion, up 36% from last year.
Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 35%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 44% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 25.4%, which was below our guidance due primarily to the extension and catch-up of United States research and development tax credits. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.54, above our EPS guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. Earnings per share were up 40% from last year.
In Q3, we repurchased 7.9 million shares at an average price of $31.54 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $24.3 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 46 days compared to 47 days last year and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated a record $9.5 billion in free cash flow and a record $9.9 billion in operating cash flow during the last four quarters.
Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."
22247,127788383,112663,"Oracle Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2011",2011-03-24,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Mark. As you can see, we had yet another excellent quarter. We just continued to execute extremely well. We easily exceeded the h",878,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Mark. As you can see, we had yet another excellent quarter. We just continued to execute extremely well. We easily exceeded the high point of our New License guidance. We beat the high end of our total revenue guidance and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.04. So far this year, we've delivered 38% earnings per share growth in Q1, 33% earnings per share growth in Q2. And now, 40% earnings per share growth in Q3 and we've got Q4 still to come.
So the real highlight of the quarter, of course, is our 29% growth in Software License growth, which was strong in both Technology and Applications and strong in every region of the world. You can really see our momentum in our Apps business as we continue to take share from SAP. Applications grew 34% this quarter, off a 21% growth compare from a year ago. So over the last couple of years, our New License revenue for Applications has grown 53% in constant currency or about more than 10x faster than SAP over the same period.
In addition to our strong topline performance overall, we also delivered very strong operating margins. Our operating margins for the quarter was 44%, just about the same as it was last year except this year, includes a full quarter with Hardware business. This quarter, we delivered 55% gross margins on our Hardware business. This is the result of the fact that, really, under the covers of the Hardware number, the Sun products are growing and the non-Sun products that are resold, that we resell are shrinking dramatically.
In addition, we're selling a lot more of the Exadata, Exalogic line and remember that these systems are sold at good margins and also pull a lot of software with them, like racks [ph], partitioning and storage management. Now as I told you a couple quarters ago, we are really no longer able to identify the exact contributions Sun has made to our operating profits this year. But based on our results, we fully expect to exceed our goal of $1.5 billion in operating profit in the first full fiscal year.
Remember, we paid $5.7 billion for Sun, net of cash. And had we paid for Sun based on the HP 3PAR multiple, it would've cost us nearly $140 billion. Don't worry, we wouldn't do that.
Now finally, let me mention on a more somber note, our sympathies for the ongoing plight of the people of Japan. We have, of course, instituted our dollar-for-dollar charitable match. And fortunately, all of our Japanese employees are safe and our building in Tokyo is essentially undamaged. And frankly though, it's too early to be definitive. We do not expect material impact in our Q4.
As we have always said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and a dividend. So as you've heard, we did announce today a 20% increased to our quarterly dividend or $0.06 per share, and this would be the third consecutive fiscal year-over-year increase in our dividend.
Now to the guidance. As your remember, we had a spectacular Q4 last year with New License up 15% in constant dollars and non-GAAP EPS up 30% and GAAP EPS up 24%. So assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a positive five points, so five percentage currency effect on License growth and on total revenue growth, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 9% to 19% at current exchange rates or 4% to 14% in constant currency; Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from 6% to 12% at current exchange rates and 2% to 8% in constant currency, now that doesn't include the Hardware Support revenue. Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 9% to 13% at current exchange rates and 4% to 8% in constant currency; on a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 10% to 14% at current exchange rates and 5% to 9% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.69 to $0.73 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.60 last year and $0.65 to $0.69 in constant currency, GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.56 to $0.60 assuming current exchange rates up from $0.46 last year and $0.53 to $0.57 in constant currency.
Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 28.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28%, of course, it may end up being different. And as is in our documents, the lower rate we had this past quarter was the result of a number of things, but mostly the catch-up from the R&D tax credit. There won't be any catch-up in Q4.
Now with that, I would usually turn this call over to Larry for his comments. However, he is sitting on a jury today on a trial that started two days ago. So with that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments."
22247,127788383,112663,"Oracle Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2011",2011-03-24,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Safra. I won't comment on the Larry jury activity. And I also apologize for my voice, it's just the weather a bit out here. And I -- of course, I've been doing this a long time, Q3 was just a great quarter. Revenue earnings growth both up over 45%",534,"Thanks, Safra. I won't comment on the Larry jury activity. And I also apologize for my voice, it's just the weather a bit out here. And I -- of course, I've been doing this a long time, Q3 was just a great quarter. Revenue earnings growth both up over 45%. Customers were energized by our product direction. And frankly, we're just simply executing on all fronts. The Software business continues to grow faster than the market significantly. 
We saw strength across all regions, industries and product segments. Engineered systems have fundamentally changed the game. The systems actually changed the entire value proposition of both Hardware and Software, which is why all our competitors are scrambling to react. 
Now in terms of what pays the bills around here, our top line 29% New Software license growth stands out. That's software interbridge is broad-based, Technology and Applications, every region. Our GBUs, each of these constant dollar growth at 20% or higher. If you look at our Apps number, 34% growth off of 21% last year stands out. Going forward, as usual, we're going to be the only Applications vendor with a modern set of Applications built on modern infrastructure.
Last call I talked about our industry-focused business units and I want to do it again. Telecom, retail, banking, insurance, energy, all had great quarters. We are the only vendor with the industry solutions across a wide range of industries. For our customers these Applications are even more important than ERP and they position Oracle more strategically with customers.
And of course, Exadata continues to sell itself. The price performance ratio with Exadata is just off the charts. When you consider the performance increases obtainable with little or no re-engineering effort to get up and running, it's hard to think about Oracle workload that doesn't make sense on Exadata.
We saw sequential unit and revenue growth of over 50% in Exadata and Exalogic. As we head into Q4, we expect to see even higher growth. The pipeline for Exalogic is building very rapidly as well with customers building out their private clouds with both Exalogic and Exadata.
And yes, we're in the cloud, whether it's collaborating with Amazon, so that customers can launch an entire Oracle software stack on EC2 or whether it's working directly with a very large federal law agency to build out a private cloud, gain a 10x performance increase as they improve their mission and better protect the United States. Public or private, we're in the cloud.
With Exalogic, we have the most high-performance scalable cloud offering out there today. Modern, Java, Linux, standard spaced, virtualized. And unlike a lot of other cloud offering, Exalogic is already shipping and requires no so-called cloud services to get up and running. And we've added over 1,500 sales resources in the last year. With the strength of our product portfolio, we see opportunities out there and we think we can get them by hiring more sales resources.
Again, let me close by saying our performance was broad-based with solid organic growth. Strength across all regions, industries and product segments, which together drew a spectacular quarter for Oracle. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken."

Second, I think as Larry has been very clear, there's more investment going into the Technology. There's more investment into Solaris. There's more investment into SPARC. And so from that perspective, the investment, I think, is extremely positive. Third, you get the leverage and the opportunity to now get optimized software with the hardware. You can see Sun technology at the base of Exadata, the base of Exalogic. And even as we try to do work with our M-series, you can see more opportunities.

I mean, the first thing we needed to address was our supply chain, frankly, and getting it under control, which it now really is. And really optimizing the size that we are and not being very broadly and widely distributed all over. So part of it is the cost, just the cost of the supply chain itself. Secondly, it's also what we sell. And it's very important, the mix of business is important. I mean it's always, frankly, it's very easy to sell a couple hundred million more revenue in a quarter and decide not to make any money doing it. It's very easy. People will absolutely buy from you things that you are offering too cheaply. We're not in that business. We really are in the value business. We're in the business of selling things that are valuable to customers. And for them, they have to -- is they really understand what it is we're bringing to the party. So the mix of the business is also very important. And then finally, just making sure that the way we go-to-market, we really are focusing on what customers care about and what's important to them, and not a lot of kind of extraneous activities, that though you spend a lot of money doing, are not necessarily really meeting the needs of customers. So we continue to invest in the things customers care about, which frankly is R&D, support and high quality, and some of the software products. Also, by the way, we got from Sun, Java, et cetera. These are areas of importance to our customers. And that's really what we spend money on. And I think now, actually, in Q4, you'll finally start to see -- you'll start to see a real growth pattern here for the business because though we still have some third-party hardware that we are reselling, it's a much smaller percentage than it used to be. And as that continues, as now we start to actually really grow the Sun intellectual property hardware platform, that's where margins will continue to improve."

Software license has been better than expectations for the last several quarters. But this quarter, you put a Software License that's much better than what seasonal trends have been.

I mean, you’ve got a lot of cores, I guess, right now, but that's where your bread is buttered. And from my calculations, you typically do when you back out foreign exchange and acquisitions, do sort of flattish License revenue from second to third quarter. This quarter was up close to 10%. I'm just wondering, what do you owe that to? What's happening? What was different this quarter? Something happening in the environment or is it something -- is more Oracle specific?"

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and for fiscal year 2011, then I'll review the guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we delivered yet another exceptionally strong quarter to complete a fantastic year for Oracle. We continue to have a lot of company-specific momentum and we executed extremely well throughout the fiscal year exceeding even our own optimistic expectations quarter after quarter. 
For the year, we achieved 25% New License growth in Q1, 21% in Q2, 29% in Q3 and, including this quarter, we delivered 23% in New License growth for the full fiscal year. Our Software business is now even bigger than IBM's software business. For the year, we delivered 38% EPS growth in Q1, 33% in Q2, 40% in Q3 and, including 25% this quarter, we delivered 33% EPS growth for the year, once again way ahead of the 20% growth we promised. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year were $2.22, well above the consensus estimate of $1.88 when we started the year. And unlike a few of our competitors, we're not delivering this EPS growth by aggressively reducing our share count. Obviously, we're thrilled with our Q4 results. This was Oracle's first $10 billion quarter. New Software License revenue was up 19% to $3.6 billion, accelerating from 14% in Q4 of last year. Currency effects for the quarter were largely as expected. We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as technology and New License revenues were up 18% to $2.7 billion in Q4 and applications grew 22% this quarter to $1 billion, with Asia-Pacific particularly strong including Japan, which grew during the quarter. 
Our North America Applications business passed a while ago and now if you exclude Germany, we believe we have essentially caught up to them in Europe. Geographically, the quarter was strong and balanced with New License growing 16% in the Americas, 24% in APAC and 22% in EMEA in the quarter wasn't dependent on any large deal. Software License Update and Product Support revenues were up 15% to $4 billion. Sun's hardware system revenues was $1.2 billion for the quarter. We're running the Sun business on more profit aware model. Compared to Q4 a year ago, we have made a big move away from selling products at a loss or reselling other company's products. Rather, we are focused on selling value-added systems where Sun's differentiation is very clear to our customers. For example, non-Sun storage was down significantly, sun storage and tape grew very well and, of course, Exadata and Exalogic continue to show fantastic growth. This strategy shows up in our hardware gross margins, which were 56% this quarter, significantly higher than the 46% last year. Later this year, I expect the growth of the Sun hardware products to become quite obvious. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $10.8 billion, up 12% from last year. In addition to our strong top line performance, we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $5.2 billion, 19% higher than last year as our operating margin extended to 48%. We could be back at pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly as there remains ample leverage in our business model. 
For the year, our operating income grew 27% and even with the Sun hardware business included in our results for the full year, we delivered non-GAAP operating margins of only 2% -- 2 points below our all-time high. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% due to several nonrecurring items including agreements with worldwide taxing authorities. EPS grew 25% to $0.75 on a non-GAAP basis. The fact that we were able to put up these top line and bottom line results given our size once again demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio, enterprise products and the breadth and loyalty of our huge customer base and the strength of our operating model. 
We now have $29 billion in cash and marketable securities and operating cash flow increased to a record $11.2 billion. For the year, cash flow increased to $10.8 million. As we always said, we are committed to return value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and dividend. And this quarter, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for a total of a $422 million. For the full year, we repurchased 40.4 million shares for a total of approximately $1.2 billion. And the board again declared a dividend of $0.06. 
Now the guidance. As you remember, we had a spectacular Q1 last year with New License up 25%, non-GAAP EPS up 38% and GAAP EPS up 20%. So assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which is right now a positive 5% currency impact on license and revenue growth rates,, our guidance for Q1 is as follows: New Software Licenses revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20%; Hardware Product revenue growth is expected to range from negative 5 to positive 5, and of course that does not include Hardware Support revenue; total revenue on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 9% to 12%; on a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 10% to 13%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.48; GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.33 to $0.36. Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 29% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%, which is nearly 4 points higher than our tax rate in the previous year. Now of course this may end up being different. 
With that, let me turn everything over to Larry for his comments."

That growth rate is twice as fast as any year this past decade. We're already more than twice as big as IBM, the former number one and current number one player in the Database business, and we're consistently growing faster than IBM and taking the market share away from them. 
Why is it the older Database business suddenly growing so fast? Because we've advanced our database technology to take full advantage of the latest trends in the database market: cloud computing databases, in-memory databases and now big data databases. This year, we did a number of cloud computing the us and put in a very large one with Salesforce.com last quarter. And this quarter, we did one with the biggest and best name in mobile devices and cloud computing in the world. That deal included our database software, Exadata machines, our cloud computing billing system and our cloud e-mail system that scales to millions of users is all based on our technology. 
Today, more than 1,000 Exadatas are installed, and we plan on tripling that number this year. We think it's possible because Oracle apps run unchanged on Exadata. That's very different from IBM Netezza, which does not run Oracle apps or IBM DBQ apps or anything else except applications that are custom-built for Netezza. The expansion of our Exadata business and our rapidly growing Exalogic business plus a couple of new hardware and software we plan  to introduce this fall should further charge the overall of our Hardware business, making the top line and bottom line better than ever.

Second, our 19% new software license growth was broad-based with technology and apps both going at very strong rates. It's the first quarter we've ever sold than that $1 billion in apps. We had great performance in every region and delivered license fee growth in midteens or higher in every region. Fourth, we've begun to make material progress in the Hardware Support attach rates. I'm not going to explain attach in detail today, but this is good news. The fundamentals of the business now is we're selling fewer units at higher prices and we have higher margins and they have higher attach rates. These are the fundamentals of a solid hardware business. 
Last, Exadata. Our sequential growth was more than 50%. That's big growth and it was broad-based. We sold to more than 150 different customers with close to half buying multiple systems. P&G, JPMorgan Chase, Apple, Fidelity, Boeing have helped us now cross 1,000 systems mark installed Exadata systems. We have 300,000 database customers running Oracle database workloads. Every one of them is a prospect for Exadata. The exciting news is in addition to this, the Exalogic ramp has been even better than Exadata and every one of our 100,000-plus middleware customers is a prime prospect for Exalogic.

The reason attach is important, I think you know this, the eventual Hardware Support revenue is defined by the volume of hardware you sell times the attach rate, which is the service dollars that you charge for that support and then how long the installed base stays there. And what we've done really is move to a model now where we got the service lined up with the sales activity that we attach the service to the actual sale. This may sound so elementary to you, but if you lose control of that in the process, and that had happened previously, it's actually difficult to work to get that back and we've done that, and that does start to lead over time to that inclining that Hardware Support revenue that you described. So it is an absolute key element. The other point in the Hardware business, Adam, just to add is that these fundamentals I described earlier are really important. Selling units that have no gross margin are easy to do. I could get -- I won't give you examples of what like, but we have ways of selling lots of hardware without getting margin. We are focused on selling hardware systems. We are now selling fewer systems at a higher price that have more value to our customer the state installed longer. These are and also we're doing that at higher margins, so these are the fundamentals of a solid hardware business and then, of course, we have to eventually grow that business on the top line and you have a very, very attractive business model."

One of the nice thing is Exadata and Exalogic will become a larger percentage of our overall hardware Business, having gone up a fairly small base now up to about machines and hopefully about 3,000 machines next year as that is to be a larger and larger overall base that improves our profitability. Exadata's growing faster than the traditional Sun line. So improves our top line growth rate. And because of the 100% attach rate, it improves our service growth rate and our service margins. So overall, as we sell more and more engineering systems and fewer undifferentiated systems him a we make more money on the hardware sale, we make more money on the associated service. And actually is an enabler that allows us to increase our rate of sales of our middleware software because our middleware software runs better on Exalogic, and that's the best middleware combination you can buy, Exalogic hardware and Exalogic software from Oracle. The best database combination you can buy is the Oracle database running on the Exadata machine. So we actually sell more database software because of Exadata.

The truth is that the economy is sort of as it is, and yet, we continue to grow. I mean this quarter, in case anyone missed it, was really basically an organic growth quarter for us and the license number is pretty much very little help from any kind of acquisition and, obviously, significantly faster than any of the world economies that are really growing. So we've got a lot of very Oracle-specific momentum, and though we read the same newspaper  you do, we also have to be sensitive to the fact that our sales continues  to grow, we've been significant hiring and we continue to be optimistic enough to continue to hire this next year. So we're giving I think guidance that includes all those little pieces of information but it's mostly based on the growth of our pipeline and what we get from our fields around the world."

And then when we get in front of more customers, we actually sell more software, and so that's why we're adding more representation. These are both salespeople and presale people, technical people, if you will, there in GBUs as well as in our regions and they're across all regions. So for us, it's a simple case, in the salesforce, giving you an example, I have 20 customers. We think there's opportunities for that salesperson to sell just as much software calling on 5 customers and, therefore, for us to get higher productivity, and that's what we're doing, and that's probably the chatter you're hearing.

One of clients our surprised that it it's a large memory addition to Exadata for analytics and memory, so we continue to invest. We thought that we've been the leader of in-memory database technology ever since we bought Tungsten, and that's both for transactions and for processing. We are, as memories become cheaper and larger scale, we changed much of our programs and this is in memory analytics accelerator is going to be again coming out and we'll be announcing in the fall at Oracle OpenWorld. In addition, touching to our Exalogic but that, there's a lot of misunderstanding about what in order to her place our database. So this is not a reported for database. It's an adjunct to the database, which we think is very, very important. It really is a tool for Java programmers. And we're the world leader in Java technology and we are the building a big data accelerator to attach our Exalogic box, which comes out also this fall. The big data accelerator includes some of the standard open source produced software, HTFF, the system and another a number of other pieces of but also some Oracle components that we think and dramatically speed up the entire Mac produced process and we'll be particularly attractive to Java programmers who are the ones who are. There are some interesting applications to do you ETL is one. Log processings, another. We're going to have a lot of the features function and prebuilt applications in our big data accelerator. SO Oracle always followed database technology trends, whether it's object database and memory databases and kept up with this technology and some of them quite often led on innovation. Point of our Exadata data base machine where we were the first to take a software product like Oracle and marry it to specialized hardware. China came out with accommodation before but IBM as yet. IBM still hasn't come out with an appliance that runs their DB2 database very fast. Instead, they kind of ran out and did an acquisition as opposed to innovation in this area. So we have long been an innovator around the database, keeping occurred, watching all of the trends, exploiting all the technology and that's been showing up in our numbers. And that 28% in Q4 and 26% for the year is really a stunning number considering the size of our Oracle database business and how much faster we're growing than our rivals, DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server"

We'll be very focused on a couple of our competitors that we think have some vulnerabilities and we will be going after them and you'll see more alignment across the Oracle sales force as we go forward.

And by the way, you put on your private cloud, we'll run it for you if we want the to both behind your firewall attached to your local area network with all the security inherent in that. Our whole approach to kind of, if you will, cloud 2.0 is people say, we're not building multitenancy software. Remember that when I started my little company NetSuite and 6 months later, Mark and his company Salesforce.com, that was over a decade ago when virtualization wasn't so common for isolating different customers on the same machine. So our cloud 2.0, we used virtualized elastic cloud technology, very different than let's say with Salesforce.com is using more than -- the 15 -year-old multitenancy technology. We are offering that much higher degree of security and much higher degree of isolation when you run on our public cloud, which looks a lot more like Amazon.com than Salesforce.com. We think that modern technology has such a huge security advantage that will -- Salesforce.com will be facing very serious competition for as fusions roll out this year. And SAP has no answers at all. They've got nothing. So we've been competing very effectively against SAP over last several years. We pass them in North America, we've tied to many Europe and the German and German-speaking Europe, and now they're faced with what do you got for cloud? That would be nothing. While we have a completely rewritten suite of applications built entirely in Java, runs on cloud 2.0, virtual and elastic cloud that's virtualized, we have technology advantages over  Salesforce.com but they got nothing over SAP. So we think this is going to be a huge contributor to us this year and the following year and the year after that, and it's going to allow us to take a significant amount of share from SAP and some share salesforce who by the way the sales force guys are our customers. So when we only make money. When we sell ours, we make money, we like that."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and for fiscal year 2011, then I'll review the guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we delivered yet another exceptionally strong quarter to complete a fantastic year for Oracle. We continue to have a lot of company-specific momentum and we executed extremely well throughout the fiscal year exceeding even our own optimistic expectations quarter after quarter. 
For the year, we achieved 25% New License growth in Q1, 21% in Q2, 29% in Q3, and including this quarter, we delivered 23% New License growth for the full fiscal year. Our Software business is now even bigger than IBM's software business. For the year, we delivered 38% EPS growth in Q1, 33% in Q2, 40% in Q3, and including 25% this quarter, we delivered 33% EPS growth for the year, once again, way ahead of the 20% growth we promised. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year were $2.22, well above the consensus estimate of $1.88 when we started the year. And unlike a few of our competitors, we're not delivering this EPS growth by aggressively reducing our share count. Obviously, we're thrilled with our Q4 results. This was Oracle's first $10 billion quarter. New Software License revenue was up 19% to $3.6 billion, accelerating from 14% in Q4 of last year. Currency effects for the quarter were largely as expected. We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as technology and New License revenues were up 18% to $2.7 billion in Q4 and applications grew 22% this quarter to $1 billion, with Asia-Pacific particularly strong, including Japan, which grew during the quarter. 
Our North America Applications business passed SAP a while ago, and now, if you exclude Germany, we believe we have essentially caught up to them in Europe. Geographically, the quarter was strong and balanced with New License growing 16% in the Americas, 24% in APAC and 22% in EMEA, and the quarter wasn't dependent on any large deals. Software License Update and Product Support revenues were up 15% to $4 billion. Sun's hardware system revenues was $1.2 billion for the quarter. We're running the Sun business on a more profit-aware model. Compared to Q4 a year ago, we have made a big move away from selling products at a loss or reselling other company's products. Rather, we are focused on selling value-added systems where Sun's differentiation is very clear to our customers. For example, non-Sun storage was down significantly, Sun Storage and Tape grew very well and, of course, Exadata and Exalogic continue to show fantastic growth. This strategy shows up in our hardware gross margins, which were 56% this quarter, significantly higher than the 46% last year. Later this year, I expect the growth of the Sun hardware products to become quite obvious. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $10.8 billion, up 12% from last year. In addition to our strong top line performance, we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $5.2 billion, 19% higher than last year as our operating margin extended to 48%. We could be back at pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly as there remains ample leverage in our business model. 
For the year, our operating income grew 27% and even with the Sun Hardware business included in our results for the full year, we delivered non-GAAP operating margins only 2% -- 2 points below our all-time high. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% due to several favorable nonrecurring items, including agreements with worldwide taxing authorities. EPS grew 25% to $0.75 on a non-GAAP basis. The fact that we were able to put up these top line and bottom line results given our size, once again, demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio of enterprise products and the breadth and loyalty of our huge customer base and the strength of our operating model. 
We now have $29 billion in cash and marketable securities and operating cash flow increased to a record $11.2 billion. For the year, all free cash flow increased to $10.8 billion. As we've always said, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In this quarter, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for a total of a $422 million. For the full year, we repurchased 40.4 million shares for a total of approximately $1.2 billion. And the board again declared a dividend of $0.06. 
Now the guidance. As you remember, we had a spectacular Q1 last year with New License up 25%, non-GAAP EPS up 38% and GAAP EPS up 20%. So assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which is right now a positive 5% currency impact on license and revenue growth rates, our guidance for Q1 is as follows: New Software Licenses revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20%; Hardware Product revenue growth is expected to range from negative 5 to positive 5 and of course, that does not include the Hardware Support revenue; total revenue on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 9% to 12%; on a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 10% to 13%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.48; GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.33 to $0.36. Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 29% and non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%, which is nearly 4 points higher than our tax rate in the previous year. Now, of course, this may end up being different. 
With that, let me turn everything over to Larry for his comments."

That growth rate is twice as fast as any year this past decade. We're already more than twice as big as IBM, the former #1, and current #2 player in the Database business, and we're consistently growing faster than IBM and taking market share away from them. 
Why is it the Oracle Database business suddenly growing so fast? Because we've advanced our database technology to take full advantage of the latest trends in the database market: cloud computing databases, in-memory databases and now big data databases. This year, we did a number of cloud computing deals, and including a very large one with Salesforce.com last quarter. And this quarter, we did one with the biggest and best name in mobile devices and cloud computing in the world. That deal included our database software, Exadata machines, our cloud computing billing system and our cloud e-mail system that scales to millions of users, is all based on our technology. 
Today, more than 1,000 Exadatas are installed, and we plan on tripling that number this year. We think that's possible because Oracle apps run unchanged on Exadata. That's very different from IBM Netezza, which does not run Oracle apps or IBM DB2 apps or anything else, except applications that are custom-built for Netezza. The expansion of our Exadata business and our rapidly growing Exalogic business, plus a couple of new hardware and software appliances we plan  to introduce this fall, should turbo charge the overall growth of our Hardware business, making the top line and bottom line better than ever. We're very excited. Over to you, Mark"

I'm not sure this is one of the best numbers I'm ever aware of in the industry. A couple things that have us excited. First, our industry-focused business units grew faster at Oracle again, with broad-based strength across the industries. Second, our 19% new software license growth was broad-based with technology and apps both going at very strong rates. It's the first quarter we've ever sold than $1 billion in apps. We had great performance in every region and delivered license fee growth in mid-teens or higher in every region. Fourth, we've begun to make material progress in the Hardware Support attach rates. I'm not going to explain attach in detail today, but this is good news. The fundamentals of the business now is we're selling fewer units at higher prices, and we have higher margins and they have higher attach rates. These are the fundamentals of a solid hardware business. 
Last, Exadata. Our sequential growth was more than 50%. That's big growth and it was broad-based. We sold to more than 150 different customers with close to half buying multiple systems. P&G, JPMorgan Chase, Apple, Fidelity, Boeing have helped us now cross 1,000 systems mark installed Exadata systems. We have 300,000 database customers running Oracle database workloads. Every one of them is a prospect for Exadata. The exciting news is, in addition to this, the Exalogic ramp has been even better than Exadata and every one of our 100,000-plus Middleware customers is a prime prospect for Exalogic. 
Well I'll turn it over to Ken, who will take your questions."

The reason attach is important, I think you know this, the eventual Hardware Support revenue is defined by the volume of hardware you sell times the attach rate, which is the service dollars that you charge for that support and then how long the installed base stays there. And what we've done really, is move to a model now where we've got the service lined up with the sales activity that we attach the service to the actual sale. This may sound so elementary to you, but if you lose control of that in your process, and that had happened previously, it's actually a difficult set to work to get that back and we've done that, and that does start to lead, over time, to that inclining that Hardware Support revenue that you described. So it is an absolute key element. The other point in the Hardware business, Adam, just to add while we're on it, is that these fundamentals I described earlier are really important. Selling units that have no gross margin are easy to do. I could get -- I won't give you examples to like, but we have ways of selling lots of hardware without getting margin. We are focused on selling hardware systems. We are now selling fewer systems at a higher price that are of more value to the customer the stay installed longer. These are, and also we're doing that at higher margins, so these are the fundamentals of a solid Hardware business and then, of course, to the point we have to eventually grow that business on a top line and you have a very, very attractive business model."

And for you, Mark, if you could just comment down anecdotally upon the attach rate of database licenses to Exadata and also the attach rate of Middleware licenses to Exalogic, since you have obviously very ambitious goals for tripping the Hardware business that's got consequences for the Software business indeed, there is an attach rate trend there. That's it for me."

The attach rate Exalogic would be 100%, we'd have no other. The attach rate at Exadata would be 100%. One of the nice thing is Exadata and Exalogic will become a larger percentage of our overall Hardware business, having growing up a fairly small base now up to 1,000 machines and hopefully 3,000 machines next year as that gets to be a larger and larger overall base that improves our profitability. Exadata's growing faster than the traditional Sun line. So it improves our top line growth rate. And because of the 100% attach rate, it improves our service growth rate and our service margins. So overall, as we sell more and more engineering systems and fewer and fewer undifferentiated systems, we make more money on the hardware sale, we make more money on the associated service. And actually is an enabler that allows us to increase our rate of sales of our Middleware software, because our Middleware software runs better on Exalogic and that's the best Middleware combination you can buy. Exalogic hardware and Exalogic software from Oracle. The best database combination you can buy is the Oracle database running on the Exadata machine. So we actually sell more database software because of Exadata. We sold more Middleware software because of Exalogic. It's a virtuous circle that we plan to fully exploit at this current fiscal year.

I mean, this quarter, in case anyone missed it, was really basically an organic growth quarter for us and the license number is pretty much very little help from any kind of acquisition and, obviously, significantly faster than any of the world economies are really growing. So we've got a lot of very Oracle-specific momentum, and though we read the same newspapers  you do, we also have to be sensitive to the fact that our sales continues  to grow, we've done significant hiring and continue to be optimistic enough to continue to hire this next year.

And then when we get in front of more customers, we actually sell more software. And so, that's why we're adding more representation. These are both salespeople and presale people, technical people, if you will. They're in GBUs as well as in our regions and they are across all regions. So, for us, it's a simple case, if the salesperson giving you an example had 20 customers, we think there's opportunities for that salesperson to sell just as much software calling on 5 customers and, therefore, for us to get a higher productivity. And that's what we're doing, and that's probably the chatter you're hearing.

One appliance, that should surprise you is a large memory addition to Exadata for analytics and memory, so we continue to invest. We thought that would -- we've been the leader of in-memory database technology ever since we bought Tungsten. And that's for both for transactions and for preprocessing. We are, as memories become cheaper and larger scale, we changed as much of our algorithms and this in-memory analytics accelerator is going to be, again, coming out and we'll be announcing it in the fall at Oracle OpenWorld. In addition, attaching to our Exalogic box, there's a lot of misunderstanding about what's a dupe is, and is it a replacement for database. So the dupe is not a replacement for database. It's an adjunct to the database, which we think, is very, very important. It really is a tool for Java programmers. And we're the world leader in Java technology and we are building a big data accelerator to attach to our Exalogic box, which comes out also this fall. The big data accelerator includes some of the standard open source heavy software, HTFF, the heavy file system and a number of other pieces, but also some Oracle components that we think can dramatically speed up the entire math-produced process. And will be particularly attractive to Java programmers who are the ones, who asked for -- aspire to do. There are some interesting applications  they do, ETL is one. Log processings, and another. We're going to have a lot of those features, functions and prebuilt applications in our big data accelerator. So, Oracle has always followed database technology trends, whether it's object databases, in-memory databases and kept up with this technology and some, quite often led on innovation. Point to our Exadata database machine, where we were the first to take a software product, like Oracle, and marry it to specialized hardware. [indiscernible] came out with the combination before, but IBM has yet. IBM still hasn't come out with an appliance that runs their DB2 database very fast. Instead, they kind of ran out and did an acquisition as opposed to innovation in this area. So we have long been an innovator around the database, keeping it current, watching all of the trends, exploiting the technology and that's been showing up in our numbers. And that 28% in Q4 and 26% for the year is really a stunning number considering the size of our Oracle database business and how much faster we're growing than our rivals, DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server"

But at the same time, just wondering, is it as simple as the Commodity business is sort of drawing down more quickly than you dissipated? Or is there something else happening in that business?"

I think we're just following the fundamentals of building a solid business and that's what we're focused on and I'll tell you one more time, I've been doing this a long time --  longer than I want to admit. And I'm telling you these fundamentals are protecting your base. And to be very blunt, as we go through the transition from Sun, we have to get more coverage out in the market. I think you know that, but we are putting more coverage out in the market  to make sure we get that done, making sure we attach all the necessary peripheral software, service to that attach, those are the fundamentals we're working on. And if you follow what I told you earlier, there's no question we want to grow the top line right. And so to grow the top line right, getting rid of these low-margin businesses is key, because we don't get the attach, there is no aftermarket. And I tell you from a shareholder perspective, that's valueless revenue. So for us, we're focusing on that value. Revenue you're going to see, material growth in Exadata. You're now going to see growth from Exalogic that's going to participate as that becomes a more meaningful part of the portfolio. We'll be very focused on a couple of our competitors that we think have some vulnerabilities and we will be going after them. And you'll see more alignment across the Oracle sales force as we go forward. So focusing on those fundamentals, we'll be driving for growth, but very frankly through Q3 and Q4, our number one focus has been getting these fundamentals right. And as I tell you, numerically, I feel awfully good about it."

And Fusion is being completely rolled out for accounting, for human resources, for sales force automation. It's something we've been working on for 6 years. We're the only application vendor now that offers the same exact technology as a service, a Software-as-a-Service on our cloud or you can buy the software and put it on your private cloud. And by the way, if you put it on your private cloud, we'll run it for you, if you want us to, behind your firewall attached to your local area network with all the security inherent in that. We are -- our whole approach to kind of, if you will, cloud 2.0 as people say, we're not building multi-tenancy software. Remember that when I started my little company NetSuite and 6 months later, when Mark Benioff started his company, Salesforce.com, that was over a decade ago when virtualization wasn't so common for isolating different customers running on the same machine. So cloud 2.0, we used virtualized elastic cloud technology, very different than, let's say, with Salesforce.com is using more than almost a 15 -year-old multi-tenancy technology. We are offering that much higher degree of security and much higher degree of isolation when you run on our public cloud, which looks a lot more like Amazon.com, let's say, than Salesforce.com. We think that modern technology has such a huge security advantage that will -- Salesforce.com will be basing very, very serious competition for as Fusion's rolled out this year. And SAP has no answers at all. They've got nothing. So we've been competing very effectively against SAP over last several years. We passed them in North America, we've tied in Europe, in separate -- and German-speaking Europe, and now they're faced with, what do you got for cloud? That would be nothing. While we have a completely rewritten suite of applications built entirely in Java, runs on cloud 2.0, virtual and an elastic cloud that's virtualized, we have technology advantages over  Salesforce.com but they got nothing over at SAP. So we think this is going to be a huge contributor this year and the following year and the year after that, and it's going to allow us to take a significant amount of share from SAP and some share from our friends at Salesforce, who by the way, the Salesforce guys are, the customers aren't. So, when we make money -- when we sell ours, we make money, we like that."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and for fiscal year 2011, then I'll review the guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we delivered yet another exceptionally strong quarter to complete a fantastic year for Oracle. We continue to have a lot of company-specific momentum and we executed extremely well throughout the fiscal year exceeding even our own optimistic expectations quarter after quarter. 
For the year, we achieved 25% New License growth in Q1, 21% in Q2, 29% in Q3, and including this quarter, we delivered 23% New License growth for the full fiscal year. Our Software business is now even bigger than IBM's software business. For the year, we delivered 38% EPS growth in Q1, 33% in Q2, 40% in Q3, and including 25% this quarter, we delivered 33% EPS growth for the year, once again, way ahead of the 20% growth we promised. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year were $2.22, well above the consensus estimate of $1.88 when we started the year. And unlike a few of our competitors, we're not delivering this EPS growth by aggressively reducing our share count. Obviously, we're thrilled with our Q4 results. This was Oracle's first $10 billion quarter. New Software License revenue was up 19% to $3.6 billion, accelerating from 14% in Q4 of last year. Currency effects for the quarter were largely as expected. We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as technology and New License revenues were up 18% to $2.7 billion in Q4 and applications grew 22% this quarter to $1 billion, with Asia-Pacific particularly strong, including Japan, which grew during the quarter. 
Our North America Applications business passed SAP a while ago, and now, if you exclude Germany, we believe we have essentially caught up to them in Europe. Geographically, the quarter was strong and balanced with New License growing 16% in the Americas, 24% in APAC and 22% in EMEA, and the quarter wasn't dependent on any large deals. Software License Update and Product Support revenues were up 15% to $4 billion. Sun's hardware system revenues was $1.2 billion for the quarter. We're running the Sun business on a more profit-aware model. Compared to Q4 a year ago, we have made a big move away from selling products at a loss or reselling other company's products. Rather, we are focused on selling value-added systems where Sun's differentiation is very clear to our customers. For example, non-Sun storage was down significantly, Sun Storage and Tape grew very well and, of course, Exadata and Exalogic continue to show fantastic growth. This strategy shows up in our hardware gross margins, which were 56% this quarter, significantly higher than the 46% last year. Later this year, I expect the growth of the Sun hardware products to become quite obvious. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $10.8 billion, up 12% from last year. In addition to our strong top line performance, we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $5.2 billion, 19% higher than last year as our operating margin extended to 48%. We could be back at pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly as there remains ample leverage in our business model. 
For the year, our operating income grew 27% and even with the Sun Hardware business included in our results for the full year, we delivered non-GAAP operating margins only 2% -- 2 points below our all-time high. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% due to several favorable nonrecurring items, including agreements with worldwide taxing authorities. EPS grew 25% to $0.75 on a non-GAAP basis. The fact that we were able to put up these top line and bottom line results given our size, once again, demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio of enterprise products and the breadth and loyalty of our huge customer base and the strength of our operating model. 
We now have $29 billion in cash and marketable securities and operating cash flow increased to a record $11.2 billion. For the year, all free cash flow increased to $10.8 billion. As we've always said, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In this quarter, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for a total of a $422 million. For the full year, we repurchased 40.4 million shares for a total of approximately $1.2 billion. And the board again declared a dividend of $0.06. 
Now the guidance. As you remember, we had a spectacular Q1 last year with New License up 25%, non-GAAP EPS up 38% and GAAP EPS up 20%. So assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which is right now a positive 5% currency impact on license and revenue growth rates, our guidance for Q1 is as follows: New Software Licenses revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20%; Hardware Product revenue growth is expected to range from negative 5 to positive 5 and of course, that does not include the Hardware Support revenue; total revenue on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 9% to 12%; on a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 10% to 13%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.48; GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.33 to $0.36. Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 29% and non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%, which is nearly 4 points higher than our tax rate in the previous year. Now, of course, this may end up being different. 
With that, let me turn everything over to Larry for his comments."

That growth rate is twice as fast as any year this past decade. We're already more than twice as big as IBM, the former #1, and current #2 player in the Database business, and we're consistently growing faster than IBM and taking market share away from them. 
Why is it the Oracle Database business suddenly growing so fast? Because we've advanced our database technology to take full advantage of the latest trends in the database market: cloud computing databases, in-memory databases and now big data databases. This year, we did a number of cloud computing deals, and including a very large one with Salesforce.com last quarter. And this quarter, we did one with the biggest and best name in mobile devices and cloud computing in the world. That deal included our database software, Exadata machines, our cloud computing billing system and our cloud e-mail system that scales to millions of users, is all based on our technology. 
Today, more than 1,000 Exadatas are installed, and we plan on tripling that number this year. We think that's possible because Oracle apps run unchanged on Exadata. That's very different from IBM Netezza, which does not run Oracle apps or IBM DB2 apps or anything else, except applications that are custom-built for Netezza. The expansion of our Exadata business and our rapidly growing Exalogic business, plus a couple of new hardware and software appliances we plan to introduce this fall, should turbo charge the overall growth of our Hardware business, making the top line and bottom line better than ever. We're very excited. Over to you, Mark"

I'm not sure this is one of the best numbers I'm ever aware of in the industry. A couple things that have us excited. First, our industry-focused business units grew faster at Oracle again, with broad-based strength across the industries. Second, our 19% new software license growth was broad-based with technology and apps both going at very strong rates. It's the first quarter we've ever sold than $1 billion in apps. We had great performance in every region and delivered license fee growth in mid-teens or higher in every region. Fourth, we've begun to make material progress in the Hardware Support attach rates. I'm not going to explain attach in detail today, but this is good news. The fundamentals of the business now is we're selling fewer units at higher prices, and we have higher margins and they have higher attach rates. These are the fundamentals of a solid hardware business. 
Last, Exadata. Our sequential growth was more than 50%. That's big growth and it was broad-based. We sold to more than 150 different customers with close to half buying multiple systems. P&G, JPMorgan Chase, Apple, Fidelity, Boeing have helped us now cross 1,000 systems mark in sold Exadata systems. We have 300,000 database customers running Oracle database workloads. Every one of them is a prospect for Exadata. The exciting news is, in addition to this, the Exalogic ramp has been even better than Exadata and every one of our 100,000-plus Middleware customers is a prime prospect for Exalogic. 
Well I'll turn it over to Ken, who will take your questions."

The reason attach is important, I think you know this, the eventual Hardware Support revenue is defined by the volume of hardware you sell times the attach rate, which is the service dollars that you charge for that support and then how long the installed base stays there. And what we've done, really, is move to a model now where we've got the service lined up with the sales activity that we attach the service to the actual sale. This may sound so elementary to you, but if you lose control of that in your process, and that had happened previously, it's actually a difficult set to work to get that back and we've done that, and that does start to lead, over time, to that incline in that Hardware Support revenue that you described. So it is an absolute key element. The other point in the Hardware business, Adam, just to add while we're on it, is that these fundamentals I described earlier are really important. Selling units that have no gross margin are easy to do. I could get -- I won't give you examples to like, but we have ways of selling lots of hardware without getting margin. We are focused on selling hardware systems. We are now selling fewer systems at a higher price that are of more value to the customer that stay installed longer. These are, and also we're doing that at higher margins, so these are the fundamentals of a solid Hardware business and then, of course, to the point we have to eventually grow that business on a top line and you have a very, very attractive business model."

The attach rate Exalogic would be 100%, we'd have no other. The attach rate at Exadata would be 100%. One of the nice thing is Exadata and Exalogic will become a larger percentage of our overall Hardware business, having growing up a fairly small base now up to 1,000 machines and hopefully 3,000 machines next year as that gets to be a larger and larger overall base that improves our profitability. Exadata's growing faster than the traditional Sun line. So it improves our top line growth rate. And because of the 100% attach rate, it improves our service growth rate and our service margins. So overall, as we sell more and more engineering systems and fewer and fewer undifferentiated systems, we make more money on the hardware sale, we make more money on the associated service. And actually is an enabler that allows us to increase our rate of sales of our Middleware software, because our Middleware software runs better on Exalogic and that's the best Middleware combination you can buy. Exalogic hardware and Exalogic software from Oracle. The best database combination you can buy is the Oracle database running on the Exadata machine. So we actually sell more database software because of Exadata. We sold more Middleware software because of Exalogic. It's a virtuous circle that we plan to fully exploit at this current fiscal year.

So we've got a lot of very Oracle-specific momentum, and though we read the same newspapers  you do, we also have to be sensitive to the fact that our sales force continues  to grow, we've done significant hiring and continue to be optimistic enough to continue to hire this next year.

And then when we get in front of more customers, we actually sell more software. And so, that's why we're adding more representation. These are both salespeople and presale people, technical people, if you will. They're in GBUs as well as in our regions and they are across all regions. So, for us, it's a simple case, if the salesperson giving you an example had 20 customers, we think there's opportunities for that salesperson to sell just as much software calling on 5 customers and, therefore, for us to get a higher productivity. And that's what we're doing, and that's probably the chatter you're hearing.

One appliance, that should surprise you is a large memory addition to Exadata for analytics and memory, so we continue to invest. We thought that would -- we've been the leader of in-memory database technology ever since we bought Tungsten. And that's for both for transactions and for preprocessing. We are, as memories become cheaper and larger scale, we've changed as much of our algorithms and this in-memory analytics accelerator is going to be, again, coming out and we'll be announcing it in the fall at Oracle OpenWorld. In addition, attaching to our Exalogic box, there's a lot of misunderstanding about what's a dupe is, and is it a replacement for database. So the dupe is not a replacement for database. It's an adjunct to the database, which we think, is very, very important. It really is a tool for Java programmers. And we're the world leader in Java technology and we are building a big data accelerator to attach to our Exalogic box, which comes out also this fall. The big data accelerator includes some of the standard open source heavy software, HTFF, the heavy file system and a number of other pieces, but also some Oracle components that we think can dramatically speed up the entire math-produced process. And will be particularly attractive to Java programmers who are the ones, who asked for -- aspire to do. There are some interesting applications they do, ETL is one. Log processing is another. We're going to have a lot of those features, functions and prebuilt applications in our big data accelerator. So, Oracle has always followed database technology trends, whether it's object databases, in-memory databases and kept up with this technology and some, quite often led on innovation. Point to our Exadata database machine, where we were the first to take a software product, like Oracle, and marry it to specialized hardware. [indiscernible] came out with the combination before, but IBM has yet. IBM still hasn't come out with an appliance that runs their DB2 database very fast. Instead, they kind of ran out and did an acquisition as opposed to innovation in this area. So we have long been an innovator around the database, keeping it current, watching all of the trends, exploiting the technology and that's been showing up in our numbers. And that 28% in Q4 and 26% for the year is really a stunning number considering the size of our Oracle database business and how much faster we're growing than our rivals, DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server"

And Fusion is being completely rolled out for accounting, for human resources, for sales force automation. It's something we've been working on for 6 years. We're the only application vendor now that offers the same exact technology as a service, a Software-as-a-Service on our cloud or you can buy the software and put it on your private cloud. And by the way, if you put it on your private cloud, we'll run it for you, if you want us to, behind your firewall attached to your local area network with all the security inherent in that. We are -- our whole approach to kind of, if you will, cloud 2.0 as people say, we're not building multi-tenancy software. Remember that when I started my little company NetSuite and 6 months later, when Mark Benioff started his company, Salesforce.com, that was over a decade ago when virtualization wasn't so common for isolating different customers running on the same machine. So cloud 2.0, we used virtualized elastic cloud technology, very different than, let's say, what Salesforce.com is using more than almost a 15 -year-old multi-tenancy technology. We are offering that much higher degree of security and much higher degree of isolation when you run on our public cloud, which looks a lot more like Amazon.com, let's say, than Salesforce.com. We think that modern technology has such a huge security advantage that will -- Salesforce.com will be basing very, very serious competition for as Fusion's rolled out this year. And SAP has no answers at all. They've got nothing. So we've been competing very effectively against SAP over last several years. We passed them in North America, we've tied in Europe, in separate -- and German-speaking Europe, and now they're faced with, what do you got for cloud? That would be nothing. While we have a completely rewritten suite of applications built entirely in Java, runs on cloud 2.0, virtual and an elastic cloud that's virtualized, we have technology advantages over Salesforce.com but they got nothing over at SAP. So we think this is going to be a huge contributor this year and the following year and the year after that, and it's going to allow us to take a significant amount of share from SAP and some share from our friends at Salesforce, who by the way, the Salesforce guys are, the customers aren't. So, when we make money -- when we sell ours, we make money, we like that."

I'll then review guidance for Q2 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As you can see, we delivered another great quarter as we executed well throughout the quarter, including late July and August. Our Q1 results against our June guidance made clear that we continue to have a lot of company-specific momentum. Obviously, we're pleased with the results. Our New Software license revenue was up 17% to $1.5 billion building an exceptional growth of 25% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum at Technology and License revenues were up 14% to $1.1 billion and Applications grew 23% this quarter to $428 million with Europe particularly strong. Geographically, the quarter was balanced with New License growing 10% in the Americas, 20% in APAC and 25% in EMEA. 
The quarter was also not dependent on any large deals. Software License Update and Product Support revenues were up 16% to $4 billion. Reported tax and renewal rates continue at the usual high level. Hardware Systems revenue was $1 billion for the quarter. This quarter, Hardware growth margins were 54%, significantly higher than the 48% last year as we continue to ship the product mix to more profitable products and engineered systems and as we continue to improve our supply chain efficiencies. 
Total revenues for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 11% from last year. We matched this topline momentum with business discipline and we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.6 billion, 21% higher than last year as our operating margin expanded to 42% from 39% last year. 
We still believe there remains ample leverage in our business model and we could be back at our pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly. The non-GAAP tax rates for the quarter was 26.5%. EPS for the quarter grew 14% to $0.48 on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll tell you that really being able to put up these topline and bottom-line results given our size once again demonstrates the real strength of our product line, the loyalty of our customer base and the strength of the operating model. We have the products in the market that customers want to buy. And OpenWorld, which starts next month will only make us even more obvious. 
Operating cash flow increased to a record $12.8 billion over the last 4 quarters with operating cash flow increasing this quarter to $5.4 billion, up $1.6 billion from $3.8 billion in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow grew 46% to a record $12.3 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have nearly $32 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Now as we said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend and we'll continue to be opportunistic. This quarter, we repurchased 27.5 million shares. And the Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to the guidance. And as many of you remember, we had a great second quarter last year with New License up 21% on a non-GAAP basis and up 33%. And GAAP EPS up 27%. So let me just say that again. New License was up 21%, non-GAAP EPS was up 33% and GAAP EPS was up 27%. So those are pretty tough comparisons and we don't expect much help from currency because at this point, it looks like only 1% is where it is. 
New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 6% to 16% in growth. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from flat to negative 5%. However, we do expect gross margins and profitability of our overall Hardware business to improve during the quarter as we continue to move away from selling low-margin commodity server and focus on selling engineered systems like Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Solaris system. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.58, up from $0.51 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 and $0.46. This guidance is been to GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 27%, of course, it may end up being different. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

In Q1 we transition away from selling low-margin commodity servers to selling high-margin engineering systems, increasing both the gross margins and the overall profitability of our Hardware business.

Each of these new engineered systems ultimately combine Oracle Software, Oracle Silicon and Oracle Hardware to deliver extreme high-performing, all tolerance high reliability and improved ease-of-use. 
The large of these engineered systems is the full tolerance, SPARC Supercluster, featuring our new SPARC T4 microprocessor that runs up to 5x faster than a T3 microprocessor that replace it. Our new feature-rich Solaris 11 operating system and the ultra high-performance Exadata Flash disk storage system. The SPARC Supercluster runs the Oracle Database Applications faster and less expensively than anything available from IBM. Thus, we expect that many customers in our large SPARC Solaris install base will be upgradign to SPARC supercluster's. Mark, it's all yours."

Second. Exadata Exalogic. Year-to-date growth was nearly triple digit, broad-based across industries and geographies and we sold systems to more than 150 unique customers of which 100 were new Exadata or Exalogic. 
Third, our industry-focused solutions are increasing in relevance to customers and that shows up in our 17% growth but our industry focused solutions again grew faster than Oracle did in license growth. So again, good help from the industry-focused solutions. 
Now fourth I want to make sure this point is clear. In addition to Exadata and Exalogic growth, our SPARC server products grew this quarter. We have growth in the core SPARC product line. Our strategy around high-intellectual property, high attach, high-margin solutions, that include Exadata, Exalogic and the SPARC server products is working.

The guidance is the guidance. I think second point, I think we're really not as focused to be very frank on the Hardware growth rate as we are on the point that I just made of growing the right things in the product line. The things that are attributable to long-term profitability, long-term positioning of the customer, long-term positioning in the datacenter. And I'll give you an example. If you take that core server product line that we grew in the quarter plus SPARC server product line, if you took the M-Series product, just imagine, Adam, that we sold $100 million worth of M-series products. And these are rough numbers. My guess over 5 years, our profitability on that is roughly $100 million when you include the attach and support and the service. Just the same, if we sold $100 million of X86 with no intellectual property, my guess, our profitability would be less than 1/5 of that. And I only bring that up to give you the polarization of the impact of intellectual property, the alignment of the intellectual property to the solution, the alignment of that to support the ability for us to do things for the customer and the eventual profitability for the company. So what we're focused on are the solutions like what Larry described are coming out, Exadata, Exalogic, the core SPARC product line and that's what we're focused. And in that context, I think we are turning around the business. I think you are seeing some of the momentum. And if you see the market turns data to show you the facts that we are gaining share in that core part of the product line."

Furthermore, I'm not sure we're going to come up with 4 new intersystems, one of which is about superclusters and we're also going to have a big data engineering system that we're going to introduce at Oracle OpenWorld. So we think as more and more data gets computer on, a lot of that data finds its way into an Oracle Database and the cloud database business is to grow in an accelerated rate."

I think we'd look over the next several years, the database is going to continue to grow. The ability to direct database performance with capabilities like Exadata and Supercluster as Larry talked about earlier, aren't going to become as much a novelty as they are a requirement for all the people are going to try and get an opportunity to get this data.

I think certainly next, we would expect our overall Hardware business to have topline growth, no question about it. And the transition right now is we've got -- our axle line up almost doubled in the quarter in Q1. Our overall SPARC line was up. Our servers, our x86 line commodity line was down and Sun had to practice. It's selling x86 at very, very low margins. And we reward our salespeople based on margins. So we don't make money selling low-margin commodity x86 boxes and our salespeople don't make any money selling them. And therefore, we're deemphasizing that business. That business is shrinking. However, our profitable businesses in servers, the Exa line and the SPARC line are growing. And also, our storage, the system is growing. Our polar system is growing. The Exadata system storage is growing. So our disc storage systems are all growing, the ones with our IT. However, we also sell third-party disks without our IT at very low margins. Those are still in the system. And we expect those low-margin storage systems to also decline because again, we pay our salespeople based on margins and there is no margin. There's very low margin on those products. We don't care about selling those products because we don't make any money. I think your question is when will we sell -- when will that be out of the system. And that's pretty much only selling servers or storage with our IP and I think that will be next fiscal year you'll see topline growth in the Hardware business. But this fiscal year, you'll see continued improvement in gross margin and continued improvement in profitability in our overall Hardware business, the commodity this will gradually shrinking every quarter.

And I'm not going to talk about what other databases are going to replace relational database. And what actually happened is that object database capabilities got integrated into the Oracle Database so Oracle just the relational database with database. And then when there is thing called text databases or text search. And those were separate databases and Oracle then incorporated a text search, text capability into the Oracle Database. And then there were these things called XML databases and separate XML databases and Oracle integrated XML capability. And now people are talking a lot about unstructured data and things like autonomy. Oracle's strategy has always been to integrate additional types of data into the Oracle Database. And a lot of it is unstructured data whether it's video or audio or images, all of those. We think the transition continues. We started relational then object then text then XML. Now a lot of different types of unstructured data types all going into the Oracle databases. Finally, big data or the searching of large amounts of data Hadoop. After had to finish as filtering the data, the place you want to put that data is in Oracle Database and that's what a lot of our customers are doing. And we are exploiting the trend, the big data technology and the big data trend, if you prefer, by building a Hadoop appliance that attaches to the Oracle Exadata database or any Oracle Database for that matter. But you don't have to buy a Hadoop plan, you can use whatever servers you want running Hadoop and we provide the interface between Hadoop and the Oracle Database.

I'll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As you can see, we delivered another great quarter as we executed well throughout the quarter, including late July and August. Our Q1 results against our June guidance made clear that we continue to have a lot of company-specific momentum. Obviously, we're pleased with the results. 
New Software license revenue was up 17% to $1.5 billion, building off exceptional growth of 25% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as Technology New License revenues were up 14% to $1.1 billion and Applications grew 23% this quarter to $428 million with Europe particularly strong. Geographically, the quarter was balanced with New License growing 10% in the Americas, 20% in APAC and 25% in EMEA. 
The quarter was also not dependent on any large deals. Software License Update and Product Support revenues were up 16% to $4 billion. Support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Hardware systems revenue was $1 billion for the quarter. This quarter, Hardware gross margins were 54%, significantly higher than the 48% last year as we continue to shift the product mix to more profitable products and engineered systems and as we continue to improve our supply chain efficiencies. 
Total revenues for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 11% from last year. We matched this top line momentum with business discipline, and we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.6 billion, 21% higher than last year as our operating margin expanded to 42% from 39% last year. 
We still believe there remains ample leverage in our business model, and we could be back at our pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.5%. EPS for the quarter grew 14% to $0.48 on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll tell you that, really, being able to put up these top line and bottom line results given our size once again demonstrates the real strength of our product line, the loyalty of our customer base and the strength of the operating model. We have the products in the market that customers want to buy. And OpenWorld, which starts next month, will only makes this even more obvious. 
Operating cash flow increased to a record $12.8 billion over the last 4 quarters, with operating cash flow increasing this quarter to $5.4 billion, up $1.6 billion from $3.8 billion in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow grew 46% to a record $12.3 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have nearly $32 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Now as we said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend and we'll continue to be opportunistic. This quarter, we repurchased 27.5 million shares, and the Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to the guidance. And as many of you remember, we had a great second quarter last year with New License up 21% on a non-GAAP basis and up 33% and GAAP EPS up 27%. So let me just say that again. New License was up 21%, non-GAAP EPS was up 33% and GAAP EPS was up 27%. So those are pretty tough comparisons, and we don't expect much help from currency because at this point, it looks like only 1% stays where it is. 
New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 6% to 16% in growth. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from flat to negative 5%. However, we do expect gross margins and profitability of our overall Hardware business to improve during the quarter as we continue to move away from selling low-margin commodity server and focus on selling engineered systems like Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Solaris system. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.58, up from $0.51 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 27%. Of course, it may end up being different. 
With that, I'd turn it over to Larry for his comments."

In Q1, the transition away from selling low-margin commodity servers to selling high-margin engineering systems increased both the gross margins and the overall profitability of our Hardware business. In Q2, we will accelerate that trend when we introduce 4 brand-new engineered systems products. Each of these new engineered systems ultimately combine the Oracle software, Oracle silicon and Oracle hardware to deliver extreme high performance, fault-tolerant, high reliability and improved ease of use. 
The largest of these new engineered systems is the fault tolerant SPARC Supercluster, featuring our new SPARC T4 microprocessor that runs up to 5x faster than a T3 microprocessor that replace it. Our new feature-rich Solaris 11 operating system and the ultra high-performance Exadata Flash disk storage system. The SPARC Supercluster runs the Oracle Database Applications faster and less expensively than anything available from IBM. Thus, we expect that many customers in our large SPARC Solaris installed base will be upgrading to SPARC Superclusters. 
Mark, it's all yours."

It was primarily organic broad-based across tech and apps, both growing double digits. Performance across geographies was balanced. One number worth noting is apps in Europe was up over 60%, 6-0 percent.
Second, Exadata Exalogic. Unit growth was nearly triple digit, broad-based across industries and geographies, and we sold systems to more than 150 unique customers, of which 100 were new Exadata or Exalogic. 
Third, our industry-focused solutions are increasing in relevance to customers and that shows up in our 17% growth, but our industry-focused solutions again grew faster than Oracle did in license growth. So again, good help from the industry-focused solutions. 
Now fourth, I want to make sure this point is clear. In addition to Exadata and Exalogic growth, our SPARC server products grew this quarter. We had growth in the core SPARC product line. Our strategy around high-intellectual property, high attach, high-margin solutions, that include Exadata, Exalogic and the SPARC server products is working. You're also beginning to see that show up in these industry market share figures that show us gaining shares. 
Last, we are continuing to hire. We added 350 people to our sales organization in Q1. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ken for your questions"

The guidance is the guidance. I think second point, I think we're really not as focused, to be very frank, on the Hardware growth rate as we are on the point that I just made of growing the right things in the product line. The things that are attributable to long-term profitability, long-term positioning of the customer, long-term positioning in the data center. And I'll try to give you an example. If you take that core server product line that we grew in the quarter across SPARC server product line, if you took an M-series product, just imagine, Adam, that we sold $100 million worth of M-series products. And these are rough numbers. My guess over 5 years, our profitability on that is roughly $100 million when you include the attach and the support and the service. Just the same, if we sold $100 million of x86 with no intellectual property, my guess our profitability would be less than 1/5 of that. And I only bring that up to give you the polarization of the impact of intellectual property, the alignment of that intellectual property to a solution, the alignment of that to support the ability for us to do things for the customer and the eventual profitability for the company. So what we're focused on are the solutions like what Larry described are coming out, Exadata, Exalogic, the core SPARC product line and that's what we're focused. And in that context, I think we are turning around the business. I think you are seeing some of the momentum. And if you see the market share charts, they seem to show you the facts that we are gaining share in that core part of the product line."

Sun filled that stuff, and we are phasing out that business. We have no interest in it whatsoever. We have interest in selling systems that include our IP. That's how we're going to drive the profitability of our overall Hardware business, eventually. I think that's in fairly short order. Our engineered systems will be growing at such a high rate that the overall Hardware business top line will grow also.

I think certainly next fiscal year, we would expect our overall Hardware business to have top line growth, no question about it. And the transition right now is we've got -- our Exa line almost doubled in the quarter in Q1. Our overall SPARC line was up on servers. Our x86 commodity line was down, and Sun had a practice of selling x86s at very, very low margins and we reward our salespeople based on margins. So we don't make money selling low-margin commodity x86 boxes, and our salespeople don't make any money selling them. And therefore, they're not -- we're deemphasizing that business. That business is shrinking. However, our profitable businesses in servers, the Exa line and the SPARC line, are growing. And also, in storage, our ZFS system is growing. Our Pillar system is growing. The Exadata storage system is growing. So our disc storage systems are all growing, the ones with our IP. However, we also sell third-party disks without our IP at very low margins. Those are still in the system. And we expect those low-margin storage systems to also decline because, again, we pay our salespeople based on margins and there is no margin. There is very low margin on those products. We don't care about selling those products because we don't make any money. I think your question is when will we sell -- when will that be out of the system. And that's pretty much only be selling servers and storage with our IP, and I think that will be -- next fiscal year, you'll see top line growth in the Hardware business. But this fiscal year, you'll see continued improvement in gross margin and continued improvement in profitability in our overall Hardware business even though the commodity business will be gradually shrinking every quarter. I don't know if that answered your question."

We added -- I don't know how many people on the call are my age, probably no one. But a long time ago, after relational databases came out, there was a next-generation database that were called object databases. And everyone talks about, ""Will object databases are going to replace relational databases?"" And what actually happened is that object database capabilities got integrated into the Oracle Database. So Oracle seized just the relational database. It can be relational and object databases, a really strong object database. And then there were these things called text databases or text search, and those were separate databases. And Oracle then incorporated a text search, a text capability, into the Oracle Database. And then there were these things called XML databases and separate XML databases, and Oracle integrated XML capability into it. Now people are talking a lot about unstructured data and things like autonomy. Oracle's strategy has always been to integrate additional types of data into the Oracle Database. And a lot of it is unstructured data, whether it's video or audio or images, all of those. We think the transition continues. We started relational then object then text then XML. Now a lot of different types of unstructured data types all going into the Oracle Database. Finally, big data or the searching of large amounts of data using Hadoop. After Hadoop finishes filtering the data, the place you want to put that data is in Oracle Database, and that's what a lot of our customers are doing. And we are exploiting the trend, the big data technology and the big data trend, if you prefer, by building a Hadoop appliance that attaches to the Oracle Exadata database or any Oracle Database for that matter. But you don't have to buy our Hadoop appliance if you can use whatever servers you want running Hadoop, and we provide the interface between Hadoop and the Oracle Database. The idea is all of your data should be -- you should be able to put all of your data regardless of data type into the Oracle Database where it can be stored securely and reliably. And you could search it and get answers to your questions very quickly."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we delivered another great quarter as we executed well throughout the quarter,",746,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As you can see, we delivered another great quarter as we executed well throughout the quarter, including late July and August. Our Q1 results against our June guidance made clear that we continue to have a lot of company-specific momentum. Obviously, we're pleased with the results. 
New Software license revenue was up 17% to $1.5 billion, building off exceptional growth of 25% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as Technology New License revenues were up 14% to $1.1 billion and Applications grew 23% this quarter to $428 million with Europe particularly strong. Geographically, the quarter was balanced with New License growing 10% in the Americas, 20% in APAC and 25% in EMEA. 
The quarter was also not dependent on any large deals. Software License Update and Product Support revenues were up 16% to $4 billion. Support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Hardware Systems revenue was $1 billion for the quarter. This quarter, Hardware gross margins were 54%, significantly higher than the 48% last year as we continue to shift the product mix to more profitable products and engineered systems and as we continue to improve our supply chain efficiency. 
Total revenues for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 11% from last year. We matched this top line momentum with business discipline, and we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.6 billion, 21% higher than last year as our operating margin expanded to 42% from 39% last year. 
We still believe there remains ample leverage in our business model, and we could be back at our pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.5%. EPS for the quarter grew 14% to $0.48 on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll tell you that, really, being able to put up these top line and bottom line results given our size, once again, demonstrates the real strength of our product line, the loyalty of our customer base and the strength of the operating model. We have the products in the market that customers want to buy. And OpenWorld, which starts next month, will only make this even more obvious. 
Operating cash flow increased to a record $12.8 billion over the last 4 quarters, with operating cash flow increasing this quarter to $5.4 billion, up $1.6 billion from $3.8 billion in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow grew 46% to a record $12.3 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have nearly $32 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Now as we said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend and we'll continue to be opportunistic. This quarter, we repurchased 27.5 million shares, and the Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to the guidance. And as many of you remember, we had a great second quarter last year with New License up 21% on a non-GAAP basis and up 33% and GAAP EPS up 27%. So let me just say that again. New License was up 21%, non-GAAP EPS was up 33% and GAAP EPS was up 27%. So those are pretty tough comparisons, and we don't expect much help from currency because at this point, it looks like only 1% stays where it is. 
New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 6% to 16% in growth. Hardware Product revenue growth is expected to range from flat to negative 5%. However, we do expect gross margins and profitability of our overall Hardware business to improve during the quarter as we continue to move away from selling low-margin commodity servers and focus on selling engineered systems like Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Solaris system. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.58, up from $0.51 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 27%. Of course, it may end up being different. 
With that, I'd turn it over to Larry for his comments."

In Q1, the transition away from selling low-margin commodity servers to selling high-margin engineering systems increased both the gross margins and the overall profitability of our Hardware business. In Q2, we will accelerate that trend when we introduce 4 brand-new engineered systems products. Each of these new engineered systems optimally combine Oracle software, Oracle silicon and Oracle hardware to deliver extreme high performance, fault-tolerant high reliability and improved ease of use. 
The largest of these new-engineered systems is the fault tolerant SPARC Supercluster, featuring our new SPARC T4 microprocessor that runs up to 5x faster than a T3 microprocessor it replaces. Our new feature-rich Solaris 11 operating system and the ultra high-performance Exadata Flash disk storage system. The SPARC Supercluster runs the Oracle Database applications faster and less expensively than anything available from IBM. Thus, we expect that many customers in our large SPARC Solaris installed base will be upgrading to SPARC Superclusters.

It was primarily organic broad-based across tech and apps, both growing double digits. Performance across geographies was balanced. One number worth noting is apps in Europe was up over 60%, 6-0 percent.
Second, Exadata Exalogic. Unit growth was nearly triple digit, broad-based across industries and geographies, and we sold systems to more than 150 unique customers, of which 100 were new Exadata or Exalogic. 
Third, our industry-focused solutions are increasing in relevance to customers and that shows up in our 17% growth, but our industry-focused solutions again grew faster than Oracle did in License growth. So again, good help from the industry-focused solutions. 
Now fourth, I want to make sure this point is clear. In addition to Exadata and Exalogic growth, our SPARC server products grew this quarter. We had growth in the core SPARC product line. Our strategy around high-intellectual property, high attach, high-margin solutions, that include Exadata, Exalogic and the SPARC server products is working. You're also beginning to see that show up in these industry market share figures that show us gaining shares.

The guidance is the guidance. I think second point, I think we're really not as focused, to be very frank, on the Hardware growth rate as we are on the point that I just made of growing the right things in the product line. The things that are attributable to long-term profitability, long-term positioning of the customer, long-term positioning in the data center. And I'll try to give you an example. If you take that core server product line that we grew in the quarter across SPARC server product line, if you took an M-series product, just imagine, Adam, that we sold $100 million worth of M-series products. And these are rough numbers. My guess over 5 years, our profitability on that is roughly $100 million when you include the attach and the support and the service. Just the same, if we sold $100 million of x86 with no intellectual property, my guess our profitability would be less than 1/5 of that. And I only bring that up to give you the polarization of the impact of intellectual property, the alignment of that intellectual property to a solution, the alignment of that to support the ability for us to do things for the customer and the eventual profitability for the company. So what we're focused on are the solutions like what Larry described are coming out, Exadata, Exalogic, the core SPARC product line and that's where we're focused. And in that context, I think we are turning around the business. I think you are seeing some of the momentum. And if you see the market share charts, they tend to show you the facts that we are gaining share in that core part of the product line."

We don't make money selling that. sold that stuff, and we are phasing out that business. We have no interest in it whatsoever. We have interest in selling systems that include our IP. That's how we're going to drive the profitability of our overall Hardware business, eventually. I think that's in fairly short order. Our engineered systems will be growing at such a high rate that the overall Hardware business top line will grow also. But what's really important is to continuously grow our margins in the Hardware business and our profitability in the Hardware business, so we can meet Safra's goal, which is getting back to our pre-Sun acquisition's overall profit margins.

We had some really cool business that showed up in Europe too. We had a great win at Deutsche Post with Exadata, Exalogic. We had some great Apps to Disk wins in Europe in the quarter. I gave you the applications growth number. It's 60%. I would be cautious to Safra's point that this is not maybe macro but may be more Oracle specific. We got a great team over there, and to add to it, we're hiring in Europe right now. We are adding to our sales force in Europe right now. We think there is more market to cover, and there's more opportunity to go get. I guess, I'd said it another way, maybe a bit of a plug. I'm very proud of those guys. They're doing a very good job. They are gaining share, and their Exadata quarter was, frankly, very impressive as well."

We think we really don't want to have 2 separate databases kind of an autonomy-like unstructured database and Oracle-structured data. We think that data should be integrated with a single database technology. That's always been our strategy for Oracle.

I think when you look over the next several years, the database is going to continue to grow. The ability to direct database performance with capabilities like Exadata and Supercluster, as Larry talked about earlier, aren't going to become as much a novelty as they are a requirement for all the people that are going to be paying and trying to get an opportunity to get this data.

I think certainly next fiscal year, we would expect our overall Hardware business to have top line growth, no question about it. And the transition right now is we've got -- our Exa line almost doubled in the quarter in Q1. Our overall SPARC line was up on servers. Our x86 commodity line was down, and Sun had a practice of selling x86s at very, very low margins and we reward our salespeople based on margins. So we don't make money selling low-margin commodity x86 boxes, and our salespeople don't make any money selling them. And therefore, they're not -- we're deemphasizing that business. That business is shrinking. However, our profitable businesses in servers, the Exa line and the SPARC line, are growing. And also, in storage, our ZFS system is growing. Our Pillar system is growing. The Exadata storage system is growing. So our disk storage systems are all growing, the ones with our IP. However, we also sell third-party disks without our IP at very low margins. Those are still in the system. And we expect those low-margin storage systems to also decline because, again, we pay our salespeople based on margins and there is no margin. There is very low margin on those products. We don't care about selling those products because we don't make any money. I think your question is when will we sell -- when will that be out of the system. And us pretty much only be selling servers and storage with our IP, and I think that will be next fiscal year, you'll see top line growth in the Hardware business. But this fiscal year, you'll see continued improvement in gross margin and continued improvement in profitability in our overall Hardware business even though the commodity business will be gradually shrinking every quarter. I don't know if that answered your question."

We added -- I don't know how many people on the call are my age, probably no one. But a long time ago, after relational databases came out, there was a next-generation database that were called object databases. And everyone talked about, ""Well, object databases are going to replace relational databases"" And what actually happened is that object database capabilities got integrated into the Oracle Database. So Oracle seized just the relational database. It can be relational and object databases, a really strong object database. And then there were these things called text databases or text search, and those were separate databases. And Oracle then incorporated a text search, a text capability, into the Oracle Database. And then there were these things called XML databases and separate XML databases, and Oracle integrated XML capability into it. Now people are talking a lot about unstructured data and things like autonomy. Oracle's strategy has always been to integrate additional types of data into the Oracle Database. And a lot of it is unstructured data, whether it's video or audio or images, all of those. We think the transition continues. We started relational then object then text then XML. Now a lot of different types of unstructured data types all going into the Oracle Database. Finally, big data or the searching of large amounts of data using Hadoop. After Hadoop finishes filtering the data, the place you want to put that data is in Oracle Database, and that's what a lot of our customers are doing. And we are exploiting the trend, the big data technology and the big data trend, if you prefer, by building a Hadoop appliance that attaches to the Oracle Exadata database or any Oracle Database for that matter. But you don't have to buy our Hadoop appliance if you can use whatever servers you want running Hadoop, and we provide the interface between Hadoop and the Oracle Database. The idea is all of your data should be -- you should be able to put all of your data regardless of data type into the Oracle Database where it can be stored securely and reliably.

As you can see, we delivered another great quarter as we executed well throughout the quarter,",746,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As you can see, we delivered another great quarter as we executed well throughout the quarter, including late July and August. Our Q1 results against our June guidance made clear that we continue to have a lot of company-specific momentum. Obviously, we're pleased with the results. 
New software license revenue was up 17% to $1.5 billion, building off exceptional growth of 25% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as technology new license revenues were up 14% to $1.1 billion and applications grew 23% this quarter to $428 million with Europe particularly strong. Geographically, the quarter was balanced with new license growing 10% in the Americas, 20% in APAC and 25% in EMEA. 
The quarter was also not dependent on any large deals. Software license update and product support revenues were up 16% to $4 billion. Support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Hardware systems revenue was $1 billion for the quarter. This quarter, hardware gross margins were 54%, significantly higher than the 48% last year as we continue to shift the product mix to more profitable products and engineered systems and as we continue to improve our supply chain efficiency. 
Total revenues for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 11% from last year. We matched this top line momentum with business discipline, and we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.6 billion, 21% higher than last year as our operating margin expanded to 42% from 39% last year. 
We still believe there remains ample leverage in our business model, and we could be back at our pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.5%. EPS for the quarter grew 14% to $0.48 on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll tell you that, really, being able to put up these top line and bottom line results given our size, once again, demonstrates the real strength of our product line, the loyalty of our customer base and the strength of the operating model. We have the products in the market that customers want to buy. And OpenWorld, which starts next month, will only make this even more obvious. 
Operating cash flow increased to a record $12.8 billion over the last 4 quarters, with operating cash flow increasing this quarter to $5.4 billion, up $1.6 billion from $3.8 billion in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow grew 46% to a record $12.3 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have nearly $32 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Now as we said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend and we'll continue to be opportunistic. This quarter, we repurchased 27.5 million shares, and the Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to the guidance. And as many of you remember, we had a great second quarter last year with new license up 21% on a non-GAAP basis and up 33% and GAAP EPS up 27%. So let me just say that again. New license was up 21%, non-GAAP EPS was up 33% and GAAP EPS was up 27%. So those are pretty tough comparisons, and we don't expect much help from currency because at this point, it looks like only 1% stays where it is. New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 6% to 16% in growth. 
Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from flat to negative 5%. However, we do expect gross margins and profitability of our overall hardware business to improve during the quarter as we continue to move away from selling low-margin commodity servers and focus on selling engineered systems like Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Solaris systems. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.58, up from $0.51 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 27%.

In Q1, the transition away from selling low-margin commodity servers to selling high-margin engineering systems increased both the gross margins and the overall profitability of our hardware business. In Q2, we will accelerate that trend",160,"Thank you, Safra. In Q1, the transition away from selling low-margin commodity servers to selling high-margin engineering systems increased both the gross margins and the overall profitability of our hardware business. In Q2, we will accelerate that trend when we introduce 4 brand-new engineered systems products. Each of these new engineered systems optimally combine Oracle software, Oracle silicon and Oracle hardware to deliver extreme high performance, fault-tolerant high reliability and improved ease of use. 
The largest of these new-engineered systems is the fault tolerant SPARC Supercluster, featuring our new SPARC T4 microprocessor that runs up to 5x faster than the T3 microprocessor it replaces. Our new feature-rich Solaris 11 operating system and the ultra high-performance Exadata Flash disk storage system. The SPARC Supercluster runs the Oracle Database applications faster and less expensively than anything available from IBM. Thus, we expect that many customers in our large SPARC Solaris installed base will be upgrading to SPARC Superclusters. 
Mark, it's all yours."

It was primarily organic broad-based across tech and apps, both growing double digits. Performance across geographies was balanced. One number worth noting is apps in Europe was up over 60%, 6-0 percent.
Second, Exadata Exalogic. Unit growth was nearly triple digit, broad-based across industries and geographies, and we sold systems to more than 150 unique customers, of which 100 were new Exadata or Exalogic. 
Third, our industry-focused solutions are increasing in relevance to customers and that shows up in our 17% growth, but our industry-focused solutions again grew faster than Oracle did in license growth. So again, good help from the industry-focused solutions. 
Now fourth, I want to make sure this point is clear. In addition to Exadata and Exalogic growth, our SPARC server products grew this quarter. We had growth in the core SPARC product line. Our strategy around high-intellectual property, high-attach, high-margin solutions that include Exadata, Exalogic and the SPARC server products is working. You're also beginning to see that show up in these industry market share figures that show us gaining share. 
Last, we are continuing to hire. We added 350 people to the sales organization in Q1. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ken for your questions"

The guidance is the guidance. I think second point, I think we're really not as focused, to be very frank, on the hardware growth rate as we are on the point that I just made of growing the right things in the product line. The things that are attributable to long-term profitability, long- term positioning with the customer, long-term positioning in the data center. And I'll try to give you an example. If you take that core server product line that we grew in the quarter, SPARC server product line, if you took an M-series product, just imagine, Adam, that we sold $100 million worth of M-series products. And these are rough numbers. My guess over 5 years, our profitability on that is roughly $100 million when you include the attach and the support and the service. Just the same, if we sold $100 million of x86 with no intellectual property, my guess our profitability would be less than 1/5 of that. And I only bring that up to give you the polarization of the impact of intellectual property, the alignment of that intellectual property to a solution, the alignment of that to support the ability for us to do things for the customer and the eventual profitability for the company. So what we're focused on are the solutions like what Larry described are coming out, Exadata, Exalogic, the core SPARC product line and that's where we're focused. And in that context, I think we are turning around the business. I think you are seeing some of the momentum. And if you see the market share charts, they tend to show you the facts that we are gaining share in that core part of the product line."

I think certainly next fiscal year, we would expect our overall hardware business to have top line growth, no question about it. And the transition right now is we've got -- our Exa line almost doubled in the quarter in Q1. Our overall SPARC line was up on servers. Our x86 commodity line was down, and Sun had a practice of selling x86s at very, very low margins and we reward our salespeople based on margins. So we don't make money selling low-margin commodity x86 boxes, and our salespeople don't make any money selling them. And therefore, they're not -- we're deemphasizing that business. That business is shrinking. However, our profitable businesses in servers, the Exa line and the SPARC line, are growing. And also, in storage, our ZFS system is growing. Our Pillar system is growing. The Exadata storage system is growing. So our disk storage systems are all growing, the ones with our IP. However, we also sell third-party disks without our IP at very low margins. Those are still in the system. And we expect those low-margin storage systems to also decline because, again, we pay our salespeople based on margins and there is no margin. There is very low margin on those products. We don't care about selling those products because we don't make any money. I think your question is when will we sell -- when will that be out of the system. And us pretty much only be selling servers and storage with our IP, and I think that will be next fiscal year, you'll see top line growth in the hardware business. But this fiscal year, you'll see continued improvement in gross margin and continued improvement in profitability in our overall hardware business even though the commodity business will be gradually shrinking every quarter.

We added -- I don't know how many people on the call are my age, probably no one. But a long time ago, after relational databases came out, there was a next-generation database that were called object databases. And everyone talked about, ""Well, object databases are going to replace relational databases"" And what actually happened is that object database capabilities got integrated into the Oracle Database. So Oracle seized just the relational database. It became a relational and object database. And then there were these things called text databases for text search, and those were separate databases. And Oracle then incorporated text search and text capability into the Oracle Database. And then there were these things called XML databases and separate XML databases. Then Oracle integrated XML capability into it. Now people are talking a lot about unstructured data and things like autonomy. Oracle's strategy has always been to integrate additional types of data into the Oracle Database. And a lot of this unstructured data, whether it's video or audio or images, all of those, we think the transition continues. We started with relational then objects then text then XML. Now a lot of different types of unstructured data types all going into the Oracle Database. Finally, big data or the searching of large amounts of data using Hadoop. After Hadoop finishes filtering the data, the place you want to put that data is an Oracle Database, and that's what a lot of our customers are doing. And we are exploiting the trend, the big data technology and the big data trend, if you prefer, by building a Hadoop appliance that attaches to the Oracle Exadata database or any Oracle Database for that matter. But you don't have to buy our Hadoop appliance if you can use whatever servers you want running Hadoop, and we provide the interface between Hadoop and the Oracle Database. The idea is all of your data should be -- you should be able to put all of your data regardless of data type into the Oracle Database where it can be stored securely and reliably. And you could search it and get answers to your questions very quickly."

I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
This quarter, new software license revenue was $2 billion, up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars, building off a 21% increase from last year. This was a result of a few things: First, in the last few weeks, really in the last few days of our November quarter, for the first time in a while in some regions, we saw an increase in last-minute additional approvals required for previously scheduled and expected deals. As a result, we are putting in place better deal management so that we have the time and the approvals necessary to take this into account. 
Additionally, there was a 2% negative swing as the currency -- as the 1% currency tailwind included in our September guidance shifted to a 1% headwind for new software license. Technology new license revenues were $1.5 billion, up 4% in constant currency and U.S. dollars, and applications were $569 million, up 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. 
Within application revenue, ERP and CRM grew very well. Geographically, results were mixed as Latin America and Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, did well in constant currency in most products, consistent with the growth in their economies, while the U.S., Europe and Japan were up a bit, flat or down. 
As I mentioned earlier, currencies moved a lot in different regions. In license, we saw total new license growth rate of 1% in constant currency or flat in U.S. dollars in the America and up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars in EMEA, while we saw 8% growth in J pack in constant currency or 11% in U.S. dollars. The quarter was not dependent on any large deals. 
Software license and product support revenues were $4 billion, up 9%. Support attach rates and software renewal rates continue at usual high levels. Hardware systems revenue was $953 million for the quarter due in part to a product transition to G4 processor-based products as some customers moved to qualify the new servers and significantly slowed buying the older systems. We saw good early demand for the new SPARC Supercluster but only released the product for general availability at the very end of the quarter, allowing us to ship only a couple. 
In sharp contrast, Exadata and Exalogic growth saw significant acceleration this quarter, with triple-digit growth rates over last year's Q2. 
Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter on the lower volumes. Total revenue for the quarter was $8.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and U.S. dollars. 
As for expenses, it was not a perfect comparison as in last year's number. We got the benefit of $120 million in G&A expense reduction as a result of SAP's expense reimbursement for settling a small part of our intellectual property spec losses against them. Net of that, G&A was flat. 
We're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.9 billion, up 3%, as we expanded operating margins to 45%. We believe there remains ample leverage in our business model, and we believe we could be back at pre-Sun operating margins shortly. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. EPS for the quarter grew 6% to $0.54 on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flow increased to a record $13.1 billion over the last 4 quarters, while free cash flow grew 45% to a record $12.6 billion. We now have over $31 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividends. This quarter, we repurchased 33 million -- 33.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion. We have received an additional $5 billion in authorization for our stock buyback program, and the board again declared a dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to guidance. As you remember, we have an absolutely stunning third quarter last year, with new license up 29% and non-GAAP EPS up 40% and GAAP EPS up 75%. Regardless, the fundamentals of the business remains strong with pipelines growing significantly. 
Now, I do read the daily financial news so I'm going to take that into account for this quarter's guidance. With currency bouncing around, I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, and as a convenience for you, I'll give what our U.S. dollar rates from the past few days. That currently amounts to about a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rates and on total revenue growth rates but rates remain very volatile. 
Our guidance for Q3 is as follows: New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to plus 12%, so that's from positive 2% to positive 12% in constant currency and 0% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Hardware product revenue growth rate growth is expected to range from negative 4% to negative 14% in constant currency or negative 5% to negative 15% in U.S. dollars, and that does not include the hardware support revenue. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant currency and 1% to 5% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 4% to 7% in constant currency and 2% to 5% in U.S. dollars. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.56 to $0.59 in constant currency and $0.55 to $0.58 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.54 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.47 in constant currency and $0.43 to $0.46 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.41 last year. This guidance assumes a GAAP -- This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 26% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. 
With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This past Q2, Oracle sold over 200 Exadata and Exalogic Engineered Systems. In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic Engineered Systems.

In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic Engineered Systems. In Q4, we plan to sell over 400 Exadata and Exalogic Engineered Systems. 
That would make our annualized Q4 Engineered System sales approximately $1 billion. Then we plan to double that -- those sales again next fiscal year. 
As our Engineered Systems business gets larger, it will drive revenue growth and our overall hardware business. In Q2, we won some competitive deals because our engineered systems deliver much higher performance than IBM's fastest pSeries computers. 
In Q2, we won other competitor deals because our Engineered Systems delivered much better cost performance than commodity Intel servers. 
I'm going to start with Exalogic, the newer of our machines, and talk about a few deals we won. The University of Melbourne, they bought 4 Exalogic systems running our Fusion Middleware, where we beat Cisco Intel servers running VMware because the Exalogic systems were a lot faster and a lot more cost-effective. But it was cost performance that won us that deal, not peak performance. 
We won an Exalogic deals at the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. They bought 5 large Exalogic systems, 4 racks, to add on to their existing Exadata systems. They are standardizing now for a series of applications, including identity management and the budget custom applications. They're standardizing on Exadata and Exalogic. 
bought 2 Exalogic systems, replacing IBM AIX on pSeries machines. The E-Business Suite, the Oracle E-Business Suite, ran 12x faster on the Exalogic machines than on the IBM pSeries. They are a custom, that's custom LLTP applications, which are our SOA Java applications, ran 10x faster than on IBM pSeries machines. I know IBM's running a lot of bad thing. They run faster. Their machines run faster than ours but I love to see their customer references because we haven't see one. We've seen a lot of ads, no customer references. We have lots and lots of customer references. We're replacing pSeries and running much faster than IBM. I'd like to see one from IBM. 
Hyundai Motors, Hyundai Kia motor company bought an Exalogic system. This was our first win in an account that has been a loyal IBM customer for more than 20 years. 
Exadata. Exadata came out quite a bit before our Exalogic machines, and some customers are beginning to now -- to standardize on Exadata. A very large American smartphone manufacturer now has over 30 Exadata systems as they build their cloud. A large European bank has over 24 Exadata systems. AC Nielsen moved their Wal-Mart data off their IBM computer and onto an Exadata machine where it ran clearly 10x faster, 10x faster. We won 4 SAP customers moved their -- moved their data on to Exadata to run their SAP ERP systems, and we're seeing huge performance gains as they move up conventional servers. At least one of those deals was competitive against SAP's product. 
As Safra mentioned, our SPARC Supercluster was delivered during the last week of the quarter, where Macy's bought 2 Superclusters and the state of California bought one. 
Mark, turn it over to you."

We had the largest number of wins from new customers in Q2. 
Exalogic is ramping faster than Exadata. Sales more than doubled sequentially, and the first year sales for Exalogic are more than double the first year sales of Exadata. Moreover, we have 2 more Exas, Exalytics and the Oracle Big Data Appliance in addition to the SPARC Supercluster that was just mentioned. 
We are now win with Fusion apps in the cloud. We won Brocade, Living Social and Rainbow Media in the quarter, 100 apps now available, cloud or on-premise, and we believe this to be a key differentiator. 
As Larry mentioned, well, let me add that we have put 1,700 incremental sales resources into the field since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have shown strong expense discipline while adding these resources while increasing our margins. Great new products and more sales resources drive more organic growth. 
On hardware, our introduction of the T4 and SSC have driven material -- SSC for us is SPARC Supercluster, have driven material pipeline for the back half of the year. And Safra mentioned the T4 hurt a few orders for us in Q2 but the pipeline is growing materially. These are the most exciting SPARC products we have had in years. 
ZFS storage doubled year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter of consecutive growth for ZFS in a row. And again, as we start lining up these pieces of differentiated IP, aligned with incremental sales resources, we will drive yet more growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

Remember, a lot of the -- a lot of this is our new product update and support, product support and updates business. The overall business gets bigger, that is, of course, very profitable for us and we think we can grow profitably. I want to point out that even in this quarter, our operating margins increased, okay, even in a quarter where we did not actually end up selling as many new licenses as we'd hoped. Our operating margins increased, and we are really on track to get back to our pre-hardware company margins, which puts us, of course, as still the highest operating margins in the software -- in the software industry, and we have a $4 billion hardware business in us. So I would -- I'd bet on us to keep those earnings growing and protected."

You obviously sound pretty confident that the business will rebound in the February quarter. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more call, is it financial services, public sectors or the verticals that are talked about with the apps that is where you saw the pause or maybe you could take a vertical cut at it? I know you have a strong presence in the industry vertical solutions. Is that where you saw the pause? And constantly, what gives you the confidence that we might see a snapback in spending if the is correct that it was narrow that weakness in application license was narrowed to a few pockets?"

And so we think those are actually going to recover. I will tell you that generally, in public sector, we're actually doing reasonably well in U.S. public sector. And as they're very good customers for our Engineered Systems and things like that. So I think we actually expect a snapback more as we get into more regular management of those deals in the vertical markets, which are generally long sales cycle, larger deals, have to be managed well."

So these are just the things you have to do you start to improve the IP and the product line. You've seen us improve ZFS, you've seen us with T4. You see that now manifesting itself in servers out there. You're going to see it show up in what we've done in tape earlier in the year. So we've refreshed the product line.

This quarter, new software license revenue was $2 billion, up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars, building off a 21% increase from last year. This was a result of a few things. First, in the last few weeks, really in the last few days of our November quarter, for the first time in a while in some regions, we saw an increase in last-minute additional approvals required for previously-scheduled and expected deals. As a result, we are putting in place better deal management so that we have the time and the approvals necessary to take this into account. 
Additionally, there was a 2% negative swing as the currency -- as the 1% currency tailwind, included in our September guidance, shifted to a 1% headwind for new software license. Technology new license revenues were $1.5 billion, up 4% in constant currency and U.S. dollars, and applications were $569 million, up 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. 
Within application revenue, ERP and CRM grew very well. Geographically, results were mixed as Latin America and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, did well in constant currency in most products, consistent with the growth in their economies, while the U.S., Europe and Japan were up a bit, flat or down. 
As I mentioned earlier, currencies moved a lot in different regions. In license, we saw total new license growth rate of 1% in constant currency or flat in U.S. dollars in the America and up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars in EMEA, while we saw 8% growth in JPAC in constant currency or 11% in U.S. dollars. The quarter was not dependent on any large deals. 
Software license and product support revenues were $4 billion, up 9%. Support attach rates and software renewal rates continue at usual high levels. Hardware systems revenue was $953 million for the quarter due in part to a product transition to T4 processor-based products, as some customers move to qualify the new servers and significantly slowed buying the older systems. We saw good early demand for the new SPARC Supercluster but only released the product for general availability at the very end of the quarter, allowing us to ship only a couple. 
In sharp contrast, Exadata and Exalogic growth saw significant acceleration this quarter, with triple-digit growth rates over last year's Q2. Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter on the lower volumes. Total revenue for the quarter was $8.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and U.S. dollars. 
As for expenses, it was not a perfect comparison as in last year's number. We got the benefit of $120 million in G&A expense reduction as a result of SAP's expense reimbursement for settling a small part of our intellectual property theft losses against them. Net of that, G&A was flat. 
We're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.9 billion, up 3%, as we expanded operating margins to 45%. We believe there remains ample leverage in our business model, and we believe we could be back at pre-Sun operating margins shortly. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. EPS for the quarter grew 6% to $0.54 on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flow increased to a record $13.1 billion over the last 4 quarters, while free cash flow grew 45% to a record $12.6 billion. We now have over $31 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividends. This quarter, we repurchased 33 million -- 33.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion. We have received an additional $5 billion in authorization for our stock buyback program, and the board again declared a dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to guidance. As you remember, we had an absolutely stunning third quarter last year, with new license up 29% and non-GAAP EPS up 40% and GAAP EPS up 75%. Regardless, the fundamentals of the business remains strong, with pipelines growing significantly. 
Now I do read the daily financial news, so I'm going to take that into account for this quarter's guidance. With currency bouncing around, I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, and as a convenience for you, I'll give what our U.S. dollar rates from the past few days. That currently amounts to about a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rates and on total revenue growth rates, but rates remain very volatile. 
Our guidance for Q3 is as follows. New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to plus 12%, so that's from positive 2% to positive 12% in constant currency and 0% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Hardware product revenue growth rate -- growth is expected to range from negative 4% to negative 14% in constant currency or negative 5% to negative 15% in U.S. dollars, and that does not include the hardware support revenue. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant currency and 1% to 5% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 4% to 7% in constant currency and 2% to 5% in U.S. dollars. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.56 to $0.59 in constant currency and $0.55 to $0.58 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.54 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.47 in constant currency and $0.43 to $0.46 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.41 last year. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 26% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. 
With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This past Q2, Oracle sold over 200 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q4, we plan to sell over 400 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. That would make",534,"Thank you, Safra. This past Q2, Oracle sold over 200 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q4, we plan to sell over 400 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. That would make our annualized Q4 engineered system sales approximately $1 billion. Then we plan to double that -- those sales again next fiscal year. 
As our engineered systems business gets larger, it will drive revenue growth and our overall hardware business. In Q2, we won some competitive deals because our engineered systems deliver much higher performance than IBM's fastest pSeries computers. In Q2, we won other competitive deals because our engineered systems delivered much better cost performance than commodity Intel servers. 
I'm going to start with Exalogic, the newer of our machines, and talk about a few deals we won. The University of Melbourne, they bought 4 Exalogic systems running our Fusion Middleware, where we beat Cisco Intel servers running VMware because the Exalogic systems were a lot faster and a lot more cost-effective. But it was cost performance that won us that deal, not peak performance. 
We won an Exalogic deal at the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. They bought 5 large Exalogic systems, full racks, to add on to their existing Exadata systems. They are standardizing now for a series of applications, including identity management and the budget custom applications. They're standardizing on Exadata and Exalogic. 
Amway bought 2 Exalogic systems, replacing IBM AIX on pSeries machines. The E-Business Suite, the Oracle E-Business Suite, ran 12x faster on the Exalogic machines than on the IBM pSeries. Their custom, that's Amway's custom OLTP applications, which are our SOA Java applications, ran 10x faster than on IBM pSeries machines. I know IBM's running a lot of ad thing. They run faster. Their machines run faster than ours, but I love to see their customer references because we haven't see one. We've seen a lot of ads, no customer references. We have lots and lots of customer references. We're replacing pSeries and running much faster than IBM. I'd like to see one from IBM. 
Hyundai Motors -- Hyundai Kia motor company bought an Exalogic system. This was our first win in an account that has been a loyal IBM customer for more than 20 years. 
Exadata. Exadata came out quite a bit before our Exalogic machines, and some customers are beginning to now -- to standardize on Exadata. A very large American smartphone manufacturer now has over 30 Exadata systems as they build their cloud. A large European bank has over 24 Exadata systems. ACNielsen moved their Wal-Mart data off their IBM computer and on to an Exadata machine where it ran clearly 10x faster, 10x faster. We won 4 SAP customers who moved their data on to Exadata to run their SAP ERP systems, and we're seeing huge performance gains as they move up conventional servers. At least one of those deals was competitive against SAP's HANA product. 
As Safra mentioned, our SPARC Supercluster was delivered during the last week of the quarter, where Macy's bought 2 Superclusters, and the state of California bought one. 
Mark, turn it over to you."

Our bookings for Exadata were a record, that includes Q4 of last year. The pipeline is the biggest we have ever had. We had the largest number of wins from new customers in Q2. 
Exalogic is ramping faster than Exadata. Sales more than doubled sequentially, and the first year sales for Exalogic are more than double the first year sales of Exadata. Moreover, we have 2 more Exas, Exalytics and the Oracle Big Data Appliance, in addition to the SPARC Superclusters that were just mentioned. 
We are now winning with Fusion apps in the cloud. We won Brocade, Living Social and Rainbow Media in the quarter. 100 apps now available, cloud or on-premise, and we believe this to be a key differentiator. 
As Larry mentioned, well, let me add that we have put 1,700 incremental sales resources into the field since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have shown strong expense discipline while adding these resources, while increasing our margins. Great new products and more sales resources drive more organic growth. 
On hardware, our introduction of the T4 and SSC have driven material -- SSC for us is SPARC Supercluster, have driven material pipeline for the back half of the year. And Safra mentioned the T4 hurt a few orders for us in Q2, but the pipeline is growing materially. These are the most exciting SPARC products we have had in years. 
ZFS storage doubled year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter of consecutive growth for ZFS in a row. And again, as we start lining up these pieces of differentiated IP, aligned with incremental sales resources, we will drive yet more growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And some people were looking at buying T3 delayed and qualified T4 and are buying T4. I think that hurt us a bit, and that definitely hurt us a bit in Q2. We think that's going to help us a bit in Q3 and help us even more in Q4. SPARC Superclusters. Again, we just  were able to deliver right at the end of the quarter, but we think that's going to -- we're going to start selling that aggressively into the installed base, the Sun installed base, and we've already have a very large pipeline for that. On top of that, but the big thing, I think, did really moved the needle are Exadata and Exalogic have been out there for a while. As I said, we sold 200 last -- in Q2. We'll sell 300 in Q3. We'll sell 400 in Q4. It's very easy to remember. Q2, 200; Q3, 300; 4 -- we didn't plan it that way but that's where it's turning out. As I think about larger and larger percentage of the total, I mean, clearly, that's going to drive 2 things. It's going to drive top line, it's going to drive margin. And we think that's -- we think the hardware business could turn around and show growth as soon as Q4, and we'll definitely go. I think I'm very confident we'll show double-digit growth next year because we'll have all of these new products out and I'll let Mark..."

The range of products now coming out give us a different position in the market. So now the fact that next year, when T5 comes out, you'll be able to upgrade from the T4 to T5, and that will sort of eliminate some of this pause that you just heard us describe because now if I bought a T3, I have to do a complete replacement to get to a T4. So these are just the things you have to do you start to improve the IP and the product line. You've seen us improve ZFS. You've seen us with T4. You see that now manifesting itself in servers out there. You're going to see it show up in what we've done in TAPE earlier in the year. So we've refreshed the product line. This is all separate from Exa. We've put more feet on the street. We feel very good about our competitive position. So yes, that's where we are."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. This quarter, new software license revenue was $2 billion, up 3% in constant currency or 2% in",989,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
This quarter, new software license revenue was $2 billion, up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars, building off a 21% increase from last year. This was a result of a few things. First, in the last few weeks, really in the last few days of our November quarter, for the first time in a while in some regions, we saw an increase in last-minute additional approvals required for previously-scheduled and expected deals. As a result, we are putting in place better deal management so that we have the time and the approvals necessary to take this into account. 
Additionally, there was a 2% negative swing as the currency -- as the 1% currency tailwind, included in our September guidance, shifted to a 1% headwind for new software license. Technology new license revenues were $1.5 billion, up 4% in constant currency and U.S. dollars, and applications were $569 million, up 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. 
Within application revenue, ERP and CRM grew very well. Geographically, results were mixed as Latin America and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, did well in constant currency in most products, consistent with the growth in their economies, while the U.S., Europe and Japan were up a bit, flat or down. 
As I mentioned earlier, currencies moved a lot in different regions. In license, we saw total new license growth rate of 1% in constant currency or flat in U.S. dollars in the America and up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars in EMEA, while we saw 8% growth in JPAC in constant currency or 11% in U.S. dollars. The quarter was not dependent on any large deals. 
Software license and product support revenues were $4 billion, up 9%. Support attach rates and software renewal rates continue at usual high levels. Hardware systems revenue was $953 million for the quarter due in part to a product transition to T4 processor-based products, as some customers move to qualify the new servers and significantly slowed buying the older systems. We saw good early demand for the new SPARC Supercluster but only released the product for general availability at the very end of the quarter, allowing us to ship only a couple. 
In sharp contrast, Exadata and Exalogic growth saw significant acceleration this quarter, with triple-digit growth rates over last year's Q2. Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter on the lower volumes. Total revenue for the quarter was $8.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and U.S. dollars. 
As for expenses, it was not a perfect comparison as in last year's number. We got the benefit of $120 million in G&A expense reduction as a result of SAP's expense reimbursement for settling a small part of our intellectual property theft losses against them. Net of that, G&A was flat. 
We're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.9 billion, up 3%, as we expanded operating margins to 45%. We believe there remains ample leverage in our business model, and we believe we could be back at pre-Sun operating margins shortly. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. EPS for the quarter grew 6% to $0.54 on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flow increased to a record $13.1 billion over the last 4 quarters, while free cash flow grew 45% to a record $12.6 billion. We now have over $31 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividends. This quarter, we repurchased 33 million -- 33.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion. We have received an additional $5 billion in authorization for our stock buyback program, and the board again declared a dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to guidance. As you remember, we had an absolutely stunning third quarter last year, with new license up 29% and non-GAAP EPS up 40% and GAAP EPS up 75%. Regardless, the fundamentals of the business remains strong, with pipelines growing significantly. 
Now I do read the daily financial news, so I'm going to take that into account for this quarter's guidance. With currency bouncing around, I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, and as a convenience for you, I'll give what our U.S. dollar rates from the past few days. That currently amounts to about a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rates and on total revenue growth rates, but rates remain very volatile. 
Our guidance for Q3 is as follows. New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to plus 12%, so that's from positive 2% to positive 12% in constant currency and 0% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Hardware product revenue growth rate -- growth is expected to range from negative 4% to negative 14% in constant currency or negative 5% to negative 15% in U.S. dollars, and that does not include the hardware support revenue. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant currency and 1% to 5% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 4% to 7% in constant currency and 2% to 5% in U.S. dollars. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.56 to $0.59 in constant currency and $0.55 to $0.58 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.54 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.47 in constant currency and $0.43 to $0.46 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.41 last year. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 26% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. 
With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This past Q2, Oracle sold over 200 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems.

In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q4, we plan to sell over 400 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. That would make our annualized Q4 engineered system sales approximately $1 billion. Then we plan to double that -- those sales again next fiscal year. 
As our engineered systems business gets larger, it will drive revenue growth and our overall hardware business. In Q2, we won some competitive deals because our engineered systems deliver much higher performance than IBM's fastest pSeries computers. In Q2, we won other competitive deals because our engineered systems delivered much better cost performance than commodity Intel servers. 
I'm going to start with Exalogic, the newer of our machines, and talk about a few deals we won. The University of Melbourne, they bought 4 Exalogic systems running our Fusion Middleware, where we beat Cisco Intel servers running VMware because the Exalogic systems were a lot faster and a lot more cost-effective. But it was cost performance that won us that deal, not peak performance. 
We won an Exalogic deal at the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. They bought 5 large Exalogic systems, full racks, to add on to their existing Exadata systems. They are standardizing now for a series of applications, including identity management and the budget custom applications. They're standardizing on Exadata and Exalogic. 
Amway bought 2 Exalogic systems, replacing IBM AIX on pSeries machines. The E-Business Suite, the Oracle E-Business Suite, ran 12x faster on the Exalogic machines than on the IBM pSeries. Their custom, that's Amway's custom OLTP applications, which are our SOA Java applications, ran 10x faster than on IBM pSeries machines. I know IBM's running a lot of ad thing. They run faster. Their machines run faster than ours, but I love to see their customer references because we haven't see one. We've seen a lot of ads, no customer references. We have lots and lots of customer references. We're replacing pSeries and running much faster than IBM. I'd like to see one from IBM. 
Hyundai Motors -- Hyundai Kia motor company bought an Exalogic system. This was our first win in an account that has been a loyal IBM customer for more than 20 years. 
Exadata. Exadata came out quite a bit before our Exalogic machines, and some customers are beginning to now -- to standardize on Exadata. A very large American smartphone manufacturer now has over 30 Exadata systems as they build their cloud. A large European bank has over 24 Exadata systems. ACNielsen moved their Wal-Mart data off their IBM computer and on to an Exadata machine where it ran clearly 10x faster, 10x faster. We won 4 SAP customers who moved their data on to Exadata to run their SAP ERP systems, and we're seeing huge performance gains as they move up conventional servers. At least one of those deals was competitive against SAP's HANA product. 
As Safra mentioned, our SPARC Supercluster was delivered during the last week of the quarter, where Macy's bought 2 Superclusters, and the state of California bought one. 
Mark, turn it over to you."

Exalogic is ramping faster than Exadata. Sales more than doubled sequentially, and the first year sales for Exalogic are more than double the first year sales of Exadata. Moreover, we have 2 more Exas, Exalytics and the Oracle Big Data Appliance, in addition to the SPARC Superclusters that were just mentioned. 
We are now winning with Fusion apps in the cloud. We won Brocade, Living Social and Rainbow Media in the quarter. 100 apps now available, cloud or on-premise, and we believe this to be a key differentiator. 
As Larry mentioned, well, let me add that we have put 1,700 incremental sales resources into the field since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have shown strong expense discipline while adding these resources, while increasing our margins. Great new products and more sales resources drive more organic growth. 
On hardware, our introduction of the T4 and SSC have driven material -- SSC for us is SPARC Supercluster, have driven material pipeline for the back half of the year. And Safra mentioned the T4 hurt a few orders for us in Q2, but the pipeline is growing materially. These are the most exciting SPARC products we have had in years. 
ZFS storage doubled year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter of consecutive growth for ZFS in a row. And again, as we start lining up these pieces of differentiated IP, aligned with incremental sales resources, we will drive yet more growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

There is no issue with pipeline. It is quite the opposite. And we're also comparing what we booked versus what we shipped, so there are a couple of different numbers that are running around here. We are going after that same metric that Larry described before. You are seeing probably not anything more than us now manifesting that sales in quarterly numbers that are coming out. So it's very positive. I think the biggest news within it is no change in the Exadata trajectory.

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. This quarter, new software license revenue was $2 billion, up 3% in constant currency or 2% in",988,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
This quarter, new software license revenue was $2 billion, up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars, building off a 21% increase from last year. This was the result of a few things. First, in the last few weeks, really in the last few days of our November quarter, for the first time in a while in some regions, we saw an increase in last-minute additional approvals required for previously-scheduled and expected deals. As a result, we are putting in place better deal management so that we have the time and the approvals necessary to take this into account. 
Additionally, there was a 2% negative swing as the currency -- as the 1% currency tailwind, included in our September guidance, shifted to a 1% headwind for new software license. Technology new license revenues were $1.5 billion, up 4% in constant currency and U.S. dollars, and applications were $569 million, off 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. 
Within application revenue, ERP and CRM grew very well. Geographically, results were mixed as Latin America and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, did well in constant currency in most products, consistent with the growth in their economies, while the U.S., Europe and Japan were up a bit, flat or down. 
As I mentioned earlier, currencies moved a lot in different regions. In license, we saw total new license growth rate of 1% in constant currency or flat in U.S. dollars in the America and up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars in EMEA, while we saw 8% growth in JPAC in constant currency or 11% in U.S. dollars. The quarter was not dependent on any large deals. 
Software license and product support revenues were $4 billion, up 9%. Support attach rates and software renewal rates continue at usual high levels. Hardware systems revenue was $953 million for the quarter due in part to a product transition to T4 processor-based products, as some customers moved to qualify the new servers and significantly slowed buying the older systems. We saw good early demand for the new SPARC Supercluster but only released the product for general availability at the very end of the quarter, allowing us to ship only a couple. 
In sharp contrast, Exadata and Exalogic growth saw significant acceleration this quarter, with triple-digit growth rates over last year's Q2. Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter on the lower volumes. Total revenue for the quarter was $8.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and U.S. dollars. 
As for expenses, it was not a perfect comparison as, in last year's number, we got the benefit of $120 million in G&A expense reduction as a result of SAP's expense reimbursement for settling a small part of our intellectual property theft lawsuit against them. Net of that, G&A was flat.
We're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.9 billion, up 3%, as we expanded operating margins to 45%. We believe there remains ample leverage in our business model, and we believe we could be back at pre-Sun operating margins shortly.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. EPS for the quarter grew 6% to $0.54 on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flow increased to a record $13.1 billion over the last 4 quarters, while free cash flow grew 45% to a record $12.6 billion. We now have over $31 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and dividends. This quarter, we repurchased 33 million -- 33.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion. We have received an additional $5 billion in authorization for our stock buyback program, and the board again declared a dividend of $0.06 per share. 
Now to guidance. As you remember, we had an absolutely stunning third quarter last year, with new license up 29% and non-GAAP EPS up 40% and GAAP EPS up 75%. Regardless, the fundamentals of the business remained strong, with pipelines growing significantly. 
Now I do read the daily financial news, so I'm going to take that into account for this quarter's guidance. With currency bouncing around, I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, and as a convenience for you, I'll give what our U.S. dollar rates from the past few days. That currently amounts to about a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rates and on total revenue growth rates, but rates remained very volatile.
Our guidance for Q3 is as follows: new software license revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to plus 12%, so that's from positive 2% to positive 12% in constant currency and 0% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Hardware product revenue growth rate -- growth is expected to range from negative 4% to negative 14% in constant currency or negative 5% to negative 15% in U.S. dollars, and that does not include the hardware support revenue. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant currency and 1% to 5% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 4% to 7% in constant currency and 2% to 5% in U.S. dollars. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.56 to $0.59 in constant currency and $0.55 to $0.58 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.54 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.47 in constant currency and $0.43 to $0.46 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.41 last year. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 26% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26.5%. Of course, it may end up being different.
With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This past Q2, Oracle sold over 200 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q4, we plan to sell over 400 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. That would make",537,"Thank you, Safra. This past Q2, Oracle sold over 200 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q4, we plan to sell over 400 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. That would make our annualized Q4 engineered system sales approximately $1 billion. Then we plan to double that -- those sales again next fiscal year. 
As our engineered systems business gets larger, it will drive revenue growth in our overall hardware business. In Q2, we won some competitive deals because our engineered systems deliver much higher performance than IBM's fastest pSeries computers. In Q2, we won other competitive deals because our engineered systems delivered much better cost performance than commodity Intel servers. 
I'm going to start with Exalogic, the newer of our machines, and talk about a few deals we've won. The University of Melbourne, they bought 4 Exalogic systems running our Fusion Middleware, where we beat Cisco Intel servers running VMware because the Exalogic systems were a lot faster and a lot more cost-effective. But it was cost performance that won us that deal, not peak performance. 
We won an Exalogic deal at the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. They bought 5 large Exalogic systems, full racks, to add on to their existing Exadata systems. They are standardizing now for a series of applications, including identity management and a bunch of custom applications. They're standardizing on Exadata and Exalogic. 
Amway bought 2 Exalogic systems, replacing IBM AIX on pSeries machines. The E-Business Suite, the Oracle E-Business Suite, ran 12x faster on the Exalogic machines than on the IBM pSeries. Their custom, that's Amway's, custom OLTP applications, which are our SOA Java applications, ran 10x faster than on IBM pSeries machines. I know IBM's running a lot of ads saying, ""They run faster,"" ,that their machines run faster than ours, but I'd love to see their customer references because we haven't see one. We've seen a lot of ads, no customer references. We have lots and lots of customer references. Where we're replacing pSeries and running much faster than IBM. I'd like to see one from IBM. 
Hyundai Motors -- Hyundai Kia Motor Company bought an Exalogic system. This was our first win in an account that has been a loyal IBM customer for more than 20 years. 
Exadata. Exadata came out quite a bit before our Exalogic machines, and some customers are beginning to now -- to standardize on Exadata. A very large American smartphone manufacturer now has over 30 Exadata systems as they build their cloud. A large European bank has over 24 Exadata systems. ACNielsen moved their Wal-Mart data off their IBM computer and on to an Exadata machine where it ran clearly 10x faster, 10x faster. We won 4 SAP customers who moved their data on to Exadata to run their SAP ERP systems, and we're seeing huge performance gains as they move off conventional servers. At least one of those deals was competitive against SAP's HANA product. 
As Safra mentioned, our SPARC Supercluster was delivered during the last week of the quarter, where Macy's bought 2 Superclusters, and the State of California bought one. 
Mark, turn it over to you."

Our bookings for Exadata were a record, that includes Q4 of last year. The pipeline is the biggest we have ever had. We had the largest number of wins from new customers in Q2. 
Exalogic is ramping faster than Exadata. Sales more than doubled sequentially, and the first year sales for Exalogic are more than double the first year sales of Exadata. Moreover, we have 2 more Exas, Exalytics and the Oracle Big Data Appliance, in addition to the SPARC Superclusters that we just mentioned. 
We are now winning with Fusion apps in the cloud. We won Brocade, LivingSocial and Rainbow Media in the quarter. 100 apps now available, cloud or on-premise, and we believe this to be a key differentiator. 
As Larry mentioned, well, let me add that we have put 1,700 incremental sales resources into the field since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have shown strong expense discipline while adding these resources, while increasing our margins. Great new products and more sales resources drive more organic growth. 
On hardware, our introduction of the T4 and SSC have driven material -- SSC for us is SPARC Supercluster, have driven material pipeline for the back half of the year. And Safra mentioned the T4 hurt a few orders for us in Q2, but the pipeline has grown materially. These are the most exciting SPARC products we have had in years. 
ZFS storage doubled year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter of consecutive growth for ZFS in a row. And again, as we start lining up these pieces of differentiated IP, aligned with incremental sales resources, we will drive yet more growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And we're looking at really the business overall, and though I'm trying to bring in some level of conservatism because of the -- just what I read on the -- about the economy, we are really comfortable that we will get there. We should be there. There's no -- I mean, I suppose if there's a giant global financial meltdown, we shouldn't, but in looking at what was -- what happened this quarter, we don't actually expect that to repeat.

The overall business gets bigger, that is, of course, very profitable for us, and we think we can grow profitably. I want to point out that even in this quarter, our operating margins increased. Okay? Even in a quarter where we did not actually end up selling as many new licenses as we'd hoped, our operating margins increased, and we are really on track to get back to our pre-hardware company margins, which puts us, of course, at still the highest operating margins in the software industry, and we have a $4 billion hardware business in us.
