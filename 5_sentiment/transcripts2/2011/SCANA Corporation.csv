I’d also like to welcome each of you to our call. Let’s start on slide three, which reflects SCANA’s 2010 full year basic earnings per share of $2.99 compared to $2.85 per share in 2009. Basic earnings in the fourt",1826,"Thanks, Byron, and good afternoon. I’d also like to welcome each of you to our call. Let’s start on slide three, which reflects SCANA’s 2010 full year basic earnings per share of $2.99 compared to $2.85 per share in 2009. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $0.74 per share compared to $0.62 per share in the same quarter of 2009. Our results were within our 2010 guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 per share which had been narrowed during our second quarter call.
The quarterly and year-over-year increases in earnings were attributable to several factors as outlined on slide four. Primarily the increases in earnings was driven by improved margins from base rate increases which offset higher operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense, and share dilution. Some of the increase in O&M expense was the result of the regulatory order from our base rate care. For example, major maintenance expense on our power plants increased $4.6 million in 2010 because we were allowed to increase our major maintenance accrual beginning in the third quarter. In 2011 we will have a full year of this higher expense level which equates to approximately $10 million.
Of course these expenses were considered in the rate application and order and therefore our company buy like amount of revenue. As you may recall in the third quarter of 2010 we implemented the electric weather normalization mechanism beginning with August bills. This mechanism applies to residential and commercial electric customers. As a result the effects of as a result the effects of abnormal weather are mitigated in our third and fourth quarter results for 2010.
Now on slide five, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings denoted in blue were up $0.13 compared to 2009. Improved margins from base rate increase is under the Base Load Review Act and the retail electric rate case offset higher operating and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense. At December 31, 2010, SCE&G was serving approximately 661,000 electric customers and approximately 314,000 natural gas customers, up 0.9% and 1.3% respectively over 2009.
PSNC Energy’s earnings for 2010 in red were $0.36 per share compared to $0.38 per share in 2009. Higher interest expense offset increases in industrial usage and customer growth of 1.9% over the previous year. We are likely to term out $100 million of debt at a fixed rate in 2010 whereas this debt had previously been financed at very low credit facility rates. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings were flat over the same period in 2009.
SCANA Energy in green reported higher earnings for the full year 2010 and level earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. The $0.04 per share increase in annual earnings is attributable to increased throughput due to colder than normal weather and customer growth of approximately 2% over 2009.
SCANA’s corporate and other businesses reported a 2010 loss for the year and the quarter of $0.03 and $0.02 respectively compared to a loss of $0.02 and $0.01 for 2009. This increase is due to higher interest cost at the holding company in 2010.
Costs at the holding company in 2010.
Next I would like to discuss our financing plan. On slide six, you see a summary of our actual financings for 2010 and our preliminary financing plan for the years 2011 through ‘13. As you may recall in the second quarter we discussed the change in income tax accounting for capital maintenance, which resulted in certain maintenance costs to be included as current expense for income tax purposes.
Additionally we elected to use bonus depreciation in 2010 which allowed 50% of qualifying assets to be expensed for tax purposes. Combined these tax strategies generated approximately $175 million in cash eliminating our taxable income on our 2009 return and substantially reducing our 2010 estimated payments.
While, we yet to receive final guidance on additional bonus depreciation from the IRS, we expect these strategies to provide additional cash flow of approximately $50 million in 2011. This improved cash flow will continue to be used to mitigate external capital requirements.
In May 2010, we completed a $300 million equity transaction with $240 million in the forward structure because of improved cash flow provided through these tax strategies we did not draw from the equity forward in 2010 and don’t anticipate making any draws until late 2011.
You have also noticed a reduction in the amount of the new debt; we plan to issue in 2012 from our earlier forecast of $600 million down to current forecast of $450 million. While our financing plans are subject to our actual operating results and additional sources of cash, ultimately our intentions are that these tax strategies will allow us the flexibility to match our financings with the timing of capital requirements for our nuclear project and to reduce financing risk while minimizing real share dilution. Our pension plan is well funded, so we don’t anticipate using any of the cash for contributions as some of our peers are doing
Similar to our peers we have elected to use bonus depreciation; we will experience a reduction in rate base due to the netting of deferred taxes. While the effect of this decrease in rate base does not currently impact our rates it is incorporated in to our quarterly monitoring reports filed with the Public Service Commission. However much of our rate base growth is in new nuclear and will not be impacted under the bonus depreciation rules as the property is not yet in service.
Slide 7 and 8 show our electric and gas sales statistics. Kilowatt hour sales of electricity to our retail customers in the fourth quarter of 2010 were up 8.3% over the prior year. Overall total kilowatt hour sales of electricity, which includes sales to other utilities were up 9.5%.
Consolidated therm sales were up 6% over the fourth quarter of 2009 driven by higher residential and commercial usage. The weather was the primary driver of residential and commercial kilowatt hour sales. Of course our WNA and cut mechanisms normalized margin and not kilowatt hour of therm sales. Industrials, which are only minimally impacted by weather, continue to show a strong recovery compared to 2009.
As you can see on Slide 9 we continue to attract new business and see expansion of existing businesses. In December of 2010 Amazon announced plans to invest $100 million to build a distribution center in Lexington County near our corporate campus. This distribution center will have over 1200 permit employees and an estimated 2500 on a seasonal basis. In January of 2011 AQT Solar announced plans to locate a manufacturing in Richland County. This 300 million
This $300 million investment will begin production in 2012 and is estimated to create a total of 1000 jobs about 2014. Additionally the South Carolina Ports Authority recently announced that the Port of Charleston saw an increase in year-over-year container cargo volume of almost 17% during the prior year.
These recent announcements will result in the creation of more than 7100 new jobs and encouraging signs of a longer term economic recovery in our service territories. In addition, we recently reached an agreement on the wholesale contract with the Orangeburg Department of Public Utilities. Under the new $700 million contract SCE&G will continue to supply electricity to Orangeburg through at least December 2022. Orangeburg has long been a customer of SCE&G and we’re pleased that we were able to reach an agreement for the continuation of this relationship.
Another data point the U.S. census population growth is presented on slide 10. The average population growth for the U.S. was approximately 9.7% over the last decade. The three states in our service territory Carolina’s and Georgia all showed growth rates significantly higher than the national average ranging from 15% to 18%. We are pleased to see this type of population growth in our service territory and anticipate customer growth will return to more normal levels as the economy improves.
Slide 11 presents our preliminary three-year CapEx forecast. The estimates for 2011 and ‘12 are slightly less than the forecast we presented a year ago. As we have reported consistently in our BLRA filings, our new nuclear spending steps up in 2012 and ‘13 and accounts for more than half of our total capital spending in those years. In January of this year
January of this year we entered into an agreement with Westinghous from nuclear fuel assemblies which will supply the need of Units 1, 2 and 3 at V.C. Summer through 2033. We have incorporated this recently signed agreement into this forecast. Earlier today we announced that our Board of Directors raised the indicated annual dividend rate to $1.94 per share, a 2.1% increase.
The new rate is payable April 1, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10. Despite a challenging economic environment in 2010 SCANA achieved its earnings target and completed another successful year. Results of 2010 and confidence in the long-term growth of our company led the board to decide that a dividend increase was appropriate.
Slide 12 presents our 2011 earnings guidance and related assumptions. While we are pleased with 2010 results we continue to increase the effects of the recession, a sluggish housing market and elevated unemployment. Our 2010 weather normalized EPS base of $2.92 takes into account $0.07 per share benefit from weather.
Our 2011 preliminary guidance is $2.95 to $3.10 per share and our internal target is $3.02 or approximately the middle of the range. This guidance assumes known industrial expansion and continued customer growth at recent levels.
Additionally we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings and the effects of the additional cash flow from our tax strategies. As it relates to expenses operation and maintenance expense is expected to remain relatively flat with modest growth and property taxes and other major expense categories and effective tax rate of approximately 30%.
While we are beginning to see signs of longer term economic recovery in our service territories. We remain conservative in our estimates and cautiously optimistic about our longer term sustained recovery. While our compound average growth rate over the last six years has been 4.4%, given the challenging economic environment and relatively high unemployment, we are tempering our average annual earnings growth to between 3% and 5% for the next three to five years. We feel this is more appropriate given the challenges of the current economy, as we continue to emphasize a long term sustainable plan.
In summary, our guidance is higher than the prior year. The trajectory is positive. We continue to experience customer growth and are optimistic about our long term business plan. And I’ll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh, President and Chief Operating Officer of SCANA and President of SCE&G.

Before I get started on our regulatory and construction update, I want to discuss the recently announced changes in our management team. As many of you know, on January 7, Bill Timmerman announced his plans to retire as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SCANA effective November 30. Upon Bill’s retirement, the Board has elected me to succeed him as Chairman and CEO. I’m certainly honored and look forward to the opportunities that will come with my new responsibilities.
During this transition period, I will continue in my capacity as President of SCE&G and assume the role of President and Chief Operating Officer of SCANA. Additionally, Steve Byrne, our Executive Vice President of Generation and Transmission was appointed Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G and Keller Kissam was promoted to Senior Vice President of Retail Operations for SCE&G.
I have been fortunate to have worked closely with Bill for nearly 30 years and we both expect this to be a smooth transition as we continue with this period of nuclear construction. Bill has been Chairman and CEO of SCANA for almost 15 years and I value his counsel. I am pleased that after his retirement he will be serving as a consultant and available for discussion and input. We have a strong succession planning program with many experienced leaders in our company that will enable us to make this transition as seamless as possible.
Let me turn now to our new nuclear project activities. On slide 13, I am very pleased to report that our new nuclear project remains on schedule and on budget. On November 15th we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the Office of Regulatory Staff of the third quarter of 2010 as required under our Base Load Review order. This report provides a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. Additionally, we intend to file our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter of 2010 this coming Monday February 14th.
In addition, on November 15th we also filed a petition with the PSC seeking approval to update the capital cost schedule for the construction of the company’s new nuclear units as seen on slide 14. This filing is necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court last year which found that contingency cost could not be included in forecast approved for Base Load Review Act purposes until the cost could be identified and itemized to specific cost categories.
This filing identified and itemized certain capital costs of approximately 174 million that will be incurred during the construction of the new nuclear units. The 174 million is highlighted on chart 14 on line one of the last column and it represents the proposed increase and projected capital cost requested in our filing with the PSC. These are not additional costs nor is this a request to raise customer rates. We are simply specifying how we intend to use some of the dollars that were originally included in the contingency fund and our initial BLRA filing now that we have more clarity of the construction.
Hearing on this proceeding is currently scheduled for the spring. At receiving a commission order in the approved capital cost already incurred would be added those included in our last rate filing under the BLRA to determine the requested rate adjustment for 2011.
Regarding the status of the CR will the Nuclear Rate Reporting Commission’s likes and proceedings for the units are also progressing toward a successful conclusion. One focus of this licensing review has been the new and stronger design from the reactor shield building. In late 2010 the NRC staff completed its technical review of the current design for the shield building as well as other design changes proposed by Westinghouse and issued a favorable comprehensive safety evaluation report for the units.
The advisory committee on Reactor Safeguards an independent panel that advises NRC also reviewed and approved AP1000 design and related changes and has determined that the core design is fully adequate to protect public health and safety.
In addition all intervenous challenges to SCE&G’s COL application have been denied by both the Atomic Safety Licensing Board and the NRC. We believe the current NRC schedule continues to support the issuance of the combined operating license in late 2011 or early 2012.
On slide 15, you’ll see a schedule of our historical regulatory filings and rate increases to-date under the Base Load Review Act. We are pleased that the mechanism continues to work as designed, this slide also shows our regulatory schedule for 2011 with new nuclear related filings
With nuclear related filings appearing in the left column and our other routine filings on the right. That concludes our prepared remarks. We’ll now be glad or respond to any questions you might have.

So, really what you have is the majority of the variance is due to rate changes both due to the base rate increase as well as the Base Load Review Act increases related to nuclear. So that only leads to the second quarter that was not weather normalized and we estimate for the year for SCE&G there was about $0.06 per share of above normal earnings from weather due to that second quarter.

Nuclear units, we went through a couple of years there where we had a very little CapEx outside of just normal growth of the system. That normal growth was coming at close to 2.5% or 3% range. And even at that level we were able to do all of our financing without having to do much of the new external financing realm and we’re able to bring that growth to the bottom line because you had new assets going in and the customer revenue was earning a return on those new assets. With the lower growth rates, until we returned to those levels, we still earn our return on the investment we’ve got. That won’t change.

It’s not the, part of it is the lack of growth that we’ve had in the past. It’s about half of what it’s been in the past. Although it’s better than many of the country, it’s slightly under 1%.
The challenge that our industry is facing and we certainly are is that the average customer is using slightly less electricity in that same unit home that’s been there than they were three years ago. That is the core challenge that’s putting pressure on it. We’ve responded to that by really ratcheting back our cost and doing everything we can to control cost while providing reliable service, meeting customer service expectations of running a safe system. So, that’s the challenge in the short run.

Ironically, back to one of the very first questions we got here earlier this afternoon, we’re really - we’re probably closer to earning our allowed returns than we ever had been historically at least in the last decade because the growth has slowed, and usually when you got robust growth you’re chasing that with new distribution system on the electric side and gas side with expansion of power plants etcetera and you’re constantly falling behind because of using historical test years. With the CapEx slowing, with us really controlling cost well, we’re closer to earning those allowed returns than we’ve likely been in 10 plus years.

what we saw when the economy turned in South Carolina was very much indicative of customers saying they wanted to cutback and that’s what makes us so hard and terminable when do they feel comfortable that they can turn those air conditioners back up during the summer time. Trust me, when it’s 100 degrees, I think the customers are running the air conditioners. And so in short it appears when they feel like they can possibly do without any targets to handle on and for the challenges we have right now is we haven’t had a long enough periods to see a sustained pattern.
We dove into the same pretty quickly in 2009 and it’s been very difficult to determine when will we come back out and we see positive signs, but as I’ve talked about it with Jimmy we want to be very sure that we’re on the way back up and we’re not going to have a relapse before we make a commitment.

I would like to welcome each of you to our call also. Let’s start on slide three which reflects SCANA’s 2011 Q1 basic earnings per share of $1 compared to $1.02 per share in 2010.

Let’s start on slide three which reflects SCANA’s 2011 Q1 basic earnings per share of $1 compared to $1.02 per share in 2010. The decline in earnings was primarily attributable to weather in our Georgia market of natural gas rates stabilization act, decrease in South Carolina, higher depreciation and share dilution; all of which offset improved margins from electric based rate increases. We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guide of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with an internal target of $3.02.
Additionally, with more than 90% of our earnings weather normalized I thought it might be helpful for you to understand our view of our annual earnings plan by quarter. In our annual forecast we see this distribution as approximately 30% in both Q1 and Q4, 25% in Q3 and the remaining 15% in Q2. Hopefully this will be helpful in the quarterly distribution within your models. I caution you to consider the combination of this quarterly distribution and our annual guidance in updating your models if you choose to use it at all.
Now on slide four I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G’s Q1 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $.04 compared to 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the base load review act and the mid-2010 retail electric rate case offset the lower gas margins from the RSA rate decrease and the higher capital related costs of depreciation, property taxes and interest.
As you may recall, in Q1 of 2010, we deferred for refund $25 million related to incremental margin from unusually cold weather as part of the implementation of our pilot electric weather normalization mechanism. This program applies to residential and commercial electric customers and was fully implemented in August 2010. The 2010 deferral had the effect of weather normalizing Q1, therefore there is no weather variance at the SCE&G.
At March 31, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 663,000 electric customers and approximately 315,000 natural gas customers; up .6% and .9% respectively over the same date in 2010.
PS&C Energy’s earnings for Q1 2011, in red, were $.25 per share unchanged from Q1 of 2010. Increases in margin from customer growth of 1.4% were offset by higher interest expense. As with SCE&G, no wonder variance is seen at PS&C due to the customer usage tracker or decoupling mechanism. SCANA Energy in grain reported earnings of $.17 during the quarter compared to $.24 in the prior year. The $.07 per share decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to weather. The colder than normal weather in Q1 2010 contributed $.09 to earnings as compared to about $.02 from colder than normal weather in 2011. Said another way, although Q1 of 2011 was cold, it was not nearly as cold as Q1 of 2010.
SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers as of March 31, 2011. SCANA’s corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $.03 per share in Q1 of 2011 compared to $.02 per share in the same quarter last year.
Slide five shows our electric and gas sales statistics. Unit sales of electricity and natural gas to our retail customers in Q1 of 2011 were down over the prior year driven by weather related decreases in our residential and commercial classes. Of course our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalized margin and not unit sales. The industrial sector continued the train of recovery with an increase in both electric and gas sales.
On slide six you can see an update of economic growth announcements during Q1 of 2011. These recent announcements suggest the creation of more than 1800 new jobs with an investment of more than $600 million and are a continuing sign of a longer-term economic recovery in our service territory.
As you can see on slide seven, we expect to complete our debt financings for 2011 next month. As it relates to our cash position the final ROS rules for 2011 bonus depreciation were issued in March. These final rules are consistent with the method we used to originally estimate cash will be generated from bonus depreciation as discussed during our February call. In addition to bonus depreciation we continue to recognize a cash benefit and the method being used to account for capital maintenance, which results in certain maintenance costs being treated as current expenses for income tax purposes. Combined, we expect these strategies to generate over $60 million in cash benefit. Accordingly, we do not expect to draw the remaining funds under our May 2010 equity forward until early 2012, which will mitigate dilution.
I’ll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh.

I would like to direct your attention first to slide 8. As most of you are aware, the United States environmental protection agency issued a proposed rule on March 16th, 2011 which would provide the first national standards for emissions of mercury, arsenic and other pollutants from coal and oil fired power plants. We will review the proposed rules to better understand any potential impact on our operations. The proposed rule must first be published under federal register, then undergo a 60-day comment period and the EPA will also hold three public meetings. Based upon the comments received, the EPA may make changes to the proposal before it is finalized, as early as November 6th, 2011. SCANA is committed to being a good steward of the environment and to meeting all the requirements set by state and federal regulators regarding power plant emissions. After the final rule is available, we will develop a compliant strategy based on the requirements of the rule, compliant time frames and the estimated cost of various options for compliance.
Since the mid 1990s we have spent nearly a billion dollars installing environmental equipment in our fossil plants including, most recently, an SER at our Coat facility and (inaudible) and William Station plants. That equipment has significantly reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and mercury on our system.
Let me turn now to our new nuclear project activities. On slide nine I’m very pleased to report that our project for two new units remains on budget and on schedule for 2016 and 2019 respectively. As you may recall, on November 15th, 2010, we filed a petition with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking approval to update the capital cost schedules for the construction of the company’s new nuclear units. This filing was necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court last year, which found that general contingency costs should not be included in forecast approved under the Base Load Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use contingency fund is identified and itemized in specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval.
The November 2010 filing identified and itemized certain capital costs of approximately $174 million that will be incurred during the construction of the new nuclear unit. These are not additional costs nor is this an additional quest to raise customer rates. We’re simply specifying how we intend to use some of the dollars that were originally included in the contingency fund in our initial BLRA filing now that we have more clarity of the construction outlook. The hearing on this request was held on April 4th and we anticipate receiving permission order in May. After receiving the order, any approved capital costs already incurred will be added to those included in our revised rates filing under BLRA to determine the requested rate adjustment for 2011.
Please turn to slide ten. On February 14, 2011 we filed our quarterly status report with the CFC and the Office Of Regulatory Staff for Q4 of 2010 as required under our Base Load Review order. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. Additionally, we intend to file our quarterly status report for Q1 2011 on Monday, May 16th and our annual request for revised rate under the Base Load Review Act on Friday, May 27th. The remaining dates on this slide represent other regulatory filings we anticipate making later this year. We are pleased with the progress of the projects and the continued regulatory support that we have received.
We believe that nuclear power is a clean non-invading source of energy, which will position South Carolina well in the future, particularly as environmental regulations surrounding greenhouse gases and coal increase.
I will now turn the call over to Steve Byrne who will discuss our COL application and provide and update on the status of our nuclear construction project.

The nuclear regulatory commissions’ licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. We continue to anticipate receiving our combined operating license or COL in late 2011 or early 201",689,"Thank you Kevin. Please turn to slide 11. The nuclear regulatory commissions’ licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. We continue to anticipate receiving our combined operating license or COL in late 2011 or early 2012. The COL during impact study referenced in the most recent BLRA filing was initiated by SCE&G in December of 2010. This detailed study is an evaluation of the alternatives for optimizing the construction schedule to make up the anticipated delay beyond the original construction schedule for the first under the EPC contract which assumed the COL would be issued in mid-2011 rather than our current expectation.
Construction schedules generally can be adjusted by adding shifts of construction workers working weekends, undertaking scopes of work in parallel instead of in series and similar changes in the construction plan. SCE&G is involved in the ongoing oversight of the study and will review the results and any cost associated with compressing the schedule using such techniques. While the situation is dynamic, we anticipate that this study will be completed by the end of Q2. SCE&G continues to believe that the commercial operation date for the first will fall within the schedule approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission including the allowable schedule contingencies. There should be no adverse impact on the commercial operation date for the second meeting.
In late 2010 the NRC staff completed its technical review of the current AP1000 design for the shield building as well as other design changes proposed by Westinghouse and issued a favorable comprehensive advanced safety evaluation report for the units. The advisory committee on reactive safeguards, an independent panel of advisors in NRC also reviewed and recommended the AP1000 design and related changes and has determined that the current design is fully adequate to protect the public health and safety.
We received our final environmental impact statement last week and we anticipate receiving the final safety evaluation report this summer. We believe the NRC will conduct a mandatory hearing in the fall this year. I’d like to point out that there will be no contested hearing as all interveners challenges to SCE&G COL application have been denied by both the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. After mandatory hearing is complete, the NRC will make the decision regarding issuance of our COL.
As you see from the aerial photo on slide 12, we continue to proceed with pre-construction activity to the site and continue to receive parts on site in preparation for constructing. After we receive the COL, we will begin so called Nuclear Construction of the unit. I’d like to point out that while we do not foresee a delay on the COL beyond late 2011 or early 2012, we are evaluating contingency plans for that scenario. There’s a great deal of work that can be done on the unit prior to receipt of the COL. For example, the two largest modules, CA01 and CA20 can be constructed simultaneously in the module assembly building and then moved into the excavation site once we receive the COL. In the unlikely event that we might receive the COL in late 2011 or early 2012 as we expect, we feel confident that we will be able to optimize our construction schedule for critical path items to reduce any significant impact to our in-service dates.
Finally I would like to briefly touch on the supply chain. As you may know, our turbine generators and steel plating for the containment vessels are being manufactured in Japan. While these components represent less than 15% of the total project cost, they are long lead-time components. Our suppliers in Japan have assured us that they suffered minimal damage as a result of the natural disaster. The biggest challenge these suppliers continue to face is related to their electric power supply. Japan continues to have rolling blackouts so they are not able to operate at full capacity. However, we do not anticipate significant delays in our construction due to these supply issues.
That concludes our prepared remarks, we’ll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.

First let me tell you that I think that it’s probably a little early for us to start talking about the lessons learned. The nuclear regulatory commission has, in process, a lessons learned review that they’ll be reporting out and it’s a 90 day review and they’ll be reporting out at 30, 60 and 90 days. And I think May 12th is the advertised date for that first report out from that 30-day review. Beyond that what the NRC is doing is they’re putting in place a taskforce to do a more in-depth review and that taskforce, I believe it’s been selected, once it starts its work it’s about a six month working time frame. So I think that will probably put us somewhere near the end of this year. And that taskforce will then report out. So the NRC has a couple lessons learned of things in the work.
What we are doing is in the United States after September 11th of 2001, we put in place a number of practices, procedures and equipment to compensate for loss of large areas of the plant. And it really doesn’t make much difference as to what the reason for that loss is whether it’s an aircraft impact, whether it’s a tornado, hurricane, whatever the reason is. We had to have mitigating strategies and then some equipment staged. Not necessarily staged at the plant location but staged so that you can get it to the plant location as soon as the plant location suffers some damage.
So one of the things we’ve done after the Fukushima accident was we verified all the equipment was in place and verify that all of our practices and procedures will work. We did that through a group we belong to called WANO Nuclear Power Operations. That group subsequently is one of the charter members of a world association of nuclear operators. But the Japanese utilities are members of that world association and they will be reporting out on lessons learned through that group, through WANO and we’ll get our information through the info link into WANO. Though there’s a couple of, one national and one worldwide industry of associations that will be formulating those lessons learned. Now based on what we have seen, I want to point out a couple things. One, the type of reactors that they’re using in Japan at that Fukushima site, all six of their reactors were borne water reactors. The reactors that we are building and the reactors we currently operate are pressurized water reactors. So there is a fundamental difference in the way that the reactors operate.
Secondly their issue really was not caused as much by the earthquake as it was by the tsunami. They had a significant wall of water that impacted that facility. Our information, in fact, is that the plants rode through the earthquake pretty well; all the reactors shut down, all the controls rods fully inserted, the reactors went sub-critical, the diesel generator started to carry the emergency loads and it wasn’t until almost an hour later when the tsunami flooded the facility that they lost that onsite power supply and then they were relying just on the battery. Our facility is over 400 feet above sea level and we’re over 100 miles from the ocean. So the tsunami issue for us will not be an issue.
So there are some fundamental differences we’ve looked into. What we do expect to learn are things like communications, batteries, emergency planning, communication to offsite agencies, that didn’t go probably as smoothly as it could have or should have. But one fundamental difference is that I don’t think the rest of the world took the events of September 11th of 2001 as seriously as the United States did, probably for very good reasons. But in the US we put in place beyond our design basis mitigating strategies at that point in time. But most of the rest of the world probably didn’t pay a lot of attention to it.

In fact none of the vendors that we’re using whether it’s Toshiba, IJI or some of their sub vendors, has indicated to us that they’ve suffered any amount of real damage from the earthquake or tsunami.

Now their rolling blackout situation is getting better. And as much as it is now more predictable then it used to be and a number of vendors have indicated to us that they are now shifting their work schedules such that if power’s not going to be available during the day but it will be available at night , then they’re bringing folks in at night to do the work.

Three quick questions; all just nuance type stuff. The first one is on O&M trends.

Second question is at SCE&G what was the earned ROE for either the trailing 12 or 13 months, I forgot how you report it.
And then the final question is on your funding and cash flow impacts and needs going forward on bonus depreciation, I think you mentioned it, but the cash impacts on both 11 and 12 especially now that the rules are out and what are you thinking about your DRIP program in the next several years?

On the first, on O&M, we do continue to keep tight control around what we call core O&M. That’s the things that are really controllable by the wine businesses.

That’s the things that are really controllable by the wine businesses. The things that have been, and those are really, we’ve maintained those relatively flat. The one exception to that is that for the first time in three years we did have salary increases during Q1 that was impacted about half of the quarter for mid-February. Very modest amounts of 2% to 2.5%, something like that. So you want to have a full run of that for a quarter until Q2.
The things that are offset that many of our incentive comp plans, the part driven by shareholder return, the costs of the revision in the long-term guidance that we did on the yearend call and because of the hit the stock took with the Japan crisis initially. We were out of the money on those at the end of the quarter. So there’s no incentive cost in there related to the shareholder return for Q1.
And the third thing I’d comment on about O&M really relates to bad debt expense. And we continue to have fairly good success in a very difficult economy with bad debt expense across the companies. Certainly low natural gas prices have helped that. A milder winter compared to a winter ago has kept total bills down, has helped that as well. And I think generally just people’s pulling back and concentrating on more critical items in the household they’ve maybe moved the utility bill up in the priority compared to some things they would have spent on a couple three years ago. So we’re fairly encouraged about that but we’re going to watch that throughout the balance of the year so it’s kind of cautious optimism.
On the ROEs you asked about, on the electric business we continue to be at about 10%, just slightly under .995% but that is on a proforma basis and I would just caution you that, so what we do, as you’re probably familiar, is we annualize expenses. I gave you a moment ago the example of salary increases. So in that 10% return that we filed with the regulators, we’ll take any expenses what we’re aware of and known and measurable at the time and annualize a full year’s run rate. So that usually results in a 20 to 40 basis point reduction off the actual return. So when I give you slightly under 10%, the actual return for the period may have been closer to 20 to 40 basis points higher. We try to proforma the entire everything we know of at that point in time out in accordance with the regulator’s requirements.
And then the last thing I think you asked about cash flow and overall with the change we made in our capitalization policy and then the bonus depreciation on top of that, we estimate in aggregate over $200 million of additional cash over those two plus years, really a part of ‘10, ‘11 and ‘12 that would benefit us. Therefore we don’t see ourselves taking down any of the remaining forward equity until Q1 of 2012 when we had originally projected to take that down in a few trenches during this year. So we think we’re in much better position there from a cash basis and we don’t really see needing any additional equity beyond that in the equity forward until well into 2012.

But that would be in the, what I termed, the so-called nuclear construction because there are some things that I need a license in order to start. But there are a significant amount of activities that we currently have ongoing that do not need the license and would continue. Cooling towers for example, we just started on cooling towers. We’d be able to step our way through those. There’s one permit we’re waiting on for the cooling towers but was dependent on us getting the final environmental impact statement. Well we received that final environmental impact statement a little over a week ago so we should be cleared to do that now.
We can start the fabrication of the modules; these are the big modules that eventually will be put in the excavation. We’ve got probably a year plus worth of work on the two biggest ones and we can stage those and start on some of the smaller modules. The plate for the containment vessel bottom bowl, the way you build a containment vessel is it’s almost two inch thick steel and you build a bottom bowl just a layer that looks like a big cereal bowl, then you build some stackable rings and then you build the top portion of the bowl. We received all the plate for the bottom bowl and we’ve got probably a years’ worth of fabrication on site to do that. And then we’ll start receiving plate for the ring sites and that can all continue.
We’ve got the switchyard that we’re constructing. That will go through, probably through about 2012. We’ve got a water treatment facility that eventually will supply all three of our units. That can continue and we’ve got a number of other support, piping, intake, structure, discharge, well water supply, all those kinds of things you can go in.
So we’ve got a reasonably significant amount of work that will continue even if we did not get the COL when we anticipate it, you know, we would be looking at reconfiguring our critical path schedule and looking to see what kinds of things we can do external to the excavation that might be inserted once finished. For example rebar; if we put the reinforcing bar together, the matrix and the lattice together outside of the excavation and then lowered it in later, that would remove that from critical pass. So while we would anticipate that the capital spending would slow down in 2012, we would not certainly anticipate a cessation and it would be a reasonable significant amount that we can continue to do.

Currently their situation is still but there are only two places in the world where ultra large forgings can be done and that’s either in Japan or in Korea. And we opted to have ours done in Korea. So the forgings and the machining are all being done in Korea before shipment here.
We have plate steel that we are going to need for the first ring. It should be coming from a company called IHI, that’s the in Tokyo area. And again we’ve contacted them and don’t anticipate any delays but we would expect to receive some of that steel in 2012 such that when we’re finished with the lower bowl we can start, actually we’ll start before hand, we’ll start on the first lane. So the little bowl goes in first and then the first ring will go on after that. So we would expect those deliveries in 2012 from IHI in the Tokyo area.

This is Kevin. We have been participating in the loan guarantee process, going through the due diligence and have gotten to a point where we believe we provided enough information to their team that will allow us to get some sort of information back on what sort of terms and conditions they might be attaching to the loan guarantees.
We know and it’s been reported they’ve got a deal with Southern on the Georgia projects. We’d like to certainly see how those documents are laid out and what the requirements might be in there to make sure it would be something that would fit with us for the long-term period that those loans would run. They present some challenges from a financing perspective because they’re twenty-year amortizing loans, which means in that twenty-year period you’ll be out of the marketplace, refinancing significant parts of the plant. If you do accept the loan guarantees that gives us some concern with interest rates where they are today given that they’re likely to go up. That could expose us to some fairly good-sized risk as opposed to thirty-year bonds that we typically do under our First Mortgage financing.
So we have told DOE that we need some more information before we go any further to evaluate the loans but I would reaffirm that we’ve said since day one we don’t need the loan guarantees to proceed with the project. We’ve been very successful to date in doing the financing we need to bring the debt on board as necessary and that we certainly believe that will continue to be the case. So we’ll continue to work with them as information becomes available. But at this point I would say the ball is in their court to provide us additional information to help us do the evaluation; in the meantime we’ll continue with our First Mortgage-run debt issuances when they are necessary.

I would like to welcome each of you to our call. Let’s start on slide 3, which reflects 2011 second quarter basic earnings per share of $0.44 compared to $0.43 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributabl",1074,"Thanks, Byron and good afternoon. I would like to welcome each of you to our call. Let’s start on slide 3, which reflects 2011 second quarter basic earnings per share of $0.44 compared to $0.43 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases and lower operations and maintenance expenses which were partially offset by higher property taxes, depreciation, interest expense, and share dilution.
In addition, we experienced a weather benefit of $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2010 in the Electric business. Of course we now have an electric weather normalization mechanism, effective in August of 2010 so our margins do not experience large fluctuations due to weather.
Please turn to slide 4. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $1.44 compared to $1.45 for the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operations and maintenance expenses were more than offset by the abnormal weather in the prior year, a gas rate decrease under the Rate Stabilization Act, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are re-affirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with an internal target of $3.02. We continue to actively monitor the economy and aggressively manage operations and maintenance expenses.
Now on slide 5, I’d like to review results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G’s second quarter 2011 earnings denoted in blue were down $0.02 per share compared to 2010. As I mentioned earlier, the second quarter of 2010 included a weather benefit of $0.06 per share. In the current quarter, our electric weather normalization mechanism removed the impact of abnormal weather from our margins.
Additionally, improved electric margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the mid-2010 retail electric rate case were offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution related to our CapEx program. At June 30, 2011, SCE&G was serving approximately 664,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.6% and 1.0% respectively over the same dates in 2010.
PSNC Energy in red reported a seasonal loss of less than $1 million or $0.01 per share in the current quarter, relatively unchanged from the prior year. Lower operations and maintenance expense and increases in margin from customer growth of approximately 1.6% offset decreases in other income.
SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.05 in the prior year. The $0.03 change is driven by cooler weather early in the quarter compared to last year and lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers as of June 30, 2011. SCANA’s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01, unchanged compared to the same quarter last year.
On slides 6 and 7, you see our electric and gas sales statistics, unit sales of electricity and natural gas to our retail customers in the second quarter of 2011 were up over the prior year. Of course, our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalize margin and not unit sales. The industrial sector continued to show signs of recovery with an increase in both electric and gas sales.
On slide 8, you can see an update of economic expansion announcements during the second quarter of 2011. These recent announcements suggest the creation of approximately 500 new jobs with an investment of more than $230 million. At the bottom of the page, you will find unemployment data. If you look to the far right of this chart, you’ll find data for the Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina metropolitan areas. These areas include a large portion of our electric service territory. As you can see from the numbers, the unemployment rate in those areas is slightly better than national rate and the rates of the three states in which we operate. We are pleased that our territories continue to see customer growth, and announcements of jobs and investment. As these trends continue, lower unemployment will be expected to follow.
Please turn to slide 9. In May, we completed our previously announced debt issuances for 2011. We refinanced $300 million in medium term notes at SCANA and also we issued $100 million in new first mortgage bonds at SCE&G. We were pleased with investor response to both of these transactions, and I am delighted to have completed these (inaudible) prior to the recent turmoil in Washington related to debt limits.
As previously discussed, we continue to recognize a cash benefit from bonus depreciation and from the election to account for certain maintenance cost as current expense for tax purposes. Combined, we expect these strategies to generate over $60 million of cash benefit for 2011. Accordingly, we do not expect to draw the remaining funds under our May 2010 equity forward until 2012, delaying the impact of share dilution.
Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the earned regulatory returns at our three largest regulated subsidiaries. As you can see on slide 10, our electric business earned 9.16% for the 12 months ended March 31. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWIP or associated rate increases as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.
Since the time of our latest electric rate case filing, which used the test year ended September 30, 2009, we have seen increases in costs such as property taxes, depreciation, and interest, which have put downward pressure on our actual regulatory return.
As of March 31, our gas businesses at SCE&G was earning approximately 8%. Under the terms of the Rate Stabilization Act, we have applied for an increase of $8.64 million to restore the return to 10.25%. After an audit of the application, the new gas rates will become effective in November. Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well and is earning its allowed return. As you can see from the timeline at the bottom of the chart, we have completed most of our planned regulatory filings for the year.
In addition to the items shown on this slide, we will continue to make quarterly filings with the South Carolina PSC related to our nuclear construction project and for the electric and gas businesses at SCE&G.
I’ll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh.

Let me turn now to our new nuclear project activities on slide 11. I am very pleased to report that our project for the two new units remains on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019 respectively. In May 2011, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act.
The revenue increase requested was $58.5 million based on estimated incremental CWIP through June 2011 of approximately $485 million. Earlier this week, the Office of Regulatory Staff filed their report related to the requested increase. The report reflected actual CWIP through June of $437 million and a resulting rate increase of $52.8 million. We agree with the revised amount from the ORS report. After approval by the South Carolina Public Service Commission, this will be the fourth rate increase we have received under the BLRA. The revised rate will go into effect in November.
Please turn to slide 12. On May 16, 2011, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the first quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. As shown on the slide, we are $163 million under the capital cost approved by the Commission, most of which is due to lower-than-anticipated escalation. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the same quarter of 2011 on August 15.
Recently Duke Energy and the Florida Municipal Power Agency announced that they both had signed letters of intent with Santee Cooper for potential minority interest in Santee’s 45% ownership of the new nuclear units under construction at V.C. Summer. Santee Cooper continues to be a co-owner and co-applicant in V.C. Summer units 2 and 3 as set forth in the combined license application currently being reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And, we do not expect these letters of intent or the one that Santee Cooper has signed with the Orlando Utilities Commission to have an impact on the issuance of our COL.
If Santee Cooper decides to move forward with a sale of a portion of its output or interest in the two new nuclear units, it would help Santee accomplish its previously stated objective of lowering its participation in these two units. SCE&G will continue to operate the two new units, and there is no change in our 55% share of ownership which is needed to meet customer demand, comply with environmental regulations, and reduce carbon emissions.
I’ll now turn the call over to Steve Byrne to discuss our COL status and environmental regulations.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. This past Tuesday, we received a letter from the NRC Office of New Reactors that outlines an updated schedule for issuing our Final Safety Evaluation Report or FSER. The letter made three points.
First, the staff concluded that they have all the information they need to complete the safety review and that our application was complete. Second, the review supports the issuance of our FSER in September, and third, the completion of the mandatory hearing on the V.C. Summer COL application including issuance of a Commission decision should be no later than four months from the issuance of the latter of the FEIS which we received in April or the FSER which the letter states will be received in September.
So, the remaining issue is the ultimate approval of the AP1000 certified design itself. Westinghouse submitted DCD Revision 19 to the NRC on June 13. After the NRC’s review of this design revision, the next step would be the issuance of the final safety evaluation report for the AP1000 design, which we believe to be imminent. Following that, the NRC will go for a rule-making process which we anticipate will provide for the receipt our COL within our previously announced timeframe of late 2011 or early 2012. As Tuesday’s NRC letter suggests, we anticipate a Commission decision to approve our COL no later than January of 2012.
I’d like now to spend a few minutes to touch on the NRC taskforce report on the Fukushima accident, or the so-called 90-day report that was issued on July 12. SCE&G has consistently embraced measures which protect public health and safety. Recognizing this report is early in the process. We fully support assessments by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other independent oversight authorities that might help further improve safe operation of nuclear reactors in the U.S. now and in the future.
SCE&G remains committed to its nuclear strategy, which includes operating Unit 1 safely and progressing with the plans for Units 2 and 3. This is consistent with conclusions in the 90-day report. The report concluded that continued operation and continued licensing activities do not pose an eminent risk to public health and safety, and we are certainly in agreement with that statement. The taskforce also supported completing the design certification and rule-making activities for the AP 1000 without delay.
Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet as seen on slide 14. On July 6, 2011, the EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. This rule replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule and is aimed at addressing power plant emissions that may contribute to air pollution in other states. The rule requires states in the Eastern United States to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. In general, the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction or SCR.
As you can see from this slide, around 70% of our coal megawatts already have a scrubber and SCR installed. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched total generation. In anticipation of more regulation, we will continue to pursue additional strategies and evaluate emissions-reduction technologies, to ensure that we are in compliance with all environmental regulations.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.

And then, I guess your issuer rating at SCE&G, but on the ones that are Baa2, just in general, could be the ones that are Baa3 on junior subordinated. What if any implications does that have? I mean, I don’t know if there are any, I’m just going back to like, the Enron days, but any type of triggers, anything in your indenture, anything like that that you would have to put up any type of cash or just in general, what are the implications if you were to get a one notch downgrade on these various things that have been put on watch for downgrade?

Well, it is disappointing, but I think practically to get to your question, there’s very little impact. We have one financing to do at the holding company in the next nine years, that’s next year, it’s actually a refinancing, not new money for about $250 million. So, that’s the only thing that’s really in our headlights for the - as I said, the next nine years through 2019.
The only other implication would be slightly higher cost for short-term money, if we were to borrow any at the holco. We have not had any commercial paper program at the holding company until we renewed our credit facility this past fall. We instituted one at the holco and have used it sparingly. We don’t expect to use it a great deal, but that market is not as liquid as the P2 market, if were to be downgraded to P3 at the holco, but of course, we got the credit facilities in place that we could fall back on and borrow. But we really put that there as just a contingency anyway.
So all of our financing for the CapEx is going to be - we plan to be through first mortgage bonds at SCE&G, of course, most of our commercial paper is there or at the fuel company, which are not part of this review, and we would expect that when we come out of this that all of the entities will be on - probably on stable outlook, which will kind of remove that overhang from the SCE&G.

Any sale of their 45% portion of the new plant does require our approval and the approval of the South Carolina Commission, and if they just decide to sell the power and not actually sell the portion of the asset, it doesn’t require any approval from us, but if they do decide to actually sell assets or their portion from the 45%, we do have the right to approve that, and once we were to do that, it would go to the South Carolina Commission, but that’s not something I see that would stand in the way of them trying to accomplish their goals.
Now, they’ve certainly been working hard to lower that level of ownership and these letters of intent they signed are very important step. Our relationship with Santee continues to be strong and I think they’ll continue to be a great partner with us as we go forward, because they still do plan on maintaining a significant portion of their original investment. And we’re working with them to help them achieve their goals.
So they’ve been doing that negotiating and as they go forward at the appropriate time, we’ll have a chance to look at what they’ve negotiated and decide if that’s in the best interest of the project. But I’m comfortable if that’s something they want to move forward with we’ll find a way to work that out than take it to the Commission.

We think it’s going to be competitive over the long term. I know they believe that too, which is why they certainly want to stay in for as much as they think they’ll need.
So, I can’t speak for them, but I’d be surprised if they were looking to look out or to move this at some sort of fire sale price. It’s a valuable asset, but I think once the COLs are actually issued, will become even more valuable. So, we’ll look forward to that and see what we can do to help them. But in the meantime, our 55% need does not change. I’ve gotten that question a lot too. We remain committed to our 55%.

So, that’s essentially all been given back in an amortization now, so we brought that income in to offset the lack of the cash increase from the customers, so that was a wash. And the second one was the tax credits that we phased in over a two-year period, the EIZ tax credit, state investment credits.

So we’re working hard on that. We continue to work hard on that for the 2012 plan and I’m encouraged by the direction we’re headed. So I would think we can maintain the cost control as we move through this period until the economy takes a definitive direction up.

During today’s call, we will provide an update on our nuclear project and our recent hearing before the NRC. We will also discuss our results for the third quarter and our financial guidance for the balance of 2011 and for 2012. As you all know, Bill Timmerman announced his retirement earlier this year. He will be retiring at the end of November and I will be moving into my new role as CEO.
Bill and I have worked together for many years. He has and will continue to be a valuable resource for me personally and for the company. I am pleased to report that our transition is progressing as planned and I look forward to my new responsibilities. We continue to see significant industrial announcements in our service territory.
On slide three, we have provided an update of economic expansion announcements. This period was very impressive including a large expansion at the Bridgestone tire facility in Aiken County and a new continental tire operation in Sumter County. In total, announcement since July 1st suggest a creation of over 3000 new jobs with an investment of approximately $1.9 billion. This brings our year-to-date planned industrial investments to over $2.5 billion with more than 5,500 job additions.
In addition to industrial growth, we also continue to see customer growth in our residential and commercial categories. These are promising signs of economic recovery and we are excited to be positioned to provide clean, safe, reliable energy for the citizens and industries in South Carolina in the future.
Please turn to slide four. We’ve set forth our regulated returns and related filings. The chart at the top of the slide shows allowed returns at our three largest regulated subsidiaries as of June 30, 2011, the date of our most recent filing. The third quarter earned returned filings for our Electric and Gas businesses will be made in mid-December.
Our electric business earned 8.6%. The decrease from the previous filing was due primarily to the elimination of the second quarter of 2010, which was positively impacted by weather. You might recall beginning in the third quarter of 2010 we implemented a weather normalization mechanism, so our returns at the Electric business are no longer impacted by weather. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWFE or associated rate increases, as those allowances were handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.
As of June 30, 2011, our gas business at SCE&G was earning approximately 7.72%. This does not incorporate the recent 8.5 million rate increase, will effective in November of this year under the Rate Stabilization Act. This increase will restore the return to approximately 10.25%. And overall earned returns in the Gas business fall 50 basis points above or below our allowed return of 10.25%, we adjust rates through our annual Rate Stabilization filing.
Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well, and is earnings its allowed return principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. As you can see form timeline at the bottom of this slide, we have completed all of our - one of our plan regulatory filings for the year.
On slide five, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.8 million or approximately 2.4% to the retail electric rates of SCE&G. The new rates will be effective for bills rendered on or after October 30 of this year.
Our BLRA filings for 2011 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, on August 15th we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with a commission and office of regulatory staff for the second quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2011 on November 14th. I am pleased to report that our project for the two new units continues to be on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019, respectively.
Finally, SCE&G and Santee recently executed the permanent construction and operating agreements, which will govern and construction and operation of the new nuclear facilities. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have a primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the units and will be responsible for the operation of the units as they come on line.
I’ll now turn the call over to Stephen Byrne to discuss some other aspects of our nuclear project and environmental matters.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s licensing proceedings continued to progress towards a successful conclusion. Please focus on the blue section of the chart.
On October 13, we completed the uncontested mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. SCE&G believes it presented evidence that all requirements have been met to allow the NRC to issue the combined construction and operating license for V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3. We anticipate a decision from the NRC regarding our COL in the coming months.
Now if I can get you to focus on the green section of the chart related to the approval of the 81000 certified design, you see it as in the rule making process. The NRC has indicated that the full commission intends to act on the final certification by year end. This timeline continues to align with our expectation that we’ll receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012.
As Kevin mentioned, construction of the units is progressing on schedule and continues to support the units coming online in 2016 and 2019. As we have previously discussed earlier this year we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study. You might recall that this study related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the anticipated COL issuance of mid 2011 timeframe when we signed the EPC contract in 2008 to the current timeframe of late 2011 early 2012. This study is not in any way an indication that we are expecting additional delays in receipt of the COL.
This study provides for three scenarios. The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out the commercial operation date for Unit 2 by six months. The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2 and accelerating the date for Unit 3 in order to take advantages of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. By narrowing the gap between the units, it may be possible to create construction efficiencies by avoiding the demobilization and remobilization of crews as we progress from one unit to the next. SCE&G has been negotiations with the Shaw Westinghouse consortium to determine the preferred scenario. We do not anticipate a decision on the COL Delay study until later this year.
Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet. Please turn to slide number seven. We continue to evaluate the impact of alignment of regulations, particularly the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The rule requires states in the Eastern U.S. to reduce power plant emissions specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. At this time we still believe the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction or SCRs.
As you can see in the top of this chart on the slide 69% of our coal capacity already has scrubber and SCR technology. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched coal generation as these are our larger, more efficient plants. The charts at the bottom of the slide demonstrate our current and anticipated generation mix after the two new nuclear plants at V.C. Summer come online.
Our coal fleet composes slightly over 50% of our current generation mix. We anticipate that percentage to drop to 24% as we will rely less heavily on coal in the future. In anticipation of more regulation we will continue to pursue additional strategies and evaluate emissions reduction technologies to ensure that we are in compliance with all environmental regulations.
I will now turn the call over to Jimmy Addison.

Let’s start on slide eight which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate",1207,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. Let’s start on slide eight which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases which were partially offset by interest expense and share dilution.
On slide nine for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $2.25 per share unchanged from the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by the gas rate decrease under the rate stabilization act that was effective in November 2010, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with our internal target of $3.02 per share.
Now on slide 10, I’d like to review results by principle lines of business. SCE&G third quarter 2011 earnings denoted in blue were $0.05 per share higher than 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the base load review act were partially offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution. At September 30, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 665,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8% and 1.3% respectively over the same date in 2010. The PSNC energy in red reported the seasonal loss of $0.03 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the prior year. Increased margin from customer growth of approximately 1.7% was slightly offset by depreciation and property taxes.
SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. The $0.01 change is driven by lower margins which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers as of September 30. SCANA Energy along with three other marketers entered the bid process to service the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming term of September 2012 through August 2014. The commission is scheduled to make a selection in February 2012. SCANA Energy has served as a regulator provider since 2002. SCANA’s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share during the third quarter of 2010. The results for 2011 reflect higher income taxes at the holding company during the quarter due to levelizing the effective tax rate as required by accounting standards.
Slides 11 and 12 show our electric and gas sales statistics. These numbers have not been weather normalized. Recall that our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalize margin but obviously not unit sales. Retail sales of electricity are down 1.5% for the quarter due to lower residential and commercial sales primarily as a result of milder weather this year, partially offset by higher industrial sales. Retail sales of natural gas showed a decrease of 1.8% for the quarter. While the residential and commercial categories showed improvement, industrial gas usage declined slightly when compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower sales for power generation in the current quarter, again driven by milder weather.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on slide 13. Our 2012 preliminary guidance is $3.05 to $3.25 per share and our internal target is $3.17. This guidance assumes known industrial expansion and continued customer growth at recent levels. While we anticipate the number of customers will increase our assumption of usage per customer is slightly lower reflecting continued energy efficiency and the economy in general.
As it relates to expenses, operations and maintenance expense is expected to remain relatively flat with modest growth related to CapEx expansion in property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and dilution. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings and the RSA and the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies.
These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing down the remainder of the equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012 and postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution in next year, as I’ll discuss in more detail when I cover our financing plan shortly.
As Steve mentioned earlier, we are still making a decision on the COL delay study. Our guidance is necessarily broader than normal to accommodate the range of potential outcomes he discussed. Once the decision on the study is finalized we will update you and provide information about how the decision impacts our guidance range, capital forecast, and financing plan.
While we continue to see some signs of a longer term economic recovery, the signals are mixed. As a result, we remain conservative in our estimates and cautiously optimistic about our longer terms sustain recovery. We reaffirm our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the next three to five years based on the 2010 weather-normalized base of 292.
Slide 14 presents our preliminary CapEx forecast. The estimates for 2012 and ‘13 are slightly less than the forecast represented a year ago. As you can see from the slide, our new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our total capital spending over the next three years.
Now please turn to slide 15. This slide represents our estimated financing plan through 2014. We anticipate completing two debt refinancings in 2012 and ‘13. Our only planned issuances of new debt will be at SCE&G to support our new nuclear construction. Regarding equity, we intend to continue to issue shares through our 401(k) and DRIP programs, yielding approximately $100 million per year.
As mentioned in previous calls, we have adapted two tax strategies which have provided additional cash flow. These are bonus deprecation and the election to deduct repairs expense as opposed to capitalizing those costs. Because of the cash benefits we have seen from these strategies we planned to extend the May 2010 equity forward and postpone drawing the remaining funds and to the fourth quarter of 2012. We are working with the forward counterparties on the extension and expect to have it completed shortly.
Our previous financing plan included an additional equity offering of $150 million in 2012, while our updated plans postpone this issuance until 2013. As a result, our 2012 plan is lower than previously announced while our 2013 plan has increased. We continued to evaluate our financing plan and develop strategies which align our debt and equity issuances with our cash needs for construction. This isn’t a change in our overall strategy of financing the project 50/50 with debt and equity, but rather simply an adjustment in the execution to match previously unexpected cash flows. We’re very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has offered us during this period.
In summary, we are pleased with our quarterly results and confident in our guidance for both 2011 and 2012.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.

So that’s really not a consideration.
So, really for us the considerations are the schedule and the cost implications of that schedule and then probably secondarily then is our desire to try to keep the trained workforce onsite actively engaged as long as we can and that’s why in the third scenario that we are looking at which is really a compression of the schedules. We will allow the first new unit to be deferred for six months, but we’ll bring the second new unit up earlier and that way we should avoid some of the demobilization/remobilization. So we’ll keep that workforce more actively engaged and so the discussions we are having with the consortium now are how we value that versus how they value that and that’s with the negotiations.

So whatever they come up, well, that would be applicable to the entire fleet in the United States would also be applicable to our new units.

Certainly the issue that’s gotten a lot of attention is the Boeing situation where they’ve got their plant contemplated, not just contemplated, but up and running and they got plants moving through the facility at this point, and I believe the first plants do out of there early next year. So, there are big issues there. I certainly can’t give the little aspect of their case. But generally, the complaints are centered around whether or not they unduly penalize the unions in Washington by expanding the plant down here. But it’s my understanding that the union workforce was not reduced in Washington.
I think it was slightly increased and this was addition to their facilities, not just a movement of the existing line from there - from operations out there. So, there’ll be a lot of debate about that. I am sure it’ll go through the legal process. But the reality is we got a plant down here. There has been a tremendous impact of a state. Thousands of people have found employment. I think there’ll other companies that come in around to support their operations. And personally I think it’d be difficult to try to shut it down and send all those people home, which I believe is what - I believe more to have happened. But I won’t - somehow as well take place, but that’s really the challenge at hand and what we have got as a plant it is working well and employing a lot of people in a state that’s go ahead to have them and others are coming to join them.

There probably would be an impact on CapEx through, I don’t think this is significant impact. Because, as I pointed out earlier, the first let’s say six to eight months of work in the excavation that we’re now allowed to do, once we receive the COL would be the same under any of the scenarios. There may be some more work done outside of the excavation under the first scenario where we try to keep the commercial operation take the same. But we will have a significant amount of work going on really irregardless of which of those scenarios we chose.
For example, we are going to be assembling modules from subcomponents that come in to decide in a very large building. That work will continue, that’s probably almost years worth of work on the two largest modules. We will continue to assemble the lower bowl assembly for the containment vessel and then the rings once we get the plate steel in for the rings, that work it really will continue irregardless as to which of the options we chose. And then we got some other things to decide that we’re trying to complete water intake, water outfall, cooling tower work that work will all continue and we’re trying to build a water treatment facility that eventually will supply our existing and the two new units and that work will continue. So we got a significant amount of work to do in 2012 really irregardless of the scenario we pick.

During today's call, we will provide an update on our nuclear project and our recent hearing before the NRC. We will also discuss our results for the third quarter and our financial guidance for the balance of 2011 and for 2012. As you all know, Bill Timmerman announced his retirement earlier this year. He will be retiring at the end of November and I will be moving into my new role as CEO.
Bill and I have worked together for many years. He has and will continue to be a valuable resource for me personally and for the company. I am pleased to report that our transition is progressing as planned and I look forward to my new responsibilities. We continue to see significant industrial announcements in our service territory.
On Slide 3, we have provided an update of economic expansion announcements. This period was very impressive including a large expansion at the Bridgestone tire facility in Aiken County and a new Continental Tire operation in Sumter County. In total, announcements since July 1st suggest a creation of over 3,000 new jobs with an investment of approximately $1.9 billion. This brings our year-to-date planned industrial investments to over $2.5 billion with more than 5,500 job additions.
In addition to industrial growth, we also continue to see customer growth in our residential and commercial categories. These are promising signs of economic recovery and we are excited to be positioned to provide clean, safe, reliable energy for the citizens and industries of South Carolina in the future.
Please turn to Slide 4, which sets forth our regulated returns and related filings. The chart at the top of the slide shows earned returns at our 3 largest regulated subsidiaries as of June 30, 2011, the date of our most recent filing. The third quarter earned returned filings for our Electric and Gas businesses will be made in mid-December.
Our electric business earned 8.6%. The decrease from the previous filing was due primarily to the elimination of the second quarter of 2010, which was positively impacted by weather. You might recall that beginning in the third quarter of 2010 we implemented a weather normalization mechanism, so our returns at the Electric business are no longer impacted by weather. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWIP or associated rate increases, as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.
As of June 30, 2011, our gas business at SCE&G was earning approximately 7.72%. This does not incorporate the recent 8.5 million rate increase that will effective in November of this year under the Rate Stabilization Act. This increase will restore the return to approximately 10.25%. Whenever our earned returns in the Gas business fall 50 basis points above or below our allowed return of 10.25%, we adjust rates through our annual Rate Stabilization filing.
Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well, and is earning its allowed return principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. As you can see from the timeline at the bottom of this slide, we have completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings for the year.
On Slide 5, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.8 million or approximately 2.4% to the retail electric rates of SCE&G. The new rates will be effective for bills rendered on or after October 30 of this year.
Our BLRA filings for 2011 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, on August 15th we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2011 on November 14th. I am pleased to report that our project for the 2 new units continues to be on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019, respectively.
Finally, SCE&G and Santee recently executed the permanent construction and operating agreements, which will govern the construction and operation of the new nuclear facilities. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the units and will be responsible for the operation of the units as they come online.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Byrne to discuss some other aspects of our nuclear project and environmental matters."

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's licensing proceedings continued to progress towards a successful conclusion. Please focus on the blue section of the chart.
On October 13, we completed the uncontested mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. SCE&G believes it presented evidence that all requirements have been met to allow the NRC to issue the combined construction and operating license for V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3. We anticipate a decision from the NRC regarding our COL in the coming months.
Now if I can get you to focus on the green section of the chart related to the approval of the AP1000 certified design, you see it is in the rulemaking process. The NRC has indicated that the full commission intends to act on the final certification by year end. This timeline continues to align with our expectation that we will receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012.
As Kevin mentioned, construction of the units is progressing on schedule and continues to support the units coming online in 2016 and 2019. As we have previously discussed earlier this year we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study. You might recall that this study related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the anticipated COL issuance of mid-2011 timeframe when we signed the EPC contract in 2008 to the current timeframe of late 2011, early 2012. This study is not in any way an indication that we are expecting additional delays in receipt of the COL.
This study provides for 3 scenarios. The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out the commercial operation date for Unit 2 by 6 months. The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2 and accelerating the date for Unit 3 in order to take advantages of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. By narrowing the gap between the units, it may be possible to create construction efficiencies by avoiding the demobilization and remobilization of crews as we progress from one unit to the next. SCE&G is in negotiations with the Shaw/Westinghouse consortium to determine the preferred scenario. We do not anticipate a decision on the COL delay study until later this year.
Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet. Please turn to slide number 7. We continue to evaluate the impact of environmental regulations, particularly the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The rule requires states in the Eastern U.S. to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. At this time we still believe the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction, or SCRs.
As you can see in the top of this chart on the slide, 69% of our coal capacity already has scrubber and SCR technology. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched coal generation as these are our larger, more efficient plants. The charts at the bottom of this slide demonstrate our current and anticipated generation mix after the 2 new nuclear plants at V.C. Summer come online.
While our coal fleet composes slightly over 50% of our current generation mix, we anticipate that percentage to drop to 24% as we will rely less heavily on coal in the future.

Let's start on Slide 8, which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate incre",1207,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. Let's start on Slide 8, which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases, which were partially offset by interest expense and share dilution.
On Slide 9, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $2.25 per share, unchanged from the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by the gas rate decrease under the rate stabilization act that was effective in November 2010, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, with our internal target of $3.02 per share.
Now on Slide 10, I'd like to review results by principle lines of business. SCE&G's third quarter 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were $0.05 per share higher than 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were partially offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution. At September 30, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 665,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8% and 1.3% respectively over the same date in 2010. PSNC energy, in red, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the prior year. Increased margin from customer growth of approximately 1.7% was slightly offset by depreciation and property taxes.
SCANA Energy, in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. The $0.01 change is driven by lower margins which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers as of September 30. SCANA Energy, along with 3 other marketers, entered the bid process to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming term of September 2012 through August 2014. The commission is scheduled to make a selection in February 2012. SCANA Energy has served as the regulator provider since 2002. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share during the third quarter of 2010. The results for 2011 reflect higher income taxes at the holding company during the quarter due to levelizing the effective tax rate as required by accounting standards.
Slides 11 and 12 show our electric and gas sales statistics. These numbers have not been weather normalized. Recall that our WNA and Cut mechanisms normalize margin but obviously not unit sales. Retail sales of electricity are down 1.5% for the quarter due to lower residential and commercial sales, primarily as a result of milder weather this year, partially offset by higher industrial sales. Retail sales of natural gas showed a decrease of 1.8% for the quarter. While the residential and commercial categories showed improvement, industrial gas usage declined slightly when compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower sales for power generation in the current quarter, again driven by milder weather.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 13. Our 2012 preliminary guidance is $3.05 to $3.25 per share and our internal target is $3.17. This guidance assumes known industrial expansion and continued customer growth at recent levels. While we anticipate the number of customers will increase, our assumption of usage per customer is slightly lower, reflecting continued energy efficiency and the economy in general.
As it relates to expenses, operations and maintenance expense is expected to remain relatively flat with modest growth related to CapEx expansion in property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and dilution. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings and the RSA and the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies.
These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing down the remainder of the equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012 and postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution in --next year, as I'll discuss in more detail when I cover our financing plan shortly.
As Steve mentioned earlier, we are still making a decision on the COL delay study. Our guidance is necessarily broader than normal to accommodate the range of potential outcomes he discussed. Once a decision on the study is finalized we will update you and provide information about how the decision impacts our guidance range, capital forecast, and financing plan.
While we continue to see some signs of a longer term economic recovery, the signals are mixed. As a result, we remain conservative in our estimates and cautiously optimistic about our longer term sustained recovery. We reaffirm our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years based on the 2010 weather-normalized base of 292.
Slide 14 presents our preliminary CapEx forecast. The estimates for 2012 and '13 are slightly less than the forecast we presented a year ago. As you can see from the slide, our new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our total capital spending over the next 3 years.
Now please turn to Slide 15. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. We anticipate completing 2 debt refinancings in 2012 and '13. Our only planned issuances of new debt will be at SCE&G to support our new nuclear construction. Regarding equity, we intend to continue to issue shares through our 401(k) and DRIP programs, yielding approximately $100 million per year.
As mentioned in previous calls, we have adopted 2 tax strategies which have provided additional cash flow. These are bonus deprecation and the election to deduct repairs expense as opposed to capitalizing those costs. Because of the cash benefits we have seen from these strategies, we plan to extend the May 2010 equity forward and postpone drawing the remaining funds until the fourth quarter of 2012. We are working with the forward counterparties on the extension and expect to have it completed shortly.
Our previous financing plan included an additional equity offering of $150 million in 2012, while our updated plans postpone this issuance until 2013. As a result, our 2012 plan is lower than previously announced, while our 2013 plan has increased. We continued to evaluate our financing plan and develop strategies which align our debt and equity issuances with our cash needs for construction. This isn't a change in our overall strategy of financing the project 50/50 with debt and equity, but rather simply an adjustment in the execution to match previously unexpected cash flows. We're very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has offered us during this period.
In summary, we are pleased with our quarterly results and confident in our guidance for both 2011 and 2012.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

First of all, the supply chain really has not entered into the -- any of the gating factors.

So our expectation is that all of the components that are being manufactured will continue on their current manufacturing schedule and we've got plenty of room onsite to store large components should they come in. So that's really not a consideration.
So, really for us the considerations are the schedule and the cost implications of that schedule and then probably secondarily then, is our desire to try to keep the trained workforce onsite actively engaged as long as we can. And that's why in the third scenario that we are looking at, which is really a compression of the schedules, we will allow the first new unit to be deferred for 6 months, but we'll bring the second new unit up earlier. And that way, we should avoid some of the demobilization/remobilization. So we'll keep that workforce more actively engaged and so the discussions we are having with the consortium now are how we value that versus how they value that and that's within the negotiations."

We have labor supplies and traditionally South Carolina was a right to work state. I think we're less than 5% unionized in the state, a reason people are looking at us. Certainly the issue that's gotten a lot of attention is the Boeing situation where they've got their plant contemplated, not just contemplated, but up and running and they got planes moving through the facility at this point, and I believe the first plane's due out of there early next year. So, there are big issues there. I certainly can't give you the legal aspects of their case. But generally, the complaints are centered around whether or not they unduly penalize the unions in Washington by expanding the plant down here. But it's my understanding that the union workforce was not reduced in Washington.
I think it was slightly increased and this was addition to their facilities, not just a movement of the existing line from there -- from operations out there. So, there'll be a lot of debate about that. I am sure it'll go through the legal process. But the reality is we got a plant down here that has been a tremendous impact to a state. Thousands of people have found employment. I think there'll be other companies that come in around it to support their operations. And personally I think it'd be difficult to try to shut it down and send all those people home, which I believe is what the NLRB maybe want to have happened. But I won't surmise what will take place, but that's really the challenge at hand and what we have got is a plant that is working well and employing a lot of people in a state that's glad to have them and others are coming to join them."

Toshiba largely had not started their work yet, IHI had actually delivered us plate steel in December.
We got word from both of the vendors that our components that were on site were undamaged. For example, we had some plate steel onsite at IHI, that they were prepping to send us for the ring segment of the containment vessel, that was undamaged, and that their facilities were largely undamaged. They did have some minor things that they had to correct. Their bigger issue was with the rolling blackouts. Both of the vendors were in the Tokyo area.

For example, we are going to be assembling modules from subcomponents that come in to the site in a very large building.

During today's call, we will provide an update on our nuclear project and our recent hearing before the NRC. We will also discuss our results for the third quarter and our financial guidance for the balance of 2011 and for 2012. As you all know, Bill Timmerman announced his retirement earlier this year. He will be retiring at the end of November and I will be moving into my new role as CEO.
Bill and I have worked together for many years. He has and will continue to be a valuable resource for me personally and for the company. I am pleased to report that our transition is progressing as planned and I look forward to my new responsibilities. We continue to see significant industrial announcements in our service territory.
On Slide 3, we have provided an update of economic expansion announcements. This period was very impressive including a large expansion at the Bridgestone tire facility in Aiken County and a new Continental Tire operation in Sumter County. In total, announcements since July 1st suggest a creation of over 3,000 new jobs with an investment of approximately $1.9 billion. This brings our year-to-date planned industrial investments to over $2.5 billion with more than 5,500 job additions.
In addition to industrial growth, we also continue to see customer growth in our residential and commercial categories. These are promising signs of economic recovery and we are excited to be positioned to provide clean, safe, reliable energy for the citizens and industries of South Carolina in the future.
Please turn to Slide 4, which sets forth our regulated returns and related filings. The chart at the top of the slide shows earned returns at our 3 largest regulated subsidiaries as of June 30, 2011, the date of our most recent filing. The third quarter earned returned filings for our Electric and Gas businesses will be made in mid-December.
Our electric business earned 8.6%. The decrease from the previous filing was due primarily to the elimination of the second quarter of 2010, which was positively impacted by weather. You might recall that beginning in the third quarter of 2010 we implemented a weather normalization mechanism, so our returns at the Electric business are no longer impacted by weather. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWIP or associated rate increases, as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.
As of June 30, 2011, our gas business at SCE&G was earning approximately 7.72%. This does not incorporate the recent 8.5 million rate increase that will effective in November of this year under the Rate Stabilization Act. This increase will restore the return to approximately 10.25%. Whenever our earned returns in the Gas business fall 50 basis points above or below our allowed return of 10.25%, we adjust rates through our annual Rate Stabilization filing.
Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well, and is earning its allowed return principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. As you can see from the timeline at the bottom of this slide, we have completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings for the year.
On Slide 5, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.8 million or approximately 2.4% to the retail electric rates of SCE&G. The new rates will be effective for bills rendered on or after October 30 of this year.
Our BLRA filings for 2011 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, on August 15th we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2011 on November 14th. I am pleased to report that our project for the 2 new units continues to be on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019, respectively.
Finally, SCE&G and Santee recently executed the permanent construction and operating agreements, which will govern the construction and operation of the new nuclear facilities. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the units and will be responsible for the operation of the units as they come online.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Byrne to discuss some other aspects of our nuclear project and environmental matters."

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's licensing proceedings continued to progress towards a successful conclusion. Please focus on the blue section of the chart.
On October 13, we completed the uncontested mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. SCE&G believes it presented evidence that all requirements have been met to allow the NRC to issue the combined construction and operating license for V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3. We anticipate a decision from the NRC regarding our COL in the coming months.
Now if I can get you to focus on the green section of the chart related to the approval of the AP1000 certified design, you see it is in the rulemaking process. The NRC has indicated that the full commission intends to act on the final certification by year end. This timeline continues to align with our expectation that we will receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012.
As Kevin mentioned, construction of the units is progressing on schedule and continues to support the units coming online in 2016 and 2019. As we have previously discussed earlier this year we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study. You might recall that this study related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the anticipated COL issuance of mid-2011 timeframe when we signed the EPC contract in 2008 to the current timeframe of late 2011, early 2012. This study is not in any way an indication that we are expecting additional delays in receipt of the COL.
This study provides for 3 scenarios. The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out the commercial operation date for Unit 2 by 6 months. The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2 and accelerating the date for Unit 3 in order to take advantages of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. By narrowing the gap between the units, it may be possible to create construction efficiencies by avoiding the demobilization and remobilization of crews as we progress from one unit to the next. SCE&G is in negotiations with the Shaw/Westinghouse consortium to determine the preferred scenario. We do not anticipate a decision on the COL delay study until later this year.
Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet. Please turn to slide number 7. We continue to evaluate the impact of environmental regulations, particularly the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The rule requires states in the Eastern U.S. to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. At this time we still believe the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction, or SCRs.
As you can see in the top of this chart on the slide, 69% of our coal capacity already has scrubber and SCR technology. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched coal generation as these are our larger, more efficient plants. The charts at the bottom of this slide demonstrate our current and anticipated generation mix after the 2 new nuclear plants at V.C. Summer come online.
While our coal fleet composes slightly over 50% of our current generation mix, we anticipate that percentage to drop to 24% as we will rely less heavily on coal in the future. In anticipation of more regulation, we will continue to pursue additional strategies and evaluate emissions reduction technologies to ensure that we are in compliance with all environmental regulations.
I will now turn the call over to Jimmy Addison."

Let's start on Slide 8, which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases, which were partially offset by interest expense and share dilution.
On Slide 9, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $2.25 per share, unchanged from the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by the gas rate decrease under the rate stabilization act that was effective in November 2010, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, with our internal target of $3.02 per share.
Now on Slide 10, I'd like to review results by principle lines of business. SCE&G's third quarter 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were $0.05 per share higher than 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were partially offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution. At September 30, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 665,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8% and 1.3% respectively over the same date in 2010. PSNC energy, in red, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the prior year. Increased margin from customer growth of approximately 1.7% was slightly offset by depreciation and property taxes.
SCANA Energy, in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. The $0.01 change is driven by lower margins which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers as of September 30. SCANA Energy, along with 3 other marketers, entered the bid process to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming term of September 2012 through August 2014. The commission is scheduled to make a selection in February 2012. SCANA Energy has served as the regulator provider since 2002. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share during the third quarter of 2010. The results for 2011 reflect higher income taxes at the holding company during the quarter due to levelizing the effective tax rate as required by accounting standards.
Slides 11 and 12 show our electric and gas sales statistics. These numbers have not been weather normalized. Recall that our WNA and Cut mechanisms normalize margin but obviously not unit sales. Retail sales of electricity are down 1.5% for the quarter due to lower residential and commercial sales, primarily as a result of milder weather this year, partially offset by higher industrial sales. Retail sales of natural gas showed a decrease of 1.8% for the quarter. While the residential and commercial categories showed improvement, industrial gas usage declined slightly when compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower sales for power generation in the current quarter, again driven by milder weather.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 13. Our 2012 preliminary guidance is $3.05 to $3.25 per share and our internal target is $3.17. This guidance assumes known industrial expansion and continued customer growth at recent levels. While we anticipate the number of customers will increase, our assumption of usage per customer is slightly lower, reflecting continued energy efficiency and the economy in general.
As it relates to expenses, operations and maintenance expense is expected to remain relatively flat with modest growth related to CapEx expansion in property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and dilution. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings and the RSA and the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies. These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing down the remainder of the equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012 and postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution in --next year, as I'll discuss in more detail when I cover our financing plan shortly.
As Steve mentioned earlier, we are still making a decision on the COL delay study. Our guidance is necessarily broader than normal to accommodate the range of potential outcomes he discussed. Once a decision on the study is finalized we will update you and provide information about how the decision impacts our guidance range, capital forecast, and financing plan.
While we continue to see some signs of a longer term economic recovery, the signals are mixed. As a result, we remain conservative in our estimates and cautiously optimistic about our longer term sustained recovery. We reaffirm our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years based on the 2010 weather-normalized base of 292.
Slide 14 presents our preliminary CapEx forecast. The estimates for 2012 and '13 are slightly less than the forecast we presented a year ago. As you can see from the slide, our new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our total capital spending over the next 3 years.
Now please turn to Slide 15. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. We anticipate completing 2 debt refinancings in 2012 and '13. Our only planned issuances of new debt will be at SCE&G to support our new nuclear construction. Regarding equity, we intend to continue to issue shares through our 401(k) and DRIP programs, yielding approximately $100 million per year.
As mentioned in previous calls, we have adopted 2 tax strategies which have provided additional cash flow. These are bonus deprecation and the election to deduct repairs expense as opposed to capitalizing those costs. Because of the cash benefits we have seen from these strategies, we plan to extend the May 2010 equity forward and postpone drawing the remaining funds until the fourth quarter of 2012. We are working with the forward counterparties on the extension and expect to have it completed shortly.
Our previous financing plan included an additional equity offering of $150 million in 2012, while our updated plans postpone this issuance until 2013. As a result, our 2012 plan is lower than previously announced, while our 2013 plan has increased. We continued to evaluate our financing plan and develop strategies which align our debt and equity issuances with our cash needs for construction. This isn't a change in our overall strategy of financing the project 50/50 with debt and equity, but rather simply an adjustment in the execution to match previously unexpected cash flows. We're very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has offered us during this period.
In summary, we are pleased with our quarterly results and confident in our guidance for both 2011 and 2012.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

So that's really not a consideration.
So, really for us the considerations are the schedule and the cost implications of that schedule and then probably secondarily then, is our desire to try to keep the trained workforce onsite actively engaged as long as we can. And that's why in the third scenario that we are looking at, which is really a compression of the schedules, we will allow the first new unit to be deferred for 6 months, but we'll bring the second new unit up earlier. And that way, we should avoid some of the demobilization/remobilization. So we'll keep that workforce more actively engaged and so the discussions we are having with the consortium now are how we value that versus how they value that and that's within the negotiations."

We've got a lot of work to do, preparation-wise. Beyond that, I think the outcomes from Fukushima -- now the AP1000 units were really designed to handle the kind of station blackout that they had over at Fukushima. So, that's one reason I think, why the NRC, in their internal review that they put out about 90 days afterwards, said that they would support the continued licensing of 2 designs, and the AP1000 was one of those designs. So we're heartened by that. I do think that the AP1000 design will handle Fukushima type of issues. But that being said, it could be that we get some impact from a Fukushima-related issue. I don't think that, that will delay licensing at all, and again, I think the plan is a solid plan. So whatever they come up with that would be applicable to the entire fleet in the United States would also be applicable to our new units."

We have labor supplies and traditionally South Carolina was a right to work state. I think we're less than 5% unionized in the state, a reason people are looking at us. Certainly the issue that's gotten a lot of attention is the Boeing situation where they've got their plant contemplated, not just contemplated, but up and running and they got planes moving through the facility at this point, and I believe the first plane's due out of there early next year. So, there are big issues there. I certainly can't give you the legal aspects of their case. But generally, the complaints are centered around whether or not they unduly penalize the unions in Washington by expanding the plant down here. But it's my understanding that the union workforce was not reduced in Washington. I think it was slightly increased and this was addition to their facilities, not just a movement of the existing line from there -- from operations out there. So, there'll be a lot of debate about that. I am sure it'll go through the legal process. But the reality is we got a plant down here that has been a tremendous impact to the state. Thousands of people have found employment. I think there'll be other companies that come in around it to support their operations. And personally I think it'd be difficult to try to shut it down and send all those people home, which I believe is what the NLRB maybe want to have happened. But I won't surmise what will take place, but that's really the challenge at hand and what we have got is a plant that is working well and employing a lot of people in a state that's glad to have them and others are coming to join them."

I would like to welcome each of you to our call also. Let's start on slide three which reflects SCANA's 2011 Q1 basic earnings per share of $1 compared to $1.02 per share in 2010.

Let's start on slide three which reflects SCANA's 2011 Q1 basic earnings per share of $1 compared to $1.02 per share in 2010. The decline in earnings was primarily attributable to weather in our Georgia market of natural gas rates stabilization act, decrease in South Carolina, higher depreciation and share dilution; all of which offset improved margins from electric based rate increases. We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guide of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with an internal target of $3.02. 
 
 
Additionally, with more than 90% of our earnings weather normalized I thought it might be helpful for you to understand our view of our annual earnings plan by quarter. In our annual forecast we see this distribution as approximately 30% in both Q1 and Q4, 25% in Q3 and the remaining 15% in Q2. Hopefully this will be helpful in the quarterly distribution within your models. I caution you to consider the combination of this quarterly distribution and our annual guidance in updating your models if you choose to use it at all. 
 
 
Now on slide four I'd like to review results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G's Q1 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $.04 compared to 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the base load review act and the mid-2010 retail electric rate case offset the lower gas margins from the RSA rate decrease and the higher capital related costs of depreciation, property taxes and interest. 
 
 
As you may recall, in Q1 of 2010, we deferred for refund $25 million related to incremental margin from unusually cold weather as part of the implementation of our pilot electric weather normalization mechanism. This program applies to residential and commercial electric customers and was fully implemented in August 2010. The 2010 deferral had the effect of weather normalizing Q1, therefore there is no weather variance at the SCE&G. 
 
 
At March 31, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 663,000 electric customers and approximately 315,000 natural gas customers; up .6% and .9% respectively over the same date in 2010. 
 
 
PS&C Energy's earnings for Q1 2011, in red, were $.25 per share unchanged from Q1 of 2010. Increases in margin from customer growth of 1.4% were offset by higher interest expense. As with SCE&G, no wonder variance is seen at PS&C due to the customer usage tracker or decoupling mechanism. SCANA Energy in grain reported earnings of $.17 during the quarter compared to $.24 in the prior year. The $.07 per share decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to weather. The colder than normal weather in Q1 2010 contributed $.09 to earnings as compared to about $.02 from colder than normal weather in 2011. Said another way, although Q1 of 2011 was cold, it was not nearly as cold as Q1 of 2010. 
 
 
SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers as of March 31, 2011. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $.03 per share in Q1 of 2011 compared to $.02 per share in the same quarter last year. 
 
 
Slide five shows our electric and gas sales statistics. Unit sales of electricity and natural gas to our retail customers in Q1 of 2011 were down over the prior year driven by weather related decreases in our residential and commercial classes. Of course our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalized margin and not unit sales. The industrial sector continued the train of recovery with an increase in both electric and gas sales. 
 
 
On slide six you can see an update of economic growth announcements during Q1 of 2011. These recent announcements suggest the creation of more than 1800 new jobs with an investment of more than $600 million and are a continuing sign of a longer-term economic recovery in our service territory. 
 
 
As you can see on slide seven, we expect to complete our debt financings for 2011 next month. As it relates to our cash position the final ROS rules for 2011 bonus depreciation were issued in March. These final rules are consistent with the method we used to originally estimate cash will be generated from bonus depreciation as discussed during our February call. In addition to bonus depreciation we continue to recognize a cash benefit and the method being used to account for capital maintenance, which results in certain maintenance costs being treated as current expenses for income tax purposes. Combined, we expect these strategies to generate over $60 million in cash benefit. Accordingly, we do not expect to draw the remaining funds under our May 2010 equity forward until early 2012, which will mitigate dilution. 
 
 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh."

I would like to direct your attention first to slide 8. As most of you are aware, the United States environmental protection agency issued a proposed rule on March 16th, 2011 which would provide the first national standards for emissions of mercury, arsenic and other pollutants from coal and oil fired power plants. We will review the proposed rules to better understand any potential impact on our operations. The proposed rule must first be published under federal register, then undergo a 60-day comment period and the EPA will also hold three public meetings. Based upon the comments received, the EPA may make changes to the proposal before it is finalized, as early as November 6th, 2011. SCANA is committed to being a good steward of the environment and to meeting all the requirements set by state and federal regulators regarding power plant emissions. After the final rule is available, we will develop a compliant strategy based on the requirements of the rule, compliant time frames and the estimated cost of various options for compliance. 
 
 
Since the mid 1990s we have spent nearly a billion dollars installing environmental equipment in our fossil plants including, most recently, an SER at our Coat facility and [indiscernible] and William Station plants. That equipment has significantly reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and mercury on our system. 
 
 
Let me turn now to our new nuclear project activities. On slide nine I'm very pleased to report that our project for two new units remains on budget and on schedule for 2016 and 2019 respectively. As you may recall, on November 15th, 2010, we filed a petition with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking approval to update the capital cost schedules for the construction of the company's new nuclear units. This filing was necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court last year, which found that general contingency costs should not be included in forecast approved under the Base Load Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use contingency fund is identified and itemized in specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval. 
 
 
The November 2010 filing identified and itemized certain capital costs of approximately $174 million that will be incurred during the construction of the new nuclear unit. These are not additional costs nor is this an additional quest to raise customer rates. We're simply specifying how we intend to use some of the dollars that were originally included in the contingency fund in our initial BLRA filing now that we have more clarity of the construction outlook. The hearing on this request was held on April 4th and we anticipate receiving permission order in May. After receiving the order, any approved capital costs already incurred will be added to those included in our revised rates filing under BLRA to determine the requested rate adjustment for 2011. 
 
 
Please turn to slide ten. On February 14, 2011 we filed our quarterly status report with the CFC and the Office Of Regulatory Staff for Q4 of 2010 as required under our Base Load Review order. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. Additionally, we intend to file our quarterly status report for Q1 2011 on Monday, May 16th and our annual request for revised rate under the Base Load Review Act on Friday, May 27th. The remaining dates on this slide represent other regulatory filings we anticipate making later this year. We are pleased with the progress of the projects and the continued regulatory support that we have received. 
 
 
We believe that nuclear power is a clean non-invading source of energy, which will position South Carolina well in the future, particularly as environmental regulations surrounding greenhouse gases and coal increase. 
 
 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Byrne who will discuss our COL application and provide and update on the status of our nuclear construction project."
188244,129583905,2468960,"SCANA Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","SCANA Corporation","Executives","Thank you Kevin. Please turn to slide 11. The nuclear regulatory commissions' licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. We continue to anticipate receiving our combined operating license or COL in late 2011 or early 2012.",689,"Thank you Kevin. Please turn to slide 11. The nuclear regulatory commissions' licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. We continue to anticipate receiving our combined operating license or COL in late 2011 or early 2012. The COL during impact study referenced in the most recent BLRA filing was initiated by SCE&G in December of 2010. This detailed study is an evaluation of the alternatives for optimizing the construction schedule to make up the anticipated delay beyond the original construction schedule for the first under the EPC contract which assumed the COL would be issued in mid-2011 rather than our current expectation. 
 
 
Construction schedules generally can be adjusted by adding shifts of construction workers working weekends, undertaking scopes of work in parallel instead of in series and similar changes in the construction plan. SCE&G is involved in the ongoing oversight of the study and will review the results and any cost associated with compressing the schedule using such techniques. While the situation is dynamic, we anticipate that this study will be completed by the end of Q2. SCE&G continues to believe that the commercial operation date for the first will fall within the schedule approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission including the allowable schedule contingencies. There should be no adverse impact on the commercial operation date for the second meeting. 
 
 
In late 2010 the NRC staff completed its technical review of the current AP1000 design for the shield building as well as other design changes proposed by Westinghouse and issued a favorable comprehensive advanced safety evaluation report for the units. The advisory committee on reactive safeguards, an independent panel of advisors in NRC also reviewed and recommended the AP1000 design and related changes and has determined that the current design is fully adequate to protect the public health and safety. 
 
 
We received our final environmental impact statement last week and we anticipate receiving the final safety evaluation report this summer. We believe the NRC will conduct a mandatory hearing in the fall this year. I'd like to point out that there will be no contested hearing as all interveners challenges to SCE&G COL application have been denied by both the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. After mandatory hearing is complete, the NRC will make the decision regarding issuance of our COL. 
 
 
As you see from the aerial photo on slide 12, we continue to proceed with pre-construction activity to the site and continue to receive parts on site in preparation for constructing. After we receive the COL, we will begin so called Nuclear Construction of the unit. I'd like to point out that while we do not foresee a delay on the COL beyond late 2011 or early 2012, we are evaluating contingency plans for that scenario. There's a great deal of work that can be done on the unit prior to receipt of the COL. For example, the two largest modules, CA01 and CA20 can be constructed simultaneously in the module assembly building and then moved into the excavation site once we receive the COL. In the unlikely event that we might receive the COL in late 2011 or early 2012 as we expect, we feel confident that we will be able to optimize our construction schedule for critical path items to reduce any significant impact to our in-service dates. 
 
 
Finally I would like to briefly touch on the supply chain. As you may know, our turbine generators and steel plating for the containment vessels are being manufactured in Japan. While these components represent less than 15% of the total project cost, they are long lead-time components. Our suppliers in Japan have assured us that they suffered minimal damage as a result of the natural disaster. The biggest challenge these suppliers continue to face is related to their electric power supply. Japan continues to have rolling blackouts so they are not able to operate at full capacity. However, we do not anticipate significant delays in our construction due to these supply issues. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, we'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

First let me tell you that I think that it's probably a little early for us to start talking about the lessons learned.

First let me tell you that I think that it's probably a little early for us to start talking about the lessons learned. The nuclear regulatory commission has, in process, a lessons learned review that they'll be reporting out and it's a 90 day review and they'll be reporting out at 30, 60 and 90 days. And I think May 12th is the advertised date for that first report out from that 30-day review. Beyond that what the NRC is doing is they're putting in place a taskforce to do a more in-depth review and that taskforce, I believe it's been selected, once it starts its work it's about a six month working time frame. So I think that will probably put us somewhere near the end of this year. And that taskforce will then report out. So the NRC has a couple lessons learned of things in the work. 
 
 
What we are doing is in the United States after September 11th of 2001, we put in place a number of practices, procedures and equipment to compensate for loss of large areas of the plant. And it really doesn't make much difference as to what the reason for that loss is whether it's an aircraft impact, whether it's a tornado, hurricane, whatever the reason is. We had to have mitigating strategies and then some equipment staged. Not necessarily staged at the plant location but staged so that you can get it to the plant location as soon as the plant location suffers some damage. 
 
 
So one of the things we've done after the Fukushima accident was we verified all the equipment was in place and verify that all of our practices and procedures will work. We did that through a group we belong to called WANO Nuclear Power Operations. That group subsequently is one of the charter members of a world association of nuclear operators. But the Japanese utilities are members of that world association and they will be reporting out on lessons learned through that group, through WANO and we'll get our information through the info link into WANO. Though there's a couple of, one national and one worldwide industry of associations that will be formulating those lessons learned. Now based on what we have seen, I want to point out a couple things. One, the type of reactors that they're using in Japan at that Fukushima site, all six of their reactors were borne water reactors. The reactors that we are building and the reactors we currently operate are pressurized water reactors. So there is a fundamental difference in the way that the reactors operate. 
 
 
Secondly their issue really was not caused as much by the earthquake as it was by the tsunami. They had a significant wall of water that impacted that facility. Our information, in fact, is that the plants rode through the earthquake pretty well; all the reactors shut down, all the controls rods fully inserted, the reactors went sub-critical, the diesel generator started to carry the emergency loads and it wasn't until almost an hour later when the tsunami flooded the facility that they lost that onsite power supply and then they were relying just on the battery. Our facility is over 400 feet above sea level and we're over 100 miles from the ocean. So the tsunami issue for us will not be an issue. 
 
 
So there are some fundamental differences we've looked into. What we do expect to learn are things like communications, batteries, emergency planning, communication to offsite agencies, that didn't go probably as smoothly as it could have or should have. But one fundamental difference is that I don't think the rest of the world took the events of September 11th of 2001 as seriously as the United States did, probably for very good reasons. But in the US we put in place beyond our design basis mitigating strategies at that point in time. But most of the rest of the world probably didn't pay a lot of attention to it."

So largely for the Japanese vendors that would be through Westinghouse. They are checking with Westinghouse on a weekly or more frequent basis. And remember that one of the suppliers is actually the parent company for Westinghouse and that's Toshiba and that's probably our largest supplier in Japan. And again they have not indicated to us any significant damage. In fact none of the vendors that we're using whether it's Toshiba, IJI or some of their sub vendors, has indicated to us that they've suffered any amount of real damage from the earthquake or tsunami. We did have some equipment on the ground, plate steel and that kind of thing and we verified that our equipment has not suffered any damage. 
 
 
Now their rolling blackout situation is getting better. And as much as it is now more predictable then it used to be and a number of vendors have indicated to us that they are now shifting their work schedules such that if power's not going to be available during the day but it will be available at night , then they're bringing folks in at night to do the work.

Three quick questions; all just nuance type stuff. The first one is on O&M trends. O&M was down in Q1, can you talk about some of the O&M trends especially in light of the comments you made in conjunction with the Q4 earnings call? 
 
 
Second question is at SCE&G what was the earned ROE for either the trailing 12 or 13 months, I forgot how you report it. 
 
 
And then the final question is on your funding and cash flow impacts and needs going forward on bonus depreciation, I think you mentioned it, but the cash impacts on both 11 and 12 especially now that the rules are out and what are you thinking about your DRIP program in the next several years?"

On the first, on O&M, we do continue to keep tight control around what we call core O&M. That's the things that are really controllable by the wine businesses. The things that have been, and those are really, we've maintained those",582,"Okay, yeah, thanks Jim. On the first, on O&M, we do continue to keep tight control around what we call core O&M. That's the things that are really controllable by the wine businesses. The things that have been, and those are really, we've maintained those relatively flat. The one exception to that is that for the first time in three years we did have salary increases during Q1 that was impacted about half of the quarter for mid-February. Very modest amounts of 2% to 2.5%, something like that. So you want to have a full run of that for a quarter until Q2. 
 
 
The things that are offset that many of our incentive comp plans, the part driven by shareholder return, the costs of the revision in the long-term guidance that we did on the yearend call and because of the hit the stock took with the Japan crisis initially. We were out of the money on those at the end of the quarter. So there's no incentive cost in there related to the shareholder return for Q1. 
 
 
And the third thing I'd comment on about O&M really relates to bad debt expense. And we continue to have fairly good success in a very difficult economy with bad debt expense across the companies. Certainly low natural gas prices have helped that. A milder winter compared to a winter ago has kept total bills down, has helped that as well. And I think generally just people's pulling back and concentrating on more critical items in the household they've maybe moved the utility bill up in the priority compared to some things they would have spent on a couple three years ago. So we're fairly encouraged about that but we're going to watch that throughout the balance of the year so it's kind of cautious optimism. 
 
 
On the ROEs you asked about, on the electric business we continue to be at about 10%, just slightly under .995% but that is on a proforma basis and I would just caution you that, so what we do, as you're probably familiar, is we annualize expenses. I gave you a moment ago the example of salary increases. So in that 10% return that we filed with the regulators, we'll take any expenses what we're aware of and known and measurable at the time and annualize a full year's run rate. So that usually results in a 20 to 40 basis point reduction off the actual return. So when I give you slightly under 10%, the actual return for the period may have been closer to 20 to 40 basis points higher. We try to proforma the entire everything we know of at that point in time out in accordance with the regulator's requirements. 
 
 
And then the last thing I think you asked about cash flow and overall with the change we made in our capitalization policy and then the bonus depreciation on top of that, we estimate in aggregate over $200 million of additional cash over those two plus years, really a part of '10, '11 and '12 that would benefit us. Therefore we don't see ourselves taking down any of the remaining forward equity until Q1 of 2012 when we had originally projected to take that down in a few trenches during this year. So we think we're in much better position there from a cash basis and we don't really see needing any additional equity beyond that in the equity forward until well into 2012."

I saw that you guys mentioned that you were evaluating contingency plans in case the COL license is delayed and you guys were not expecting any sort of impact on the in-service dates of the units. Just wanted to get a little bit more detail on the 2012 nuclear CAPEX. If there were some sort of slippage in the COL timeline would you guys anticipate any of that CAPEX being delayed?"

But that would be in the, what I termed, the so-called nuclear construction because there are some things that I need a license in order to start. But there are a significant amount of activities that we currently have ongoing that do not need the license and would continue. Cooling towers for example, we just started on cooling towers. We'd be able to step our way through those. There's one permit we're waiting on for the cooling towers but was dependent on us getting the final environmental impact statement. Well we received that final environmental impact statement a little over a week ago so we should be cleared to do that now. 
 
 
We can start the fabrication of the modules; these are the big modules that eventually will be put in the excavation. We've got probably a year plus worth of work on the two biggest ones and we can stage those and start on some of the smaller modules. The plate for the containment vessel bottom bowl, the way you build a containment vessel is it's almost two inch thick steel and you build a bottom bowl just a layer that looks like a big cereal bowl, then you build some stackable rings and then you build the top portion of the bowl. We received all the plate for the bottom bowl and we've got probably a years' worth of fabrication on site to do that. And then we'll start receiving plate for the ring sites and that can all continue. 
 
 
We've got the switchyard that we're constructing. That will go through, probably through about 2012. We've got a water treatment facility that eventually will supply all three of our units. That can continue and we've got a number of other support, piping, intake, structure, discharge, well water supply, all those kinds of things you can go in. 
 
 
So we've got a reasonably significant amount of work that will continue even if we did not get the COL when we anticipate it, you know, we would be looking at reconfiguring our critical path schedule and looking to see what kinds of things we can do external to the excavation that might be inserted once finished. For example rebar; if we put the reinforcing bar together, the matrix and the lattice together outside of the excavation and then lowered it in later, that would remove that from critical pass. So while we would anticipate that the capital spending would slow down in 2012, we would not certainly anticipate a cessation and it would be a reasonable significant amount that we can continue to do."

Currently their situation is still but there are only two places in the world where ultra large forgings can be done and that's either in Japan or in Korea. And we opted to have ours done in Korea. So the forgings and the machining are all being done in Korea before shipment here. 
 
 
We have plate steel that we are going to need for the first ring. It should be coming from a company called IHI, that's the in Tokyo area. And again we've contacted them and don't anticipate any delays but we would expect to receive some of that steel in 2012 such that when we're finished with the lower bowl we can start, actually we'll start before hand, we'll start on the first lane. So the little bowl goes in first and then the first ring will go on after that. So we would expect those deliveries in 2012 from IHI in the Tokyo area. 
 
 
The turbine generator is a [indiscernible] item but that wasn't slated to start I think until sometime in '12 so we're not going to receive that until probably sometime in '13 or '14."

We have been participating in the loan guarantee process, going through the due diligence and have gotten to a point where we believe we provided enough information to their team that will allow us to get some sort of information back on what sort of terms and conditions they might be attaching to the loan guarantees. 
 
 
We know and it's been reported they've got a deal with Southern on the Georgia projects. We'd like to certainly see how those documents are laid out and what the requirements might be in there to make sure it would be something that would fit with us for the long-term period that those loans would run. They present some challenges from a financing perspective because they're twenty-year amortizing loans, which means in that twenty-year period you'll be out of the marketplace, refinancing significant parts of the plant. If you do accept the loan guarantees that gives us some concern with interest rates where they are today given that they're likely to go up. That could expose us to some fairly good-sized risk as opposed to thirty-year bonds that we typically do under our First Mortgage financing. 
 
 
So we have told DOE that we need some more information before we go any further to evaluate the loans but I would reaffirm that we've said since day one we don't need the loan guarantees to proceed with the project. We've been very successful to date in doing the financing we need to bring the debt on board as necessary and that we certainly believe that will continue to be the case. So we'll continue to work with them as information becomes available. But at this point I would say the ball is in their court to provide us additional information to help us do the evaluation; in the meantime we'll continue with our First Mortgage-run debt issuances when they are necessary."

I mean we are more conservative about the business than we were a few months ago as we outlined on the year-end call, but I'd also say it's not as simple as just parsing those and saying well, if you're not doing new nuclear what's the underlying growth? Because we've got to do something. We've got to have generation on the system to meet customers' needs down the road, and let's take the extreme case and say there's a long-term delay or even a stoppage to new nuclear development. Well, under the law in South Carolina we're going to take the accumulated equip costs to date and go to the Commission and get that amortized over some period to start getting the actual return of that investment back to investors.
 
 
We're also going to begin some type of new generation solution, most likely I would presume some type of combined cycle gas units. So we have looked at that scenario in the extreme case, contingency plan only, and still think that falls within the long-term earnings guidance that we provided."

I would like to welcome each of you to our call also. Let's start on slide three which reflects SCANA's 2011 Q1 basic earnings per share of $1 compared to $1.02 per share in 2010.

Let's start on slide three which reflects SCANA's 2011 Q1 basic earnings per share of $1 compared to $1.02 per share in 2010. The decline in earnings was primarily attributable to weather in our Georgia market of natural gas rates stabilization act, decrease in South Carolina, higher depreciation and share dilution; all of which offset improved margins from electric based rate increases. We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guide of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with an internal target of $3.02. 
 
 
Additionally, with more than 90% of our earnings weather normalized I thought it might be helpful for you to understand our view of our annual earnings plan by quarter. In our annual forecast we see this distribution as approximately 30% in both Q1 and Q4, 25% in Q3 and the remaining 15% in Q2. Hopefully this will be helpful in the quarterly distribution within your models. I caution you to consider the combination of this quarterly distribution and our annual guidance in updating your models if you choose to use it at all. 
 
 
Now on slide four I'd like to review results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G's Q1 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $.04 compared to 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the base load review act and the mid-2010 retail electric rate case offset the lower gas margins from the RSA rate decrease and the higher capital related costs of depreciation, property taxes and interest. 
 
 
As you may recall, in Q1 of 2010, we deferred for refund $25 million related to incremental margin from unusually cold weather as part of the implementation of our pilot electric weather normalization mechanism. This program applies to residential and commercial electric customers and was fully implemented in August 2010. The 2010 deferral had the effect of weather normalizing Q1, therefore there is no weather variance at the SCE&G. 
 
 
At March 31, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 663,000 electric customers and approximately 315,000 natural gas customers; up .6% and .9% respectively over the same date in 2010. 
 
 
PS&C Energy's earnings for Q1 2011, in red, were $.25 per share unchanged from Q1 of 2010. Increases in margin from customer growth of 1.4% were offset by higher interest expense. As with SCE&G, no wonder variance is seen at PS&C due to the customer usage tracker or decoupling mechanism. SCANA Energy in grain reported earnings of $.17 during the quarter compared to $.24 in the prior year. The $.07 per share decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to weather. The colder than normal weather in Q1 2010 contributed $.09 to earnings as compared to about $.02 from colder than normal weather in 2011. Said another way, although Q1 of 2011 was cold, it was not nearly as cold as Q1 of 2010. 
 
 
SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers as of March 31, 2011. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $.03 per share in Q1 of 2011 compared to $.02 per share in the same quarter last year. 
 
 
Slide five shows our electric and gas sales statistics. Unit sales of electricity and natural gas to our retail customers in Q1 of 2011 were down over the prior year driven by weather related decreases in our residential and commercial classes. Of course our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalized margin and not unit sales. The industrial sector continued the train of recovery with an increase in both electric and gas sales. 
 
 
On slide six you can see an update of economic growth announcements during Q1 of 2011. These recent announcements suggest the creation of more than 1800 new jobs with an investment of more than $600 million and are a continuing sign of a longer-term economic recovery in our service territory. 
 
 
As you can see on slide seven, we expect to complete our debt financings for 2011 next month. As it relates to our cash position the final ROS rules for 2011 bonus depreciation were issued in March. These final rules are consistent with the method we used to originally estimate cash will be generated from bonus depreciation as discussed during our February call. In addition to bonus depreciation we continue to recognize a cash benefit and the method being used to account for capital maintenance, which results in certain maintenance costs being treated as current expenses for income tax purposes. Combined, we expect these strategies to generate over $60 million in cash benefit. Accordingly, we do not expect to draw the remaining funds under our May 2010 equity forward until early 2012, which will mitigate dilution. 
 
 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh."

I would like to direct your attention first to slide 8.

I would like to direct your attention first to slide 8. As most of you are aware, the United States environmental protection agency issued a proposed rule on March 16th, 2011 which would provide the first national standards for emissions of mercury, arsenic and other pollutants from coal and oil fired power plants. We will review the proposed rules to better understand any potential impact on our operations. The proposed rule must first be published under federal register, then undergo a 60-day comment period and the EPA will also hold three public meetings. Based upon the comments received, the EPA may make changes to the proposal before it is finalized, as early as November 6th, 2011. SCANA is committed to being a good steward of the environment and to meeting all the requirements set by state and federal regulators regarding power plant emissions. After the final rule is available, we will develop a compliant strategy based on the requirements of the rule, compliant time frames and the estimated cost of various options for compliance. 
 
 
Since the mid 1990s we have spent nearly a billion dollars installing environmental equipment in our fossil plants including, most recently, an SER at our Coat facility and [indiscernible] and William Station plants. That equipment has significantly reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and mercury on our system. 
 
 
Let me turn now to our new nuclear project activities. On slide nine I'm very pleased to report that our project for two new units remains on budget and on schedule for 2016 and 2019 respectively. As you may recall, on November 15th, 2010, we filed a petition with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking approval to update the capital cost schedules for the construction of the company's new nuclear units. This filing was necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court last year, which found that general contingency costs should not be included in forecast approved under the Base Load Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use contingency fund is identified and itemized in specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval. 
 
 
The November 2010 filing identified and itemized certain capital costs of approximately $174 million that will be incurred during the construction of the new nuclear unit. These are not additional costs nor is this an additional quest to raise customer rates. We're simply specifying how we intend to use some of the dollars that were originally included in the contingency fund in our initial BLRA filing now that we have more clarity of the construction outlook. The hearing on this request was held on April 4th and we anticipate receiving permission order in May. After receiving the order, any approved capital costs already incurred will be added to those included in our revised rates filing under BLRA to determine the requested rate adjustment for 2011. 
 
 
Please turn to slide ten. On February 14, 2011 we filed our quarterly status report with the CFC and the Office Of Regulatory Staff for Q4 of 2010 as required under our Base Load Review order. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. Additionally, we intend to file our quarterly status report for Q1 2011 on Monday, May 16th and our annual request for revised rate under the Base Load Review Act on Friday, May 27th. The remaining dates on this slide represent other regulatory filings we anticipate making later this year. We are pleased with the progress of the projects and the continued regulatory support that we have received. 
 
 
We believe that nuclear power is a clean non-invading source of energy, which will position South Carolina well in the future, particularly as environmental regulations surrounding greenhouse gases and coal increase. 
 
 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Byrne who will discuss our COL application and provide and update on the status of our nuclear construction project."

The nuclear regulatory commissions' licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. We continue to anticipate receiving our combined operating license or COL in late 2011 or early 2012.",689,"Thank you Kevin. Please turn to slide 11. The nuclear regulatory commissions' licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. We continue to anticipate receiving our combined operating license or COL in late 2011 or early 2012. The COL during impact study referenced in the most recent BLRA filing was initiated by SCE&G in December of 2010. This detailed study is an evaluation of the alternatives for optimizing the construction schedule to make up the anticipated delay beyond the original construction schedule for the first under the EPC contract which assumed the COL would be issued in mid-2011 rather than our current expectation. 
 
 
Construction schedules generally can be adjusted by adding shifts of construction workers working weekends, undertaking scopes of work in parallel instead of in series and similar changes in the construction plan. SCE&G is involved in the ongoing oversight of the study and will review the results and any cost associated with compressing the schedule using such techniques. While the situation is dynamic, we anticipate that this study will be completed by the end of Q2. SCE&G continues to believe that the commercial operation date for the first will fall within the schedule approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission including the allowable schedule contingencies. There should be no adverse impact on the commercial operation date for the second meeting. 
 
 
In late 2010 the NRC staff completed its technical review of the current AP1000 design for the shield building as well as other design changes proposed by Westinghouse and issued a favorable comprehensive advanced safety evaluation report for the units. The advisory committee on reactive safeguards, an independent panel of advisors in NRC also reviewed and recommended the AP1000 design and related changes and has determined that the current design is fully adequate to protect the public health and safety. 
 
 
We received our final environmental impact statement last week and we anticipate receiving the final safety evaluation report this summer. We believe the NRC will conduct a mandatory hearing in the fall this year. I'd like to point out that there will be no contested hearing as all interveners challenges to SCE&G COL application have been denied by both the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. After mandatory hearing is complete, the NRC will make the decision regarding issuance of our COL. 
 
 
As you see from the aerial photo on slide 12, we continue to proceed with pre-construction activity to the site and continue to receive parts on site in preparation for constructing. After we receive the COL, we will begin so called Nuclear Construction of the unit. I'd like to point out that while we do not foresee a delay on the COL beyond late 2011 or early 2012, we are evaluating contingency plans for that scenario. There's a great deal of work that can be done on the unit prior to receipt of the COL. For example, the two largest modules, CA01 and CA20 can be constructed simultaneously in the module assembly building and then moved into the excavation site once we receive the COL. In the unlikely event that we might receive the COL in late 2011 or early 2012 as we expect, we feel confident that we will be able to optimize our construction schedule for critical path items to reduce any significant impact to our in-service dates. 
 
 
Finally I would like to briefly touch on the supply chain. As you may know, our turbine generators and steel plating for the containment vessels are being manufactured in Japan. While these components represent less than 15% of the total project cost, they are long lead-time components. Our suppliers in Japan have assured us that they suffered minimal damage as a result of the natural disaster. The biggest challenge these suppliers continue to face is related to their electric power supply. Japan continues to have rolling blackouts so they are not able to operate at full capacity. However, we do not anticipate significant delays in our construction due to these supply issues. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, we'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

First let me tell you that I think that it's probably a little early for us to start talking about the lessons learned.

First let me tell you that I think that it's probably a little early for us to start talking about the lessons learned. The nuclear regulatory commission has, in process, a lessons learned review that they'll be reporting out and it's a 90 day review and they'll be reporting out at 30, 60 and 90 days. And I think May 12th is the advertised date for that first report out from that 30-day review. Beyond that what the NRC is doing is they're putting in place a taskforce to do a more in-depth review and that taskforce, I believe it's been selected, once it starts its work it's about a six month working time frame. So I think that will probably put us somewhere near the end of this year. And that taskforce will then report out. So the NRC has a couple lessons learned of things in the work. 
 
 
What we are doing is in the United States after September 11th of 2001, we put in place a number of practices, procedures and equipment to compensate for loss of large areas of the plant. And it really doesn't make much difference as to what the reason for that loss is whether it's an aircraft impact, whether it's a tornado, hurricane, whatever the reason is. We had to have mitigating strategies and then some equipment staged. Not necessarily staged at the plant location but staged so that you can get it to the plant location as soon as the plant location suffers some damage. 
 
 
So one of the things we've done after the Fukushima accident was we verified all the equipment was in place and verify that all of our practices and procedures will work. We did that through a group we belong to called WANO Nuclear Power Operations. That group subsequently is one of the charter members of a world association of nuclear operators. But the Japanese utilities are members of that world association and they will be reporting out on lessons learned through that group, through WANO and we'll get our information through the info link into WANO. Though there's a couple of, one national and one worldwide industry of associations that will be formulating those lessons learned. Now based on what we have seen, I want to point out a couple things. One, the type of reactors that they're using in Japan at that Fukushima site, all six of their reactors were borne water reactors. The reactors that we are building and the reactors we currently operate are pressurized water reactors. So there is a fundamental difference in the way that the reactors operate. 
 
 
Secondly their issue really was not caused as much by the earthquake as it was by the tsunami. They had a significant wall of water that impacted that facility. Our information, in fact, is that the plants rode through the earthquake pretty well; all the reactors shut down, all the controls rods fully inserted, the reactors went sub-critical, the diesel generator started to carry the emergency loads and it wasn't until almost an hour later when the tsunami flooded the facility that they lost that onsite power supply and then they were relying just on the battery. Our facility is over 400 feet above sea level and we're over 100 miles from the ocean. So the tsunami issue for us will not be an issue. 
 
 
So there are some fundamental differences we've looked into. What we do expect to learn are things like communications, batteries, emergency planning, communication to offsite agencies, that didn't go probably as smoothly as it could have or should have. But one fundamental difference is that I don't think the rest of the world took the events of September 11th of 2001 as seriously as the United States did, probably for very good reasons. But in the US we put in place beyond our design basis mitigating strategies at that point in time. But most of the rest of the world probably didn't pay a lot of attention to it."

And again they have not indicated to us any significant damage. In fact none of the vendors that we're using whether it's Toshiba, IJI or some of their sub vendors, has indicated to us that they've suffered any amount of real damage from the earthquake or tsunami. We did have some equipment on the ground, plate steel and that kind of thing and we verified that our equipment has not suffered any damage.

And then the final question is on your funding and cash flow impacts and needs going forward on bonus depreciation, I think you mentioned it, but the cash impacts on both 11 and 12 especially now that the rules are out and what are you thinking about your DRIP program in the next several years?"
188244,129583905,2468961,"SCANA Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","SCANA Corporation","Executives","Okay, yeah, thanks Jim. On the first, on O&M, we do continue to keep tight control around what we call core O&M. That's the things that are really controllable by the wine businesses. The things that have been, and those are really, we've maintained those",582,"Okay, yeah, thanks Jim. On the first, on O&M, we do continue to keep tight control around what we call core O&M. That's the things that are really controllable by the wine businesses. The things that have been, and those are really, we've maintained those relatively flat. The one exception to that is that for the first time in three years we did have salary increases during Q1 that was impacted about half of the quarter for mid-February. Very modest amounts of 2% to 2.5%, something like that. So you want to have a full run of that for a quarter until Q2. 
 
 
The things that are offset that many of our incentive comp plans, the part driven by shareholder return, the costs of the revision in the long-term guidance that we did on the yearend call and because of the hit the stock took with the Japan crisis initially. We were out of the money on those at the end of the quarter. So there's no incentive cost in there related to the shareholder return for Q1. 
 
 
And the third thing I'd comment on about O&M really relates to bad debt expense. And we continue to have fairly good success in a very difficult economy with bad debt expense across the companies. Certainly low natural gas prices have helped that. A milder winter compared to a winter ago has kept total bills down, has helped that as well. And I think generally just people's pulling back and concentrating on more critical items in the household they've maybe moved the utility bill up in the priority compared to some things they would have spent on a couple three years ago. So we're fairly encouraged about that but we're going to watch that throughout the balance of the year so it's kind of cautious optimism. 
 
 
On the ROEs you asked about, on the electric business we continue to be at about 10%, just slightly under .995% but that is on a proforma basis and I would just caution you that, so what we do, as you're probably familiar, is we annualize expenses. I gave you a moment ago the example of salary increases. So in that 10% return that we filed with the regulators, we'll take any expenses what we're aware of and known and measurable at the time and annualize a full year's run rate. So that usually results in a 20 to 40 basis point reduction off the actual return. So when I give you slightly under 10%, the actual return for the period may have been closer to 20 to 40 basis points higher. We try to proforma the entire everything we know of at that point in time out in accordance with the regulator's requirements. 
 
 
And then the last thing I think you asked about cash flow and overall with the change we made in our capitalization policy and then the bonus depreciation on top of that, we estimate in aggregate over $200 million of additional cash over those two plus years, really a part of '10, '11 and '12 that would benefit us. Therefore we don't see ourselves taking down any of the remaining forward equity until Q1 of 2012 when we had originally projected to take that down in a few trenches during this year. So we think we're in much better position there from a cash basis and we don't really see needing any additional equity beyond that in the equity forward until well into 2012."

But that would be in the, what I termed, the so-called nuclear construction because there are some things that I need a license in order to start. But there are a significant amount of activities that we currently have ongoing that do not need the license and would continue. Cooling towers for example, we just started on cooling towers. We'd be able to step our way through those. There's one permit we're waiting on for the cooling towers but was dependent on us getting the final environmental impact statement. Well we received that final environmental impact statement a little over a week ago so we should be cleared to do that now. 
 
 
We can start the fabrication of the modules; these are the big modules that eventually will be put in the excavation. We've got probably a year plus worth of work on the two biggest ones and we can stage those and start on some of the smaller modules. The plate for the containment vessel bottom bowl, the way you build a containment vessel is it's almost two inch thick steel and you build a bottom bowl just a layer that looks like a big cereal bowl, then you build some stackable rings and then you build the top portion of the bowl. We received all the plate for the bottom bowl and we've got probably a years' worth of fabrication on site to do that. And then we'll start receiving plate for the ring sites and that can all continue. 
 
 
We've got the switchyard that we're constructing. That will go through, probably through about 2012. We've got a water treatment facility that eventually will supply all three of our units. That can continue and we've got a number of other support, piping, intake, structure, discharge, well water supply, all those kinds of things you can go in. 
 
 
So we've got a reasonably significant amount of work that will continue even if we did not get the COL when we anticipate it, you know, we would be looking at reconfiguring our critical path schedule and looking to see what kinds of things we can do external to the excavation that might be inserted once finished. For example rebar; if we put the reinforcing bar together, the matrix and the lattice together outside of the excavation and then lowered it in later, that would remove that from critical pass. So while we would anticipate that the capital spending would slow down in 2012, we would not certainly anticipate a cessation and it would be a reasonable significant amount that we can continue to do."

Currently their situation is still but there are only two places in the world where ultra large forgings can be done and that's either in Japan or in Korea. And we opted to have ours done in Korea. So the forgings and the machining are all being done in Korea before shipment here. 
 
 
We have plate steel that we are going to need for the first ring. It should be coming from a company called IHI, that's the in Tokyo area. And again we've contacted them and don't anticipate any delays but we would expect to receive some of that steel in 2012 such that when we're finished with the lower bowl we can start, actually we'll start before hand, we'll start on the first lane. So the little bowl goes in first and then the first ring will go on after that. So we would expect those deliveries in 2012 from IHI in the Tokyo area.

We know and it's been reported they've got a deal with Southern on the Georgia projects. We'd like to certainly see how those documents are laid out and what the requirements might be in there to make sure it would be something that would fit with us for the long-term period that those loans would run. They present some challenges from a financing perspective because they're twenty-year amortizing loans, which means in that twenty-year period you'll be out of the marketplace, refinancing significant parts of the plant. If you do accept the loan guarantees that gives us some concern with interest rates where they are today given that they're likely to go up. That could expose us to some fairly good-sized risk as opposed to thirty-year bonds that we typically do under our First Mortgage financing. 
 
 
So we have told DOE that we need some more information before we go any further to evaluate the loans but I would reaffirm that we've said since day one we don't need the loan guarantees to proceed with the project. We've been very successful to date in doing the financing we need to bring the debt on board as necessary and that we certainly believe that will continue to be the case. So we'll continue to work with them as information becomes available. But at this point I would say the ball is in their court to provide us additional information to help us do the evaluation; in the meantime we'll continue with our First Mortgage-run debt issuances when they are necessary."

He will be retiring at the end of November and I will be moving into my new role as CEO.
Bill and I have worked together for many years. He has and will continue to be a valuable resource for me personally and for the company. I am pleased to report that our transition is progressing as planned and I look forward to my new responsibilities. We continue to see significant industrial announcements in our service territory.
On Slide 3, we have provided an update of economic expansion announcements. This period was very impressive including a large expansion at the Bridgestone tire facility in Aiken County and a new Continental Tire operation in Sumter County. In total, announcements since July 1st suggest a creation of over 3,000 new jobs with an investment of approximately $1.9 billion. This brings our year-to-date planned industrial investments to over $2.5 billion with more than 5,500 job additions.
In addition to industrial growth, we also continue to see customer growth in our residential and commercial categories. These are promising signs of economic recovery and we are excited to be positioned to provide clean, safe, reliable energy for the citizens and industries of South Carolina in the future.
Please turn to Slide 4, which sets forth our regulated returns and related filings. The chart at the top of the slide shows earned returns at our 3 largest regulated subsidiaries as of June 30, 2011, the date of our most recent filing. The third quarter earned returned filings for our Electric and Gas businesses will be made in mid-December.
Our electric business earned 8.6%. The decrease from the previous filing was due primarily to the elimination of the second quarter of 2010, which was positively impacted by weather. You might recall that beginning in the third quarter of 2010 we implemented a weather normalization mechanism, so our returns at the Electric business are no longer impacted by weather. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWIP or associated rate increases, as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.
As of June 30, 2011, our gas business at SCE&G was earning approximately 7.72%. This does not incorporate the recent 8.5 million rate increase that will effective in November of this year under the Rate Stabilization Act. This increase will restore the return to approximately 10.25%. Whenever our earned returns in the Gas business fall 50 basis points above or below our allowed return of 10.25%, we adjust rates through our annual Rate Stabilization filing.
Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well, and is earning its allowed return principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. As you can see from the timeline at the bottom of this slide, we have completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings for the year.
On Slide 5, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.8 million or approximately 2.4% to the retail electric rates of SCE&G. The new rates will be effective for bills rendered on or after October 30 of this year.
Our BLRA filings for 2011 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, on August 15th we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2011 on November 14th. I am pleased to report that our project for the 2 new units continues to be on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019, respectively.
Finally, SCE&G and Santee recently executed the permanent construction and operating agreements, which will govern the construction and operation of the new nuclear facilities. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the units and will be responsible for the operation of the units as they come online.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Byrne to discuss some other aspects of our nuclear project and environmental matters."

I would now like to direct your attention to slide number 6. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's licensing proceedings continued to progress towards a successful conclusion. Please focus on the blue section of the chart.On October 13, we",632,"Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to direct your attention to slide number 6. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's licensing proceedings continued to progress towards a successful conclusion. Please focus on the blue section of the chart.
On October 13, we completed the uncontested mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. SCE&G believes it presented evidence that all requirements have been met to allow the NRC to issue the combined construction and operating license for V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3. We anticipate a decision from the NRC regarding our COL in the coming months.
Now if I can get you to focus on the green section of the chart related to the approval of the AP1000 certified design, you see it is in the rulemaking process. The NRC has indicated that the full commission intends to act on the final certification by year end. This timeline continues to align with our expectation that we will receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012.
As Kevin mentioned, construction of the units is progressing on schedule and continues to support the units coming online in 2016 and 2019. As we have previously discussed earlier this year we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study. You might recall that this study related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the anticipated COL issuance of mid-2011 timeframe when we signed the EPC contract in 2008 to the current timeframe of late 2011, early 2012. This study is not in any way an indication that we are expecting additional delays in receipt of the COL.
This study provides for 3 scenarios. The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out the commercial operation date for Unit 2 by 6 months. The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2 and accelerating the date for Unit 3 in order to take advantages of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. By narrowing the gap between the units, it may be possible to create construction efficiencies by avoiding the demobilization and remobilization of crews as we progress from one unit to the next. SCE&G is in negotiations with the Shaw/Westinghouse consortium to determine the preferred scenario. We do not anticipate a decision on the COL delay study until later this year.
Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet. Please turn to slide number 7. We continue to evaluate the impact of environmental regulations, particularly the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The rule requires states in the Eastern U.S. to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. At this time we still believe the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction, or SCRs.
As you can see in the top of this chart on the slide, 69% of our coal capacity already has scrubber and SCR technology. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched coal generation as these are our larger, more efficient plants. The charts at the bottom of this slide demonstrate our current and anticipated generation mix after the 2 new nuclear plants at V.C. Summer come online.
While our coal fleet composes slightly over 50% of our current generation mix, we anticipate that percentage to drop to 24% as we will rely less heavily on coal in the future. In anticipation of more regulation, we will continue to pursue additional strategies and evaluate emissions reduction technologies to ensure that we are in compliance with all environmental regulations.
I will now turn the call over to Jimmy Addison."
188244,141352130,2469057,"SCANA Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","SCANA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. Let's start on Slide 8, which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate incre",1207,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. Let's start on Slide 8, which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases, which were partially offset by interest expense and share dilution.
On Slide 9, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $2.25 per share, unchanged from the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by the gas rate decrease under the rate stabilization act that was effective in November 2010, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, with our internal target of $3.02 per share.
Now on Slide 10, I'd like to review results by principle lines of business. SCE&G's third quarter 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were $0.05 per share higher than 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were partially offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution. At September 30, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 665,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8% and 1.3% respectively over the same date in 2010. PSNC energy, in red, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the prior year. Increased margin from customer growth of approximately 1.7% was slightly offset by depreciation and property taxes.
SCANA Energy, in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. The $0.01 change is driven by lower margins which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers as of September 30. SCANA Energy, along with 3 other marketers, entered the bid process to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming term of September 2012 through August 2014. The commission is scheduled to make a selection in February 2012. SCANA Energy has served as the regulator provider since 2002. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share during the third quarter of 2010. The results for 2011 reflect higher income taxes at the holding company during the quarter due to levelizing the effective tax rate as required by accounting standards.
Slides 11 and 12 show our electric and gas sales statistics. These numbers have not been weather normalized. Recall that our WNA and Cut mechanisms normalize margin but obviously not unit sales. Retail sales of electricity are down 1.5% for the quarter due to lower residential and commercial sales, primarily as a result of milder weather this year, partially offset by higher industrial sales. Retail sales of natural gas showed a decrease of 1.8% for the quarter. While the residential and commercial categories showed improvement, industrial gas usage declined slightly when compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower sales for power generation in the current quarter, again driven by milder weather.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 13. Our 2012 preliminary guidance is $3.05 to $3.25 per share and our internal target is $3.17. This guidance assumes known industrial expansion and continued customer growth at recent levels. While we anticipate the number of customers will increase, our assumption of usage per customer is slightly lower, reflecting continued energy efficiency and the economy in general.
As it relates to expenses, operations and maintenance expense is expected to remain relatively flat with modest growth related to CapEx expansion in property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and dilution. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings and the RSA and the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies.
These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing down the remainder of the equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012 and postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution in --next year, as I'll discuss in more detail when I cover our financing plan shortly.
As Steve mentioned earlier, we are still making a decision on the COL delay study. Our guidance is necessarily broader than normal to accommodate the range of potential outcomes he discussed. Once a decision on the study is finalized we will update you and provide information about how the decision impacts our guidance range, capital forecast, and financing plan.
While we continue to see some signs of a longer term economic recovery, the signals are mixed. As a result, we remain conservative in our estimates and cautiously optimistic about our longer term sustained recovery. We reaffirm our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years based on the 2010 weather-normalized base of 292.
Slide 14 presents our preliminary CapEx forecast. The estimates for 2012 and '13 are slightly less than the forecast we presented a year ago. As you can see from the slide, our new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our total capital spending over the next 3 years.
Now please turn to Slide 15. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. We anticipate completing 2 debt refinancings in 2012 and '13. Our only planned issuances of new debt will be at SCE&G to support our new nuclear construction. Regarding equity, we intend to continue to issue shares through our 401(k) and DRIP programs, yielding approximately $100 million per year.
As mentioned in previous calls, we have adopted 2 tax strategies which have provided additional cash flow. These are bonus deprecation and the election to deduct repairs expense as opposed to capitalizing those costs. Because of the cash benefits we have seen from these strategies, we plan to extend the May 2010 equity forward and postpone drawing the remaining funds until the fourth quarter of 2012. We are working with the forward counterparties on the extension and expect to have it completed shortly.
Our previous financing plan included an additional equity offering of $150 million in 2012, while our updated plans postpone this issuance until 2013. As a result, our 2012 plan is lower than previously announced, while our 2013 plan has increased. We continued to evaluate our financing plan and develop strategies which align our debt and equity issuances with our cash needs for construction. This isn't a change in our overall strategy of financing the project 50/50 with debt and equity, but rather simply an adjustment in the execution to match previously unexpected cash flows. We're very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has offered us during this period.
In summary, we are pleased with our quarterly results and confident in our guidance for both 2011 and 2012.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

So our expectation is that all of the components that are being manufactured will continue on their current manufacturing schedule and we've got plenty of room onsite to store large components should they come in. So that's really not a consideration.
So, really for us the considerations are the schedule and the cost implications of that schedule and then probably secondarily then, is our desire to try to keep the trained workforce onsite actively engaged as long as we can. And that's why in the third scenario that we are looking at, which is really a compression of the schedules, we will allow the first new unit to be deferred for 6 months, but we'll bring the second new unit up earlier. And that way, we should avoid some of the demobilization/remobilization. So we'll keep that workforce more actively engaged and so the discussions we are having with the consortium now are how we value that versus how they value that and that's within the negotiations."

We have labor supplies and traditionally South Carolina was a right to work state. I think we're less than 5% unionized in the state, a reason people are looking at us. Certainly the issue that's gotten a lot of attention is the Boeing situation where they've got their plant contemplated, not just contemplated, but up and running and they got planes moving through the facility at this point, and I believe the first plane's due out of there early next year. So, there are big issues there. I certainly can't give you the legal aspects of their case. But generally, the complaints are centered around whether or not they unduly penalize the unions in Washington by expanding the plant down here. But it's my understanding that the union workforce was not reduced in Washington.
I think it was slightly increased and this was addition to their facilities, not just a movement of the existing line from there -- from operations out there. So, there'll be a lot of debate about that. I am sure it'll go through the legal process. But the reality is we got a plant down here that has been a tremendous impact to a state. Thousands of people have found employment. I think there'll be other companies that come in around it to support their operations. And personally I think it'd be difficult to try to shut it down and send all those people home, which I believe is what the NLRB maybe want to have happened. But I won't surmise what will take place, but that's really the challenge at hand and what we have got is a plant that is working well and employing a lot of people in a state that's glad to have them and others are coming to join them."

Yes, one another thing I might add is that there was a comment here in the local press this week after -- or last week, after the most recent announcement of Continental Tire over in Sumter that followed on the heels of the Bridgestone that Kevin mentioned earlier and of course we got a lot of Michelin manufacturing facilities already in the territory and the projection is that once all these plants come online that South Carolina will produce more rubber products than does Akron, Ohio, the previous rubber capital of the country."

During today's call, we will provide an update on our nuclear project and our recent hearing before the NRC. We will also discuss our results for the third quarter and our financial guidance for the balance of 2011 and for 2012. As you all know, Bill Timmerman announced his retirement earlier this year. He will be retiring at the end of November and I will be moving into my new role as CEO.
Bill and I have worked together for many years. He has and will continue to be a valuable resource for me personally and for the company. I am pleased to report that our transition is progressing as planned and I look forward to my new responsibilities. We continue to see significant industrial announcements in our service territory.
On Slide 3, we have provided an update of economic expansion announcements. This period was very impressive including a large expansion at the Bridgestone tire facility in Aiken County and a new Continental Tire operation in Sumter County. In total, announcements since July 1st suggest a creation of over 3,000 new jobs with an investment of approximately $1.9 billion. This brings our year-to-date planned industrial investments to over $2.5 billion with more than 5,500 job additions.
In addition to industrial growth, we also continue to see customer growth in our residential and commercial categories. These are promising signs of economic recovery and we are excited to be positioned to provide clean, safe, reliable energy for the citizens and industries of South Carolina in the future.
Please turn to Slide 4, which sets forth our regulated returns and related filings. The chart at the top of the slide shows earned returns at our 3 largest regulated subsidiaries as of June 30, 2011, the date of our most recent filing. The third quarter earned returned filings for our Electric and Gas businesses will be made in mid-December.
Our electric business earned 8.6%. The decrease from the previous filing was due primarily to the elimination of the second quarter of 2010, which was positively impacted by weather. You might recall that beginning in the third quarter of 2010 we implemented a weather normalization mechanism, so our returns at the Electric business are no longer impacted by weather. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWIP or associated rate increases, as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.
As of June 30, 2011, our gas business at SCE&G was earning approximately 7.72%. This does not incorporate the recent 8.5 million rate increase that will effective in November of this year under the Rate Stabilization Act. This increase will restore the return to approximately 10.25%. Whenever our earned returns in the Gas business fall 50 basis points above or below our allowed return of 10.25%, we adjust rates through our annual Rate Stabilization filing.
Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well, and is earning its allowed return principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. As you can see from the timeline at the bottom of this slide, we have completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings for the year.
On Slide 5, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.8 million or approximately 2.4% to the retail electric rates of SCE&G. The new rates will be effective for bills rendered on or after October 30 of this year.
Our BLRA filings for 2011 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, on August 15th we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2011 on November 14th. I am pleased to report that our project for the 2 new units continues to be on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019, respectively.
Finally, SCE&G and Santee recently executed the permanent construction and operating agreements, which will govern the construction and operation of the new nuclear facilities. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the units and will be responsible for the operation of the units as they come online.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Byrne to discuss some other aspects of our nuclear project and environmental matters."

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's licensing proceedings continued to progress towards a successful conclusion. Please focus on the blue section of the chart.
On October 13, we completed the uncontested mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. SCE&G believes it presented evidence that all requirements have been met to allow the NRC to issue the combined construction and operating license for V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3. We anticipate a decision from the NRC regarding our COL in the coming months.
Now if I can get you to focus on the green section of the chart related to the approval of the AP1000 certified design, you see it is in the rulemaking process. The NRC has indicated that the full commission intends to act on the final certification by year end. This timeline continues to align with our expectation that we will receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012.
As Kevin mentioned, construction of the units is progressing on schedule and continues to support the units coming online in 2016 and 2019. As we have previously discussed, earlier this year we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study. You might recall that this study related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the anticipated COL issuance of mid-2011 timeframe when we signed the EPC contract in 2008 to the current timeframe of late 2011, early 2012. This study is not in any way an indication that we are expecting additional delays in receipt of the COL.
This study provides for 3 scenarios. The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out the commercial operation date for Unit 2 by 6 months. The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2 and accelerating the date for Unit 3 in order to take advantages of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. By narrowing the gap between the units, it may be possible to create construction efficiencies by avoiding the demobilization and remobilization of crews as we progress from one unit to the next. SCE&G is in negotiations with the Shaw/Westinghouse consortium to determine the preferred scenario. We do not anticipate a decision on the COL delay study until later this year.
Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet. Please turn to slide number 7. We continue to evaluate the impact of environmental regulations, particularly the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The rule requires states in the Eastern U.S. to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. At this time we still believe the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction, or SCRs.
As you can see in the top of this chart on the slide, 69% of our coal capacity already has scrubber and SCR technology. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched coal generation as these are our larger, more efficient plants. The charts at the bottom of this slide demonstrate our current and anticipated generation mix after the 2 new nuclear plants at V.C. Summer come online.
While our coal fleet composes slightly over 50% of our current generation mix, we anticipate that percentage to drop to 24% as we will rely less heavily on coal in the future. In anticipation of more regulation, we will continue to pursue additional strategies and evaluate emissions reduction technologies to ensure that we are in compliance with all environmental regulations.
I will now turn the call over to Jimmy Addison."
188244,141352130,2469058,"SCANA Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","SCANA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. Let's start on Slide 8, which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010.

Let's start on Slide 8, which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases, which were partially offset by interest expense and share dilution.
On Slide 9, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $2.25 per share, unchanged from the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by the gas rate decrease under the rate stabilization act that was effective in November 2010, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, with our internal target of $3.02 per share.
Now on Slide 10, I'd like to review results by principal lines of business. SCE&G's third quarter 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were $0.05 per share higher than 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were partially offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution. At September 30, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 665,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8% and 1.3% respectively over the same date in 2010. PSNC energy, in red, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the prior year. Increased margin from customer growth of approximately 1.7% was slightly offset by depreciation and property taxes.
SCANA Energy, in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. The $0.01 change is driven by lower margins which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers as of September 30. SCANA Energy, along with 3 other marketers, entered the bid process to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming term of September 2012 through August 2014. The commission is scheduled to make a selection in February 2012. SCANA Energy has served as the regulator provider since 2002. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share during the third quarter of 2010. The results for 2011 reflect higher income taxes at the holding company during the quarter due to levelizing the effective tax rate as required by accounting standards.
Slides 11 and 12 show our electric and gas sales statistics. These numbers have not been weather normalized. Recall that our WNA and Cut mechanisms normalize margin but obviously not unit sales. Retail sales of electricity are down 1.5% for the quarter due to lower residential and commercial sales, primarily as a result of milder weather this year, partially offset by higher industrial sales. Retail sales of natural gas showed a decrease of 1.8% for the quarter. While the residential and commercial categories showed improvement, industrial gas usage declined slightly when compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower sales for power generation in the current quarter, again driven by milder weather.
Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 13. Our 2012 preliminary guidance is $3.05 to $3.25 per share and our internal target is $3.17. This guidance assumes known industrial expansion and continued customer growth at recent levels. While we anticipate the number of customers will increase, our assumption of usage per customer is slightly lower, reflecting continued energy efficiency and the economy in general.
As it relates to expenses, operations and maintenance expense is expected to remain relatively flat with modest growth related to CapEx expansion in property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and dilution. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings and the RSA and the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies. These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing down the remainder of the equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012 and postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution in --next year, as I'll discuss in more detail when I cover our financing plan shortly.
As Steve mentioned earlier, we are still making a decision on the COL delay study. Our guidance is necessarily broader than normal to accommodate the range of potential outcomes he discussed. Once a decision on the study is finalized, we will update you and provide information about how the decision impacts our guidance range, capital forecast, and financing plan.
While we continue to see some signs of a longer term economic recovery, the signals are mixed. As a result, we remain conservative in our estimates and cautiously optimistic about our longer term sustained recovery. We reaffirm our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years based on the 2010 weather-normalized base of 292.
Slide 14 presents our preliminary CapEx forecast. The estimates for 2012 and '13 are slightly less than the forecast we presented a year ago. As you can see from the slide, our new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our total capital spending over the next 3 years.
Now please turn to Slide 15. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. We anticipate completing 2 debt refinancings in 2012 and '13. Our only planned issuances of new debt will be at SCE&G to support our new nuclear construction. Regarding equity, we intend to continue to issue shares through our 401(k) and DRIP programs, yielding approximately $100 million per year.
As mentioned in previous calls, we have adopted 2 tax strategies which have provided additional cash flow. These are bonus depreciation and the election to deduct repairs expense as opposed to capitalizing those costs. Because of the cash benefits we have seen from these strategies, we plan to extend the May 2010 equity forward and postpone drawing the remaining funds until the fourth quarter of 2012. We are working with the forward counterparties on the extension and expect to have it completed shortly.
Our previous financing plan included an additional equity offering of $150 million in 2012, while our updated plans postpone this issuance until 2013. As a result, our 2012 plan is lower than previously announced, while our 2013 plan has increased. We continued to evaluate our financing plan and develop strategies which align our debt and equity issuances with our cash needs for construction. This isn't a change in our overall strategy of financing the project 50/50 with debt and equity, but rather simply an adjustment in the execution to match previously unexpected cash flows. We're very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has offered us during this period.
In summary, we are pleased with our quarterly results and confident in our guidance for both 2011 and 2012.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

First of all, the supply chain really has not entered into the -- any of the gating factors.

So our expectation is that all of the components that are being manufactured will continue on their current manufacturing schedule and we've got plenty of room onsite to store large components should they come in. So that's really not a consideration.
So, really for us the considerations are the schedule and the cost implications of that schedule and then probably secondarily then, is our desire to try to keep the trained workforce onsite actively engaged as long as we can. And that's why in the third scenario that we are looking at, which is really a compression of the schedules, we will allow the first new unit to be deferred for 6 months, but we'll bring the second new unit up earlier. And that way, we should avoid some of the demobilization/remobilization. So we'll keep that workforce more actively engaged and so the discussions we are having with the consortium now are how we value that versus how they value that and that's within the negotiations."

We've got a lot of work to do, preparation-wise. Beyond that, I think the outcomes from Fukushima -- now the AP1000 units were really designed to handle the kind of station blackout that they had over at Fukushima. So, that's one reason I think, why the NRC, in their internal review that they put out about 90 days afterwards, said that they would support the continued licensing of 2 designs, and the AP1000 was one of those designs. So we're heartened by that. I do think that the AP1000 design will handle Fukushima type of issues. But that being said, it could be that we get some impact from a Fukushima-related issue. I don't think that, that will delay licensing at all, and again, I think the plan is a solid plan.

We have labor supplies and traditionally South Carolina was a right to work state. I think we're less than 5% unionized in the state, a reason people are looking at us. Certainly the issue that's gotten a lot of attention is the Boeing situation where they've got their plant contemplated, not just contemplated, but up and running and they got planes moving through the facility at this point, and I believe the first plane's due out of there early next year. So, there are big issues there. I certainly can't give you the legal aspects of their case. But generally, the complaints are centered around whether or not they unduly penalize the unions in Washington by expanding the plant down here. 
But it's my understanding that the union workforce was not reduced in Washington. I think it was slightly increased and this was addition to their facilities, not just a movement of the existing line from there -- from operations out there. So, there'll be a lot of debate about that. I am sure it'll go through the legal process. 
But the reality is we got a plant down here that has been a tremendous impact to the state. Thousands of people have found employment. I think there'll be other companies that come in around it to support their operations. And personally I think it'd be difficult to try to shut it down and send all those people home, which I believe is what the NLRB maybe want to have happened. But I won't surmise what will take place, but that's really the challenge at hand and what we have got is a plant that is working well and employing a lot of people in a state that's glad to have them and others are coming to join them."

They do that as a, I would say, a routine course of business whenever they have something that goes on anywhere around the world that could impact -- they deliver these units, they give us one of those typed letters, many of which they end up rescinding. The supply chain in Japan, there were really 2 vendors in Japan that could have been affected. One was IHI, which is a large manufacturer that's supplying plate steel for us, and the other one was Toshiba and Toshiba is delivering the turbine condenser, really quite a large number of units. Toshiba largely had not started their work yet, IHI had actually delivered us plate steel in December.
We got word from both of the vendors that our components that were on site were undamaged. For example, we had some plate steel onsite at IHI, that they were prepping to send us for the ring segment of the containment vessel, that was undamaged, and that their facilities were largely undamaged. They did have some minor things that they had to correct. Their bigger issue was with the rolling blackouts. Both of the vendors were in the Tokyo area. They have learned to deal with the rolling blackouts now and they are in full production as we understand it, and we anticipate no delays from the earthquake impacts in Japan."

And again, it's unquantified since our negotiations and discussions with the consortium are not yet complete. There probably would be an impact on CapEx, though I don't think it's a significant impact. Because, as I pointed out earlier, the first let's say 6 to 8 months of work in the excavation that we're now allowed to do once we receive the COL would be the same under any of the scenarios. There may be some more work done outside of the excavation under the first scenario where we try to keep the commercial operation date the same. But we will have a significant amount of work going on really regardless of which of those scenarios we choose. 
For example, we are going to be assembling modules from subcomponents that come into the site in a very large building. That work will continue, that's probably almost a year's worth of work on the 2 largest modules. We will continue to assemble the lower bowl assembly for the containment vessel. And then the rings, once we get the plate steel in for the rings, that work, it really will continue regardless as to which of the options we choose. And then we got some other things at the site that we're trying to complete, water intake, water outfall, cooling tower work. That work will all continue and we're trying to build a water treatment facility that eventually will supply our existing and the 2 new units, and that work will continue. So we've got a significant amount of work to do in 2012, really regardless of the scenario we pick."
