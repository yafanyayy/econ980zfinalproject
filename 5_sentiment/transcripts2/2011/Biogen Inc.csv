Our Q4 2010 was a very good finish to a very good year, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap our 2010 results and accomplishments. So financially, we finished 2010 with an all-around strong performance, AVONEX Q4 revenue grew 10% on a year-over-year basis, TYSABRI Q4 revenue grew 12% year-over-year which drove a solid 8% growth in total Q4 revenues year-over-year.  For the full year 2010, total revenues also grew by 8% over 2009, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 25% for the full year. 
During 2010, we also returned over $2 billion in cash to shareholders and generated over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Francesco and Paul will provide more financial details later in the call, but suffice it to say that we entered 2011 in a strong financial position with solid momentum. 
In 2010, we also clarified Biogen Idec's strategic focus. As you know, we terminated our oncology and cardiovascular pipelines in order to focus on neurodegenerative diseases, hematology and selected high value biological drugs. We're now focusing on what we do best and what our patients need the most. 
We streamlined the company, which will result in annual cost savings of about $300 million. Paul Clancy will go into the financials in more detail later in the call. And we made two very important surrounding our management team, and I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
2010 was also very strong commercially with significantly improved AVONEX unit sales trends, particularly in the  U.S., where we delivered what is now three straight quarters of U.S. sales of around 170,000 units. We enrolled more than 14,700 patients in our two U.S. stratified trials, validating what we believe is strong interest among patients and physicians in TYSABRI restratification. And we filed applications to our U.S. and EU TYSABRI lately to include anti-JC virus antibody status  as an additional factor to help stratify the P&L risk. It has been a strong year for our commercial organization, and I commend them on our achievements. 
One recent disappointment has been the negative opinion we received from the CHMP. The CHMP was not convinced that 25-foot was an adequate measure of overall walking ability and had questions about the responder analysis used in the trial. We are of course disappointed by the decision, and we continue to believe strongly that the drug provides a meaningful benefit to many MS patients with impairments. We decide to appeal a decision, a process that takes typically six to seven months, and we'll update you on the status of our PO in appropriate time. 
Otherwise, the R&D organization made significant progress in 2010. We initiated two new Phase III programs, one for the rituximab MS and the other for our prolonged in hemophilia A. We initiated human trials for our inside lingo antibodies, which has a potential to repair to the regions in patients and we have made some late stage pipeline. In 2011, we anticipate Phase III data for BG12, our MS compound in Phase III registration data for rituximab, a promising MS therapy  with unique mechanism of action. 
In 2010, our Business Development team delivered three important new deals: First, the restructuring of our anti-CD 20 agreements that strengthen to our collaboration with certain, an acquisition from of early stage research programs that address three key central nervous system targets and their collaboration with biosciences on the new potential therapies for ALS, a disease with a very high on that region. Together these accomplishments position us well for strong performance in 2011. 
Before I close, let me take a moment here and talk about the two new additions to our senior management team. Steven Holtzman, the founder, Chairman and former CEO of Infinity Pharmaceuticals and Former Chief Business Officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals, and a track record of doing creative and groundbreaking deals, and Steve will lead our Corporate Development organization. Doug Williams, who was formerly Head of Research of Imunex, when they brought Enbrel forward and was also was formerly the Head of R&D and later CEO of Biokinetics has a great note for knowing how to turn science into products and doubling our Research and Development organization. Steve and Doug are not only are extraordinarily talented, but a great human being as well. With the addition of Steve and Doug to Paul, Francesco, Al and the rest of the team here, I believe that we now have the talent and the team to take Biogen Idec to the next level. 
In summary then, 2010  was the begin of a transformative period of Biogen Idec. We performed well and made the groundwork for a successful 2011 by restructuring the organization, recruiting top talents and putting in place a high-performance culture. I'll now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our new the R&D Head, who will give you the thoughts on what makes a great R&D organization, and his approach to advancing our pipeline. Welcome, Doug."
29726,118367384,97520,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George.

My job is to build on the already solid science that Bio",940,"Thank you, George. Before I begin, I just wanted to say to those of you listening to the conference call and to my colleagues in the R&D organization that I'm very excited to be joining Biogen Idec. My job is to build on the already solid science that Biogen Idec has, and to advance and strengthen our R&D pipeline to deliver meaningful benefits to patients and add value to our shareholders. As you know, I've been part of a large biotech, bringing Enbrel and Leukine to market, but I've also been part of an entrepreneurial company. Whether it's large or small, I see common denominator in both, underlying what makes a great organization. As a result, my focus for increasing R&D productivity was set around, first, bringing forward only those programs that offer real differentiated benefits to patients. There's already a strong commitment in the organization to this, but we need to improve upon our past R&D performance by accelerating high priority internal candidates and assuring that we adequately resourced them.  We'll be a more disciplined in evaluating our pipeline programs. 
Second, we need to improve decision making across the evangelization. I plan to build on the momentum that George has already begun by evaluating and streamlining program structures so that we can cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit and a sense of urgency in the company. 
Third, we need to be agnostic about which programs we pursue. Whether they're internal or external.  We'll become a preferred partner for external emerging biotech companies to further strengthen our pipeline. George, Steve and I can translate our experience leading small entrepreneurial companies into forging effective new partnerships to sustain our long-term growth. And at the same time, meeting the needs of our partners. We have a keen understanding of what elements and their collaboration will be important for our future partners having spent many years in that position as the smaller company in collaborations with large pharma and biotech. 
Ultimately, I want to harness the passion for innovation that we already have here among the many talented scientists and inspire a new sense of focus, clarity and urgency. In the short-term,  we'll build on our historical strengths in neurology and immunology and support the late stage Ophelia programs. We'll further strengthen this company by improving decision-making, assuring we effectively resource the highest priority in most differentiated programs and retaining our commitment to bringing true benefits to patients. 
Now I'd like to transition to updates from our late stage urology pipeline, which is clearly a priority for me and where we have a number of significant data events this year. We filed in December with the FDA and EMA proposed labeling to include anti-JC virus antibody status  as another potential factor to help stratify the risk of PML. We're also working to make an anti-JC virus antibody assay commercially available sometime this year. We expect beta readouts from both of our Phase III studies of our Oral MS treatment, BG 12, later this year. BG 12 is unique among Oral MS therapies because it acts as a side of protective agent as well as having immune effects. The active agent in BG 12 is the newest in psoriasis for many years and has been established safety profile. We believe this affords the opportunity to pursue combination therapy that have already initiated a Phase II study to explore this approach to treating MS. 
We plan to initiate a Phase III trial of dexpramipexole for ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease in the first half of this year. Dex has received orphan drug designation both in the U.S. and EU, as well as fast-track designation in the U.S. Dex has shown positive results in Phase II, and this program is an important part of our strategy to advance therapies for unmet needs in other neurological diseases. 
And in the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registrational trials for daclizumab. This drug targets the pathogenic T cells in MS through a novel mechanism and Phase II studies have shown solid advocacy and promising safety with the convenience of once monthly subcutaneous dosing.  As for our hemophilia programs, we continue to rapidly enroll patients in our registrational studies, with beta readouts from both B-LONG  and A-LONG expected in 2012. 
Turning to RITUXAN lifecycle management activities, last week , we and our partner Genentech, a member of the Roche group, announced FDA approval for the use of RITUXAN as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma who responded to initial treatment with RITUXAN plus chemotherapy. Our date for RITUXAN and ANCA-associated vasculitis, a rare debilitating disease with no approved therapy is April 19. While we'll be focusing heavily on maturing these late-stage programs, I'll also be looking into the early stage candidates to evaluate them for their future potential and therapeutic differentiation. 
So in summary, while I'd only been there for three weeks, I feel very privileged to be part of a biotech company with such a tremendous legacy, one that's developed three drugs that have transformed the lives of thousands of patients. Biogen Idec has great science and a team of individuals committed to making the company the leading biotech enterprise in the industry. I've known and admired  George and Steve for many years, and now the privilege with interacting with the rest of the management team. This is the solid team as I've ever seen, and has the unwavering commitment to take this company to the next level. 
With that, I'll pass the call over to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Head of Global Commercial Operations."

As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance ended the year on a high note. I'm pleased to say that in 2010, we achieved our main goal, which was to stabilize our Global MS patient share by abating to the decline in our share in the U.S. and growing TYSABRI share globally. This contributed to our 10% driven by strong performances from both AVONEX and TYSABRI. 
Let me take a moment to discuss each franchise in more detail and I'm going to focus on market share and unit sales. Later in the call, Paul Clancy will provide more information on revenue, including the impact on foreign exchange in pricing. 
Starting with AVONEX, our performance in the U.S. has improved tremendously. We have had three consecutive quarters now of sales around 170,000 unit mark after four years of units sales declined. This is thanks to our strong commercial leadership team that over all organization and thanks to the plan we have implemented. Our 2011 goal now is to put our U.S. AVONEX franchise back on an ABC market share growth trajectory. 
Outside the U.S., our  have declined we  achieved some AVONEX market share growth in Q4. Keep in mind that in a multi-billion-dollar market, even small changes in market share can translate into significant revenue growth. Those are our focus on share. 
AVONEX unit demand grew by a solid 6% and the overall market continued to expand. AVONEX is now licensing more than 85 countries and continues to gain share in many of them. In Japan for example, AVONEX market share cross the 30% threshold in 2010. AVONEX full year revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was 46%. In 2010, AVONEX was newly approved in South Korea, Hong Kong, Bosnia, Lebanon and Panama. 
Moving on to TYSABRI performance, 2010 was widely market TYSABRI revenue exceeded the $1.2 billion, an increase of 16% versus 2009. We ended the year with 56,600 patients, an increase of 8,200 patients or 72% over 2009, and we continue to gain market share. Worldwide, net patients additions average of 133 per week, down from 162 during the third quarter. This patient additions is something that we are watching but nothing that we are overly concerned about. In fact, new TYSABRI patient inflows in the U.S. had been stabled a reflection of the confidence that physician and patient had in the value of TYSABRI, and the affirmation of the effectiveness of our commercial communication strategy. There's no doubt what's Bionet in the U.S. discontinuation, which would be the result of a number of factors, including TYSABRI, treatment interruptions, JCV antibodies competition. The important point however, is that TYSABRI continues to grow in the U.S. In fact, during 2010, we have the 3,100 commercial U.S. TYSABRI patients. This is very good, very strong growth. 
In addition, there are now more than 14,000 patients who have been enrolled on the Stratified II trial in the U.S. which suggest the tremendous amount of interest in risk certification, potentially unlocking TYSABRI growth over the midterm. TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 21% and unit grew by 23%. 
During 2010, TYSABRI were approved in Russia, Argentina, Columbia , Guatemala, Honduras, Boliva, Morocco and Panama raising the total number of countries where TYSABRI is approved to more than 30. In December, TYSABRI in India. Much has been made lately about competition from Redux. We expect the overall market to grow as a result of a new entry and that we expect Forus to gain market share and meet the needs of the segment of the marketplace. However, to date, as I just described, both AVONEX and TYSABRI has performed very well. We believe that the benefits of these products, coupled with our commercial strategy and the associated communication plans, we continue to make them compelling options for our next patient. 
Our strong 2010 performance these are not by chance that was a result of a new way of working, combined with exquisite execution. In line with current vision with Biogen Idec, we strengthened our global commercial infrastructure while eliminating the necessary lays of management and clearing the way for a strong partnership between our strong global and our strong local operations. We enhanced our capabilities in market access, Global Marketing and other core commercial functions. We hired neurologist to run the medical affairs team, increase the size of the team and investing to generating new scientific data for our problems. In addition, we have increased the size of our sales force, and we strengthened  our leadership team by attracting some of the best talent in the industry. 
And another big accomplishment for us in 2010 was the restructuring of our already sales and marketing operations, which allowed us to focus on our joint strategic role on the collaboration, while eliminating most of the hour operations and responsibilities. These translated into improved market performance and profitability that will continue into 2011. These priorities are critical, not only to Biogen Idec's 2011 success, but also to building a strong commercial foundation to accommodate the future product launches. 
Overall then, we have much to be excited about how we are heading into 2011. We entered the year with positive momentum in both AVONEX and TYSABRI franchises. We have identified opportunities to advance both franchises through better execution, global expansion, and in the case of TYSABRI, risk stratification. And now we have the talent and the resources in place to translate these platforms. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"
29726,118367384,97520,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francesco. I'll start with our GAAP financials which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the q",1346,"Thanks, Francesco. I'll start with our GAAP financials which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $75 million related to restructuring, $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $28 million the tax impact on these items. 
For the year, the differences are outlined in the earnings presentation. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99 in Q4 and $3.94 for full year 2010. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.42 for Q4 and $5.15 for full year 2010, which was, as noted, a strong finish to the year. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 8% to $1.2 billion and also grew 8% for full year to $4.7 billion. Going through our product revenues, I'll focus on adding financial detail to Francesco's comments, starting with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue were strong, growing 10% to $654 million. AVONEX worldwide reached $2.5 billion in revenue for 2010. In the U.S. where AVONEX grew to $1.5 billion, inventory channel ended at just over two and a quarter weeks, up slightly from last quarter. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $270 million, an 11% increase over Q4 2009, and full year grew 12% to $1, 027,000,000. The international AVONEX business modestly benefited from some tender sales in Middle East and Russia in Q4. International AVONEX revenue also includes a $4 million hedging gain in Q4 and $35 million in hedged gains for the full year 2010. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide collaboration sales were $333 million in the fourth quarter, growing to $1.2 billion for the year. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI sales of $242 million in the fourth quarter, a 12 % increase over prior year. And we recorded TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full year 2010 of $900 million, a 16% increase. 
In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $70 million grew 9% for the full year to $253 million. Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $172 million, a 12% increase over prior year, which included a $1 million gains from hedging. International TYSABRI revenue for full year 2010 totaled $647 million, a 19% year-over-year increase, which included an $11 million gain from hedging. 
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. Our revenues are broken down to three components. First our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $691 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Q4 revenue was unfavorably impacted by some destocking as inventory in the channel declined. Our profit share from that business was $215 million, up 12%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.8 billion, up 4% and our profit share from that business was $848 million, up 10%. 
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S., and in Q4 this was $34 million, down 26% as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. for the full year was $171 million. And last in the fourth quarter, we have reimbursed $900 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year, we were reimbursed $58 million. 
Moving to royalties. Royalties were $45 million for the fourth quarter and $137 million for the year. In the fourth quarter, our royalties increased sequentially as a result of max moving to a sales based royalty tier. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $100 million or 8% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $289 million or 24% of revenues. R&D expense for the full year totaled $1.2 billion, approximately 26% of full year revenue. In the fourth quarter, R&D expense benefited from the termination of the lixivaptan program, which was offset by a $10 million true up payment to Roche related to the collaboration amendment. Absent these two changes, we incurred no meaningful R&D milestones in the quarter. Q4 SG&A expense was $273 million, a 15% year-over-year increase as we increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI and increased medical affairs activity. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit share and line totaled $68 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q4 as yields on our marketable securities have declined. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 22%, which was driven lower due to the R&D tax credit legislation late in the year. For full year 2010, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%, which included the R&D tax credit in favorable discrete items in prior quarters. 
Let me also call attention to the non-controlling interest line on the P&L. In Q4, we incurred a $25 million pretax charge related to the previously announced termination of our involvement in the lixivaptan program. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average shares were $243 million. Over the course of 2010 we retired over 43 million shares related to the two previously communicated share repurchase authorizations. The ability to return cash is shareholders has been a testament to the robust cash flow generation of the company. We ended the year with approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Of note, approximately 47% of our cash and our marketable securities is domiciled outside the U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.42 in Q4 and $5.15 for full year, representing a 25% increase for our over full year 2009. So 2010 was a year of strong financial performance. Commercial organization executed hard to achieve high-single-digit revenue growth above our original expectations. We appropriately leveraged the P&L with non-GAAP EPS growing by 25%, and our cash growth was exceptional. 
Now I'd like to open our 2011 financial guidance, which will exclude any significant business development activities. Revenue in 2011 is expected to be between flat and low-single-digit growth. Our estimate includes the impact of some notable items that are projected to reduce our revenue base. First, the RITUXAN business will be impacted by the continuing of ex-U.S. royalties and a reduction in sales and marketing expense reimbursements. We expect the RITUXAN rest of world revenue to total approximately $80 million to $100 million for 2011.  Second, we don't expect to benefit from the hedged gains we've experienced in 2010. Third, the impact of healthcare reform increases from approximately $15 million in 2010 to approximately $95 million in 2011 across all products. Nevertheless, we expect these headwinds to be offset by continued TYSABRI revenue growth. 
We expect some upward pressure on cost of goods sold as we won't benefits from some of the one-time upsides in 2010. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 24% of revenue. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, reflecting the savings from the change in RITUXAN sales and marketing structure, offset by some commercial investments to compete in the new landscape. Our outlook is designed to capture the economic upside from the November restructuring, aiming to achieve a yearly run rate savings of $300 million by the second half of 2011. As a result, we expect the combination of R&D plus SG&A expenditures to decline by high-single-digit percent. 
Our effective tax rate, both GAAP and non-GAAP is expected to be between 26% and 28% of profit before tax. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be above $5.70, and GAAP diluted EPS expected to be above $4.82. We expect CapEx in the range of between $200 million and $220 million. Overall, the financial plan is designed to allow resources to move forward our late stage pipeline, defend the commercial business and drive double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

So continued to have a stronger -- both product continue to show a very promising testing growth in terms of volumes. As far as price is concerned, as usual, there is much more price pressure in Europe than in the United States. We think we have got the large proportion of the possible price  pressure around most problems in 2010, which could translate into a softer 2011 price erosion outside the United States. We have on the other hand strengthened our global market access capability to make sure that the two appropriate for position will be able to further limit to the outside the United States as well."

Our Q4 2010 was a very good finish to a very good year, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap our 2010 results and accomplishments. So financially, we finished 2010 with an all-around strong performance, AVONEX Q4 revenue grew by 10% on a year-over-year basis, TYSABRI Q4 revenue grew by 12% year-over-year, which drove a solid 8% growth in total Q4 revenues year-over-year.  For the full year 2010, total revenues also grew by 8% over 2009, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 25% for the full year. 
During 2010, we also returned over $2 billion in cash to shareholders and generated over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Francesco and Paul will provide more financial details later in the call, but suffice it to say that we entered 2011 in a strong financial position with solid momentum. 
In 2010, we also clarified Biogen Idec's strategic focus. As you know, we terminated our oncology and cardiovascular pipelines in order to focus on neurodegenerative diseases, hematology and selected high value biological drugs. We're now focusing on what we do best and on what our patients need the most. 
We streamlined this company, which will result in annual cost savings of about $300 million. Paul Clancy will go into the financials in more detail later in the call. And we've made two very important hires surrounding our management team, and I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
2010 was also very strong commercially with significantly improved AVONEX unit sales trends, particularly in the  U.S., where we delivered what is now three straight quarters of U.S. sales of around 170,000 units. We enrolled more than 14,700 patients in our two U.S. stratified trials, validating what we believe is strong interest among patients and physicians in TYSABRI risk stratification. And we filed applications to our U.S. and EU TYSABRI lately to include anti-JC virus antibody status  as an additional factor to help stratify the P&L risk. It has been a strong year for our commercial organization, and I commend them on their achievements. 
One recent disappointment has been the negative opinion we received from the CHMP on FAMPYRA. The CHMP was not convinced that 25-foot timed walk was an adequate measure of overall walking ability and had questions about the responder analysis used in the trial. We are of course disappointed by the decision, and we continue to believe strongly that the drug provides a meaningful benefit to many MS patients with walking impairments. We plan to appeal a decision, a process that takes typically six to seven months, and we'll update you on the status of our appeal in appropriate time. 
Otherwise, the R&D organization made significant progress in 2010. We initiated two new Phase III programs, one for daclizumab in MS and the other for our prolonged half-life Factor VIII in hemophilia A. We initiated human trials for our inside LINGO antibody, which has the potential to repair to the myelinated lesions in our patients, and we have made some late stage pipeline. In 2011, we anticipate Phase III data for BG-12, our first four of MS compound, contains two registrational data for daclizumab, a promising MS therapy  with unique mechanism of action. 
In 2010, our Business Development Team delivered three important new deals: First, the restructuring of our anti-CD20 agreement that strengthens our collaboration with Gentech and Roche; an acquisition from Neurimmune of early stage programs that address three key central nervous system targets; and a collaboration with Knopp Biosciences on  [indiscernible]  New potential therapies for ALS, a disease which is very high on that region. Together, these accomplishments position us well for strong performance in 2011. 
Before I close, let me take a moment here and talk about the two new additions to our senior management team. Steve Holtzman, the Founder, Chairman and former CEO of Infinity Pharmaceuticals and Former Chief Business Officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals and a track record of doing creative and groundbreaking deals, and Steve will lead our Corporate Development organization; Doug Williams, who was formerly Head of Research in Imunex, when they brought Enbrel forward and was also formerly the Head of R&D and later CEO of ZymoGenetics has a great knowledge for knowing how to turn science into products and doubling our Research and Development organization. Steve and Doug are not only are extraordinarily talented, but are great human beings as well. With the addition of Steve and Doug to Paul, Francesco, Al and the rest of the team here, I believe that we now have the talent and the team that can take Biogen Idec to the next level. 
In summary then, 2010  was the beginning of a transformative period of Biogen Idec. We performed well and made the groundwork for a successful 2011 by restructuring the organization, recruiting top talents and putting in place a high-performance culture. I'll now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our new the R&D Head, who will give you the thoughts on what makes a great R&D organization, and his approach to advancing our pipeline. Welcome, Doug."
29726,118367384,97765,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George.

My job is to build on the already solid science that Bio",938,"Thank you, George. Before I begin, I just wanted to say to those of you listening to the conference call and to my colleagues in the R&D organization that I'm very excited to be joining Biogen Idec. My job is to build on the already solid science that Biogen Idec has and to advance and strengthen our R&D pipeline to deliver meaningful benefits to patients and add value to our shareholders. As you know, I've been part of a large biotech, bringing Enbrel and LEUKINE to market, but I've also been part of an entrepreneurial company. Whether it's large or small, I see common denominators in both, underlying what makes a great organization. As a result, my focus for increasing R&D productivity was set around, first, bringing forward only those programs that offer real differentiated benefits to patients. There's already a strong commitment in the organization to this, but we need to improve upon our past R&D performance by accelerating high-priority internal candidates and assuring that we adequately resourced them.  We will be more disciplined in evaluating our pipeline programs. 
Second, we need to improve decision making across the organization. I plan to build on the momentum that George has already begun by evaluating and streamlining program structures so that we can cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit and a sense of urgency in the company. 
Third, we need to be agnostic about which programs we pursue, whether they're internal or external.  We'll become a preferred partner for external emerging biotech companies to further strengthen our pipeline. George, Steve and I can translate our experiences leading small entrepreneurial companies into forging effective new partnerships to sustain our long-term growth and, at the same time, meeting the needs of our partners. We have a keen understanding of what elements in the collaboration will be important for our future partners, having spent many years in that position as the smaller company in collaborations with large pharma and biotech. 
Ultimately, I want to harness the passion for innovation that we already have here among the many talented scientists and inspire a new sense of focus, clarity and urgency. In the short-term,  we'll build on our historical strengths in neurology and immunology and support the late stage hemophilia programs. We'll further strengthen this company by improving decision making, assuring we effectively resource the highest priority in most differentiated programs and retaining our commitment to bringing true benefits to patients. 
Now I'd like to transition to updates from our late-stage neurology pipeline, which is clearly a priority for me and where we have a number of significant data events this year. We filed in December with the FDA and EMA proposed labeling to include anti-JC virus antibody status  as another potential factor to help stratify the risk of PML. We're also working to make an anti-JC virus antibody assay commercially available sometime this year. We expect data readouts from both of our Phase III studies of our oral MS treatment, BG-12, later this year. BG-12 is unique among oral MS therapies because it acts as a side of protective agent as well as having immune effects. The active agent in BG-12 is the newest in psoriasis for many years and has an established safety profile. We believe this supports the opportunity to pursue combination therapy that have already initiated a Phase II study to explore this approach to treating MS. 
We plan to initiate a Phase III trial of dexpramipexole for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease in the first half of this year. Dex has received orphan drug designation both in the U.S. and EU, as well as fast-track designation in the U.S. Dex has shown positive results in Phase II, and this program is an important part of our strategy to advance therapies for unmet needs in other neurological diseases. 
And in the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registrational trials for daclizumab. This drug targets the pathogenic T cells in MS through a novel mechanism and Phase II studies have shown solid advocacy and promising safety with the convenience of once-monthly subcutaneous dosing.  As for our hemophilia programs, we continue to rapidly enroll patients in our registrational studies, with data readouts from both B-LONG  and A-LONG expected in 2012. 
Turning to RITUXAN life cycle management activities, last week , we and our partner Genentech, a member of the Roche group, announced FDA approval for the use of RITUXAN as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma who responded to initial treatment with RITUXAN plus chemotherapy. Our [indiscernible] date for RITUXAN and ANCA-associated vasculitis, a rare debilitating disease with no approved therapy, is April 19. While I'll be focusing heavily on maturing these late-stage programs, I'll also be looking into the earlier-staged candidates to evaluate them for their future potential and therapeutic differentiation. 
So in summary, while I'd only been here for three weeks, I feel very privileged to be part of a biotech company with such a tremendous legacy, one that's developed three drugs that have transformed the lives of thousands of patients. Biogen Idec has great science and a team of individuals committed to making the company the leading biotech enterprise in the industry. I've known and admired  George and Steve for many years and now have the privilege with interacting with the rest of the management team. This is as solid a team as I've ever seen, and there's the unwavering commitment to take this company to the next level. 
With that, I'll pass the call over to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Head of Global Commercial Operations."

As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance ended the year on a high note. I'm pleased to say that in 2010, we achieved our main goal, which was to stabilize our global MS patient share by abating to the decline in our share in the U.S. and growing TYSABRI share globally. This contributed to our 10% global sales growth, driven by strong performances from both AVONEX and TYSABRI. 
Let me take a moment to discuss each franchise in more detail, and I'm going to focus on market share and unit sales. Later in the call, Paul Clancy will provide more information on revenue, including the impact on foreign exchange and pricing. 
Starting with AVONEX, our performance in the U.S. has improved tremendously. We have had three consecutive quarters now or sale around 170,000 unit mark after four years of unit sales declines. This is thanks to our strong commercial leadership team, that over all organization, and thanks to the plan we have implemented. Our 2011 goal now is to put our U.S. AVONEX franchise back on an ABCRE market share growth trajectory. 
Outside the U.S., after period of decline, we  achieved some AVONEX market share growth in Q4. Keep in mind that in a multi-billion market, even small changes in market share can translate into significant revenue growth. Those are our focus on share. 
AVONEX unit demand grew by a solid 6% and the overall market continued to expand. AVONEX is now licensing more than 85 countries and continues to gain share in many of them. In Japan for example, AVONEX market share crossed the 30% threshold in 2010. AVONEX full year revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was 46%. In 2010, AVONEX was newly approved in South Korea, Hong Kong, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Lebanon and Panama. 
Moving on to TYSABRI performance, 2010 worldwide market TYSABRI revenue exceeded the $1.2 billion, an increase of 16% versus 2009. We ended the year with 56,600 patients, an increase of 8,200 patients or 72% over 2009, and we continue to gain market share. Worldwide, net patient additions averaged 133 per week, down from 162 during the third quarter. This drop in patient addition is something we are watching but nothing that we are overly concerned about. In fact, new TYSABRI patient inflows in the U.S. had been stable, a reflection of the confidence that physician and patient have in the value of TYSABRI and the affirmation of the effectiveness of our commercial communication strategy. There's no doubt what's called Biogen Idec [ph] in the U.S. discontinuation, which would be the result of a number of factors including TYSABRI, treatment interruptions, JCV antibodies Phase II is a new competition. The important point however, is that TYSABRI continues to grow in the U.S. In fact, during 2010, we have the 3,100 commercial U.S. TYSABRI patients. This is very good, very strong growth. 
In addition, there are now more than 14,000 patients who have been recruited on the STRATIFY-2 trial in the U.S., which suggests the tremendous amount of interest in risk stratification, potentially in unlocking TYSABRI growth over the midterm. TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 21% and unit grew by 23%. 
During 2010, TYSABRI were approved in Russia, Argentina, Columbia , Guatemala, Honduras Bosnia, Herzegovina, Morocco and Panama raising the total number of countries where TYSABRI is approved to more than 30. In December, TYSABRI goes to India. Much has been made lately about competition from us. We expect the overall market to grow as a result of a new entry and that we expect for us to gain market share and meet the needs of the segment of the marketplace. However, to date, as I just described, both AVONEX and TYSABRI has performed very well. We believe that the benefits of these products, coupled with our commercial strategy and their associated communication plans, we continue to make them compelling options for our next patient. 
Our strong 2010 performance, these are not threatened by chance, it was the result of a new way of working, combined with exquisite execution. In line with joint vision for Biogen Idec, we strengthened our global commercial infrastructure, while eliminating unnecessary layers of management and clearing the way for a strong partnership between our strong global and our strong local operations. We enhanced our capabilities in market access, global marketing and other core commercial functions. We hired premium neurologist to run the medical affairs team, increased the size of that team and invested in generating new scientific data for our problems. In addition, we have increased the size of our sales force, and we strengthened  our leadership team by attracting some of the best talent in the industry. 
Another big accomplishment for us in 2010 was the restructuring of our retention, sales and marketing operations, which allowed us to focus on our joint strategic role in the collaboration, while eliminating most of the hour of operational responsibilities. These translated into improved market performance and profitability that will continue into 2011. These priorities are critical, not only to Biogen Idec's 2011 success, but also to building a strong commercial foundation to accommodate future product launches. 
Overall then, we have much to be excited about how we are heading into 2011. We entered the year with positive momentum in both AVONEX and TYSABRI franchises. We have identified opportunities to advance both franchises through better execution, global expansion and, in the case of TYSABRI, risk stratification. And now we have the talent and the resources in place to translate these platforms. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $75 million related to restructuring, $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $28 million of tax impact on these items. 
For the year, the differences are outlined in the earnings presentation. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99 in Q4 and $3.94 for full year 2010. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.42 for Q4 and $5.15 for  full year 2010, which was, as noted, a strong finish to the year. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 8% to $1.2 billion and also grew 8% for full year to $4.7 billion. Going through our product revenues, I'll focus on adding financial detail to Francesco's comments, starting with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 10% to $654 million. AVONEX worldwide reached $2.5 billion in revenue for 2010. In the U.S. where AVONEX grew to $1.5 billion, inventory channel ended at just over two and a quarter weeks, up slightly from last quarter. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $270 million, an 11% increase over Q4 2009, and full year grew 12% to $1, 027,000,000. The international AVONEX business modestly benefited from some tender market sales in Middle East and Russia in Q4. International AVONEX revenue also includes a $4 million hedging gain in Q4 and $35 million in hedged gains for the full year 2010. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide collaboration sales were $333 million in the fourth quarter, growing to $1.2 billion for the year. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $242 million in the fourth quarter, a 12 % increase over prior year. And we recorded TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full year 2010 of $900 million, a 16% increase. 
In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $70 million and grew 9% for the full year to $253 million. Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $172 million, a 12% increase over prior year, which included a $1 million gain from hedging. International TYSABRI revenue for full year 2010 totaled $647 million, a 19% year-over-year increase, which included an $11 million gain from hedging. 
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. Our revenues are broken down to three components. First our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $691 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Q4 revenue was unfavorably impacted by some destocking as inventory in the channel declined. Our profit share from that business was $215 million, up 12%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.8 billion, up 4% and our profit share from that business was $848 million, up 10%. 
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S., and in Q4 this was $34 million, down 26% as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. for the full year was $171 million. And last in the fourth quarter, we are reimbursed $900 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year, we were reimbursed $58 million. 
Moving to royalties. Royalties were $45 million for the fourth quarter and $137 million for the year. In the fourth quarters, our royalties increased sequentially as a result of indiamax [ph]  Moving through a sales-based royalty tier. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $100 million or 8% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $289 million or 24% of revenues. R&D expense for the full year totaled $1.2 billion, approximately 26% of full year revenue. In the fourth quarter, R&D expense benefited from the termination of the lixivaptan program, which was offset by a $10 million true up payment to Roche related to the collaboration amendment. Absent these two changes, we incurred no meaningful R&D milestones in the quarter. Q4 SG&A expense was $273 million, a 15% year-over-year increase as we increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI and increased medical affairs activity. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $68 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q4, as yields on our marketable securities have declined. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 22%, which was driven lower due to the R&D tax credit legislation late in the year. For full year 2010, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%, which included the R&D tax credit in favorable discrete items in prior quarters. 
Let me also call attention to the non-controlling interest line on the P&L. In Q4, we incurred a $25 million pretax charge related to the previously announced termination of our involvement in the lixivaptan program. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average shares were $243 million. Over the course of 2010, we retired over 40.3 million shares related to the two previously communicated share repurchase authorizations. The ability to return cash to shareholders has been a testament to the robust cash flow generation of the company. We ended the year with approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Of note, approximately 47% of our cash and marketable securities is domiciled outside the U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.42 in Q4 and $5.15 for full year, representing a 25% increase over the full year 2009. So 2010 was a year of strong financial performance. Commercial organization executed hard to achieve high-single-digit revenue growth above our original expectations. We appropriately leveraged the P&L with non-GAAP EPS growing by 25%, and our cash growth was exceptional. 
Now I'd like to outline our 2011 financial guidance, which will exclude any significant business development activities. Revenue in 2011 is expected to be between flat and low-single-digit growth. Our estimate includes the impact of some notable items that are projected to reduce our revenue base. First, the RITUXAN business will be impacted by the continuing expiry of ex-U.S. royalties and a reduction in sales and marketing expense reimbursements. We expect the RITUXAN rest of the world revenue to total approximately $80 million to $100 million for 2011.  Second, we don't expect to benefit from the hedged gains we've experienced in 2010. Third, the impact of healthcare reform increases from approximately $15 million in 2010 to approximately $95 million in 2011 across all products. Nevertheless, we expect these headwinds to be offset by continued TYSABRI revenue growth. 
We expect some upward pressure on cost of goods sold as we won't benefit from some of the one-time upsides in 2010. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 24% of revenue. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, reflecting the savings from the change in RITUXAN sales and marketing structure, offset by some commercial investments to compete in the new landscape. Our outlook is designed to capture the economic upside from the November restructuring, aiming to achieve a yearly run rate savings of $300 million by the second half of 2011. As a result, we expect the combination of R&D plus SG&A expenditures to decline by high-single-digit percent. 
Our effective tax rate, both GAAP and non-GAAP is expected to be between 26% and 28% of profit before tax. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be above $5.70 and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.82. We expect CapEx in the range of between $200 million and $220 million. Overall, the financial plan is designed to allow resources to move forward our late-stage pipeline, defend the commercial business and drive double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

If I see goals for 2011, first, I will plan to maximize our financial performance without compromising the long-term cause of the business. Our 2011 goal is to deliver double-digit earnings growth, realizing the economic benefits of the restructuring we did last fall. 
Second, we plan to grow our share of the MS market. Our 2011 goal is to grow AVONEX share in the ABCRE market and to continue to grow TYSABRI share overall. Third, we plan to aggressively pursue the serological assay and TYSABRI risk ratification efforts. Our 2011 goal is to provide these important insights to the neurology community subsequent to a label update. 
Fourth, we plan to aggressively advance the late-stage pipeline. Our 2011 goals include filing an NDA for BG-12, completing the enrollments in the Peginterferon Phase III trial, completing and communicating the final results of the select daclizumab Phase II registrational trial, continuing to advance the Phase III daclizumab design trial, initiating this experiment in Factor VIII new trial and completing the enrollment in our Factor VIII and Factor IX physical trial. 
In addition, formed aggressively for our external opportunities to enhance our portfolio, and we now have in place a team that can do that positively and effectively. 
Fifth and finally, our planned calls for continuing to drive true cultural change at Biogen Idec, building on a new sense of urgency and [indiscernible] of the company. So before I close, I want to thank all of Biogen Idec's employees for their contributions, without which we couldn't achieve our goals and for the positive and progressive attitude with which they've embraced our new vision. We've had quite a bit to be excited about and are looking forward for 2011 and beyond. 
So with that, we'll close our remarks and open up the call for questions."

I don't think our expectations are meaningful unit gains when you combine what's going on in the United States, with natural kind of unit growth that continues outside the United States. The $300 million target savings is pure savings.

We feel very comfortable that the data in the United States both on touch forms, which are in kind of an analogue to prescriptions as well as discontinuations, are pretty robust. In that when we articulate the U.S. information, it's based off of the risk management program, and it's pretty good. Outside the United States, when we provide total worldwide information, it's actually the triangulation of information, including shipments and units and country-by-country data. And that would extend also to the patient utilization numbers that you referred to at the beginning of your math, I think that kind of 77,000 number. So I think we just wanted to be guarded by taking those and then driving it down to very, very specific trends. These are kind of broad, particularly outside the United States, broad kind of unit trends and patient trend numbers."

Our Q4 2010 was a very good finish to a very good year, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap our 2010 results and accomplishments. So financially, we finished 2010 with an all-around strong performance. AVONEX Q4 revenue grew by 10% on a year-over-year basis, TYSABRI Q4 revenue grew by 12% year-over-year, which drove a solid 8% growth in total Q4 revenues year-over-year.  For the full year 2010, total revenues also grew by 8% over 2009, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 25% for the full year. 
During 2010, we also returned over $2 billion in cash to shareholders and generated over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Francesco and Paul will provide more financial details later in the call, but suffice it to say that we entered 2011 in a strong financial position with solid momentum. 
In 2010, we also clarified Biogen Idec's strategic focus. As you know, we terminated our oncology and cardiovascular pipelines in order to focus on neurodegenerative diseases, hematology and selected high value biological drugs. We're now focusing on what we do best and on what patients need the most. 
We streamlined the company, which will result in annual cost savings of about $300 million. Paul Clancy will go into the financials in more detail later in the call. And we've made two very important hires surrounding our management team, and I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
2010 was also very strong commercially with significantly improved AVONEX unit sales trends, particularly in the U.S., where we delivered what is now three straight quarters of U.S. sales of around 170,000 units. We enrolled more than 14,700 patients in our two U.S. stratified trials, validating what we believe is strong interest among patients and physicians in TYSABRI risk stratification. And we filed applications to our U.S. and EU TYSABRI [ph] to include anti-JC virus antibody status as an additional factor to help stratify the PML risk. It has been a strong year for our commercial organization, and I commend them on their achievements. 
One recent disappointment has been the negative opinion we received from the CHMP on FAMPYRA. The CHMP was not convinced that 25-foot timed walk was an adequate measure of overall walking ability and had questions about the responder analysis used in the trial. We are of course disappointed by the decision, and we continue to believe strongly that the drug provides a meaningful benefit to many MS patients with walking impairments. We plan to appeal the decision, a process that takes typically six to seven months, and we'll update you on the status of our appeal at an appropriate time. 
Otherwise, the R&D organization made significant progress in 2010. We initiated two new Phase III programs, one for daclizumab in MS and the other for our prolonged half-life Factor VIII in hemophilia A. We initiated human trials for our inside LINGO antibody, which has the potential to repair to the myelinated lesions in our patients, and we have made some late stage pipeline. In 2011, we anticipate Phase III data for BG-12, our first oral MS compound, Phase II registrational data for daclizumab, a promising MS therapy  with unique mechanism of action. 
In 2010, our Business Development Team delivered three important new deals: First, the restructuring of our anti-CD20 agreement that strengthens our collaboration with Genentech and Roche; an acquisition from Neurimmune of early stage programs that address three key central nervous system targets; and a collaboration with Knopp Biosciences on a promising new potential therapy for ALS, a disease which is very high on that need. Together, these accomplishments position us well for strong performance in 2011. 
Before I close, let me take a moment here and talk about the two new additions to our senior management team. Steve Holtzman, the Founder, Chairman and former CEO of Infinity Pharmaceuticals and Former Chief Business Officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals and a track record of doing creative and groundbreaking deals, and Steve will lead our Corporate Development organization; Doug Williams, who was formerly Head of Research in Imunex, when they brought Enbrel forward and was also formerly the Head of R&D and later CEO of ZymoGenetics has a great knowledge for knowing how to turn science into products and doubling our Research and Development organization. Steve and Doug are not only are extraordinarily talented, but are great human beings as well. With the addition of Steve and Doug to Paul, Francesco, Al and the rest of the team here, I believe that we now have the talent and the team that can take Biogen Idec to the next level. 
In summary then, 2010  was the beginning of a transformative period of Biogen Idec. We performed well and laid the groundwork for a successful 2011 by restructuring the organization, recruiting top talent and putting in place a high-performance culture. I'll now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our new the R&D head, who will give you the thoughts on what makes a great R&D organization, and his approach to advancing our pipeline. Welcome, Doug."

Before I begin, I just wanted to say to those of you listening to the conference call and to my colleagues in the R&D organization that I'm very excited to be joining Biogen Idec. My job is to build on the already solid science that Biogen Idec has and to advance and strengthen our R&D pipeline to deliver meaningful benefits to patients and add value to our shareholders. As you know, I've been part of a large biotech, bringing Enbrel and LEUKINE to market, but I've also been part of an entrepreneurial company. Whether it's large or small, I see common denominators in both, underlying what makes a great organization. As a result, my focus for increasing R&D productivity will center on, first, bringing forward only those programs that offer real differentiated benefits to patients. There's already a strong commitment in the organization to this, but we need to improve upon our past R&D performance by accelerating high-priority internal candidates and assuring that we adequately resource them.  We will be more disciplined in evaluating our pipeline programs. 
Second, we need to improve decision making across the organization. I plan to build on the momentum that George has already begun by evaluating and streamlining program structures so that we can cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit and a sense of urgency in the company. 
Third, we need to be agnostic about which programs we pursue, whether they're internal or external.  We'll become a preferred partner for external emerging biotech companies to further strengthen our pipeline. George, Steve and I can translate our experiences leading small entrepreneurial companies into forging effective new partnerships to sustain our long-term growth and, at the same time, meeting the needs of our partners. We have a keen understanding of what elements in the collaboration will be important for our future partners, having spent many years in that position as the smaller company in collaborations with large pharma and biotech. 
Ultimately, I want to harness the passion for innovation that we already have here among the many talented scientists and inspire a new sense of focus, clarity and urgency. In the short-term, we'll build on our historical strengths in neurology and immunology and support the late stage hemophilia programs. We'll further strengthen this company by improving decision making, assuring we effectively resource the highest priority in most differentiated programs and retaining our commitment to bringing true benefits to patients. 
Now I'd like to transition to updates from our late-stage neurology pipeline, which is clearly a priority for me and where we have a number of significant data events this year. We filed in December with the FDA and EMA proposed labeling to include anti-JC virus antibody status as another potential factor to help stratify the risk of PML. We're also working to make an anti-JC virus antibody assay commercially available sometime this year. We expect data readouts from both of our Phase III studies of our oral MS treatment, BG-12, later this year. BG-12 is unique among oral MS therapies because it acts as a [ph] protective agent as well as having immune effects. The active agent in BG-12 is the newest in psoriasis for many years and has an established safety profile. We believe this affords the opportunity to pursue combination therapy that have already initiated a Phase II study to explore this approach to treating MS. 
We plan to initiate a Phase III trial of dexpramipexole for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease in the first half of this year. Dex has received orphan drug designation both in the U.S. and EU, as well as fast-track designation in the U.S. Dex has shown positive results in Phase II, and this program is an important part of our strategy to advance therapies for unmet needs in other neurological diseases. 
And in the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registrational trials for daclizumab. This drug targets the pathogenic T cells in MS through a novel mechanism and Phase II studies have shown solid efficacy and promising safety with the convenience of once-monthly subcutaneous dosing.  As for our hemophilia programs, we continue to rapidly enroll patients in our registrational studies, with data readouts from both B-LONG and A-LONG expected in 2012. 
Turning to RITUXAN life cycle management activities, last week, we and our partner Genentech, a member of the Roche group, announced FDA approval for the use of RITUXAN as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma who responded to initial treatment with RITUXAN plus chemotherapy. Our [indiscernible] date for RITUXAN and ANCA-associated vasculitis, a rare debilitating disease with no approved therapy, is April 19. While I'll be focusing heavily on maturing these late-stage programs, I'll also be looking into the earlier-staged candidates to evaluate them for their future potential and therapeutic differentiation.
So in summary, while I've only been here for three weeks, I feel very privileged to be part of a biotech company with such a tremendous legacy, one that's developed three drugs that have transformed the lives of thousands of patients. Biogen Idec has great science and a team of individuals committed to making the company the leading biotech enterprise in the industry. I've known and admired George and Steve for many years and now have the privilege with interacting with the rest of the management team. This is as solid a team as I've ever seen, and there's an unwavering commitment to take this company to the next level. 
With that, I'll pass the call over to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Head of Global Commercial Operations."
29726,118367384,98012,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. And good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance ended the year on a high note. I'm pleased to say that in 2010, we achieved our main goal, which was to stabilize our global MS patient sh",944,"Thank you, Doug. And good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance ended the year on a high note. I'm pleased to say that in 2010, we achieved our main goal, which was to stabilize our global MS patient share by abating the decline in our share in the U.S. and growing TYSABRI share globally. This contributed to our 10% global sales growth, driven by strong performances from both AVONEX and TYSABRI. 
Let me take a moment to discuss each franchise in more detail, and I'm going to focus on market share and unit sales. Later in the call, Paul Clancy will provide more information on revenue, including the impact on foreign exchange and pricing. 
Starting with AVONEX, our performance in the U.S. has improved tremendously. We have had three consecutive quarters now for sale around the 170,000 unit mark after four years of unit sales declines. This is thanks to our strong commercial leadership team, the overall organization, and thanks to the plan we have implemented. Our 2011 goal now is to put our U.S. AVONEX franchise back on an ABCRE market share growth trajectory. 
Outside the U.S., after a period of decline, we achieved some AVONEX market share growth in Q4. Keep in mind that in a multi-billion market, even small changes in market share can translate into significant revenue growth, thus, our focus on share. 
AVONEX unit demand grew by a solid 6% and the overall market continued to expand. AVONEX is now licensed in more than 85 countries and continues to gain share in many of them. In Japan for example, AVONEX market share crossed the 30% threshold in 2010. AVONEX full year revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was 46%. In 2010, AVONEX was newly approved in South Korea, Hong Kong, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lebanon and Panama. 
Moving on to TYSABRI performance, 2010 worldwide market TYSABRI revenue exceeded the $1.2 billion, an increase of 16% versus 2009. We ended the year with 56,600 patients, an increase of 8,200 patients or 72% over 2009, and we continue to gain market share. Worldwide, net patient additions averaged 133 per week, down from 162 during the third quarter. This drop in patient addition is something we are watching but nothing that we are overly concerned about. In fact, new TYSABRI patient inflows in the U.S. have been stable, a reflection of the confidence that physicians and patients have in the value of TYSABRI and the affirmation of the effectiveness of our commercial communication strategy. There's no doubt what's called [ph] in the U.S. discontinuation, which could be the result of a number of factors including time on TYSABRI, treatment interruptions, JCV antibodies, [ph] and new competition. The important point however, is that TYSABRI continues to grow in the U.S. In fact, during 2010, we added 3,100 commercial U.S. TYSABRI patients. This is very good, very strong growth. 
In addition, there are now more than 14,000 patients who have been recruited on the STRATIFY-2 trial in the U.S., which suggests the tremendous amount of interest in risk stratification, potentially unlocking TYSABRI growth over the midterm. TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 21% and unit grew by 23%. 
During 2010, TYSABRI were approved in Russia, Argentina, Columbia, Guatemala, Honduras, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Morocco and Panama raising the total number of countries where TYSABRI is approved to more than 30. In December, TYSABRI goes to India. Much has been made lately about competition from [ph]. We expect the overall market to grow as a result of a new entry and that we expect [ph] to gain market share and meet the needs of the segment of the marketplace. However, to date, as I just described, both AVONEX and TYSABRI have performed very well. We believe that the benefits of these products, coupled with our commercial strategy and their associated communication plans, we continue to make them compelling options for MS patients. 
Our strong 2010 performance, did not happen by chance. It was the result of a new way of working, combined with exquisite execution. In line with joint vision for Biogen Idec, we strengthened our global commercial infrastructure, while eliminating unnecessary layers of management and clearing the way for a strong partnership between our strong global and our strong local operations. We enhanced our capabilities in market access, global marketing and other core commercial functions. We hired a preeminent neurologist to run the medical affairs team, increased the size of that team and invested in generating new scientific data for our products. In addition, we have increased the size of our sales force, and we strengthened our leadership team by attracting some of the best talent in the industry. 
Another big accomplishment for us in 2010 was the restructuring of our RITUXAN sales and marketing operations, which allowed us to focus on our joint strategic role in the collaboration, while eliminating most of the [ph] operational responsibilities. This translated into improved market performance and profitability that will continue into 2011. These priorities are critical, not only to Biogen Idec's 2011 success, but also to building a strong commercial foundation to accommodate future product launches. 
Overall then, we have much to be excited about how we are heading into 2011. We entered the year with positive momentum in both AVONEX and TYSABRI franchises. We have identified opportunities to advance both franchises through better execution, global expansion and, in the case of TYSABRI, risk stratification. And now we have the talent and the resources in place to translate these platforms [ph]. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"
29726,118367384,98012,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francesco. I'll start with our GAAP financials which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the q",1344,"Thanks, Francesco. I'll start with our GAAP financials which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $75 million related to restructuring, $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $28 million of tax impact on these items. 
For the year, the differences are outlined in the earnings presentation. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99 in Q4 and $3.94 for full year 2010. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.42 for Q4 and $5.15 for  full year 2010, which was, as noted, a strong finish to the year. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 8% to $1.2 billion and also grew 8% for full year to $4.7 billion. Going through our product revenues, I'll focus on adding financial detail to Francesco's comments, starting with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 10% to $654 million. AVONEX worldwide reached $2.5 billion in revenue for 2010. In the U.S. where AVONEX grew to $1.5 billion, inventory in the channel ended at just over two and a quarter weeks, up slightly from last quarter. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $270 million, an 11% increase over Q4 2009, and full year grew 12% to $1,027,000,000. The international AVONEX business modestly benefited from some tender market sales in Middle East and Russia in Q4. International AVONEX revenue also includes a $4 million hedging gain in Q4 and $35 million in hedged gains for the full year 2010. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide collaboration sales were $333 million in the fourth quarter, growing to $1.2 billion for the year. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $242 million in the fourth quarter, a 12% increase over prior year. And we recorded TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full year 2010 of $900 million, a 16% increase. 
In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $70 million and grew 9% for the full year to $253 million. Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $172 million, a 12% increase over prior year, which included a $1 million gain from hedging. International TYSABRI revenue for full year 2010 totaled $647 million, a 19% year-over-year increase, which included an $11 million gain from hedging. 
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. Our revenues are broken down to three components. First our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $691 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Q4 revenue was unfavorably impacted by some destocking as inventory in the channel declined. Our profit share from that business was $215 million, up 12%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.8 billion, up 4% and our profit share from that business was $848 million, up 10%. 
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S., and in Q4 this was $34 million, down 26% as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. for the full year was $171 million. And last, in the fourth quarter, we are reimbursed $9 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year, we were reimbursed $58 million. 
Moving to royalties. Royalties were $45 million for the fourth quarter and $137 million for the year. In the fourth quarters, our royalties increased sequentially as a result of indiamax [ph] moving through a sales-based royalty tier. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $100 million or 8% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $289 million or 24% of revenues. R&D expense for the full year totaled $1.2 billion, approximately 26% of full year revenue. In the fourth quarter, R&D expense benefited from the termination of the lixivaptan program, which was offset by a $10 million true up payment to Roche related to the collaboration amendment. Absent these two changes, we incurred no meaningful R&D milestones in the quarter. Q4 SG&A expense was $273 million, a 15% year-over-year increase as we increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI and increased medical affairs activity. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $68 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q4, as yields on our marketable securities have declined. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 22%, which was driven lower due to the R&D tax credit legislation late in the year. For full year 2010, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%, which included the R&D tax credit in favorable discrete items in prior quarters. 
Let me also call attention to the non-controlling interest line on the P&L. In Q4, we incurred a $25 million pretax charge related to the previously announced termination of our involvement in the lixivaptan program. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average shares were $243 million. Over the course of 2010, we retired over 40.3 million shares related to the two previously communicated share repurchase authorizations. The ability to return cash to shareholders has been a testament to the robust cash flow generation of the company. We ended the year with approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Of note, approximately 47% of our cash and marketable securities is domiciled outside the U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.42 in Q4 and $5.15 for full year, representing a 25% increase over the full year 2009. So 2010 was a year of strong financial performance. Commercial organization executed hard to achieve high-single-digit revenue growth above our original expectations. We appropriately leveraged the P&L with non-GAAP EPS growing by 25%, and our cash flow was exceptional. 
Now I'd like to outline our 2011 financial guidance, which will exclude any significant business development activities. Revenue in 2011 is expected to be between flat and low-single-digit growth. Our estimate includes the impact of some notable items that are projected to reduce our revenue base. First, the RITUXAN business will be impacted by the continuing expiry of ex-U.S. royalties and a reduction in sales and marketing expense reimbursement. We expect the RITUXAN rest-of-world revenue to total approximately $80 million to $100 million for 2011.  Second, we don't expect to benefit from the hedge gains we've experienced in 2010. Third, the impact of healthcare reform increases from approximately $15 million in 2010 to approximately $95 million in 2011 across all products. Nevertheless, we expect these headwinds to be offset by continued TYSABRI revenue growth. 
We expect some upward pressure on cost of goods sold as we won't benefit from some of the one-time upsides in 2010. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 24% of revenue. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, reflecting the savings from the change in RITUXAN sales and marketing structure, offset by some commercial investments to compete in the new landscape. Our outlook is designed to capture the economic upside from the November restructuring, aiming to achieve a yearly run rate savings of $300 million by the second half of 2011. As a result, we expect the combination of R&D plus SG&A expenditures to decline by high-single-digit percent. 
Our effective tax rate, both GAAP and non-GAAP is expected to be between 26% and 28% of profit before tax. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be above $5.70 and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.82. We expect CapEx in the range of $200 million and $220 million. Overall, the financial plan is designed to allow resources to move forward our late-stage pipeline, defend the commercial business and drive double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

We had a good 2010 and we intend to build upon that now as we move through 2011. We have five key goals for 2011.
First, we plan to maximize our financial performance without compromising the long-term health of the business. Our 2011 goal is to deliver double-digit earnings growth, realizing the economic benefits of the restructuring we did last fall. 
Second, we plan to grow our share of the MS market. Our 2011 goal is to grow AVONEX share in the ABCRE market and to continue to grow TYSABRI share overall.
Third, we plan to aggressively pursue the serological assay and TYSABRI risk ratification efforts. Our 2011 goal is to provide these important insights to the neurology community subsequent to a label update. 
Fourth, we plan to aggressively advance the late-stage pipeline. Our 2011 goals include filing an NDA for BG-12, completing the enrollments in the Peginterferon Phase III trial, completing and communicating the final results of the select daclizumab Phase II registrational trial, continuing to advance the Phase III daclizumab design trial, initiating [ph] Phase III trial and completing enrollment in our Factor VIII and Factor IX physical trial. In addition, we’ll aggressively explore external opportunities to enhance our portfolio, and we now have in place a team that can do that thoughtfully and effectively. 
Fifth and finally, our plan calls for continuing to drive true cultural change at Biogen Idec, building on a new sense of urgency and nimbleness at the company. So before I close, I want to thank all of Biogen Idec's employees for their contributions, without which we couldn't achieve our goals and for the positive and productive attitude with which they've embraced our new vision. We've had quite a bit to be excited about and are looking forward for 2011 and beyond.

So specifically on the guidance, what's embedded is simply what has already been taken in the marketplace. What we see in the marketplace, with respect to overall market growth, is low-single-digit in the United States for the market and kind of higher single-digit outside the United States. I think one thing to point to, that's interesting is that we have seen with the new entrants that it has the potential to expand the market. So we don't, per se, have that built into our forecast, but that's a heartening kind of early indicator in a dynamic in the marketplace."

And then secondly, it sounds like your guidance assumes pretty much a flat share count in 2011. So are you not expecting any share buyback or is that upside?"

The guidance assumes essentially where we ended the year with respect to shares. So on an ongoing basis, we have essentially assumed share stabilization.

We have a new team here in place that is very adept and very experienced at that in really try to build and enrich the pipeline. If we have excess cash flow, we'll look towards returning that the shareholders and the most appropriate way. But I think the way you framed it as the potential of upside is probably the decent way to think about it. We just don't want to get the SKUs too far ahead of our nose on that one. With respect to pricing, the dynamic that you're maybe seeing is kind of an FX or the hedge gains that will cut down on a year-to-year basis.

So certainly we'll continue to focus on immunological things and the anti-inflammatory aspects. But not only that, obviously, we have to be focused on neurology as well, so we'll see. We're happy to have Doug here as a very seasoned, a very successful R&D head, and who will not only take our internal projects forward, but I think help us in a very thoughtful analyses of opportunities we see on the outside."

Our Q4 2010 was a very good finish to a very good year, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap our 2010 results and accomplishments. So financially, we finished 2010 with an all-around strong performance. AVONEX Q4 revenue grew by 10% on a year-over-year basis, TYSABRI Q4 revenue grew by 12% year-over-year, which drove a solid 8% growth in total Q4 revenues year-over-year.  For the full year 2010, total revenues also grew by 8% over 2009, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 25% for the full year. 
During 2010, we also returned over $2 billion in cash to shareholders and generated over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Francesco and Paul will provide more financial details later in the call, but suffice it to say that we entered 2011 in a strong financial position with solid momentum. 
In 2010, we also clarified Biogen Idec's strategic focus. As you know, we terminated our oncology and cardiovascular pipelines in order to focus on neurodegenerative diseases, hematology and selected high value biological drugs. We're now focusing on what we do best and on what patients need the most. 
We streamlined the company, which will result in annual cost savings of about $300 million. Paul Clancy will go into the financials in more detail later in the call. And we've made two very important hires surrounding our management team, and I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
2010 was also very strong commercially with significantly improved AVONEX unit sales trends, particularly in the U.S., where we delivered what is now three straight quarters of U.S. sales of around 170,000 units. We enrolled more than 14,700 patients in our two U.S. stratified trials, validating what we believe is strong interest among patients and physicians in TYSABRI risk stratification. And we filed applications to our U.S. and EU TYSABRI [ph] to include anti-JC virus antibody status as an additional factor to help stratify the PML risk. It has been a strong year for our commercial organization, and I commend them on their achievements. 
One recent disappointment has been the negative opinion we received from the CHMP on FAMPYRA. The CHMP was not convinced that 25-foot timed walk was an adequate measure of overall walking ability and had questions about the responder analysis used in the trial. We are of course disappointed by the decision, and we continue to believe strongly that the drug provides a meaningful benefit to many MS patients with walking impairments. We plan to appeal the decision, a process that takes typically six to seven months, and we'll update you on the status of our appeal at an appropriate time. 
Otherwise, the R&D organization made significant progress in 2010. We initiated two new Phase III programs, one for daclizumab in MS and the other for our prolonged half-life Factor VIII in hemophilia A. We initiated human trials for our inside LINGO antibody, which has the potential to repair to the myelinated lesions in our patients, and we have made some late stage pipeline. In 2011, we anticipate Phase III data for BG-12, our first oral MS compound, Phase II registrational data for daclizumab, a promising MS therapy  with unique mechanism of action. 
In 2010, our Business Development Team delivered three important new deals: First, the restructuring of our anti-CD20 agreement that strengthens our collaboration with Genentech and Roche; an acquisition from Neurimmune of early stage programs that address three key central nervous system targets; and a collaboration with Knopp Biosciences on a promising new potential therapy for ALS, a disease which is very high on that need. Together, these accomplishments position us well for strong performance in 2011. 
Before I close, let me take a moment here and talk about the two new additions to our senior management team. Steve Holtzman, the Founder, Chairman and former CEO of Infinity Pharmaceuticals and Former Chief Business Officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals and a track record of doing creative and groundbreaking deals, and Steve will lead our Corporate Development organization; Doug Williams, who was formerly Head of Research in Imunex, when they brought Enbrel forward and was also formerly the Head of R&D and later CEO of ZymoGenetics has a great knowledge for knowing how to turn science into products and doubling our Research and Development organization. Steve and Doug are not only are extraordinarily talented, but are great human beings as well. With the addition of Steve and Doug to Paul, Francesco, Al and the rest of the team here, I believe that we now have the talent and the team that can take Biogen Idec to the next level. 
In summary then, 2010  was the beginning of a transformative period of Biogen Idec. We performed well and laid the groundwork for a successful 2011 by restructuring the organization, recruiting top talent and putting in place a high-performance culture. I'll now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our new the R&D head, who will give you the thoughts on what makes a great R&D organization, and his approach to advancing our pipeline. Welcome, Doug."
29726,118367384,98380,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George. Before I begin, I just wanted to say to those of you listening to the conference call and to my colleagues in the R&D organization that I'm very excited to be joining Biogen Idec. My job is to build on the already solid science that Bio",936,"Thank you, George. Before I begin, I just wanted to say to those of you listening to the conference call and to my colleagues in the R&D organization that I'm very excited to be joining Biogen Idec. My job is to build on the already solid science that Biogen Idec has and to advance and strengthen our R&D pipeline to deliver meaningful benefits to patients and add value to our shareholders. As you know, I've been part of a large biotech, bringing Enbrel and LEUKINE to market, but I've also been part of an entrepreneurial company. Whether it's large or small, I see common denominators in both, underlying what makes a great organization. As a result, my focus for increasing R&D productivity will center on, first, bringing forward only those programs that offer real differentiated benefits to patients. There's already a strong commitment in the organization to this, but we need to improve upon our past R&D performance by accelerating high-priority internal candidates and assuring that we adequately resource them.  We will be more disciplined in evaluating our pipeline programs. 
Second, we need to improve decision making across the organization. I plan to build on the momentum that George has already begun by evaluating and streamlining program structures so that we can cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit and a sense of urgency in the company. 
Third, we need to be agnostic about which programs we pursue, whether they're internal or external.  We'll become a preferred partner for external emerging biotech companies to further strengthen our pipeline. George, Steve and I can translate our experiences leading small entrepreneurial companies into forging effective new partnerships to sustain our long-term growth and, at the same time, meeting the needs of our partners. We have a keen understanding of what elements in the collaboration will be important for our future partners, having spent many years in that position as the smaller company in collaborations with large pharma and biotech. 
Ultimately, I want to harness the passion for innovation that we already have here among the many talented scientists and inspire a new sense of focus, clarity and urgency. In the short-term, we'll build on our historical strengths in neurology and immunology and support the late stage hemophilia programs. We'll further strengthen this company by improving decision making, assuring we effectively resource the highest priority in most differentiated programs and retaining our commitment to bringing true benefits to patients. 
Now I'd like to transition to updates from our late-stage neurology pipeline, which is clearly a priority for me and where we have a number of significant data events this year. We filed in December with the FDA and EMA proposed labeling to include anti-JC virus antibody status as another potential factor to help stratify the risk of PML. We're also working to make an anti-JC virus antibody assay commercially available sometime this year. We expect data readouts from both of our Phase III studies of our oral MS treatment, BG-12, later this year. BG-12 is unique among oral MS therapies because it acts as a [ph] protective agent as well as having immune effects. The active agent in BG-12 is the newest in psoriasis for many years and has an established safety profile. We believe this affords the opportunity to pursue combination therapy that have already initiated a Phase II study to explore this approach to treating MS. 
We plan to initiate a Phase III trial of dexpramipexole for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease in the first half of this year. Dex has received orphan drug designation both in the U.S. and EU, as well as fast-track designation in the U.S. Dex has shown positive results in Phase II, and this program is an important part of our strategy to advance therapies for unmet needs in other neurological diseases. 
And in the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registrational trials for daclizumab. This drug targets the pathogenic T cells in MS through a novel mechanism and Phase II studies have shown solid efficacy and promising safety with the convenience of once-monthly subcutaneous dosing.  As for our hemophilia programs, we continue to rapidly enroll patients in our registrational studies, with data readouts from both B-LONG and A-LONG expected in 2012. 
Turning to RITUXAN life cycle management activities, last week, we and our partner Genentech, a member of the Roche group, announced FDA approval for the use of RITUXAN as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma who responded to initial treatment with RITUXAN plus chemotherapy. Our [indiscernible] date for RITUXAN and ANCA-associated vasculitis, a rare debilitating disease with no approved therapy, is April 19. While I'll be focusing heavily on maturing these late-stage programs, I'll also be looking into the earlier-staged candidates to evaluate them for their future potential and therapeutic differentiation.
So in summary, while I've only been here for three weeks, I feel very privileged to be part of a biotech company with such a tremendous legacy, one that's developed three drugs that have transformed the lives of thousands of patients. Biogen Idec has great science and a team of individuals committed to making the company the leading biotech enterprise in the industry. I've known and admired George and Steve for many years and now have the privilege with interacting with the rest of the management team. This is as solid a team as I've ever seen, and there's an unwavering commitment to take this company to the next level. 
With that, I'll pass the call over to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Head of Global Commercial Operations."

As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance ended the year on a high note. I'm pleased to say that in 2010, we achieved our main goal, which was to stabilize our global MS patient share by abating the decline in our share in the U.S. and growing TYSABRI share globally. This contributed to our 10% global sales growth, driven by strong performances from both AVONEX and TYSABRI. 
Let me take a moment to discuss each franchise in more detail, and I'm going to focus on market share and unit sales. Later in the call, Paul Clancy will provide more information on revenue, including the impact on foreign exchange and pricing. 
Starting with AVONEX, our performance in the U.S. has improved tremendously. We have had three consecutive quarters now for sale around the 170,000 unit mark after four years of unit sales declines. This is thanks to our strong commercial leadership team, the overall organization, and thanks to the plan we have implemented. Our 2011 goal now is to put our U.S. AVONEX franchise back on an ABCRE market share growth trajectory. 
Outside the U.S., after a period of decline, we achieved some AVONEX market share growth in Q4. Keep in mind that in a multi-billion market, even small changes in market share can translate into significant revenue growth, thus, our focus on share. 
AVONEX unit demand grew by a solid 6% and the overall market continued to expand. AVONEX is now licensed in more than 85 countries and continues to gain share in many of them. In Japan for example, AVONEX market share crossed the 30% threshold in 2010. AVONEX full year revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was 46%. In 2010, AVONEX was newly approved in South Korea, Hong Kong, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lebanon and Panama. 
Moving on to TYSABRI performance, 2010 worldwide market TYSABRI revenue exceeded the $1.2 billion, an increase of 16% versus 2009. We ended the year with 56,600 patients, an increase of 8,200 patients or 72% over 2009, and we continue to gain market share. Worldwide, net patient additions averaged 133 per week, down from 162 during the third quarter. This drop in patient addition is something we are watching but nothing that we are overly concerned about. In fact, new TYSABRI patient inflows in the U.S. have been stable, a reflection of the confidence that physicians and patients have in the value of TYSABRI and the affirmation of the effectiveness of our commercial communication strategy. There's no doubt what's called [ph] in the U.S. discontinuation, which could be the result of a number of factors including time on TYSABRI, treatment interruptions, JCV antibodies, [ph] and new competition. The important point however, is that TYSABRI continues to grow in the U.S. In fact, during 2010, we added 3,100 commercial U.S. TYSABRI patients. This is very good, very strong growth. 
In addition, there are now more than 14,000 patients who have been recruited on the STRATIFY-2 trial in the U.S., which suggests the tremendous amount of interest in risk stratification, potentially unlocking TYSABRI growth over the midterm. TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 21% and unit grew by 23%. 
During 2010, TYSABRI were approved in Russia, Argentina, Columbia, Guatemala, Honduras, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Morocco and Panama raising the total number of countries where TYSABRI is approved to more than 30. In December, TYSABRI goes to India. Much has been made lately about competition from [ph]. We expect the overall market to grow as a result of a new entry and that we expect [ph] to gain market share and meet the needs of the segment of the marketplace. However, to date, as I just described, both AVONEX and TYSABRI have performed very well. We believe that the benefits of these products, coupled with our commercial strategy and their associated communication plans, we continue to make them compelling options for MS patients. 
Our strong 2010 performance, did not happen by chance. It was the result of a new way of working, combined with exquisite execution. In line with joint vision for Biogen Idec, we strengthened our global commercial infrastructure, while eliminating unnecessary layers of management and clearing the way for a strong partnership between our strong global and our strong local operations. We enhanced our capabilities in market access, global marketing and other core commercial functions. We hired a preeminent neurologist to run the medical affairs team, increased the size of that team and invested in generating new scientific data for our products. In addition, we have increased the size of our sales force, and we strengthened our leadership team by attracting some of the best talent in the industry. 
Another big accomplishment for us in 2010 was the restructuring of our RITUXAN sales and marketing operations, which allowed us to focus on our joint strategic role in the collaboration, while eliminating most of the [ph] operational responsibilities. This translated into improved market performance and profitability that will continue into 2011. These priorities are critical, not only to Biogen Idec's 2011 success, but also to building a strong commercial foundation to accommodate future product launches. 
Overall then, we have much to be excited about how we are heading into 2011. We entered the year with positive momentum in both AVONEX and TYSABRI franchises. We have identified opportunities to advance both franchises through better execution, global expansion and, in the case of TYSABRI, risk stratification. And now we have the talent and the resources in place to translate these platforms [ph]. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"
29726,118367384,98380,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2011",2011-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francesco.

Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $75 million related to restructuring, $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $28 million of tax impact on these items. 
For the year, the differences are outlined in the earnings presentation. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99 in Q4 and $3.94 for full year 2010. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.42 for Q4 and $5.15 for  full year 2010, which was, as noted, a strong finish to the year. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 8% to $1.2 billion and also grew 8% for full year to $4.7 billion. Going through our product revenues, I'll focus on adding financial detail to Francesco's comments, starting with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 10% to $654 million. AVONEX worldwide reached $2.5 billion in revenue for 2010. In the U.S. where AVONEX grew to $1.5 billion, inventory in the channel ended at just over two and a quarter weeks, up slightly from last quarter. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $270 million, an 11% increase over Q4 2009, and full year grew 12% to $1,027,000,000. The international AVONEX business modestly benefited from some tender market sales in Middle East and Russia in Q4. International AVONEX revenue also includes a $4 million hedging gain in Q4 and $35 million in hedged gains for the full year 2010. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide collaboration sales were $333 million in the fourth quarter, growing to $1.2 billion for the year. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $242 million in the fourth quarter, a 12% increase over prior year. And we recorded TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full year 2010 of $900 million, a 16% increase. 
In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $70 million and grew 9% for the full year to $253 million. Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $172 million, a 12% increase over prior year, which included a $1 million gain from hedging. International TYSABRI revenue for full year 2010 totaled $647 million, a 19% year-over-year increase, which included an $11 million gain from hedging. 
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. Our revenues are broken down to three components. First our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $691 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Q4 revenue was unfavorably impacted by some destocking as inventory in the channel declined. Our profit share from that business was $215 million, up 12%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.8 billion, up 4% and our profit share from that business was $848 million, up 10%. 
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S., and in Q4 this was $34 million, down 26% as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside of the U.S. for the full year was $171 million. And last, in the fourth quarter, we are reimbursed $9 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year, we were reimbursed $58 million. 
Moving to royalties. Royalties were $45 million for the fourth quarter and $137 million for the year. In the fourth quarters, our royalties increased sequentially as a result of indiamax [ph] moving through a sales-based royalty tier. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $100 million or 8% of revenues. Q4 R&D expense was $289 million or 24% of revenues. R&D expense for the full year totaled $1.2 billion, approximately 26% of full year revenue. In the fourth quarter, R&D expense benefited from the termination of the lixivaptan program, which was offset by a $10 million true up payment to Roche related to the collaboration amendment. Absent these two changes, we incurred no meaningful R&D milestones in the quarter. Q4 SG&A expense was $273 million, a 15% year-over-year increase as we increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI and increased medical affairs activity. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $68 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q4, as yields on our marketable securities have declined. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 22%, which was driven lower due to the R&D tax credit legislation late in the year. For full year 2010, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%, which included the R&D tax credit in favorable discrete items in prior quarters. 
Let me also call attention to the non-controlling interest line on the P&L. In Q4, we incurred a $25 million pretax charge related to the previously announced termination of our involvement in the lixivaptan program. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average shares were $243 million. Over the course of 2010, we retired over 40.3 million shares related to the two previously communicated share repurchase authorizations. The ability to return cash to shareholders has been a testament to the robust cash flow generation of the company. We ended the year with approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Of note, approximately 47% of our cash and marketable securities is domiciled outside the U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.42 in Q4 and $5.15 for full year, representing a 25% increase over the full year 2009. So 2010 was a year of strong financial performance. Commercial organization executed hard to achieve high-single-digit revenue growth above our original expectations. We appropriately leveraged the P&L with non-GAAP EPS growing by 25%, and our cash flow was exceptional. 
Now I'd like to outline our 2011 financial guidance, which will exclude any significant business development activities. Revenue in 2011 is expected to be between flat and low-single-digit growth. Our estimate includes the impact of some notable items that are projected to reduce our revenue base. First, the RITUXAN business will be impacted by the continuing expiry of ex-U.S. royalties and a reduction in sales and marketing expense reimbursement. We expect the RITUXAN rest-of-world revenue to total approximately $80 million to $100 million for 2011.  Second, we don't expect to benefit from the hedge gains we've experienced in 2010. Third, the impact of healthcare reform increases from approximately $15 million in 2010 to approximately $95 million in 2011 across all products. Nevertheless, we expect these headwinds to be offset by continued TYSABRI revenue growth. 
We expect some upward pressure on cost of goods sold as we won't benefit from some of the one-time upsides in 2010. R&D expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 24% of revenue. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, reflecting the savings from the change in RITUXAN sales and marketing structure, offset by some commercial investments to compete in the new landscape. Our outlook is designed to capture the economic upside from the November restructuring, aiming to achieve a yearly run rate savings of $300 million by the second half of 2011. As a result, we expect the combination of R&D plus SG&A expenditures to decline by high-single-digit percent. 
Our effective tax rate, both GAAP and non-GAAP is expected to be between 26% and 28% of profit before tax. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be above $5.70 and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.82. We expect CapEx in the range of $200 million and $220 million. Overall, the financial plan is designed to allow resources to move forward our late-stage pipeline, defend the commercial business and drive double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

Our 2011 goals include filing an NDA for BG-12, completing the enrollments in the Peginterferon Phase III trial, completing and communicating the final results of the select daclizumab Phase II registrational trial, continuing to advance the Phase III daclizumab design trial, initiating [ph] Phase III trial and completing enrollment in our Factor VIII and Factor IX physical trial. In addition, we’ll aggressively explore external opportunities to enhance our portfolio, and we now have in place a team that can do that thoughtfully and effectively. 
Fifth and finally, our plan calls for continuing to drive true cultural change at Biogen Idec, building on a new sense of urgency and nimbleness at the company. So before I close, I want to thank all of Biogen Idec's employees for their contributions, without which we couldn't achieve our goals and for the positive and productive attitude with which they've embraced our new vision. We've had quite a bit to be excited about and are looking forward for 2011 and beyond. 
So with that, we'll close our remarks and open up the call for questions."

We're off to a great start for 2011, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap some of the first quarter accomplishments and results. I'm particularly pleased with 3 areas where we continue to perform well. First, our current business is solid. As you hear in a few minutes, our products continue to dew well and our financial performance is strong. We're continuing our transformation into a lean, aggressive, focused organization. And as far as the R&D group, the reinvigoration of R&D is underway. And that's evidenced by achieving a number of accomplishments this quarter.
so let's start with sum of the already accomplishments. so last week, as you know, we're pleased to announce top line results from the DEFINE study. As the first of 2 registration trials for BG-12, our investigational oral compound for relapsing remitting MS. There's been a lot of positive reaction to the results and a prospect of a potential new treatment option for people with MS. Since that announcement, we've received a live increase around 3 topics. First, the magnitude of the DEFINE clinical results. Second, our economic commitments for BG-12. And third, the intellectual property protection for BG-12. so accordingly, I'd like to take the opportunity of the call here to provide some additional color in all of these areas.
so let's start with the data from DEFINE. The results for the BID and TID doses were generally similar and were all a statistically significant versus placebo. Therefore for simplicity, today, I'm only going to discuss the BID results now for both the primary and secondary endpoints. And I'm going to read this slowly so that they have a chance to sink in.
For the primary endpoint, which was the reduction of the proportion of patients who relapsed at two years, the BID dose showed a decline of 49% versus placebo. The reduction in annualized relapse rate of the BID dose versus placebo was 53%. The reduction in the progression of visibility as measured by was 38%. For the MRI measures, the reduction in the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyper solutions was 85% and the reduction of was 90%.
These are top line results, and we don't yet have detailed safely information. But I can say that the initial data from the trial also showed that BG-12 demonstrated a favorable, safety and tolerability profile consistent with what we've seen in the published Phase II study of BG-12. We're obviously very excited about these results and we're looking forward to further analysis of the data from this study, as well as the readout from our second Phase III trial confirmed in the second half of the year.
As to the economic obligation for BG-12, we acquired the compound and in connection with our acquisition of AG in 2006. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional payment of $15 billion upon achievement of regulatory approval for BG-12 in MS in the EU or the U.S. We also agreed to make additional payments when the community net sales of the products reached $500 million, $1 billion and in each $1 billion increment thereafter up to $20 billion. A detailed explanation of the payment schedule is provided in the appendix of the slides for this call.
We've also got many questions about the intellectual property for BG-12. And so there are issued patents in both the U.S. in the EU, their relevant to BG-12. In the U.S., we're entitled to the five-year data exclusivity given to new chemical entities, and we own the patent covering the administration of dimethyl fumarate, an active ingredient of BG-12 to treat MS and other autoimmune diseases. This patent expires in 2020, with a possible term extension to be determined. In the EU, we have a patent covering our BG-12 formulation and the method of treating MS and other autoimmune diseases, with a formulation that expires in 2019, in which may also be eligible for patent term extension in some countries. There's some uncertainty around achieving data protection in the EU. Specifically, we believe were entitled for 8 years of data exclusivity and 2 years of market activity because we believe BG-12 is a new active substance under EU law.
Whether the CHMP have recently taken a position that a single active substance may not qualify for a new active substance status if it was one component of a previously approved multicomponent product. Other companies have challenged this position of mitigation that's still ongoing. 
is approved for psoriasis in Germany and contains an active ingredient in BG-12, as well as additional fumarate cells. We're closely watching this evolving landscape and we'll continue to address this issue. We believe we will be entitled to data exclusivity and we'll aggressively make this point as we move the compound forward.
Lastly, at the end of last week, the FDA notified us that they've resented the fast-track destination for BG-12. This is not unexpected since that was an oral treatment available. And I can say that if the CONFIRM data similar to DEFINE data we'll certainly seek priority review upon FDA final.
Let me now turn to TYSABRI. As you know, we filed amendments in the EU and the U.S. to include anti-JC virus antibody status as a third factor to help STRATIFY the risk of PML, along with prior immunosupressant therapy and duration of treatment, which are already on the label. And I'm happy to say that as we announced earlier this week, the CHMP recommended adding information about JC virus antibody status to the label in EU. The combination of the test, which is now available to the EU, and the inclusion of the antibody status on the label is are very positive steps that will provide the tools that physicians and patients needs to choose an appropriate MS therapy. We believe that these tools will allow the potential of TYSABRI to be unlocked and may lead to many more patients to be able to have access to the benefits of TYSABRI with the risk that they'd be able to DEFINE and understand.
Concurrently, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for the five-year renewal of the marketing authorization for TYSABRI. The FDA decision on our sBLA filing for the inclusion of the anti-JC virus antibody status to the U.S. label continues to be expected in the second half of the year. Earlier last week, the FDA did approve additional data to be included in the U.S. TYSABRI prescribing information outlining post marketing incident PML by treatment duration. Importantly, the estimated incidence of PML for 1,000 patients for up to 24 infusions as now stated at 0.30. For 25 to 36 infusions, that's 1.5. And for 37 to 40 infusions, as 0.9.
There were a number of other very positive events in our R&D programs recently, and Doug Williams will cover those in more detail in a few minutes. And I want to briefly now turn to our financial performance. Based on our current business is very strong, we have 3 blockbuster products that are performing well despite the competitive landscape. We've good cash flow and we finished the quarter with an overall strong financial performance. Overall revenues grew by 9% this quarter over Q1  2010 while product revenues grew by 10%. And our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43, up 32% versus Q1 2010.
In summary, Q1 was a great kickoff to 2011 and find Biogen Idec a leader more aggressive and more efficient organization that's focused on the highest payout activities. Our R&D organization is reenergized and well underway to capitalize some very promising opportunities. And our commercial organization is firing on all cylinders. I will now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our R&D head, who will update us on the top line and the changes we've made today are the organization. Doug."

It certainly does feel great to share with our shareholders the progress we've made with our oral MS program,  BG-12. It really was a team effort, a dedicated team of scientists, neurologists, clinical operations, people, statisticians and many others that have contributed to this moment. As you recall, the DEFINE study was a two-year randomized, double-blind, multi- centered, placebo-controlled dose comparisons studies and over 1,200 relapsing remitting MS patients. As George mentioned, both doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints with statistical significants compared to placebo.
In the DEFINE trial, 2 endpoints assessing relapses were included, that the proportion of relapsing patients at 2 years as the primary endpoint; and annualized relapse rate as the secondary endpoint. The second Phase III study of BG-12, CONFIRM, is also a two-year placebo-controlled dose comparisons study, which includes acetate as a reference compared to arm.
CONFIRM's primary endpoint is reduction of relapses at 2 years. Through the study endpoints for both DEFINE and CONFIRM, we will have a full spectrum of information regarding the effect BG-12BG-12 has on relapses. In addition, both trials were designed to measure the effects of BG-12 on EDSS, an extremely important endpoint for disability progression. Top line data release for CONFIRM continues to be expected in the second half of 2011, and we look forward to presenting more details from the DEFINE in upcoming medical meeting later this year. BG-12 is the only compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of MS that has been shown to activate the transcriptional pathway, a central mechanism of defense against oxidative and metabolic stress. This pathway has shown anti-inflammatory properties in clinical trials and experimentally has demonstrated no protective effects. by increasing the activation of the pathway, BG-12 may prevent further cell damage and tissue loss in MS patients that can lead to symptoms of the disease. With that. I will pass the call back to Doug."

Let's move on to a discussion of the rest of our pipeline progress since our last earnings call. Last week, we shared important data on our neurology franchise at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting where we demonstrated the strength in depth of our neurology pipeline with 55 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. At AAN, we presented data on the efficacy of TYSABRI, where treated patients were more likely to have improved EDSS over time versus score. Lower annualized relapse rates and significant cognitive improvements in MS patients. AAN and was also a great form for us to present data on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. We discussed the role of prior immunosuppressant usage, to separate treatment duration and anti-JCV antibody status in stratifying patients for their potential risk of PML. To date, based on an analysis of archived 3 PML samples from patients, 27 out of 27 TYSABRI-treated related PML cases have tested positive with the JCV antibody assay. We're committed to continuing to invest significant time and resources to evaluate additional risk factors for TYSABRI so that physicians and patients can make informed benefit risk decisions.
Earlier this quarter, we made important progress on our JCV antibodies risk stratification efforts. We obtained a CE Mark for the JCV antibody assay in Europe. In the U.S., we're planning to make the assay available as a laboratory developed test or LDT. We expect to have the commercial assay under the CE mark broadly available in Europe by May and in the U.S., through the LDT process within the coming months. Francesco will provide you with additional details. During the first quarter, we also made progress on all of our registers will trials. We continue to make good progress on advancing and developing our clinical pipeline. Updates in our neurology pipeline include initiation of patient enrollment in EMPOWER, the global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. We agreed on as been on a special portable assessment or SPA for the design of this trial. We believe that dex has the potential to provide a significant investment for the treatment of patients suffering from ALS. Dex is a novel oral compound that's shown neuroprotective properties in multiple experimental in preclinical studies. In a two-part Phase II study, dex showed a dose-dependent trend towards functional decline as measured by the ALS functional rating scale across treatment groups over a 12-week period and a trend toward improving overall survival over a six-month period. Given the nature of the disease and the limited treatment options available, there's is a pressing need for novel and effective therapies. Currently, there's only 1 approved treatment available to patients with the most modest clinical benefit. We expect to fully roll this trial the year end, with top line data available in 2013.
We expect to finish enrollment and advance the registrational study of PEGylated interferon by year end, With a 1 year treatment duration and annualized relapse rate as the primary endpoint, we expect top line data to be available in the first half of 2013. In the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registration trials for daclizumab . This drug targets the pathogenic activated T cells in MS to a novel mechanism in Phase II studies have shown solid efficacy and promising safety with the convenience of once monthly subcutaneous dosing. We continue to work closely with the EMA during our fill process for prolonged release tablets to address their concerns with the goal of making this important medication available to MS patients in Europe. We'll update you when the procedure concludes.
Additionally, we've withdrawn application from systematic. Finally, I'm pleased to say that we've received positive opinion from the CHMP and authorization from Health Canada for the AVONEX  The pan delivery will make a better patient experience with AVONEX, one of the most trusted MS therapy available. The FDA required additional information in our filings, and we anticipate that the updated file will be approved in the first half of next year. Moving onto our hemophilia programs.
We continue to expect to complete enrollment in both B-LONG and A-LONG studies in 2011 and for data readouts in 2012. Earlier this week, we also received FDA approval for RITUXAN, in combination with corticosteroids  as the new treatment for adults with Wegener’s Granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis, 2 severe forms of vasculitis. While these are relatively small indications, the significant and it reflects the commitment that we and our partner, Genentech, have for following the science and developing the drug first for group of patients as possible.
Along with substantial progress in our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken steps to thoroughly evaluate our R&D organizational structure that our earlier-stage R&D portfolio and technology platforms. Our vision for the R&D organization is to make us the envy of the biotech industry terms of pipeline depth and speed of advancement of our pipeline. Our performance over the last several years has not been at this level, and we take several steps in the last few weeks to restructure a create a solid base for future strategic growth. We've restructured our R&D groups to more closely aligned resources with Firebird the programs. Doctor Al Sandrock has been appointed as Senior Vice President of Development, with responsibly do for clinical programs in neurology and immunology. This increase the scope of responsibly for Al reflects a recognition of his accomplishments over the last several years and his a scale as an architect of science-based development programs.
As part of these reviews, we faced out several early stage programs in immunology and neurology and reallocated people and resources to other higher priority projects. These were difficult but necessary decisions that needed to be made. These decisions were not necessarily based on the quality of science but on an assessment on whether the programs had sufficient differentiation and likely timing of market introduction to be competitive. All of the remaining Phase I and II candidates are potentially transformational drugs addressing unmet medical needs in areas of strength for Biogen Idec. We have 4 very exciting Phase I and II programs that we prioritize and can fully resource. These include the anti-illegal program for revitalization in all forms of MS, for nephritis, the for the antibody for general lupus and neublastin for neuropathic pain. We decided to advance neublastin after further review of that data. We recently filed the IND for our antibody known as for treating Alzheimer's disease. All of these candidates have significant potential to address unmet medical needs with a high degree of differentiation. These program decisions also creates capacity to bring in potentially transformational drugs and new technologies from external sources. We'll also apply the same rigorous criteria for pursuing emerging external opportunities that are in line with our strengths in neurology, immunology, as well as hemophilia and hematology. Our current progress in the changes we implemented over the last two months created a solid basis to grow the portfolio and position the R&D organization to achieve our aims of being the premier R&D in the company in the industry. With that, I'll now pass the call to Doctor Francesco Granata, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."

As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance start the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and was positive. For quarter one, we achieved 10",995,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance start the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and was positive. For quarter one, we achieved 10% sales growth and 10% unit growth versus Q1 2010. Both AVONEX and TYSABRI performed well. These are the results of the stronger and more focused global commercial infrastructure. Economy have added more resources where they were needed and eliminated of management. We believe that our journey to success is both structured and sustainable.
Starting with AVONEX, our performance in the U.S. has continue to hold. We have now had 4 consecutive quarters of unit sales in around of 66,000 to 170,000 range after several years of unit sales declines. And units have led quarter one 2011 versus quarter one 2010. For the first time in several years, despite the yearly competition in the market, I'm very pleased to report that AVONEX gained market share in the CRE market in this quarter. Thanks to strong execution against the commercial team began last year, we are making progress towards our near-term goal also put our expect on the ABC market share growth trajectory. In the U.S., we further expanded the number of to increase volumes. Focus the AVONEX and TYSABRI's sales to more efficient targeting and employed messaging focused on to say visibility factor to maximize our efforts and address the rising competitive landscape. In addition, the that we put in place at the end of last year has now resulted in a more awareness in key offices, increased conversion of new prescription new patients starting therapy and improved patient compliance. We are also starting to see some improvement in the economic environment, which are allowing patients to move out of the free drug programs. Outside the U.S., we are also seeing a very fast on our commercial structure investment. Or AVONEX unit demand grew by 14% as we held and it started to improve share and the overall market continued to expand. In addition, our geographic expansion is paying off as we see quarterly revenue growth of the Asia-Pacific region of 31%. In Japan, market share is now in excess of 35%. And this is a milestone for the company, showing solid evidence that we could set up both a profitable and competitive business in Japan and set the stage for our future pipeline. the good news, AVONEX our expanding the European in Canada, the commercial team is already for a successful execution of the offering to the market. These are very important evolution for patients who are treating their MS with AVONEX. Data showed that AVONEX reduces injection pain and injection anxiety compared to manual injection. Through this view, convenient administration AVONEX spend has the possibility of improving patient independence and may even improve adherence. Moving on to TYSABRI performance. Quarter 1, 2011 worldwide in market, TYSABRI revenue was $349 million, an increase of 20% versus Q1 2010. And TYSABRI units increased 15% over Q1 2010 as well.
We ended the quarter with 58,400 patients, an increase of 1,800 patients or 3% over Q4 2010. And we continued to gain market share despite more competition any the MS marketplace. Worldwide, net patient adhesion averaged 138 per week, up from 131 in quarter four 2010. In the U.S., while we see moderating growth for new patients, we see increases in both with forms submitted and patients graduated onto therapy this quarter versus the previous quarter, showing that demand of TYSABRI is strong. While the STRATIFY 2 has impacted a number of patients in discontinuation, it has had less impact than might have been expected given that more than half of the MS population will be expected to be JVC positive. There are now more than 20,000 patients who have been accrued into both certified trial, will it be less. We suggest a tremendous amount of interest on the part of patients and physicians for more individualized care to this stratification.
Outside the U.S., the number of weekly that patient was strong in this quarter. That's every patient outside the U.S. grew by 6% and unit grew by 6% sequentially. In our markets, TYSABRI also continues to grow. The launch of TYSABRI in India continues to go as planned and we achieve 
price in Brazilian and Argentina, allowing for a launch in these countries. As Doug mentioned, in the EU, the JVC commercial became available on an EBITDA basis is starting much of this year through a partner lab. We've been working with a limited number of MS centers to ensure the majestic of sample collection and delivery of assay, resulting is working smoothly. so far, the process has gone well. We expect road availability of our commercial in the U.S. in the European union some time next month. In the U.S., we're also finalizing plans to make the assay available to key diagnostic and reimbursement channels and expect broad commercial availability the coming months. Our goal is to ensure that there are no barriers for patients and physicians to have access to the risks and patients tool they need to make an informed treatment decision. AVONEX and TYSABRI continues to hold their own even with competition from a box. The year-over-year on market has modestly grown as a result of the and we expect orders to gain market share and meet the needs of a segment of the marketplace.
However, we believe that it is clearly room for both AVONEX and TYSABRI to continue to perform well and the safety and efficacy of both AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to make them a compelling option for patients. strong, focused plan, along with a strong local execution by the commercial teams around the world of paying off. And we've set the stage for a sustainable positive performance throughout the year. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll start with our GAAP financials, which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes direct the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter were $53 million related to amortization of acquired intangibles and $17 million related to our restructuring. These were offset by $19 million of tax impact of these items.
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20 in the first quarter. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43 for Q1, a 32% increase versus prior year. Total revenue grew 90% to $1.2 billion.
Q1 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 8% to $642 million. In the U.S. where evidence grew 11% to $387 million, inventory in the channel ended at just over two weeks, down from last quarter, which offset a slight favorable comparison with respect to shipping dates. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $255 billion, which was a 5% increase over Q1 2011 and benefited from some tender market sales in Russia. International AVONEX revenue includes a $7 million hedged loss in Q1. As Franchesco noted, TYSABRI worldwide direct sales were $349 million in the first quarter, growing 28%. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $251 million in Q1, 15% increase over Q1 2010.
In the U.S., Q1 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 21% to $73 million. Q1 international TYSABRI product revenue was $178 million, a 13% increase over prior year. The current quarter included a $1 million loss from hedging. Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. First, our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $722 million for the first quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Our profit share from that business was $222 million, up 11%. The profitability declaration has been by the sales and marketing restructuring in late 2010.
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside U.S. and in Q1, this was $32 million, down 18% as royalties from individual countries have expired. And third, in the first quarter, Biogen Idec was reimbursed $3 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. The result was $256 million of revenue fro a unconsolidated joint business for Q1, essentially flat with prior year.
Royalty $26 million for the first quarter, up sequential quarter declined as we returned to a lower royalty tier from adjuvant sales. We recorded $15 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, $11 million of this amount was due to a onetime cash payment received related to 2 discontinued oncology programs in connection with our restructuring initiatives. The tentative expense line from a non-GAAP P&L.
Q1 cost of goods sold were $103 million or 9% of revenues. Q1 R&D expense was $292 million or 24% of revenues. Q1 SG&A expense was $243 million, 20% of revenues. And reduction from our recent run rate as we're not incurring any meaningful expenses in this line related to the RITUXAN sales and marketing efforts that the continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line, totaled $74 million in expense for the quarter.
Other income and expense was a gain of $10 million in Q1. This includes a onetime $14 million gain on the liquidation of an investment, which we viewed as no longer strategic. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%, which was higher than previous quarters as our profit mix has shifted slightly more to the U.S. coming out of the restructuring last year. Let me also call attention to the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L.
In Q1, we incurred $10 million charge in NCI related to the ALS program Doug spoke of. Specifically, can concern $10 million for the successful initiation of the Phase III trial our dexpramipexole. In the first quarter below our weighted average diluted were 245 million. During Q1, we repurchased 2.8 million shares with total cost of $195 million. This was offset, however, by shares issued for equity based compensation.
We ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60:40 between U.S. and outside U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.43  in the Q1, representing a 32% increase over prior year. We're maintaining our previously communicated guidance for full year 2011, which envisions the financial plans designed to capture the economic savings from the 2010 restructuring, optimize the performance of the corporate and invest behind a more focused pipeline, all to drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2011. Let me highlight a couple of financial modeling dynamics for the balance of the year. Over the last number of years, we've been capitalizing interest expense as a result of the continued buildout of our large-scale manufacturing plant in Denmark. It is likely in the near term we will look to mothball that plant if we determined we don't need this capacity. The accounting impact of that decision will be to incur additional interest expense each quarter.
Additionally, we will incur a $15 million expense due to the initiation of IND on the program in the second quarter. This will be p[payable to our and charged to the NCI line on the P&L. Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

We had a positive CHMP opinion for the evidence spent in the EU and marketing authorization for Health Canada. We have FDA approval for a subset of Wegener’s Granulomatosis and Microscopic Polyangiitis to severe forms of vasculitis. We dose the first patient in the Phase III trial of dexpramipexole for ALS.

You might expect were negative patients actually begin TYSABRI. And we think that, that total overtime, that will result in an increase in TYSABRI utilization. I think one important thing that happened this quarter, which was quarters would've been the focus of the most of the questions is that we actually did get approval from the UE to put JC virus antibody status as a risk factor on the label. Once that's on the label, once this is available, both of which are the case though Europe, than we could actually talk to physicians and talk to, make it clear to physicians and patients what their individual risks is likely to be. And we think once that's the case, we can really achieve the potential of TYSABRI.

We're off to a great start for 2011, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap some of the first quarter accomplishments and results. I'm particularly pleased with 3 areas where we continue to perform well. First, our current business is solid. As you'll hear in a few minutes, our products continue to do well, and our financial performance is strong. We're continuing our transformation into a lean, aggressive, focused organization. And as far as our R&D, I think the reinvigoration of R&D is underway. And that's evidenced by achieving a number of accomplishments this quarter.
So let me start with some of the R&D accomplishments. So last week, as you know, we were pleased to announce top line results from the DEFINE study. That's the first of 2 registrational trials for BG-12, our investigational oral compound for relapsing-remitting MS [multiple sclerosis]. There's been a lot of positive reaction to the results and the prospect of a potential new treatment option for people with MS. Since that announcement, we've received a lot of inquiries around 3 topics: first, the magnitude of the DEFINE clinical results; second, our economic commitments for BG-12; and third, the intellectual property protection for BG-12. So accordingly, I'd like to take the opportunity of the call here to provide some additional color in all of these areas.
So let me start with the data from DEFINE. The results for the BID and TID doses were generally similar and were all statistically significant versus placebo. Therefore for simplicity, today, I'm only going to discuss the BID results now for both the primary and secondary endpoints. And I'm going to read this slowly so that they have a chance to sink in.
For the primary endpoint, which was the reduction of the proportion of patients who relapsed at two years, the BID dose showed a decline of 49% versus placebo. The reduction in annualized relapse rate of the BID dose versus placebo was 53%. The reduction in the progression of disability as measured by EDSS [Expanded Disability Status Scale] was 38%. For the MRI measures, the reduction in the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was 85% and the reduction of galodinium (sic) [gadolinium] enhancing lesions was 90%.
These are top line results, and we don't yet have detailed safety information. But I can say that the initial data from the trial also showed that BG-12 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile consistent with what we've seen in the published Phase II study of BG-12. We're obviously very excited about these results, and we're looking forward to further analysis of the data from this study as well as the readout from our second Phase III trial, CONFIRMED, in the second half of the year.
As to the economic obligation for BG-12, we acquired the compound and Fumaderm in connection with our acquisition of Fumapharm AG in 2006. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional payment of $15 million upon the achievement of regulatory approval for BG-12 in MS in the EU or the U.S. We also agreed to make additional payments when the cumulative net sales of Fumapharm products reached $500 million, $1 billion and then each $1 billion increment thereafter up to $20 billion. A detailed explanation of the payment schedule is provided in the appendix of the slides for this call.
We've also gotten many questions about the intellectual property for BG-12. And so there are issued patents in both the U.S. and the EU that are relevant to BG-12. In the U.S., we're entitled to the five-year data exclusivity given to new chemical entities, and we own a patent covering the administration of dimethyl fumarate, or DMF, an active ingredient in BG-12, to treat MS and other autoimmune diseases. This patent expires in 2020, with a possible term extension to be determined. 
In the EU, we have a patent covering our BG-12 formulation and the method of treating MS and other autoimmune diseases with the formulation that expires in 2019 and which may also be eligible for patent term extension in some countries. There's some uncertainty around achieving data protection in the EU. Specifically, we believe we're entitled to 8 years of data exclusivity and 2 years of market exclusivity because we believe BG-12 is a new active substance under EU law.
However, the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] has recently taken a position that a single active substance may not qualify for a new active substance status if it was one component of a previously approved multicomponent product. Other companies have challenged this position in litigation that's still ongoing. 
Fumaderm is approved for psoriasis in Germany and contains DMF, the active ingredient in BG-12, as well as additional monoethyl fumarate cells. We're closely watching this evolving landscape and we'll continue to address this issue. We believe we will be entitled to data exclusivity, and we'll aggressively make this point as we move the compound forward.
Lastly, at the end of last week, the FDA notified us that they've rescinded the fast-track designation for BG-12. This is not unexpected since there now is an oral treatment available. And I can say that if the CONFIRM data are similar to the DEFINE data, we'll certainly seek priority review upon NDA [Drug Application] filing.
Let me now turn to TYSABRI. As you know, we filed amendments with the EU and the U.S. to include anti-JC virus antibody status as a third factor to help stratify the risk of PML [progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy] along with prior immunosuppressant therapy and duration of treatment, which are already in the label. And I'm happy to say that as we announced earlier this week, the CHMP recommended adding information about JC virus antibody status to the label in EU. The combination of the test, which is now available in the EU, and the inclusion of the antibody status on the label are very positive steps that will provide the tools that physicians and patients need to choose an appropriate MS therapy. We believe that these tools will allow the potential of TYSABRI to be unlocked and may lead to many more patients being able to have access to the benefits of TYSABRI with the risk that they'll be able to define and understand.
Concurrently, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for the five-year renewal of the marketing authorization for TYSABRI. The FDA decision on our sBLA [supplemental Biologics License Application] filing for the inclusion of the anti-JC virus antibody status to the U.S. label continues to be expected in the second half of the year. Earlier last week, the FDA did approve additional data to be included in the U.S. TYSABRI prescribing information, outlining post-marketing incidence rate of PML by treatment duration. Importantly, the estimated incidence of PML for 1,000 patients for up to 24 infusions is now stated as 0.3; for 25 to 36 infusions, as 1.5; and for 37 to 48 infusions, as 0.9.
There were a number of other very positive events in our R&D programs recently, and Doug Williams will cover those in more detail in a few minutes. And I want to briefly now turn to our financial performance. Basically, our current business is very strong. We have 3 blockbuster products that are performing well despite the competitive landscape. We have good cash flow, and we finished the quarter with an overall strong financial performance. Overall revenues grew by 9% this quarter over Q1  2010 while product revenues grew by 10%. And our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43, up 32% versus Q1 2010.
In summary, Q1 was a great kickoff to 2011 and finds Biogen Idec a leaner, more aggressive and more efficient organization that's focused on the highest payoff activities. Our R&D organization is reenergized and well underway to capitalize on some very promising opportunities. And our commercial organization is firing on all cylinders. I will now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our R&D head, who will update us on the R&D pipeline and the changes he's made to the R&D organization. Doug?"

That's not to say there isn't work to be done to improve our productivity, but I believe that we have a solid base from which to build a world-class R&D capability.
As George mentioned, last week, we announced positive top line data results from DEFINE, the first Phase III study of BG-12 in relapsing MS. I'd like Dr. Al Sandrock to share with you some of the rationale for the design of the study. Al's done a tremendous job of leading this program, along with our talented internal team of dedicated neurologists and scientists. And with that, I'll pass the call off to Al."

It certainly does feel great to share with our shareholders the progress we've made with our oral MS program,  BG-12. It really was a team effort, a dedicated team of scientists, neurologists, clinical operations people, statisticians and many others that have contributed to this moment. As you recall, the DEFINE study was a two-year, randomized, double-blind, multi- centered, placebo-controlled dose comparison study in over 1,200 relapsing-remitting MS patients. As George mentioned, both doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo.
In the DEFINE trial, 2 endpoints assessing relapses were included, the proportion of relapsing patients at 2 years as the primary endpoint and annualized relapse rate as the secondary endpoint. The second Phase III study of BG-12, CONFIRM, is also a two-year, placebo-controlled dose comparison study, which includes glatiramer acetate as a reference comparator arm.
CONFIRM's primary endpoint is reduction of relapses at 2 years. Through the study endpoints for both DEFINE and CONFIRM, we will have a full spectrum of information regarding the effect BG-12 has on relapses. In addition, both trials were designed to measure the effects of BG-12 on EDSS, an extremely important endpoint for disability progression. Top line data release for CONFIRM continues to be expected in the second half of 2011, and we look forward to presenting more details from the DEFINE study in an upcoming medical meeting later this year. 
BG-12 is the only compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of MS that has been shown to activate the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, a central mechanism of cellular defense against oxidative and metabolic stress. This pathway has shown anti-inflammatory properties in clinical trials and, experimentally, has demonstrated no protective effects. By increasing the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, BG-12 may prevent further cell damage and tissue loss in MS patients that can lead to symptoms of the disease. With that, I will pass the call back to Doug."

Let's move on to a discussion of the rest of our pipeline progress since our last earnings call. Last week, we shared important data on our neurology franchise at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting where we demonstrated the strength and depth of our neurology pipeline with 55 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. At AAN, we presented data on the efficacy of TYSABRI, where treated patients were more likely to have improved EDSS score over time versus a worsened score, lower annualized relapse rates and significant cognitive improvements in MS patients. AAN was also a great forum for us to present data on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. We discussed the role of prior immunosuppressant usage, TYSABRI treatment duration and anti-JCV antibody status in stratifying patients for their potential risk of PML. To date, based on an analysis of archived 3 PML samples from patients, 27 out of 27 TYSABRI-treated related PML cases have tested positive with the JCV antibody assay. We're committed to continuing to invest significant time and resources to evaluate additional risk factors for TYSABRI so that physicians and patients can make informed benefit-risk decisions.
Earlier this quarter, we made important progress on our JCV antibody risk stratification efforts. We obtained a CE mark for the JCV antibody assay in Europe. In the U.S., we're planning to make the assay available as a laboratory-developed test, or LDT. We expect to have the commercial assay under the CE mark broadly available in Europe by May and in the U.S. through the LDT process within the coming months. Francesco will provide you with additional details. 
During the first quarter, we also made progress on all of our registrational trials. We continue to make good progress on advancing and developing our clinical pipeline. Updates on our neurology pipeline include: initiation of patient enrollment in EMPOWER, the global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. We've agreed with the FDA on a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for the design of this trial. We believe that dex [dexpramipexole] has the potential to provide a significant advancement for the treatment of patients suffering from ALS. Dex is a novel oral compound that's shown neuroprotective properties in multiple experimental and preclinical studies. In a two-part Phase II study, dex showed a dose-dependent trend towards slowing functional decline as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale across treatment groups over a 12-week period and a trend toward improving overall survival over a six-month period. Given the nature of the disease and the limited treatment options available, there's a pressing need for novel and effective therapies. Currently, there's only 1 approved treatment available to patients with at most a modest clinical benefit. We expect to fully enroll this trial by year end, with top line data available in 2013.
We expect to finish enrollment and advance the registrational study of PEGylated interferon by year end. With a 1 year treatment duration and annualized relapse rate as the primary endpoint, we expect top line data to be available in the first half of 2013. In the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registrational trials for daclizumab. This drug targets the pathogenic activated T-cells in MS to a novel mechanism, and Phase II studies have shown solid efficacy and promising safety with the convenience of once-monthly subcutaneous dosing. We continue to work closely with the EMA [European Medicines Agency] during our appeal process for prolonged-release fampridine tablets to address their concerns with the goal of making this important medication available to MS patients in Europe. We'll update you when the procedure concludes. Additionally, we've withdrawn fampridine application from SwissMedic. 
Finally, I'm pleased to say that we've received positive opinion from the CHMP and authorization from Health Canada for the AVONEX PEN. The PEN delivery will make for a better patient experience with AVONEX, one of the most trusted MS therapies available. The FDA required additional information in our filing, and we anticipate that the updated file will be approved in the first half of next year. 
Moving on to our hemophilia programs. We continue to expect to complete enrollment in both B-LONG and A-LONG studies in 2011 and for data readout in 2012. Earlier this week, we also received FDA approval for RITUXAN in combination with corticosteroids as the new treatment for adults with Wegener’s Granulomatosis and Microscopic Polyangiitis, 2 severe forms of vasculitis. While these are relatively small indications, the need is significant, and it reflects the commitment that we and our partner, Genentech, have for following the science and developing the drug for as broad a group of patients as possible.
Along with substantial progress in our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken steps to thoroughly evaluate our R&D organizational structure and our earlier-stage R&D portfolio and technology platforms. Our vision for the R&D organization is to make us the envy of the biotech industry in terms of pipeline depth and speed of advancement of our pipeline. Our performance over the last several years has not been at this level, and we took several steps in the last few weeks to restructure and create a solid base for future strengthening and growth. We've restructured our R&D group to more closely align resources with high-priority programs. Dr. Al Sandrock has been appointed as Senior Vice President of Development, with responsibly for clinical programs in neurology and immunology. This increased scope of responsibly for Al reflects a recognition of his accomplishments over the last several years and his skill as an architect of science-based development programs.
As part of these reviews, we phased out several early-stage programs in immunology and neurology and reallocated people and resources to other higher-priority projects. These were difficult but necessary decisions that needed to be made. These decisions were not necessarily based on the quality of science but on an assessment of whether the programs had sufficient differentiation and likely timing of market introduction to be competitive. All of the remaining Phase I and II candidates are potentially transformational drugs addressing unmet medical needs in areas of strength for Biogen Idec. 
We have 4 very exciting Phase I and II programs that we prioritize and can fully resource. These include the anti-LINGO program for remyelination in all forms of MS, TWEAK for lupus nephritis, the anti-CD40 Ligand antibody for general lupus and neublastin for neuropathic pain. We decided to advance neublastin after further review of that data. We recently filed the IND [Investigational New Drug Application] for our anti-beta-amyloid antibody, known as BART, for treating Alzheimer's disease. All of these candidates have significant potential to address unmet medical needs with a high degree of differentiation. These program decisions also create some capacity to bring in potentially transformational drugs and new technologies from external sources. We'll also apply the same rigorous criteria for pursuing emerging external opportunities that are in line with our strengths in neurology, immunology, as well as hemophilia and hematology. 
Our current progress in the changes we implemented over the last two months created a solid basis to grow the portfolio and position the R&D organization to achieve our aim of being the premier R&D company in the industry. With that, I'll now pass the call to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."
29726,129616919,116436,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance started the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and unit growth was positive. For quarter 1, we ac",1025,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance started the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and unit growth was positive. For quarter 1, we achieved 10% global sales growth and 10% unit growth versus Q1 2010. Both AVONEX and TYSABRI performed well. These are the results of a stronger and more focused global commercial infrastructure. Because we have added more resources where they were needed and eliminated unnecessary layers of management, we believe that our journey to success is both structured and sustainable.
Starting with AVONEX. Our performance in the U.S. has continued to hold. We have now had 4 consecutive quarters of unit sales around the 66,000 to 170,000 range after several years of unit sales declines. And units has led quarter 1 2011 versus quarter 1 2010. For the first time in several years, despite the heavy competition in the market, I'm very pleased to report that AVONEX gained market share in the ABCRE market this quarter. Thanks to strong execution against the plans the commercial team began last year, we are making progress toward our near-term goal to put AVONEX back on a ABCRE market share growth trajectory. In the U.S., we further expanded the number of [indiscernible] in the field to increase share [indiscernible], focused the AVONEX and TYSABRI sales force to more efficient targeting and employed simple messaging focused on sustained disability impacts to maximize our efforts and address the evolving competitive landscape. In addition, the [indiscernible] that we put in place at the end of last year has now resulted in more awareness in key offices, increased conversion in prescription written to new patients starting therapy and improved patient compliance. We are also starting to see some improvement in the economic environment, which are allowing patients to move out of the free drug programs. 
Outside the U.S., we are also seeing a very fast payback on our commercial structure investment. Where AVONEX unit demand grew by 14% as we held and started to improve share and the overall market continued to expand. In addition, our geographic expansion is paying off as we see quarterly revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region of 31%. In Japan, market share is now in excess of 35%. And this is a milestone for the company, showing solid evidence that we could set up both a profitable and competitive business in Japan and set the stage for our future pipeline. Still the good news about AVONEX expanding the European Union and Canada, the commercial team is ready for a successful execution of the new offering to the market. This is a very important evolution for patients who are treating their MS with AVONEX. Data show that AVONEX PEN reduces injection pain and injection anxiety compared to manual injection. Through this new, convenient administration, AVONEX PEN has the possibility of improving patient independence and may even improve adherence. 
Moving on TYSABRI performance. Quarter 1, 2011 worldwide in market, TYSABRI revenue was $349 million, an increase of 20% versus Q1 2010. And TYSABRI units increased 15% over Q1 2010 as well. We ended the quarter with 58,400 patients, an increase of 1,800 patients or 3% over Q4 2010. And we continued to gain market share despite more competition in the MS marketplace. Worldwide, net patient addition averaged 138 per week, up from 131 in quarter 4 2010. In the U.S., while we see moderating growth for new patients, we see increases in both new TOUCH forms submitted and patients graduated onto therapy this quarter versus the previous quarter, showing that demand of TYSABRI is strong. While STRATIFY 2 has impacted a number of patient discontinuation, it has had less impact than might have been expected given that more than half of the MS population will be expected to be JCV positive. There are now more than 20,000 patients who have been accrued into those certified trial. In those certified trial in the U.S. will suggest a tremendous amount of interest on the part of patients and physicians for more individualized care to this stratification.
Outside the U.S., the number of weekly net patient was strong this quarter. TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 6% and unit grew by 6% sequentially. In our emerging markets, TYSABRI also continues to grow. The launch of TYSABRI in India continues to grow as planned, and we achieved 
an appropriate price in Brazil and Argentina, allowing for a two-scale launch in these countries. As Doug mentioned, in the EU, the JCV commercial assay became available on a limited basis starting in March of this year through a partner lab. We have been working with a limited number of MS centers [indiscernible] to ensure the logistic of sample collection and delivery of assay result in working -- as a result is working smoothly. So far, the process has gone well. We expect broad availability of the commercial assay in the U.S. in the European Union some time next month. 
In the U.S., we are also finalizing plans to make the assay available to key diagnostic and reimbursement channels and expect broad commercial availability in the coming months. Our goal is to ensure that there are no barriers for patients and physicians to have access to the risks stratification tool they need to make an informed treatment decision. AVONEX and TYSABRI continues to hold their own even with competition from others. The overall market has modestly grown as a result of new entry and we expect orders to gain market share and meet the needs of a segment of the marketplace.
However, we believe that there is clearly room for both AVONEX and TYSABRI to continue to perform well and the safety and efficacy of both AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to make them a compelling option for patients. Strong, focused plan, along with strong local execution by the commercial teams around the world are paying off. And we've set the stage for a sustainable positive performance throughout the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Table 3 includes the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter were $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $17 million related to our restructuring. These were offset by $19 million of tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20 in the first quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43 for Q1, a 32% increase versus prior year. Total revenue grew 9% to $1.2 billion.
Q1 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 8% to $642 million. In the U.S. where AVONEX grew 11% to $387 million, inventory in the channel ended at just over two weeks, down from last quarter, which offset a slight favorable comparison with respect to shipping days. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $255 million, which was a 5% increase over Q1 2011 and benefited from some tender market sales in Russia. International AVONEX revenue includes a $7 million hedged loss in Q1. 
As Francesco noted, TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $349 million in the first quarter, growing 20%. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $251 million in Q1, 15% increase over Q1 2010.
In the U.S., Q1 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 21% to $73 million. Q1 international TYSABRI product revenue was $178 million, a 13% increase over prior year. The current quarter included a $1 million loss from hedging. Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. First, our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $722 million in the first quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Our profit share from that business was $222 million, up 11%. The profitability of the collaboration has been enhanced by the sales and marketing restructuring in late 2010.
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and in Q1, this was $32 million, down 18% as royalties from individual countries have expired. And third, in the first quarter, Biogen Idec was reimbursed $3 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. The result was $256 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q1, essentially flat with prior year.
Royalties were $26 million for the first quarter, a sequential quarter decline as we returned to a lower royalty tier from ANGIOMAX sales. We recorded $15 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, $11 million of this amount was due to a onetime cash payment received related to 2 discontinued oncology programs in connection with our restructuring initiatives. 
Now turning to expense line from the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $103 million or 9% of revenues. Q1 R&D expense was $292 million or 24% of revenues. Q1 SG&A expense was $243 million, 20% of revenues, a reduction from our recent run rate as we're not incurring any meaningful expenses in this line related to the RITUXAN sales and marketing efforts. continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $74 million in expense for the quarter.
Other income and expense was a gain of $10 million in Q1. This includes a onetime $14 million gain on the liquidation of an investment which we viewed as no longer strategic. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%, which is higher than previous quarters as our profit mix has shifted slightly more to the U.S. coming out of the restructuring last year. Let me also call attention to the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. In Q1, we incurred a $10 million charge in NCI related to the ALS program Doug spoke of. Specifically, it amounted to $10 million for the successful initiation of the Phase III trial for dexpramipexole. In the first quarter our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million. During Q1, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for a total cost of $195 million. This was offset, however, by shares issued for equity-based compensation.
We ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60:40 between U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.43  in Q1, representing a 32% increase over prior year. 
We're maintaining our previously communicated guidance for full year 2011, which envisions the financial plans designed to capture the economic savings from the 2010 restructuring, optimize the performance of the core brand and invest behind a more focused pipeline, all to drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2011. 
Let me highlight a couple of financial modeling dynamics for the balance of the year. Over the last number of years, we've been capitalizing interest expense as a result of the continued build-out of our large-scale manufacturing plant in Denmark. It is likely in the near term we will look to mothball that plant if we determine that we don't need this capacity. The accounting impact of that decision will be to incur additional interest expense each quarter.
Additionally, we will incur a $15 million expense due to the initiation of IND on the BART program in the second quarter. This will be payable to Neurimmune and charged to the NCI line on the P&L. Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

You might expect more negative patients to actually begin TYSABRI. And we think net-net over time, that will result in an increase in TYSABRI utilization. I think the one important thing that happened this quarter, which in most quarters would've been the focus of the most of the questions is that we actually did get approval from the EU to put JC virus antibody status as a risk factor on the label. Once that's on the label, once the test is available, both of which are the case now in Europe, then we can actually talk to physicians and talk to -- make it clear to physicians and patients what their individual risk is likely to be. And we think once that's the case, we can really achieve the potential of TYSABRI.

While in Europe, the idea is that the test will be used to screen patients who have to go into therapy. This might allow more virus negative patients to go into therapy.

We're off to a great start for 2011, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap some of the first quarter accomplishments and results. I'm particularly pleased with 3 areas where we continue to perform well. First, our current business is solid. As you'll hear in a few minutes, our products continue to do well, and our financial performance is strong. We're continuing our transformation into a lean, aggressive, focused organization. And as far as our R&D, I think the reinvigoration of R&D is underway. And that's evidenced by achieving a number of accomplishments this quarter.
So let me start with some of the R&D accomplishments. So last week, as you know, we were pleased to announce top line results from the DEFINE study. That's the first of 2 registrational trials for BG-12, our investigational oral compound for relapsing-remitting MS [multiple sclerosis]. There's been a lot of positive reaction to the results and the prospect of a potential new treatment option for people with MS. Since that announcement, we've received a lot of inquiries around 3 topics: First, the magnitude of the DEFINE clinical results; second, our economic commitments for BG-12; and third, the intellectual property protection for BG-12. So accordingly, I'd like to take the opportunity of the call here to provide some additional color in all of these areas.
So let me start with the data from DEFINE. The results for the BID and TID doses were generally similar and were all statistically significant versus placebo. Therefore for simplicity, today, I'm only going to discuss the BID results now for both the primary and secondary endpoints. And I'm going to read this slowly so that they have a chance to sink in.
For the primary endpoint, which was the reduction of the proportion of patients who relapsed at two years, the BID dose showed a decline of 49% versus placebo. The reduction in annualized relapse rate of the BID dose versus placebo was 53%. The reduction in the progression of disability as measured by EDSS [Expanded Disability Status Scale] was 38%. For the MRI measures, the reduction in the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was 85% and the reduction of galodinium (sic) [gadolinium] enhancing lesions was 90%.
These are top line results, and we don't yet have detailed safety information. But I can say that the initial data from the trial also showed that BG-12 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile consistent with what we've seen in the published Phase II study of BG-12. We're obviously very excited about these results, and we're looking forward to further analysis of the data from this study as well as the readout from our second Phase III trial, CONFIRMED, in the second half of the year.
As to the economic obligation for BG-12, we acquired the compound and Fumaderm in connection with our acquisition of Fumapharm AG in 2006. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional payment of $15 million upon the achievement of regulatory approval for BG-12 in MS in the EU or the U.S. We also agreed to make additional payments when the cumulative net sales of Fumapharm products reached $500 million, $1 billion and then each $1 billion increment thereafter up to $20 billion. A detailed explanation of the payment schedule is provided in the appendix of the slides for this call.
We've also gotten many questions about the intellectual property for BG-12. And so there are issued patents in both the U.S. and the EU that are relevant to BG-12. In the U.S., we're entitled to the five-year data exclusivity given to new chemical entities, and we own a patent covering the administration of dimethyl fumarate, or DMF, an active ingredient in BG-12, to treat MS and other autoimmune diseases. This patent expires in 2020, with a possible term extension to be determined. 
In the EU, we have a patent covering our BG-12 formulation and the method of treating MS and other autoimmune diseases with the formulation that expires in 2019 and which may also be eligible for patent term extension in some countries. There's some uncertainty around achieving data protection in the EU. Specifically, we believe we're entitled to 8 years of data exclusivity and 2 years of market exclusivity because we believe BG-12 is a new active substance under EU law.
However, the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] has recently taken a position that a single active substance may not qualify for a new active substance status if it was one component of a previously approved multi-component product. Other companies have challenged this position in litigation that's still ongoing. 
Fumaderm is approved for psoriasis in Germany and contains DMF, the active ingredient in BG-12, as well as additional monoethyl fumarate cells. We're closely watching this evolving landscape and we'll continue to address this issue. We believe we will be entitled to data exclusivity, and we'll aggressively make this point as we move the compound forward.
Lastly, at the end of last week, the FDA notified us that they've rescinded the fast-track designation for BG-12. This is not unexpected since there now is an oral treatment available. And I can say that if the CONFIRM data are similar to the DEFINE data, we'll certainly seek priority review upon NDA [Drug Application] filing.
Let me now turn to TYSABRI. As you know, we filed amendments with the EU and the U.S. to include anti-JC virus antibody status as a third factor to help stratify the risk of PML [progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy] along with prior immunosuppressant therapy and duration of treatment, which are already in the label. And I'm happy to say that as we announced earlier this week, the CHMP recommended adding information about JC virus antibody status to the label in EU. The combination of the test, which is now available in the EU, and the inclusion of the antibody status on the label are very positive steps that will provide the tools that physicians and patients need to choose an appropriate MS therapy. We believe that these tools will allow the potential of TYSABRI to be unlocked and may lead to many more patients being able to have access to the benefits of TYSABRI with the risk that they'll be able to define and understand.
Concurrently, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for the 5-year renewal of the marketing authorization for TYSABRI. The FDA decision on our sBLA [supplemental Biologics License Application] filing for the inclusion of the anti-JC virus antibody status to the U.S. label continues to be expected in the second half of the year. Earlier last week, the FDA did approve additional data to be included in the U.S. TYSABRI prescribing information, outlining post-marketing incidence rate of PML by treatment duration. Importantly, the estimated incidence of PML for 1,000 patients for up to 24 infusions is now stated as 0.3; for 25 to 36 infusions, as 1.5; and for 37 to 48 infusions, as 0.9.
There were a number of other very positive events in our R&D programs recently, and Doug Williams will cover those in more detail in a few minutes. And I want to briefly now turn to our financial performance. Basically, our current business is very strong. We have 3 blockbuster products that are performing well despite the competitive landscape. We have good cash flow, and we finished the quarter with an overall strong financial performance. Overall revenues grew by 9% this quarter over Q1 2010 while product revenues grew by 10%. And our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43, up 32% versus Q1 2010.
In summary, Q1 was a great kickoff to 2011 and finds Biogen Idec a leaner, more aggressive and more efficient organization that's focused on the highest payoff activities. Our R&D organization is reenergized and well underway to capitalize on some very promising opportunities. And our commercial organization is firing on all cylinders. I will now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our R&D head, who will update us on the R&D pipeline and the changes he's made to the R&D organization. Doug?"

I'd like Dr. Al Sandrock to share with you some of the rationale for the design of the study.

It certainly does feel great to share with our shareholders the progress we've made with our oral MS program, BG-12. It really was a team effort, a dedicated team of scientists, neurologists, clinical operations people, statisticians and many others that have contributed to this moment. As you recall, the DEFINE study was a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, multi-centered, placebo-controlled dose comparison study in over 1,200 relapsing-remitting MS patients. As George mentioned, both doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo.
In the DEFINE trial, 2 endpoints assessing relapses were included, the proportion of relapsing patients at 2 years as the primary endpoint and annualized relapse rate as the secondary endpoint. The second Phase III study of BG-12, CONFIRM, is also a 2-year, placebo-controlled dose comparison study, which includes glatiramer acetate as a reference comparator arm.
CONFIRM's primary endpoint is reduction of relapses at 2 years. Through the study endpoints for both DEFINE and CONFIRM, we will have a full spectrum of information regarding the effect BG-12 has on relapses. In addition, both trials were designed to measure the effects of BG-12 on EDSS, an extremely important endpoint for disability progression. Top line data release for CONFIRM continues to be expected in the second half of 2011, and we look forward to presenting more details from the DEFINE study in an upcoming medical meeting later this year. 
BG-12 is the only compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of MS that has been shown to activate the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, a central mechanism of cellular defense against oxidative and metabolic stress. This pathway has shown anti-inflammatory properties in clinical trials and, experimentally, has demonstrated no protective effects. By increasing the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, BG-12 may prevent further cell damage and tissue loss in MS patients that can lead to symptoms of the disease. With that, I will pass the call back to Doug."

Let's move on to a discussion of the rest of our pipeline progress since our last earnings call. Last week, we shared important data on our neurology franchise at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting where we demonstrated the strength and depth of our neurology pipeline with 55 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. At AAN, we presented data on the efficacy of TYSABRI, where treated patients were more likely to have improved EDSS score over time versus a worsened score, lower annualized relapse rates and significant cognitive improvements in MS patients. AAN was also a great forum for us to present data on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. We discussed the role of prior immunosuppressant usage, TYSABRI treatment duration and anti-JCV antibody status in stratifying patients for their potential risk of PML. To date, based on an analysis of archived 3 PML samples from patients, 27 out of 27 TYSABRI-treated related PML cases have tested positive with the JCV antibody assay. We're committed to continuing to invest significant time and resources to evaluate additional risk factors for TYSABRI so that physicians and patients can make informed benefit-risk decisions.
Earlier this quarter, we made important progress on our JCV antibody risk stratification efforts. We obtained a CE mark for the JCV antibody assay in Europe. In the U.S., we're planning to make the assay available as a laboratory-developed test, or LDT. We expect to have the commercial assay under the CE mark broadly available in Europe by May and in the U.S. through the LDT process within the coming months. Francesco will provide you with additional details. 
During the first quarter, we also made progress on all of our registrational trials. We continue to make good progress on advancing and developing our clinical pipeline. Updates on our neurology pipeline include, initiation of patient enrollment in EMPOWER, the global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. We've agreed with the FDA on a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for the design of this trial. We believe that dex [dexpramipexole] has the potential to provide a significant advancement for the treatment of patients suffering from ALS. Dex is a novel oral compound that's shown neuroprotective properties in multiple experimental and preclinical studies. In a 2-part Phase II study, dex showed a dose-dependent trend towards slowing functional decline as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale across treatment groups over a 12-week period and a trend toward improving overall survival over a 6-month period. Given the nature of the disease and the limited treatment options available, there's a pressing need for novel and effective therapies. Currently, there's only 1 approved treatment available to patients with at most a modest clinical benefit. We expect to fully enroll this trial by year end, with top line data available in 2013.
We expect to finish enrollment and advance the registrational study of PEGylated interferon by year end. With a 1-year treatment duration and annualized relapse rate as the primary endpoint, we expect top line data to be available in the first half of 2013. In the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registrational trials for daclizumab. This drug targets the pathogenic activated T-cells in MS through a novel mechanism, and Phase II studies have shown solid efficacy and promising safety with the convenience of once-monthly subcutaneous dosing. We continue to work closely with the EMA [European Medicines Agency] during our appeal process for prolonged-release fampridine tablets to address their concerns with the goal of making this important medication available to MS patients in Europe. We'll update you when the procedure concludes. Additionally, we've withdrawn fampridine application from SwissMedic. 
Finally, I'm pleased to say that we've received positive opinion from the CHMP and authorization from Health Canada for the AVONEX PEN. The PEN delivery will make for a better patient experience with AVONEX, one of the most trusted MS therapies available. The FDA required additional information in our filing, and we anticipate that the updated file will be approved in the first half of next year. 
Moving on to our hemophilia programs. We continue to expect to complete enrollment in both B-LONG and A-LONG studies in 2011 and for data readout in 2012. Earlier this week, we also received FDA approval for RITUXAN in combination with corticosteroids as the new treatment for adults with Wegener’s Granulomatosis and Microscopic Polyangiitis, 2 severe forms of vasculitis. While these are relatively small indications, the need is significant, and it reflects the commitment that we and our partner, Genentech, have for following the science and developing the drug for as broad a group of patients as possible.
Along with substantial progress in our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken steps to thoroughly evaluate our R&D organizational structure and our earlier-stage R&D portfolio and technology platforms. Our vision for the R&D organization is to make us the envy of the biotech industry in terms of pipeline depth and speed of advancement of our pipeline. Our performance over the last several years has not been at this level, and we took several steps in the last few weeks to restructure and create a solid base for future strengthening and growth. We've restructured our R&D group to more closely align resources with high-priority programs. Dr. Al Sandrock has been appointed as Senior Vice President of Development, with responsibly for clinical programs in neurology and immunology. This increased scope of responsibly for Al reflects a recognition of his accomplishments over the last several years and his skill as an architect of science-based development programs.
As part of these reviews, we phased out several early-stage programs in immunology and neurology and reallocated people and resources to other higher-priority projects. These were difficult but necessary decisions that needed to be made. These decisions were not necessarily based on the quality of science but on an assessment of whether the programs had sufficient differentiation and likely timing of market introduction to be competitive. All of the remaining Phase I and II candidates are potentially transformational drugs addressing unmet medical needs in areas of strength for Biogen Idec. 
We have 4 very exciting Phase I and II programs that we prioritize and can fully resource. These include the anti-LINGO program for remyelination in all forms of MS, TWEAK for lupus nephritis, the anti-CD40 Ligand antibody for general lupus and neublastin for neuropathic pain. We decided to advance neublastin after further review of that data. We recently filed the IND [Investigational New Drug Application] for our anti-beta-amyloid antibody, known as BART, for treating Alzheimer's disease. All of these candidates have significant potential to address unmet medical needs with a high degree of differentiation. These program decisions also create some capacity to bring in potentially transformational drugs and new technologies from external sources. We'll also apply the same rigorous criteria for pursuing emerging external opportunities that are in line with our strengths in neurology, immunology, as well as hemophilia and hematology. 
Our current progress in the changes we implemented over the last 2 months created a solid basis to grow the portfolio and position the R&D organization to achieve our aim of being the premier R&D company in the industry. With that, I'll now pass the call to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."
29726,129616919,116457,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. And good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance started the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and unit growth was positive. For quarter 1, we ac",1024,"Thank you, Doug. And good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance started the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and unit growth was positive. For quarter 1, we achieved 10% global sales growth and 10% unit growth versus Q1 2010. Both AVONEX and TYSABRI performed well. These are the result of a stronger and more focused global commercial infrastructure. Because we have added more resources where they were needed and eliminated unnecessary layers of management, we believe that our journey to success is both structured and sustainable.
Starting with AVONEX. Our performance in the U.S. has continued to hold. We have now had 4 consecutive quarters of unit sales around the 166,000 to 170,000 range after several years of unit sales declines. And units has led quarter 1 2011 versus quarter 1 2010. For the first time in several years, despite the heavy competition in the market, I'm very pleased to report that AVONEX gained market share in the ABCRE market this quarter. Thanks to strong execution against the plans the commercial team began last year, we are making progress toward our near-term goal to put AVONEX back on a ABCRE market share growth trajectory. In the U.S., we further expanded the number of [indiscernible] in the field to increase share [indiscernible], focused the AVONEX and TYSABRI sales force to more efficient targeting and employed simple messaging focused on sustained disability impacts to maximize our efforts and address the evolving competitive landscape. In addition, the [indiscernible] that we put in place at the end of last year has now resulted in more awareness in key offices, increased conversion in prescription written to new patients starting therapy and improved patient compliance. We are also starting to see some improvement in the economic environment, which are allowing patients to move out of the free drug programs. 
Outside the U.S., we are also seeing a very fast payback on our commercial structure investment. Where AVONEX unit demand grew by 14% as we held and started to improve share and the overall market continued to expand. In addition, our geographic expansion is paying off as we see quarterly revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region of 31%. In Japan, market share is now in excess of 35%. And this is a milestone for the company, showing solid evidence that we could set up both a profitable and competitive business in Japan and set the stage for our future pipeline. Still the good news about AVONEX expanding the European Union and Canada, the commercial team is ready for a successful execution of the new offering to the market. This is a very important evolution for patients who are treating their MS with AVONEX. Data show that AVONEX PEN reduces injection pain and injection anxiety compared to manual injection. Through this new, convenient administration, AVONEX PEN has the possibility of improving patient independence and may even improve adherence. 
Moving on TYSABRI performance. Quarter 1, 2011 worldwide in market, TYSABRI revenue was $349 million, an increase of 20% versus Q1 2010. And TYSABRI units increased 15% over Q1 2010 as well. We ended the quarter with 58,400 patients, an increase of 1,800 patients or 3% over Q4 2010. And we continued to gain market share despite more competition in the MS marketplace. Worldwide, net patient addition averaged 138 per week, up from 131 in quarter 4 2010. In the U.S., while we see moderating growth for new patients, we see increases in both new TOUCH forms submitted and patients graduated onto therapy this quarter versus the previous quarter, showing that demand of TYSABRI is strong. While STRATIFY 2 has impacted a number of patient discontinuation, it has had less impact than might have been expected given that more than half of the MS population will be expected to be JCV positive. There are now more than 20,000 patients who have been accrued into those certified trial. In those certified trial in the U.S. will suggest a tremendous amount of interest on the part of patients and physicians for more individualized care to this stratification.
Outside the U.S., the number of weekly net patient was strong this quarter. TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 6% and unit grew by 6% sequentially. In our emerging markets, TYSABRI also continues to grow. The launch of TYSABRI in India continues to grow as planned, and we achieved 
an appropriate price in Brazil and Argentina, allowing for a 2-scale launch in these countries. As Doug mentioned, in the EU, the JCV commercial assay became available on a limited basis starting in March of this year through a partner lab. We have been working with a limited number of MS centers [indiscernible] to ensure the logistic of sample collection and delivery of assay result in working -- as a result is working smoothly. So far, the process has gone well. We expect broad availability of the commercial assay in the U.S., in the European Union sometime next month. 
In the U.S., we are also finalizing plans to make the assay available to key diagnostic and reimbursement channels and expect broad commercial availability in the coming months. Our goal is to ensure that there are no barriers for patients and physicians to have access to the risks stratification tool they need to make an informed treatment decision. AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to hold their own even with competition from others. The overall market has modestly grown as a result of new entry and we expect orders to gain market share and meet the needs of a segment of the marketplace.
However, we believe that there is clearly room for both AVONEX and TYSABRI to continue to perform well and the safety and efficacy of both AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to make them a compelling option for patients. Strong, focused plan, along with strong local execution by the commercial teams around the world are paying off. And we've set the stage for a sustainable positive performance throughout the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."
29726,129616919,116457,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Francesco. I'll start with our GAAP financials, which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for th",923,"Thanks, Francesco. I'll start with our GAAP financials, which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter were $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $17 million related to our restructuring. These were offset by $19 million of tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20 in the first quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43 for Q1, a 32% increase versus prior year. Total revenue grew 9% to $1.2 billion.
Q1 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 8% to $642 million. In the U.S. where AVONEX grew 11% to $387 million, inventory in the channel ended at just over two weeks, down from last quarter, which offset a slight favorable comparison with respect to shipping days. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $255 million, which was a 5% increase over Q1 2011 and benefited from some tender market sales in Russia. International AVONEX revenue includes a $7 million hedged loss in Q1. 
As Francesco noted, TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $349 million in the first quarter, growing 20%. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $251 million in Q1, 15% increase over Q1 2010.
In the U.S., Q1 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 21% to $73 million. Q1 international TYSABRI product revenue was $178 million, a 13% increase over prior year. The current quarter included a $1 million loss from hedging. Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. First, our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $722 million in the first quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Our profit share from that business was $222 million, up 11%. The profitability of the collaboration has been enhanced by the sales and marketing restructuring in late 2010.
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and in Q1, this was $32 million, down 18% as royalties from individual countries have expired. And third, in the first quarter, Biogen Idec was reimbursed $3 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. The result was $256 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q1, essentially flat with prior year.
Royalties were $26 million for the first quarter, a sequential quarter decline as we returned to a lower royalty tier from ANGIOMAX sales. We recorded $15 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, $11 million of this amount was due to a onetime cash payment received related to 2 discontinued oncology programs in connection with our restructuring initiatives. 
Now turning to the expense line from the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $103 million or 9% of revenues. Q1 R&D expense was $292 million or 24% of revenues. Q1 SG&A expense was $243 million, 20% of revenues, a reduction from our recent run rate as we're not incurring any meaningful expenses in this line related to the RITUXAN sales and marketing efforts. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $74 million in expense for the quarter.
Other income and expense was a gain of $10 million in Q1. This includes a onetime $14 million gain on the liquidation of an investment which we viewed as no longer strategic. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%, which is higher than previous quarters as our profit mix has shifted slightly more to the U.S. coming out of the restructuring last year. Let me also call attention to the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. In Q1, we incurred a $10 million charge in NCI related to the ALS program Doug spoke of. Specifically, it amounted to $10 million for the successful initiation of the Phase III trial for dexpramipexole. In the first quarter our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million. During Q1, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for a total cost of $195 million. This was offset, however, by shares issued for equity-based compensation.
We ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60:40 between U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.43 in Q1, representing a 32% increase over prior year. 
We're maintaining our previously communicated guidance for full year 2011, which envisions the financial plan designed to capture the economic savings from the 2010 restructuring, optimize the performance of the core brands and invest behind a more focused pipeline, all to drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2011. 
Let me highlight a couple of financial modeling dynamics for the balance of the year. Over the last number of years, we've been capitalizing interest expense as a result of the continued build-out of our large-scale manufacturing plant in Denmark. It is likely in the near term we will look to mothball that plant if we determine that we don't need this capacity. The accounting impact of that decision will be to incur additional interest expense each quarter.
Additionally, we will incur a $15 million expense due to the initiation of IND on the BART program in the second quarter. This will be payable to Neurimmune and charged to the NCI line on the P&L. Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

This was quite a quarter. We've had good commercial results including increasing share for AVONEX in the ABCRE market for the first time in years and an increase in market share overall for TYSABRI, both of which led to a solid financial performance. We had very positive data for BG-12. We had a recommendation by the CHMP for an inclusion of JC virus antibody status as a risk factor for PML in the TYSABRI label in the EU. We had a positive CHMP opinion for the AVONEX PEN in the EU and marketing authorization from Health Canada. We had FDA approval for RITUXAN in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and Microscopic Polyangiitis, 2 severe forms of vasculitis. We dosed the first patient in the Phase III trial of dexpramipexole for ALS. And we continued our focus and our thoughtful resource allocation. All of that gives us a great start for 2011, and we're looking forward to a continued great year.
Let me just conclude by saying that these results are the result of a lot of hard work and dedication and talent of a lot of employees here at Biogen Idec.

We're off to a great start for 2011, and I'd like to begin today's call by taking a moment to recap some of the first quarter accomplishments and results. I'm particularly pleased with 3 areas where we continue to perform well. First, our current business is solid. As you'll hear in a few minutes, our products continue to do well, and our financial performance is strong. We're continuing our transformation into a lean, aggressive, focused organization. And as far as our R&D, I think the reinvigoration of R&D is underway. And that's evidenced by achieving a number of accomplishments this quarter.
So let me start with some of the R&D accomplishments. So last week, as you know, we were pleased to announce top line results from the DEFINE study. That's the first of 2 registrational trials for BG-12, our investigational oral compound for relapsing-remitting MS [multiple sclerosis]. There's been a lot of positive reaction to the results and the prospect of a potential new treatment option for people with MS. Since that announcement, we've received a lot of inquiries around 3 topics: First, the magnitude of the DEFINE clinical results; second, our economic commitments for BG-12; and third, the intellectual property protection for BG-12. So accordingly, I'd like to take the opportunity of the call here to provide some additional color in all of these areas.
So let me start with the data from DEFINE. The results for the BID and TID doses were generally similar and were all statistically significant versus placebo. Therefore for simplicity, today, I'm only going to discuss the BID results now for both the primary and secondary endpoints. And I'm going to read this slowly so that they have a chance to sink in.
For the primary endpoint, which was the reduction of the proportion of patients who relapsed at two years, the BID dose showed a decline of 49% versus placebo. The reduction in annualized relapse rate of the BID dose versus placebo was 53%. The reduction in the progression of disability as measured by EDSS [Expanded Disability Status Scale] was 38%. For the MRI measures, the reduction in the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was 85% and the reduction of galodinium (sic) [gadolinium] enhancing lesions was 90%.
These are top line results, and we don't yet have detailed safety information. But I can say that the initial data from the trial also showed that BG-12 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile consistent with what we've seen in the published Phase II study of BG-12. We're obviously very excited about these results, and we're looking forward to further analysis of the data from this study as well as the readout from our second Phase III trial, CONFIRMED, in the second half of the year.
As to the economic obligation for BG-12, we acquired the compound and Fumaderm in connection with our acquisition of Fumapharm AG in 2006. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional payment of $15 million upon the achievement of regulatory approval for BG-12 in MS in the EU or the U.S. We also agreed to make additional payments when the cumulative net sales of Fumapharm products reached $500 million, $1 billion and then each $1 billion increment thereafter up to $20 billion. A detailed explanation of the payment schedule is provided in the appendix of the slides for this call.
We've also gotten many questions about the intellectual property for BG-12. And so there are issued patents in both the U.S. and the EU that are relevant to BG-12. In the U.S., we're entitled to the five-year data exclusivity given to new chemical entities, and we own a patent covering the administration of dimethyl fumarate, or DMF, an active ingredient in BG-12, to treat MS and other autoimmune diseases. This patent expires in 2020, with a possible term extension to be determined. 
In the EU, we have a patent covering our BG-12 formulation and the method of treating MS and other autoimmune diseases with the formulation that expires in 2019 and which may also be eligible for patent term extension in some countries. There's some uncertainty around achieving data protection in the EU. Specifically, we believe we're entitled to 8 years of data exclusivity and 2 years of market exclusivity because we believe BG-12 is a new active substance under EU law.
However, the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] has recently taken a position that a single active substance may not qualify for a new active substance status if it was one component of a previously approved multi-component product. Other companies have challenged this position in litigation that's still ongoing. 
Fumaderm is approved for psoriasis in Germany and contains DMF, the active ingredient in BG-12, as well as additional monoethyl fumarate cells. We're closely watching this evolving landscape and we'll continue to address this issue. We believe we will be entitled to data exclusivity, and we'll aggressively make this point as we move the compound forward.
Lastly, at the end of last week, the FDA notified us that they've rescinded the fast-track designation for BG-12. This is not unexpected since there now is an oral treatment available. And I can say that if the CONFIRM data are similar to the DEFINE data, we'll certainly seek priority review upon NDA [Drug Application] filing.
Let me now turn to TYSABRI. As you know, we filed amendments with the EU and the U.S. to include anti-JC virus antibody status as a third factor to help stratify the risk of PML [progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy] along with prior immunosuppressant therapy and duration of treatment, which are already in the label. And I'm happy to say that as we announced earlier this week, the CHMP recommended adding information about JC virus antibody status to the label in EU. The combination of the test, which is now available in the EU, and the inclusion of the antibody status on the label are very positive steps that will provide the tools that physicians and patients need to choose an appropriate MS therapy. We believe that these tools will allow the potential of TYSABRI to be unlocked and may lead to many more patients being able to have access to the benefits of TYSABRI with the risk that they'll be able to define and understand.
Concurrently, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for the 5-year renewal of the marketing authorization for TYSABRI. The FDA decision on our sBLA [supplemental Biologics License Application] filing for the inclusion of the anti-JC virus antibody status to the U.S. label continues to be expected in the second half of the year. Earlier last week, the FDA did approve additional data to be included in the U.S. TYSABRI prescribing information, outlining post-marketing incidence rate of PML by treatment duration. Importantly, the estimated incidence of PML for 1,000 patients for up to 24 infusions is now stated as 0.3; for 25 to 36 infusions, as 1.5; and for 37 to 48 infusions, as 0.9.
There were a number of other very positive events in our R&D programs recently, and Doug Williams will cover those in more detail in a few minutes. And I want to briefly now turn to our financial performance. Basically, our current business is very strong. We have 3 blockbuster products that are performing well despite the competitive landscape. We have good cash flow, and we finished the quarter with an overall strong financial performance. Overall revenues grew by 9% this quarter over Q1 2010 while product revenues grew by 10%. And our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43, up 32% versus Q1 2010.
In summary, Q1 was a great kickoff to 2011 and finds Biogen Idec a leaner, more aggressive and more efficient organization that's focused on the highest payoff activities. Our R&D organization is reenergized and well underway to capitalize on some very promising opportunities. And our commercial organization is firing on all cylinders. I will now hand the call over to Doug Williams, our R&D head, who will update us on the R&D pipeline and the changes he's made to the R&D organization. Doug?"

That's not to say there isn't work to be done to improve our productivity, but I believe that we have a solid base from which to build a world-class R&D capability.
As George mentioned, last week, we announced positive top line data results from DEFINE, the first Phase III study of BG-12 in relapsing MS. I'd like Dr. Al Sandrock to share with you some of the rationale for the design of the study. Al's done a tremendous job of leading this program, along with our talented internal team of dedicated neurologists and scientists. And with that, I'll pass the call off to Al."

It certainly does feel great to share with our shareholders the progress we've made with our oral MS program, BG-12. It really was a team effort, a dedicated team of scientists, neurologists, clinical operations people, statisticians and many others that have contributed to this moment. As you recall, the DEFINE study was a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, multi-centered, placebo-controlled dose comparison study in over 1,200 relapsing-remitting MS patients. As George mentioned, both doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo.
In the DEFINE trial, 2 endpoints assessing relapses were included, the proportion of relapsing patients at 2 years as the primary endpoint and annualized relapse rate as the secondary endpoint. The second Phase III study of BG-12, CONFIRM, is also a 2-year, placebo-controlled dose comparison study, which includes glatiramer acetate as a reference comparator arm.
CONFIRM's primary endpoint is reduction of relapses at 2 years. Through the study endpoints for both DEFINE and CONFIRM, we will have a full spectrum of information regarding the effect BG-12 has on relapses. In addition, both trials were designed to measure the effects of BG-12 on EDSS, an extremely important endpoint for disability progression. Top line data release for CONFIRM continues to be expected in the second half of 2011, and we look forward to presenting more details from the DEFINE study in an upcoming medical meeting later this year. 
BG-12 is the only compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of MS that has been shown to activate the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, a central mechanism of cellular defense against oxidative and metabolic stress. This pathway has shown anti-inflammatory properties in clinical trials and, experimentally, has demonstrated no protective effects. By increasing the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, BG-12 may prevent further cell damage and tissue loss in MS patients that can lead to symptoms of the disease. With that, I will pass the call back to Doug."

Let's move on to a discussion of the rest of our pipeline progress since our last earnings call. Last week, we shared important data on our neurology franchise at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting where we demonstrated the strength and depth of our neurology pipeline with 55 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. At AAN, we presented data on the efficacy of TYSABRI, where treated patients were more likely to have improved EDSS score over time versus a worsened score, lower annualized relapse rates and significant cognitive improvements in MS patients. AAN was also a great forum for us to present data on our TYSABRI risk stratification efforts. We discussed the role of prior immunosuppressant usage, TYSABRI treatment duration and anti-JCV antibody status in stratifying patients for their potential risk of PML. To date, based on an analysis of archived 3 PML samples from patients, 27 out of 27 TYSABRI-treated related PML cases have tested positive with the JCV antibody assay. We're committed to continuing to invest significant time and resources to evaluate additional risk factors for TYSABRI so that physicians and patients can make informed benefit-risk decisions.
Earlier this quarter, we made important progress on our JCV antibody risk stratification efforts. We obtained a CE mark for the JCV antibody assay in Europe. In the U.S., we're planning to make the assay available as a laboratory-developed test, or LDT. We expect to have the commercial assay under the CE mark broadly available in Europe by May and in the U.S. through the LDT process within the coming months. Francesco will provide you with additional details. 
During the first quarter, we also made progress on all of our registrational trials. We continue to make good progress on advancing and developing our clinical pipeline. Updates on our neurology pipeline include, initiation of patient enrollment in EMPOWER, the global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. We've agreed with the FDA on a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for the design of this trial. We believe that dex [dexpramipexole] has the potential to provide a significant advancement for the treatment of patients suffering from ALS. Dex is a novel oral compound that's shown neuroprotective properties in multiple experimental and preclinical studies. In a 2-part Phase II study, dex showed a dose-dependent trend towards slowing functional decline as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale across treatment groups over a 12-week period and a trend toward improving overall survival over a 6-month period. Given the nature of the disease and the limited treatment options available, there's a pressing need for novel and effective therapies. Currently, there's only 1 approved treatment available to patients with at most a modest clinical benefit. We expect to fully enroll this trial by year end, with top line data available in 2013.
We expect to finish enrollment and advance the registrational study of PEGylated interferon by year end. With a 1-year treatment duration and annualized relapse rate as the primary endpoint, we expect top line data to be available in the first half of 2013. In the second half of this year, we expect to present top line data from SELECT, the first of two registrational trials for daclizumab. This drug targets the pathogenic activated T-cells in MS through a novel mechanism, and Phase II studies have shown solid efficacy and promising safety with the convenience of once-monthly subcutaneous dosing. We continue to work closely with the EMA [European Medicines Agency] during our appeal process for prolonged-release fampridine tablets to address their concerns with the goal of making this important medication available to MS patients in Europe. We'll update you when the procedure concludes. Additionally, we've withdrawn fampridine application from SwissMedic. 
Finally, I'm pleased to say that we've received positive opinion from the CHMP and authorization from Health Canada for the AVONEX PEN. The PEN delivery will make for a better patient experience with AVONEX, one of the most trusted MS therapies available. The FDA required additional information in our filing, and we anticipate that the updated file will be approved in the first half of next year. 
Moving on to our hemophilia programs. We continue to expect to complete enrollment in both B-LONG and A-LONG studies in 2011 and for data readout in 2012. Earlier this week, we also received FDA approval for RITUXAN in combination with corticosteroids as the new treatment for adults with Wegener’s Granulomatosis and Microscopic Polyangiitis, 2 severe forms of vasculitis. While these are relatively small indications, the need is significant, and it reflects the commitment that we and our partner, Genentech, have for following the science and developing the drug for as broad a group of patients as possible.
Along with substantial progress in our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken steps to thoroughly evaluate our R&D organizational structure and our earlier-stage R&D portfolio and technology platforms. Our vision for the R&D organization is to make us the envy of the biotech industry in terms of pipeline depth and speed of advancement of our pipeline. Our performance over the last several years has not been at this level, and we took several steps in the last few weeks to restructure and create a solid base for future strengthening and growth. We've restructured our R&D group to more closely align resources with high-priority programs. Dr. Al Sandrock has been appointed as Senior Vice President of Development, with responsibly for clinical programs in neurology and immunology. This increased scope of responsibly for Al reflects a recognition of his accomplishments over the last several years and his skill as an architect of science-based development programs.
As part of these reviews, we phased out several early-stage programs in immunology and neurology and reallocated people and resources to other higher-priority projects. These were difficult but necessary decisions that needed to be made. These decisions were not necessarily based on the quality of science but on an assessment of whether the programs had sufficient differentiation and likely timing of market introduction to be competitive. All of the remaining Phase I and II candidates are potentially transformational drugs addressing unmet medical needs in areas of strength for Biogen Idec. 
We have 4 very exciting Phase I and II programs that we prioritize and can fully resource. These include the anti-LINGO program for remyelination in all forms of MS, TWEAK for lupus nephritis, the anti-CD40 Ligand antibody for general lupus and neublastin for neuropathic pain. We decided to advance neublastin after further review of that data. We recently filed the IND [Investigational New Drug Application] for our anti-beta-amyloid antibody, known as BART, for treating Alzheimer's disease. All of these candidates have significant potential to address unmet medical needs with a high degree of differentiation. These program decisions also create some capacity to bring in potentially transformational drugs and new technologies from external sources. We'll also apply the same rigorous criteria for pursuing emerging external opportunities that are in line with our strengths in neurology, immunology, as well as hemophilia and hematology. 
Our current progress in the changes we implemented over the last 2 months created a solid basis to grow the portfolio and position the R&D organization to achieve our aim of being the premier R&D company in the industry. With that, I'll now pass the call to Dr. Francesco Granata, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."
29726,129616919,117082,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. And good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance started the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and unit growth was positive. For quarter 1, we ac",1024,"Thank you, Doug. And good morning everyone. As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance started the year with a very positive momentum. Global AVONEX and TYSABRI patient share and unit growth was positive. For quarter 1, we achieved 10% global sales growth and 10% unit growth versus Q1 2010. Both AVONEX and TYSABRI performed well. These are the result of a stronger and more focused global commercial infrastructure. Because we have added more resources where they were needed and eliminated unnecessary layers of management, we believe that our journey to success is both structured and sustainable.
Starting with AVONEX. Our performance in the U.S. has continued to hold. We have now had 4 consecutive quarters of unit sales around the 166,000 to 170,000 range after several years of unit sales declines. And units has led quarter 1 2011 versus quarter 1 2010. For the first time in several years, despite the heavy competition in the market, I'm very pleased to report that AVONEX gained market share in the ABCRE market this quarter. Thanks to strong execution against the plans the commercial team began last year, we are making progress toward our near-term goal to put AVONEX back on a ABCRE market share growth trajectory. In the U.S., we further expanded the number of [indiscernible] in the field to increase share [indiscernible], focused the AVONEX and TYSABRI sales force to more efficient targeting and employed simple messaging focused on sustained disability impacts to maximize our efforts and address the evolving competitive landscape. In addition, the [indiscernible] that we put in place at the end of last year has now resulted in more awareness in key offices, increased conversion in prescription written to new patients starting therapy and improved patient compliance. We are also starting to see some improvement in the economic environment, which are allowing patients to move out of the free drug programs. 
Outside the U.S., we are also seeing a very fast payback on our commercial structure investment. Where AVONEX unit demand grew by 14% as we held and started to improve share and the overall market continued to expand. In addition, our geographic expansion is paying off as we see quarterly revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region of 31%. In Japan, market share is now in excess of 35%. And this is a milestone for the company, showing solid evidence that we could set up both a profitable and competitive business in Japan and set the stage for our future pipeline. Still the good news about AVONEX expanding the European Union and Canada, the commercial team is ready for a successful execution of the new offering to the market. This is a very important evolution for patients who are treating their MS with AVONEX. Data show that AVONEX PEN reduces injection pain and injection anxiety compared to manual injection. Through this new, convenient administration, AVONEX PEN has the possibility of improving patient independence and may even improve adherence. 
Moving on TYSABRI performance. Quarter 1, 2011 worldwide in market, TYSABRI revenue was $349 million, an increase of 20% versus Q1 2010. And TYSABRI units increased 15% over Q1 2010 as well. We ended the quarter with 58,400 patients, an increase of 1,800 patients or 3% over Q4 2010. And we continued to gain market share despite more competition in the MS marketplace. Worldwide, net patient addition averaged 138 per week, up from 131 in quarter 4 2010. In the U.S., while we see moderating growth for new patients, we see increases in both new TOUCH forms submitted and patients graduated onto therapy this quarter versus the previous quarter, showing that demand of TYSABRI is strong. While STRATIFY 2 has impacted a number of patient discontinuation, it has had less impact than might have been expected given that more than half of the MS population will be expected to be JCV positive. There are now more than 20,000 patients who have been accrued into those certified trial. In those certified trial in the U.S. will suggest a tremendous amount of interest on the part of patients and physicians for more individualized care to this stratification.
Outside the U.S., the number of weekly net patient was strong this quarter. TYSABRI patients outside the U.S. grew by 6% and unit grew by 6% sequentially. In our emerging markets, TYSABRI also continues to grow. The launch of TYSABRI in India continues to grow as planned, and we achieved 
an appropriate price in Brazil and Argentina, allowing for a 2-scale launch in these countries. As Doug mentioned, in the EU, the JCV commercial assay became available on a limited basis starting in March of this year through a partner lab. We have been working with a limited number of MS centers [indiscernible] to ensure the logistic of sample collection and delivery of assay result in working -- as a result is working smoothly. So far, the process has gone well. We expect broad availability of the commercial assay in the U.S., in the European Union sometime next month. 
In the U.S., we are also finalizing plans to make the assay available to key diagnostic and reimbursement channels and expect broad commercial availability in the coming months. Our goal is to ensure that there are no barriers for patients and physicians to have access to the risks stratification tool they need to make an informed treatment decision. AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to hold their own even with competition from others. The overall market has modestly grown as a result of new entry and we expect orders to gain market share and meet the needs of a segment of the marketplace.
However, we believe that there is clearly room for both AVONEX and TYSABRI to continue to perform well and the safety and efficacy of both AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to make them a compelling option for patients. Strong, focused plan, along with strong local execution by the commercial teams around the world are paying off. And we've set the stage for a sustainable positive performance throughout the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Table 3 includes the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter were $53 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and $17 million related to our restructuring. These were offset by $19 million of tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20 in the first quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.43 for Q1, a 32% increase versus prior year. Total revenue grew 9% to $1.2 billion.
Q1 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 8% to $642 million. In the U.S. where AVONEX grew 11% to $387 million, inventory in the channel ended at just over two weeks, down from last quarter, which offset a slight favorable comparison with respect to shipping days. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $255 million, which was a 5% increase over Q1 2011 and benefited from some tender market sales in Russia. International AVONEX revenue includes a $7 million hedged loss in Q1. 
As Francesco noted, TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $349 million in the first quarter, growing 20%. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $251 million in Q1, 15% increase over Q1 2010.
In the U.S., Q1 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 21% to $73 million. Q1 international TYSABRI product revenue was $178 million, a 13% increase over prior year. The current quarter included a $1 million loss from hedging. Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. First, our share of the U.S. RITUXAN profits. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $722 million in the first quarter, up 5% versus prior year. Our profit share from that business was $222 million, up 11%. The profitability of the collaboration has been enhanced by the sales and marketing restructuring in late 2010.
Second, we received revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and in Q1, this was $32 million, down 18% as royalties from individual countries have expired. And third, in the first quarter, Biogen Idec was reimbursed $3 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. The result was $256 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q1, essentially flat with prior year.
Royalties were $26 million for the first quarter, a sequential quarter decline as we returned to a lower royalty tier from ANGIOMAX sales. We recorded $15 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, $11 million of this amount was due to a onetime cash payment received related to 2 discontinued oncology programs in connection with our restructuring initiatives. 
Now turning to the expense line from the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $103 million or 9% of revenues. Q1 R&D expense was $292 million or 24% of revenues. Q1 SG&A expense was $243 million, 20% of revenues, a reduction from our recent run rate as we're not incurring any meaningful expenses in this line related to the RITUXAN sales and marketing efforts. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $74 million in expense for the quarter.
Other income and expense was a gain of $10 million in Q1. This includes a onetime $14 million gain on the liquidation of an investment which we viewed as no longer strategic. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%, which is higher than previous quarters as our profit mix has shifted slightly more to the U.S. coming out of the restructuring last year. Let me also call attention to the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. In Q1, we incurred a $10 million charge in NCI related to the ALS program Doug spoke of. Specifically, it amounted to $10 million for the successful initiation of the Phase III trial for dexpramipexole. In the first quarter our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million. During Q1, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for a total cost of $195 million. This was offset, however, by shares issued for equity-based compensation.
We ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60:40 between U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.43 in Q1, representing a 32% increase over prior year. 
We're maintaining our previously communicated guidance for full year 2011, which envisions the financial plan designed to capture the economic savings from the 2010 restructuring, optimize the performance of the core brands and invest behind a more focused pipeline, all to drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2011. 
Let me highlight a couple of financial modeling dynamics for the balance of the year. Over the last number of years, we've been capitalizing interest expense as a result of the continued build-out of our large-scale manufacturing plant in Denmark. It is likely in the near term we will look to mothball that plant if we determine that we don't need this capacity. The accounting impact of that decision will be to incur additional interest expense each quarter.
Additionally, we will incur a $15 million expense due to the initiation of IND on the BART program in the second quarter. This will be payable to Neurimmune and charged to the NCI line on the P&L. Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

This was quite a quarter. We've had good commercial results including increasing share for AVONEX in the ABCRE market for the first time in years and an increase in market share overall for TYSABRI, both of which led to a solid financial performance. We had very positive data for BG-12. We had a recommendation by the CHMP for an inclusion of JC virus antibody status as a risk factor for PML in the TYSABRI label in the EU. We had a positive CHMP opinion for the AVONEX PEN in the EU and marketing authorization from Health Canada. We had FDA approval for RITUXAN in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and Microscopic Polyangiitis, 2 severe forms of vasculitis. We dosed the first patient in the Phase III trial of dexpramipexole for ALS. And we continued our focus and our thoughtful resource allocation. All of that gives us a great start for 2011, and we're looking forward to a continued great year.
Let me just conclude by saying that these results are the result of a lot of hard work and dedication and talent of a lot of employees here at Biogen Idec. And I just want to acknowledge the contributions that those employees have made and thank them for everything they've done for the company. So with that, we'll close the call and open -- we'll close our remarks and open up the call for questions."

I think the one important thing that happened this quarter, which in most quarters would've been the focus of the most of the questions is that we actually did get approval from the EU to put JC virus antibody status as a risk factor on the label. Once that's on the label, once the test is available, both of which are the case now in Europe, then we can actually talk to physicians and talk to -- make it clear to physicians and patients what their individual risk is likely to be.

We're now halfway through the year and we're pleased with the performance of the company so far. For the quarter, product revenues grew by 11% year-over-year the big driver was TYSABRI, which grew 20% year-over-year, and which is now trending to reach over $1.5 million in annualized in market sales. Total revenues were $1.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.36. Both of these numbers were impacted by a charge for an arbitration decision this quarter between Genentech in Hooks that affected RITUXAN which had a negative impact of about $0.15 on our EPS. 
In addition to strong TYSABRI sales, Everex continue to do well and Everex market share in the has been stabilized. After that a good quarter for RITUXAN and continued focus on cost and all adds up to solid financial and commercial performance. It's been 12 months since I began with Biogen Idec and now and the time really doesn't seem to have flown by. In addition to our strong and improving commercial performance, I'd like to take a moment or two to recap some additional accomplishments during this time period, as well as the progress we've made on refocusing and reinvigorating Biogen Idec. As you know, we've narrowed our strategic focus to the areas we know best: neurology, immunology and hemophilia. And our R&D is now structured around programs that do truly believe in and that leverage our strengths. Because of this focus, we've made progress toward driving a more efficient R&D organization and our R&D spend is now in the low to mid 20s as a percentage of sales. At this level of investment supports an enviable rate stage pipeline with the potential to produce multiple product launches over the next few years, as well as an emerging high-quality early stage pipeline. 
During the last 12 months, our improved focus and reinvigoration of the organization has driven strong product performance and the latter stage pipelein to mature. Francesco and Doug will talk about these in greater depth. But the highlight after tremendous work by many people in the organization, we received a new label for TYSABRI in the EU to include JC Virus antibody status as additional risk factor for PML. Positions in patients cannot consider JCV antibody status, as well as prior immunosuppressant use and treatment duration when assessing the risk of PML for individual patients. Along with the commercial availability of the JCB vaccine in Europe, the MS community now has more tools to make an informed treatment decision, which we all believe will unlock the value of TYSABRI. Concurrently, the European Commission renewed a 5-year marketing authorization for TYSABRI. The impressive growth of the TYSABRI business over this past year and the strong demand we've seen this quarter is a testament to the efficacy of TYSABRI, as well as the excellent planning and execution. 
After several years of AVONEX share declined, we have substantially improved the business as a result of the thoughtful strategy and excellent execution. In addition this past June, the AVONEX PEN autoinjector device was approved in the EU and Canada and represents an important convenience for patients and a valuable expansion to our AVONEX franchise. After an initial negative opinion from the CHMP earlier this year and against the odds, we received the positive opinion from marketing authorization for FAMPYRA in May. Yesterday, we announced that we received approval for the European Commission for FAMPYRA to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with walking visibility. We're now ramping up a successful launch so that we can maximize the potential of this important compound and address the unmet needs for MS patients with walking impairment. The Hemophilia program has made some great progress. Earlier today Phase-I,II data were presented for our long-acting factory product at a major medical meeting in Kyoto, Japan. Our long-acting factor addresses an important unmet need in hemophilia community where less frequent injections will mean more convenience and potentially better compliance in prophylactic layer which in turn can potentially lead to better long-term outcomes for patients. 
Last quarter, we shared the topline results from the foreign, the first of 2 registration of trials for BG-12, our investigational oral compound for relaxing remitting MS. We're very enthusiastic about the results and we're optimistic that BG-12 will have a leading role in the MS market. The full data set for DEFINE has been accepted as a platform presentation and will be presented at this fall. And as you know, the second study confirm will also read out during the second half of the year. As the continuation of our efforts towards a more collaborative and reinvigorated culture, we will further consolidate our Massachusetts site and move everyone to our Cambridge location. The proximity will make it easier for people in the various parts of the company to interact with each other and to work effectively as teams. Getting people together is an important part of our culture and will help us become a more agile, focused, and collaborative company. We expect this move to occur in the second half of 2013. 
Before I conclude, I'd like to congratulate the entire organization on these accomplishments. Our performance and outlook are credit to the entire team, to all of our employees whose hard work and dedication has resulted in a strong TYSABRI performance. Our overall solid financial performance and our remarkable progress we've made in advancing one of the strongest late-stage pipeline in the industry. I'd now like to turn the call over to Francesco Granata, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations for a more detailed update on our commercial performance for the quarter.

As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance this quarter is very positive. The journey of the commercial organization success continues as the plan we are executing deliver results. Starting with AVONEX, worldwide sales were up 5% versus Q2 last year and up 3% versus Q1. Our AVONEX performance in the U.S. has continued to hold. This quarter, we had unit sales of 166,000 which was consistent with the previous quarter. And the AVONEX share in the AV share remarket has remained stable from the last 4 months despite the competition in the market. Europe and Canada, AVONEX unit growth remains strong at 4% over the previous quarter and AVONEX is gaining share consistently since late 2010. Although the total unit drop on a sequential basis this quarter due to timing of shipment in some tender market we continue to expand AVONEX in the rapidly emerging markets where AVONEX unit has grown 18% this first 6 months of 2011 compared to the same period last year. 
In Japan, we are one of the highest market share globally for AVONEX at 37%. Moving on TYSABRI performance, Q2 was very strong. We're market base TYSABRI revenue were $389 million, an increase of 31% versus the same quarter last year and TYSABRI units increased 15%. We ended the quarter with 61,500 patients, an increase of 2,400 over the last quarter and we continue to gain market share despite most competition in the MS marketplace. Worldwide, net patient additional an average of 185 per week, up from 146 in Q1 and the highest ever in which we add CS a year ago. In the U.S., we saw a slowly of discontinuation this quarter while at the same time, we saw the highest number of new submitted since 2009. We also reached a significant milestone from TYSABRI of 1 million infusion since the relaunch in 2006. 
As George mentioned, we believe TYSABRI is now on a run rate of $1.5 billion in annualizing market sales. We went to topline strategy, additional training for our phase for and clarifying our messaging with other focus with TYSABRI as the last quarter this demand. In addition, there are now more than 28,000 patients who have been accrued into in the U.S, We suggest the continued interest on the part of the patients and physicians for more individualized care through risk stratification. In the EU, the TYSABRI label is updated. And the JCV commercial became available to our partner unit labs in March. More than 9,000 patients have been tested for JCV antibody status and the at the end of June. When the JCV antibody test became available, 100% of the patients we screened were current TYSABRI users. What we are finding each month goodbye, more and more the patients we screened are non-TYSABRI users, but it of interest in the community to use sure we're thinking about treatment procedure. In addition, now that JCV antibody status is in the label in EU our Stage 4 can begin actively in locating the market in Europe about risk stratification. 
In the U.S., we are also finalizing plans to make the available and expect broad commercial reliability in the coming months. Our goal is to ensure that there are no barriers for patients and physician to accept the sale. In addition to the current performance, I am very excited about when we launch for the commercial business. AVONEX spend and . First given the good news about the approval of the AVONEX PEN in the European Union and Canada this quarter, the commercial team has begun to launch of this important new offering to the market. Canada, Germany, Netherlands the U.K. and the Ireland ar the first countries to launch. In Canada, where the has been available since the start of June, 70% of the AVONEX new staff are and 20% of new AVONEX expense which from either modified therapies. While we are in the very early days, there is much interest in the AVONEX spend for both new patients and current AVONEX users. This would be an important launch for to secure positioning in the ABC market. 
Next, the recent positive opinion for market authorization of epitaph umpire and the European Union in May and in the recent accrual, we are getting ready for launch. Given the high and medical need for mobility empowerment in MS, the team is working to ensure that assessment and management, the working of and how to identify treatment responders is well understood by healthcare professionals. Securing reimbursement and access are also key launch imperatives for the commercial team. By largely leveraging the current infrastructure, we will be able to apply the proper effort to maximize this important treatment. We will be negotiating country by country for pricing and distribution and the first country to launch will be Germany, Q3 this year. With other countries to follow over the course of 2011 and '12. We are fully committed to the successful launch of . We look forward to bringing this important treatment to patients. With the new launch of our lower expand and found in the EU, we are building on the momentum we began this first of the year. I believe now our continued ability to deliver stock performance in the Commercial Group, we are invested in the ongoing education and program for our sales force. This will ensure that they are well-equipped to execute on our current today and for the new launch in the future. In particular, the commercial team has begun internal planning to maximize the BG-12 launch. 
At the same time, we have increased the skills of the medical science team so that they are providing the latest scientific and medical support for our therapeutic Careas within the medical community. We have strengthened and focus our market access capabilities, providing key penetration and growth of our products and prepare for the new launches. And finally in light of our excellence initiative, we have continued to strengthen both the global and the local commercial teams. We have deployed tools allowing them to work better together to fully leverage the skills and the skills of our organization and to develop top-quality brand players and focus on excellent execution. With that in mind, we will continue to focus on making our commercial team the competitive advantage for Biogen. And we now turn the call over to Doug Williams, our Executive Vice President of R&D."

In the analysis, patients who were anti-JCV antibody negative had the lowest risk for developing PML. For patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive, the risk of PML in patients with less than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment and no prior immunosuppressant usage was estimated at 0.4 per thousand. And this risk increased to 2.6 per thousand through patients with TYSABRI exposure between 2 and 4 year. For patients with less than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment and prior immunosuppressant history, the risk of PML was estimated at 1.2 per thousand. The highest risk category was identified with all 3 risk factors which includes anti-JCV antibody positive status, prior immunosuppressant usage and greater than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment. For these patients, the risk of PML was estimated at almost 9 per thousand. 
We believe that approximately 10% of all MS patients are JCV antibody positive and have prior immunosuppressant history. In Europe, physicians and patients are now equipped to make better informed decisions about their treatment with TYSABRI either through the commercial JCV essay or via participation in JEMS which stands for the JCV and epidemiology and MS study. As of mid-July, then rolled over 30,000 patients in JEMS. In the U.S., we expected an FDA decision on our SBLA filing for TYSABRI in October. Also, we expect to make the assay commercial available in the coming months as a laboratory developed test. In the meantime, patients who have access to the assay via stratify study which through mid-July, and we'll need about 28,000 patients. With regards to our hemophilia franchise, we shared important data today at the 23rd Congress of the international Society on hemostasis in Kyoto, Japan. Six out of 8 abstracts were platform presentations and focused on the advancements of our hemophilia programs. One presentation that I will highlight includes a Phase I II A study of our long-lasting fully recombenant factor 8 fusion protein, which showed that the drug demonstrated on approximately 1.7 increase in half-life compared with Advate, a commercially available factory product. In 16 previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Our long-lasting recombinant factor had comparable and dose-dependent peak plasma concentration comparable recovery but reduced clearance relative to Advate. 
Importantly, no inhibitor formation was observed. This data indicate that there would be 50 to 80 less injections per year for Hemophilia A patients. During this quarter, we also made progress on all of our registration trials. Some updates include confirmed the second Phase III study of BG-12 and MS is on track for data readout in the second half of this year. CONFIRM is a 2-year placebo-controlled dose comparison study. In order to fulful EU regulatory requirements, the study includes a glatiramer acetate reference comparer. Trial is not powered for superiority or noninferiority versus glatiramer acetate. CONFIRM's primary endpoint is annualized relapse rate at 2 years for BG-12 versus placebo. We will present detailed results from the fine the first Phase III study of BG-12 in Ekstrom's in October in Amsterdam. 
We expect data readout for SELECT, the first registration enabling study of the in MS be this summer. The has the potential for treating MS with a convenient once monthly subcutaneous administration. The drug targets the pathogenic activated T cells in MS to a normal mechanism in a prior Phase II study showed promising efficacy and safety. ADVANCE, the Phase III trial for MS is plan to complete enrollment by year end. This trial is conducted under a special protocol assessment with the FDA. With the one year treatment duration, an annualized relapse rate is the primary endpoint, we expect topline data to be available in early 2013. we've activated over 80% of the clinical sites in EmPowr, a Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS. All countries participated and at least one center activated. We and our partner cannot buy science, but are very excited about the enthusiasm that we've received for both healthcare providers and patients for participation in this international trial. 
Lastly, we're pleased with the rate of enrollment for B-LONG and A-LONG, the registration trials of long-lasting recombinant Factor 9 and Factor 8 in our on track for readout in 2012. For both of our hemophilia A and B programs, we and our partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, plan to initiate a global pediatric trial in previously treated patients under 12 years of age as soon as sufficient data are available from a study in older patients. 
Moving onto our early-stage pipeline programs, I want to highlight 3. First, our Phase I study of anti-lingo in MS continues to progress on track with data readout expected in early 2012. Primary analysis of the single and multiple ascending dose cohorts will include various safety metrics and pharmacokinetic data as well as measurements on antibody levels in the CSF. Another important early-stage program is neublastin, an endogenous neurotrophic factor, the receptor for which is predominantly expressed in pain sensing neurons in in the peripheral nervous system. Based on animal studies, the drug has shown a reduction of pain behaviors to the the neuropathic pain stage. Phase I study includes both single and multiple ascending dose cohorts we expect data readout for the single ascending portion of the trial in the first half of 2012. 
Third, we've initiated dosing now in the Phase I study of BID-37, our fully humanized anti-A beta also known as Bert in Alzheimer's disease patients. We expect data readout in the second half of 2012. Let me wrap up with a brief organizational update. As George told you earlier, we continue to make progress on our R&D invigoration efforts to do a world-class R&D organization. We're very excited to announce the addition of 3 key hires. First, Dr. Tim Harris, as the Senior Vice President of our Translational Medicine Group. Tim joined us from NCI Frederick where he was Chief Technology Officer and director of the Advanced Technology Program. Tim will provide leadership in our efforts for personalized medicine. His group will focus on molecular, serologic or cell-based markers to identify patients most likely to benefit from our drugs and drug candidates. Our efforts with PML risk stratification is just one example of putting those approaches into practice. 
Second, Dr. Joe Viney, as the Vice President of immunology research. Joe joins us from where she was director research inflammation and lend the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Joe will provide strategic direction and scientific leadership for our immunology research efforts. And third, Dr. Theresa Compton, as Vice President of Urology Research. She'll be taking the leadership role with our PML research efforts. Teresa joins us from Novartis where she was executive director of infectious diseases. The addition of Teresa shows our commitment to restratification. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress R&D organization has attained this quarter, especially with the TYSABRI EU label and turning around the FAMPYRA appeal. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'll now pass the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the second",1211,"Thanks, Doug. I'll begin with our GAAP financials which are provided in tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the second quarter was $55 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, partially offset by the tax impact on our reconciling items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.18 in the second quarter, an increase of 5% over the second quarter of 2010. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.36 for Q2, representing a 4% increase versus prior year. Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.2 billion flat year-over-year. These results, both revenue and earnings per share, including approximate charge of $50 million to Biogen Idec in the second quarter as a result of an accrual for estimated damages related to an intermediate decision in Genentech's ongoing arbitration with Hooks. This amounted to an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.15 to our reported non-GAAP earnings per share. Going to our product revenues, our focus on adding financial details to Francesco's comments. Q2 AVONEX world wide product revenue was strong growing 5% to $659 million. In the U.S. wehre AVONEX next grew 10% to $409 million, inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.3 weeks, a slight increase from last quarter while shipping days remain consistent with the last quarter. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $250 million, which was a 3% decrease compared to Q2 2010. The decrease was impacted primarily by unfavorable hedge comparison. International AVONECS revenue in Q2 includes a $15 million hedge loss as compared to Q2 2010 which included a $50 million hedge gain. 
TYSABRI worldwide in markets sales were $389 million in the second quarter. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $281 million in Q2, a 28% increase over Q2 2010. In the U.S., Q2 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 31% to $81 million. Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $200 million, a 27% increase over the prior year reflecting higher volumes across the majority of markets. Current quarter included a $3 million loss from hedging. 
Not moving onto the RITUXAN collaboration revenue. First, our share of U.S. RITUXAN profits.  U.S. RITUXAN collaboration sales were $749 million in the second quarter, up 6% versus prior year. This was driven by the launch of new indications including first-line maintenance use in follicular lymphoma in 2 forms of vasculitis. Our profit share from the U.S. business were $190 million. Second, royalties and profit-sharing sales of RITUXIMAB outside the U.S. were $25 million in Q2. And third, we reimbursed $2 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN in Q2. The $50 million charge from the accrual relating to Genentech's ongoing arbitration reduced our U.S. profit share by $45 million and reduced the U.S. royalties and profit by $5 million. 
The results net to $216 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q2. Royalties worth $29 million for the second quarter, a slight decrease from the second quarter of 2010. We also recorded $7 million of corporate partner revenue in the second quarter. Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $101 million, or 8% of revenues. Q2 R&D expense was $285 million or 24% of revenues. The late-stage pipeline accounted for over half of the R&D in the investment in the quarter as we continue to make progress on a very exciting set of programs. Additionally, we recognized the $5 million milestone to avail resulting from the initiation of a talk study to support an IND filing. 
Q2 SG&A expense was $265 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. Foreign exchange accounted for all of the increase as SG&A was down on a constant currency basis. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $88 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $12 million in Q2 included in this amount was $6 million of losses related to various strategic investments in early-stage biotech. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% which is favorable compared to our historical rate due to the relative change in business mix with the shift towards our international business in the current quarter. We also benefited from a higher level of expenditures eligible for the orphan drug credit. 
Let me also call attention to the non-controlling interest line on the P&L. In the second quarter, we incurred a $16 million charge in NCI. Included in this amount is a $15 million payment to due to the progress of the BID 37 program for an IND submission. In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $245 million. During Q2, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $191 million. The end of the quarter was approximately $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities split approximately 60/40 between the U.S. and outside the U.S.. Which brings us our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.36 in the second quarter. 
As George mentioned, we signed 2 leases this month in preparation for our consolidation to Cambridge Massachusetts. We expect construction to begin in late 2011. We expect to incur a GAAP charge of approximately $35 million in the second half of 2013 when we occupy the new buildings. Now moving on to our full-year guidance. We now expect full-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digit versus 2010 improved from our original outlook. The improvement in revenues is a result of favorable foreign exchange and more importantly the continued strength we've seen from TYSABRI. With an annualized run rate of in market TYSABRI revenues now trending over $1.5 billion. With respect to cost of goods sold I want to point out that we will see approximately 50 to 75 basis points increase in the balance of year COGS as we'll be finding the AVONEX PEN and JCV assay in order to ensure accessibility for patients. 
We expect COGS to be between 9% and 10% of sales. R&D is expected to be between 22% to 24% of sales, unchanged from prior communication. SG&A expense is expected to be at the higher end of the range of 20% to 21% of revenue driven partially by foreign exchange and a modest growth in expected in the second half to support the launch of FAMPYRA as some prep investment in BG-12. Our tax rate outlook is unchanged at 26% to 28% of BB&T. As a result, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share results of $4.91 and $5.70, respectively. We maintained our non-GAAP EPS guidance while covering the RITUXAN arbitration charge from this quarter in the incremental second half launch investments. So the outlook continues to capture the economic savings from the 2010 restructuring, drive solid performance from each of the core brands and invest behind a more focused pipeline. We expect this will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2011. Now I'll hand the call over to George."

There are several important events for the company in the upcoming months. The first, the RITUXIMAB registration trial will read out this summer. The commercial launch of FAMPYRA in the EU will begin in September. The full results for DEVINE will be presented at in the fall and the confirmed study we'll readout later this year. We're expecting a response from the FDA in the fall for our request to update the TYSABRI label to include virus antibody status as part of restratification. We'll see Phase II data for GA-101 and a show later this year. Our hemophilia registration studies are enrolling well and on track for data readout in 2012 and we had very robust enrollment in our for.

There's some minor differences in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, vastly the same. The only difference is that you couldn't have been on glatiramer acetate previously to enroll and confirm because then we'll go back on potentially a drug that has been on before. The only other difference is the endpoint, is annualized relapse rate should is the primary endpoint and confirm while this is a secondary endpoint in DEFINE and now, the proportion of patients relapsing which was the primary endpoint for DEFINE is now secondary endpoint and confirm.

This was right on track of our our guidance actually contemplated the $300 million. And the 4-key initiatives that we had was a number of programs that were deprioritized in all of those that happened, ranging from Galiximab to HSB 90, to IGF-I R rafted been as involved in the deprioritize one down, and we've attempted to partner a couple of those we've made modest progress  on that. Actually in the first quarter is a couple of very small potential field story in the waiting. We've closed sites that was the second big initiatives to San Diego site was the biggest impact and then consolidation of some Massachussets to those who have essentially happened. Formerly the San Diego site will be closed the third quarter. The workforce reduction was the second one. We had a 13% workforce reduction that is has been executed. And then the restructuring of that RITUXAN collaboration, which has an impact on the P&L in a few different places have been finished and happy to report, actually, that the performance of the RITUXAN business as evidenced even by this quarter with the 6% increase on the top line in the United States that, that restructuring has been -- actually has not only led to efficiencies but effectiveness. Simultaneously, we anticipated as we move into -- this year into 2011 that we'd invest some of that behind depending the old business. And I think that is probably what's showing up in SG&A, an increase. And the second thing that's showing up in SG&A increase this year is the foreign exchange impact. So Q2 was probably the most pressing impact on that because we're comparing a spark rate of 143 last year -- this year to 127. That has had, actually the full impact of the increase in SG&A. So I feel very good that we're achieving that are we're making the right kind of impact and investments back in SG&A to defend in the new landscape and then balance of the year we'll probably as they pointed out, make some investments in SG&A, both to launch FAMPYRA, which actually wasn't included in the original plan, as well have some prep stuff on the BG-12."

If you think about it, between STRATIFY one, STRATIFY two, what we saw in terms of JC virus is in either labs, as well as gems, worldwide, it's over 4,540,000 patients that would have been tested on the JC assay.

We're now halfway through the year and pleased with the performance of the company so far. For the quarter, product revenues grew by 11% year-over-year, the big driver was TYSABRI revenue, which grew 28% year-over-year, and which is now trending to reach over $1.5 billion in annualized end-market sales. Total revenues were $1.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.36. Both of these numbers were impacted by a charge for an arbitration decision this quarter between Genentech and Hoechst that affected RITUXAN, and which had a negative impact of about $0.15 on our EPS. 
In addition to strong TYSABRI sales, AVONEX continued to do well, and AVONEX market share in the ABCRE class has been stabilized. After that, a good quarter for RITUXAN and continued focus on cost, and it all adds up to solid financial and commercial performance. It's been 12 months since I began at Biogen Idec now and the time really does seemed to have flown by. In addition to our strong and improving commercial performance, I'd like to take a moment or 2 to recap some additional accomplishments during this time period, as well as the progress we've made on refocusing and reinvigorating Biogen Idec. 
As you know, we've narrowed our strategic focus to the areas we know best: neurology, immunology and hemophilia. And our R&D is now structured around programs that we truly believe in and that leverage our strengths. Because of this focus, we made progress toward driving a more efficient R&D organization and our R&D spend is now in the low to mid-20s as a percent of sales. This level of investment supports an enviable late-stage pipeline, with the potential to produce multiple product launches over the next few years, as well as an emerging high-quality early-stage pipeline. 
During the last 12 months, our improved focus and reinvigoration of the organization has driven strong product performance and allowed our late-stage pipeline to mature. Francesco and Doug will talk about these in greater depth. But the highlight, after tremendous work by many people in the organization, we received a new label for TYSABRI in the EU to include JC Virus Antibody Status as an additional risk factor for PML. Physicians and patients can now consider JCV Antibody Status, as well as prior immunosuppressant use and treatment duration when assessing the risk of PML for individual patients. Along with the commercial availability of the JCV assay in Europe, the MS community now has more tools to make an informed treatment decision, which we all believe will unlock the value of TYSABRI. Concurrently, the European Commission renewed the 5-year marketing authorization for TYSABRI. The impressive growth of the TYSABRI business over this past year and the strong demand we've seen this quarter is a testament to the efficacy of TYSABRI, as well as the excellent planning and execution. 
After several years of AVONEX share decline, we have substantially improved the business as a result of a thoughtful strategy and excellent execution. In addition this past June, the AVONEX PEN autoinjector device was approved in the EU and Canada, and represents an important convenience for patients and a valuable expansion to our AVONEX franchise. After an initial negative opinion from the CHMP earlier this year and against the odds, we received the positive opinion for marketing authorization for FAMPYRA in May. Yesterday, we announced that we've received approval for the European Commission for FAMPYRA to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis who have walking disability. We're now ramping up for a successful launch, so that we can maximize the potential of this important compound and address the unmet needs for MS patients with walking impairment. 
The hemophilia program has made some great progress. Earlier today, Phase I2 data were presented for our long-acting Factor VIII product at a major medical meeting in Kyoto, Japan. Our long-acting Factor addresses an important unmet need in hemophilia community, where less frequent injections will mean more convenience and potentially better compliance in prophylactic clear, which in turn can potentially lead to better long-term outcomes for patients. 
Last quarter, we shared the top line results from DEFINE, the first of 2 registrational trials for BG-12, our investigational oral compound for relapsing remitting MS. We're very enthusiastic about the results and we're optimistic that BG-12 will have a leading role in the MS market. The full data set for DEFINE has been accepted as a platform presentation and will be presented at ECTRIMS this fall. And as you know, the second study CONFIRM will also read out during the second half of the year. As the continuation of our efforts towards a more collaborative and reinvigorated culture, we will further consolidate our Massachusetts sites and move everyone to our Cambridge location. The proximity will make it easier for people in the various parts of the company to interact with each other and to work effectively as teams. Getting people together is an important part of our culture and will help us become a more agile, focused and collaborative company. We expect this move to occur in the second half of 2013. 
Before I conclude, I'd like to congratulate the entire organization on these accomplishments. Our performance and outlook are a credit to the entire team, to all of our employees, whose hard work and dedication has resulted in a strong TYSABRI performance, our overall solid financial performance and the remarkable progress we've made in advancing one of the strongest late-stage pipelines in the industry. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Francesco Granata, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations for a more detailed update on our commercial performance for the quarter. Francesco?"

As George mentioned at the start of the call, our commercial performance this quarter is very positive. The journey of the commercial organization success continues, as the plan we are executing deliver results. 
Starting with AVONEX. Total worldwide sales were up 5% versus Q2 last year, and up 3% versus Q1. Our AVONEX performance in the U.S. has continued to hold. This quarter, we had unit sales of 166,000, which was consistent with the previous quarter. And the AVONEX patient share in the ABCRE remarket has remained stable for the last 12 months despite the competition in the market. In Europe and Canada, AVONEX unit growth remains strong at 4% over the previous quarter, and AVONEX is gaining share consistently since late 2010. Although the total unit dropped on a sequential basis this quarter due to timing of shipment in some tender market, we continue to expand AVONEX in the rapidly growing emerging markets, where AVONEX unit had grown 18% this first 6 months of 2011 compared to the same period last year. In Japan, we are one of the highest market share globally for AVONEX at 37%. 
Moving on to TYSABRI performance, Q2 was very strong. Worldwide, in-market TYSABRI revenue were $389 million, an increase of 31% versus the same quarter last year, and TYSABRI units increased 15%. We ended the quarter with 61,500 patients, an increase of 2,400 over the last quarter and we continue to gain market share despite more competition in the MS market. Worldwide, net patient addition averaged of 185 per week, up from 146 in Q1 and the highest average, which we add since a year ago. In the U.S., we saw some slowing of discontinuation this quarter, while at the same time, we saw the highest number of new TOUCH forms submitted since 2009. We also reached a significant milestone from TYSABRI of 1 million infusion since the relaunch in 2006. 
As George mentioned, we believe TYSABRI is now on a run rate of $1.5 billion in annualized in-market sales. A well thought-out strategy, additional training for our sales force and clarifying our messaging with added focus on TYSABRI has in large part driven this demand. In addition, there are now more than 28,000 patients, who have been accrued into STRATIFY 1 in the U.S. We suggest the continued interest on the part of the patients and physicians for more individualized care through risk stratification. 
In the EU, the TYSABRI label was updated. And the JCV commercial assay become available to our partner Unilabs in March. More than 9,000 patients have been tested for JCV Antibody Status at the end of June. When the JCV Antibody test first became available, 100% of the patients we screened weren't current TYSABRI users. What we are finding as each month goes by, more and more of the patients we screened are non-TYSABRI users, interesting the community to use risk stratification when thinking about treatment decisions. In addition, now the JCV Antibody Status is in the label in the EU, our sales force can begin actively educating the market in Europe about risk stratification. 
In the U.S., we are also finalizing plans to make the assay available and expect broad commercial availability in the coming months. Our goal is to ensure that there are no barriers for patients and physician to accept the assay. 
In addition to the current business performance, I am very excited about the new launches coming out from commercial business. AVONEX PEN and FAMPYRA. First, given the good news about the approval of the AVONEX PEN in the European Union and Canada this quarter, the commercial team has begun the launch of this important new offering to the market. Canada, Germany, Netherlands, the U.K. and Ireland are the first country to launch. In Canada, where the PEN has been available since the start of June, 70% of the AVONEX new start are on PEN, and 20% of new AVONEX PEN patients switch from other disease modifying therapies. While we are in the very early days, there is much interest in the AVONEX PEN for both new patients and current AVONEX users. This would be an important launch for letting us to  secure AVONEX position in the ABCRE market. 
Next, since the recent positive opinion for market authorization for FAMPYRA in the European Union in May and the recent approval, we have been getting ready for launch. Given the high unmet medical need for mobility environment in MS, the team is working to ensure that assessment and management, the working ability and how to identify treatment responders is well understood by healthcare professionals. Secure reimbursement and access are also key launch imperatives for the commercial team. By largely leveraging the current infrastructure, we will be able to apply the proper effort to maximize this important treatment. We will be negotiating country by country for pricing and distribution, and the first country to launch will be Germany, in Q3 this year. With other countries to follow over the course of 2011 and '12. We are fully committed to the successful launch of  FAMPYRA, and look forward to bringing this important treatment to patients. 
With the new launches of AVONEX PEN and FAMPYRA in the EU, we are building on the momentum we began this first half of the year. I believe, in our continued ability to deliver stock performance in the commercial group, we are invested in the ongoing education and skills improvement for our sales force. This will ensure that they are well-equipped to execute on our current products today and for the new launches in the future. In particular, the commercial team has begun internal planning to maximize the BG-12 launch. 
At the same time, we have increased the skills of the Medical Science Liason Team, so that they are providing the needed scientific and medical support for our therapeutic areas within the medical community. We have strengthened and focus our market access capabilities, providing increased penetration and growth of our products and prepare for the new launches. And finally, in light of our culture of excellent initiative, we have continued to strengthen both the global and the local commercial teams. We have deployed tools allowing them to work better together to fully leverage the scales and the skills of our organization, and to develop top-quality brand plans and focus on excellent execution. With that in mind, we will continue to focus on making our commercial team, the competitive advantage for Biogen. 
I will now turn the call over to Doug Williams, our Executive Vice President of R&D."

Last month, the European Commission approved an update to the",1292,"Thank you, Francesco. During Q2, we made important advancements on several aspects of our R&D program. And as George mentioned, attained a significant milestone for TYSABRI risk stratification. Last month, the European Commission approved an update to the TYSABRI label to include the presence of anti-JC virus antibody as a risk factor for PML. We now have a 3-pronged approach for risk stratification, demonstrating different levels of PML risk, and allowing for a more personalized benefit risk discussion for each patient on/or considering TYSABRI. This update to the EU label was supported by analysis of data in our quantitative risk stratification algorithm. In the analysis, patients who were anti-JCV Antibody negative had the lowest risk for developing PML. For patients who are anti-JCV Antibody positive, the risk of PML in patients with less than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment and no prior immunosuppressant usage was estimated at 0.4 per 1,000. And this risk increased to 2.6 per 1,000 for patients with TYSABRI exposure between 2 and 4 years. For patients with less than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment and prior immunosuppressant history, the risk of PML was estimated at 1.2 per 1,000. The highest risk category was identified with all 3 risk factors, which includes anti-JCV antibody positive status, prior immunosuppressant usage and greater than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment. For these patients, the risk of PML was estimated at almost 9 per 1,000. 
We believe that approximately 10% of all MS patients are JCV Antibody positive and have prior immunosuppressant history. In Europe, physicians and patients are now equipped to make better-informed decisions about their treatment with TYSABRI either through the commercial JCV assay or via participation in JEMS, which stands for the JCV Epidemiology in MS Study. As of mid-July, we enrolled over 3,000 patients in JEMS. In the U.S., we expect a decision -- an FDA decision on our sBLA filing for TYSABRI in October. Also, we expect to make the assay commercially available in the coming months as a laboratory-developed test. In the meantime, patients who have access to the assay via the STRATIFY 2 study, which through mid-July enrolled about 28,000 patients. 
With regards to our hemophilia franchise, we shared important data today at the 23rd Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in Kyoto, Japan. Six out of our 8 abstracts were platform presentations and focused on the advancements of our hemophilia programs. One presentation that I'll highlight includes a Phase I 2a study of our long-lasting fully recombinant Factor VIII Fc fusion protein, which showed that the drug demonstrated on approximately 1.7 fold increase in half-life compared with Advate, a commercially available Factor VIII product in 16 previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII had comparable in dose-dependent peak plasma concentration, comparable recovery but reduced clearance relative to Advate. Importantly, no inhibitor formation was observed. This data indicate that there would be 50 to 80 less injections per year for hemophilia A  patients. During this quarter, we also made progress on all of our registrational trials. Some updates include CONFIRM, the second Phase III study of BG-12 in MS is on track for data readout in the second half of this year. CONFIRM is a 2-year placebo-controlled dose comparison study. In order to fulfill EU regulatory requirements, the study includes a glatiramer acetate reference comparator arm. Trial is not powered for superiority or non-inferiority versus glatiramer acetate.  CONFIRM's primary endpoint is annualized relapse rate at 2 years for BG-12 versus placebo. We will present detailed results from DEFINE, the first Phase III study of BG-12 at ECTRIMS in October in Amsterdam. 
We expect data readout for SELECT, the first registration enabling study of daclizumab in MS to be this summer. DAC has the potential for treating MS with a convenient once monthly subcutaneous administration. The drug targets the pathogenic activated T-cells in MS to a novel mechanism, and a prior Phase II study showed promising efficacy and safety data. 
ADVANCE, the Phase III trial of PEGylated interferon for MS is planned to complete enrollment by year end. This trial is conducted under a special protocol assessment with the FDA. With the one-year treatment duration, an annualized relapse rate is the primary endpoint. We expect top line data to be available in early 2013. We've activated over 80% of the clinical sites in EMPOWER, the da Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS. All countries participated and at least one center activated. We and our partner, Knopp Biosciences, are very excited about the enthusiasm that we've received from both healthcare providers and patients for participation in this international trial. 
Lastly, we're pleased with the rate of enrollment for B-LONG and A-LONG, the registrational trials of long-lasting recombinant Factor IX and Factor VIII, and are on track for readout in 2012. For both of our hemophilia A and B programs, we and our partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, plan to initiate a global pediatric trial in previously treated patients under 12 years of age as soon as sufficient data are available from a study in older patients. 
Moving onto our early-stage pipeline programs, I want to highlight 3. First, our Phase I study of Anti-LINGO in MS continues to progress on track with data readout expected in early 2012. Primary analysis of the single and multiple ascending dose cohorts will include various safety metrics and pharmacokinetic data, as well as measurements of antibody levels in the CSF. 
Another important early-stage program is neublastin, an endogenous neurotrophic factor, the receptor for which is predominantly expressed in pain-sensing neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Based on animal studies, the drug has shown a reduction of pain behaviors to the neuropathic pain state. Phase I study includes both single and multiple ascending dose cohorts, and we expect data readout for the single ascending portion of the trial in the first half of 2012. 
Third, we've initiated dosing now in the Phase I study of  BIIB037, our fully humanized anti-A beta monoclonal antibody, also known as BART in Alzheimer's disease patients. We expect data readout in the second half of 2012. 
Let me wrap up with a brief organizational update. As George told you earlier, we continue to make progress on our R&D invigoration efforts to build a world-class R&D organization. We're very excited to announce the addition of 3 key hires. First, Dr. Tim Harris, as the Senior Vice President of our Translational Medicine Group. Tim joined us from NCI-Frederick, where he was Chief Technology Officer and Director of the Advanced Technology Program. Tim will provide leadership in our efforts for personalized medicine. His group will focus on molecular, serologic or cell-based markers to identify patients most likely to benefit from our drugs and drug candidates. Our efforts with PML risk stratification is just one example of putting those approaches into practice. 
Second, Dr. Jo Viney, as the Vice President of Immunology Research. Jo joins us from Amgen, where she was Executive Director of Research Inflammation, and led the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Jo will provide strategic direction and scientific leadership for our immunology research efforts. 
And third, Dr. Teresa Compton, as Vice President of Virology Research. She'll be taking the leadership role with our PML research efforts. Teresa joins us from Novartis, where she was Executive Director of Infectious Diseases. The addition of Teresa shows our commitment to risk stratification. 
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress the R&D organization has attained this quarter, especially with the TYSABRI EU label and turning around the FAMPYRA appeal. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll begin with our GAAP financials, which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the second",1209,"Thanks, Doug. I'll begin with our GAAP financials, which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the second quarter was $55 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, partially offset by the tax impact on our reconciling items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.18 in the second quarter, an increase of 5% over the second quarter of 2010. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.36 for Q2, representing a 4% increase versus prior year. Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.2 billion, flat year-over-year. These results, both revenue and earnings per share, including approximate charge of $50 million to Biogen Idec in the second quarter, as a result of an accrual for estimated damages related to an intermediate decision in Genentech's ongoing arbitration with Hoechst. This amounted to an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.15 to our reported non-GAAP earnings per share. 
Going to our product revenues, I'll focus on adding financial details to Francesco's comments. Q2 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 5% to $659 million. In the U.S., where AVONEX grew 10% to $409 million, inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.3 weeks, a slight increase from last quarter, while shipping days remained consistent with last quarter. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $250 million, which was a 3% decrease compared to Q2 2010. The decrease was impacted primarily by unfavorable hedge comparison. International AVONEX revenue in Q2 includes a $15 million hedge loss as compared to Q2 2010, which included a $15 million hedge gain. 
TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $389 million in the second quarter. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $281 million in Q2, a 28% increase over Q2 2010. In the U.S., Q2 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 31% to $81 million. Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $200 million, a 27% increase over the prior year, reflecting higher volumes across the majority of markets. Current quarter included a $3 million loss from hedging. 
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. First, our share of U.S. RITUXAN profits.  U.S. RITUXAN collaboration sales were $749 million in the second quarter, up 6% versus prior year. This was driven by the launch of new indications including first-line maintenance use in Follicular Lymphoma and 2 forms of vasculitis. Our profit share from the U.S. business was $190 million.  Second, royalties and profit sharing sales of RITUXIMAB outside the U.S. were $25 million in Q2. And third, we reimbursed $2 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN in Q2. The $50 million charge from the accrual relating to Genentech's ongoing arbitration reduced our U.S. profit share by $45 million and reduced the x U.S. royalties and profit by $5 million. The results netted to $216 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q2. Royalties were $29 million for the second quarter, a slight decrease from the second quarter of 2010. We also recorded $7 million of corporate partner revenue in the second quarter. 
Now turning to the expense lines of the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $101 million or 8% of revenues. Q2 R&D expense was $285 million or 24% of revenues. The late-stage pipeline accounted for over half of the R&D investment in the quarter as we continue to make progress on a very exciting set of programs. Additionally, we recognized the $5 million milestone to avail, resulting from the initiation of a tox study to support an IND filing. 
Q2 SG&A expense was $265 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. Foreign exchange accounted for all of the increase as SG&A was down on a constant currency basis. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $88 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $12 million in Q2, included in this amount was $6 million of losses related to various strategic investments in early-stage biotechs. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%, which is favorable compared to our historical rate due to the relative change in business mix with the shift towards our international business in the current quarter. We also benefited from a higher level of expenditures eligible for the orphan drug credit. 
Let me also call attention to the non-controlling interest line on the P&L. In the second quarter, we incurred a $16 million charge in NCI. Included in this amount is a $15 million payment to Neurimmune due to the progress of the BIIB037 program for an IND submission. 
In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million. During Q2, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $191 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and outside the U.S.. Which brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.36 in the second quarter. 
As George mentioned, we signed 2 leases this month in preparation for our consolidation to Cambridge, Mass. We expect construction to begin in late 2011. We expect to incur a GAAP charge of approximately $35 million in the second half of 2013, when we occupy the new buildings. 
Now moving on to our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of low- to mid-single digit versus 2010, improved from our original outlook. The improvement in revenues is a result of favorable foreign exchange and more importantly, the continued strength we've seen from TYSABRI. With an annualized run rate for in-market TYSABRI revenues now trending over $1.5 billion. With respect to cost of goods sold, I want to point out that we will see approximately 50 to 75 basis points increase in the balance of year COGS, as we'll be finding the AVONEX PEN and JCV assay in order to ensure accessibility for patients. 
We expect COGS to be between 9% and 10% of sales. R&D is expected to be between 22% to 24% of sales, unchanged from prior communication. SG&A expense is expected to be at the higher end of the range of 20% to 21% of revenue, driven partially by foreign exchange and a modest growth in expenses in the second half to support the launch of FAMPYRA and some prep investment in BG-12. 
Our tax rate outlook is unchanged at 26% to 28% of PBT. As a result, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share results above $4.91 and $5.70, respectively. We've maintained our non-GAAP EPS guidance, while covering the RITUXAN arbitration charge from this quarter in the incremental second half launch investments. 
So the outlook continues to capture the economic savings from the 2010 restructuring, drive solid performance from each of the core brands and invest behind a more focused pipeline. We expect this will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2011. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George."

There are several important events for the company in the upcoming months. The first daclizumab registrational trial will readout this summer. The commercial launch of FAMPYRA in the EU will begin in September. The full results for DEFINE will be presented at ECTRIMS in the fall, and the confirmed study will readout later this year. We're expecting a response from the FDA in the fall for our request to update the TYSABRI label to include JC Virus Antibody Status as part of risk stratification. We'll see Phase II data for GA101 in NHL later this year. Our hemophilia registration studies are enrolling well and on track for data readout in 2012, and we had very robust enrollment in our dexpramipexole study for ALS.

This was -- right on track of -- our guidance actually contemplated the $300 million. In the 4 key initiatives that we had was a number of programs that were de prioritized and all of those have happened, ranging from Galiximab to HSP90 to IGF-1R, Cripto, RAF, Lixivaptan. Those have all been de-prioritize, wound down. And we've attempted to partner a couple of those, we've made modest progress  on that. Actually in the first quarter, there's a couple of kind of very small potential deal still in the waiting. We've closed sites, that was the second big initiative. The San Diego site was the biggest impact and then consolidation of some Massachusetts sites. Those have all essentially happened. Formally, the San Diego site will be closed the third quarter. The workforce reduction was the second one. We had a 13% workforce reduction that has been executed. And then the restructuring of the RITUXAN collaboration, which has an impact on the P&L on a few different places have been finished. And happy to report, actually, that the performance of the RITUXAN business as evidenced even by this quarter, with the 6% increase on the top line in the United States, that restructuring has been -- actually has not only led to efficiencies but effectiveness. Simultaneously, we anticipated as we move into 2000 -- this year into 2011 that we'd invest some of that behind, defending the old business. And I think that is probably what's showing up in SG&A, an increase. And then the second thing that's showing up in SG&A increase this year is the foreign exchange impact. So Q2 was probably the most pressing impact on that because we're comparing a spot rate of 143 last year to -- or this year to 127. That has had, actually, the full impact of the increase in SG&A. So I feel very good that we're achieving that and that we're making the right kind of impacts and investments back in SG&A to defend in the new landscape. And then balance of year, we'll probably, as they pointed out, make some investments in SG&A, both to launch FAMPYRA, which actually wasn't included in the original plan, as well have some prep stuff on BG-12."

On the quality side, we should also mention that recently, we have seen during the month of June and a more trend, also in percentage of naive staff, so this is encouraging for the business. As long as the landscape for MS is concerned, we think that over time, there will be an increased penetration of orals, there will be a continues need of high efficacy drugs like TYSABRI, for example, and the risk stratification that we are implementing will allow to capture this opportunity. And we shall see a, not rapid but a decline in the ABCRE, the traditional ABCRE market in favor of this category of drugs. We are fully equipped to compete in this market, with a very complete offer, still having AVONEX  as the -- we think a very good drug to play in the traditional ABCRE market, when we play for market share gains.

It's a more complex settings, so messaging is one component. We have been constantly training the field force in making sure that they deliver the message that -- still AVONEX delivered unsurpassed efficacy and the most convenient and drug and the most studied drug in the ABCRE segment. So the message is clear. The counter message is versus Gilenya is always updated and that people are constantly trained according to what is the evolution of the Gilenya trend. And this is one element of the ingredients. There are other elements that are helping delivering what we think is a good performance is. Rightly for sizing, rightly for training.  Now they have been trained for selling skill, they have been trained scientifically, they have been trained to target the segment, target the market and to manage account by account in a much better way. So there is much more quality, right size and focus of the field force. And finally, we have concentrated the effort on providing additional patient surveys like, for example, deploying nurses in the field in the United States but also in Europe, refining also the messaging of the patient servicing, allowing patients to go and stay more stable in therapy. Finally, I would like to quote something that is related to the dynamic of the switches. AVONEX has always been getting a high proportion of the naive -- of the patient start and have always been one of the largest sources of switches. Switches to the ever ABCRE in the past. Now things have not changed too much, simply some of the switches that from AVONEX who are going to the other ABCRE's, now go to Gilenya without real big impact on increased number of switches. So as you see, the field force effectiveness is messaging and also other intriguing characteristic of AVONEX, that is continuing to do very well in the new patient segment, has continued to keep the same position as it had in the past in the switch market, maybe even strengthening it a little bit."

And the second thing from a scientific point of view, we kind of like being able to do a double-dummy, double-blind study. And since all these interferons now come in pre-filled syringes, we couldn't do a, double-dummy double-blind study with other drugs. Whereas we can with AVONEX since we make it.

If you think about it, between STRATIFY 1, STRATIFY 2, what we saw in terms of JC Virus assay use in Unilabs, as well as JEMS. Worldwide, there's over 45 -- over 40,000 patients now that have been tested on the JC assay. So that is really, really underscores what we're seeing in terms of this interest in risk stratification. And certainly in the United States, as well as outside the United States, anecdotally, what we heard is that it's slowly but surely moved early on in those tests to be primarily TYSABRI patients, to be moving towards a number of, as Francesco had mentioned, non-TYSABRI patients.

But second to start, identifying patients even in first line who could benefit because of the status of their disease by these segments. So we have seen, as I mentioned before, an increase or so of the use of -- is an adopter, not really an adopter, it's a trend over the past 4 or 5 weeks. And that we're trending in the use of TYSABRI for first line.

We have seen an increasing percent of patients utilizing drug holidays and alternative dosage. So all of these elements contribute to the upward trend, and we think that these is a trend that is probably going to be sustainable for -- or will last for also the future. And on FAMPYRA, the straight answer is, yes. There is clearly a team that is across regional. That team capitalize on the U.S. experience as a help in crafting the right messages in Europe. We think we are a good basis of patient to work with. And the Europe, as you know, there are more or less 0.5 million MS patients. Roughly -- slightly more than 1/3 fall in the category of EDSS 4 to 7, so there is a regional pool of patients.

It's really a significant reduction in the burden in terms of infusions that they have to take. Also from a practical perspective, a lot of this pediatric patients have central lines, so it reduces the numbers of interventions and lowers the infection risk as a result of, essentially, accessing those central lines. And so we think, there's a lot of ammunition here to persuade physicians and persuade patients to move to Factor VIII, the long-acting Factor VIII that we're bringing forward. So we're actually quite pleased with the reaction we've seen so far."

We have to use the endpoints that regulatory authorities require for pivotal registrational trials, and there's really only 2 that have been approved: annualize relapse rate and disability progression. Which leads me to the point that disability progression is another key endpoint. We've always believed in it as an important endpoint. In fact, AVONEX was the first drug to use the EDSS as a primary endpoint. And all of our drugs have been tested on that endpoint, and all of our drugs are effective on that point both AVONEX and TYSABRI. And as we dis announced in the first BG-12 trial, disability progression was also statistically significant compared to placebo. So I think EDSS is going to be increasingly important, and disability progression will be noticed. I do think that looking forward, we're going to be looking at novel endpoints such as improvement and function and, for example, we have program in early stages Anti-LINGO, which will probably not affect relapse rate because it doesn't affect inflammation in the brain. But our -- it promises to repair the brain and if it does do that, we'll be looking at sustained improvement in disability, which will be a completely novel endpoint. And with, of course, highly differentiate Anti-LINGO and drugs like it from all the other drugs that are out there now."

For the quarter, product revenues grew by 11% year-over-year. The big driver was TYSABRI revenue, which grew 28% year-over-year and which is now trending to reach over $1.5 billion in annualized end-market sales. Total revenues were $1.2 billion, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.36. Both of these numbers were impacted by a charge for an arbitration decision this quarter between Genentech and Hoechst that affected RITUXAN and which had a negative impact of about $0.15 on our EPS. 
In addition to strong TYSABRI sales, AVONEX continued to do well, and AVONEX market share in the ABCRE class has been stabilized. After that, a good quarter for RITUXAN and continued focus on costs, and it all adds up to solid financial and commercial performance. It's been 12 months since I began at Biogen Idec now, and the time really does seem to have flown by. In addition to our strong and improving commercial performance, I'd like to take a moment or 2 to recap some additional accomplishments during this time period, as well as the progress we've made on refocusing and reinvigorating Biogen Idec. 
As you know, we've narrowed our strategic focus to the areas we know best: neurology, immunology and hemophilia. And our R&D is now structured around programs that we truly believe in and that leverage our strengths. Because of this focus, we made progress toward driving a more efficient R&D organization, and our R&D spend is now in the low to mid-20s as a percent of sales. This level of investment supports an enviable late-stage pipeline with the potential to produce multiple product launches over the next few years, as well as an emerging high-quality early-stage pipeline. 
During the last 12 months, our improved focus and reinvigoration of the organization has driven strong product performance and allowed our late-stage pipeline to mature. Francesco and Doug will talk about these in greater depth. But to highlight, after tremendous work by many people in the organization, we received a new label for TYSABRI in the EU to include JC Virus Antibody Status as an additional risk factor for PML. Physicians and patients can now consider JCV Antibody Status, as well as prior immunosuppressant use and treatment duration when assessing the risk of PML for individual patients. Along with the commercial availability of the JCV assay in Europe, the MS community now has more tools to make an informed treatment decision, which we all believe will unlock the value of TYSABRI. Concurrently, the European Commission renewed the 5-year marketing authorization for TYSABRI. The impressive growth of the TYSABRI business over this past year and the strong demand we've seen this quarter is a testament to the efficacy of TYSABRI, as well as the excellent planning and execution. 
After several years of AVONEX share decline, we have substantially improved the business as a result of a thoughtful strategy and excellent execution. In addition, this past June, the AVONEX PEN autoinjector device was approved in the EU and Canada, and represents an important convenience for patients and a valuable expansion to our AVONEX franchise. After an initial negative opinion from the CHMP earlier this year and against the odds, we received a positive opinion for marketing authorization for FAMPYRA in May. Yesterday, we announced that we've received approval for the European Commission for FAMPYRA to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis who have walking disability. We're now ramping up for a successful launch so that we can maximize the potential of this important compound and address the unmet need for MS patients with walking impairment. 
The hemophilia program has made some great progress. Earlier today, Phase I2 data were presented for our long-acting Factor VIII product at a major medical meeting in Kyoto, Japan. Our long-acting Factor addresses an important unmet need in hemophilia community, where less frequent injections will mean more convenience and potentially better compliance in prophylactic clear, which in turn can potentially lead to better long-term outcomes for patients. 
Last quarter, we shared the top line results from DEFINE, the first of 2 registrational trials for BG-12, our investigational oral compound for relapsing remitting MS. We're very enthusiastic about the results, and we're optimistic that BG-12 will have a leading role in the MS market. The full data set for DEFINE has been accepted as a platform presentation and will be presented at ECTRIMS this fall. And as you know, the second study, CONFIRM, will also read out during the second half of the year. As a continuation of our efforts towards a more collaborative and reinvigorated culture, we will further consolidate our Massachusetts sites and move everyone to our Cambridge location. The proximity will make it easier for people in the various parts of the company to interact with each other and to work effectively as teams. Getting people together is an important part of our culture and will help us become a more agile, focused and collaborative company. We expect this move to occur in the second half of 2013. 
Before I conclude, I'd like to congratulate the entire organization on these accomplishments. Our performance and outlook are a credit to the entire team, to all of our employees, whose hard work and dedication has resulted in a strong TYSABRI performance, our overall solid financial performance and the remarkable progress we've made advancing one of the strongest late-stage pipelines in the industry. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Francesco Granata, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations, for a more detailed update on our commercial performance for the quarter. Francesco?"

Starting with AVONEX. Total worldwide sales were up 5% versus Q2 last year and up 3% versus Q1. Our AVONEX performance in the U.S. has continued to hold. This quarter, we had unit sales of 166,000, which was consistent with the previous quarter. And AVONEX patient share in the ABCRE remarket has remained stable for the last 12 months despite the competition in the market. In Europe and Canada, AVONEX unit growth remains strong at 4% over the previous quarter, and AVONEX is gaining share consistently since late 2010. Although the total unit dropped on a sequential basis this quarter due to timing of shipment in some tender market, we continue to expand AVONEX in the rapidly growing emerging markets, where AVONEX unit had grown 18% this first 6 months of 2011 compared to the same period last year. In Japan, we have one of the highest market share globally for AVONEX at 37%. 
Moving on to TYSABRI performance, Q2 was very strong. Worldwide, in-market TYSABRI revenue was $389 million, an increase of 31% versus the same quarter last year, and TYSABRI units increased 15%. We ended the quarter with 61,500 patients, an increase of 2,400 over the last quarter, and we continue to gain market share despite more competition in the MS market. Worldwide, net patient addition averaged 185 per week, up from 146 in Q1 and the highest average which we add since a year ago. In the U.S., we saw some slowing of discontinuation this quarter, while at the same time, we saw the highest number of new TOUCH forms submitted since 2009. We also reached a significant milestone from TYSABRI of 1 million infusions since the relaunch in 2006. 
As George mentioned, we believe TYSABRI is now on a run rate of $1.5 billion in annualized in-market sales. A well thought-out strategy, additional training for our sales force and clarifying our messaging with added focus on TYSABRI has in large part driven this demand. In addition, there are now more than 28,000 patients who have been accrued into STRATIFY 1 in the U.S. We suggest the continued interest on the part of the patients and physicians for more individualized care through risk stratification.  
In the EU, the TYSABRI label was updated. And the JCV commercial assay become available to our partner Unilabs in March. More than 9,000 patients have been tested for JCV Antibody Status at the end of June. When the JCV Antibody test first became available, 100% of the patients we screened were current TYSABRI users. What we are finding as each month goes by, more and more of the patients we screen are non-TYSABRI users, pointing to the interest in the community to use risk stratification when thinking about treatment decisions. In addition, now the JCV Antibody Status is in the label in the EU, our sales force can begin actively educating the market in Europe about risk stratification. 
In the U.S., we are also finalizing plans to make the assay available and expect broad commercial availability in the coming months. Our goal is to ensure that there are no barriers for patients and physicians to accept the assay. 
In addition to the current business performance, I am very excited about 2 new launches coming up from commercial business: AVONEX PEN and FAMPYRA. First, given the good news about the approval of the AVONEX PEN in the European Union and Canada this quarter, the commercial team has begun the launch of this important new offering to the market. Canada, Germany, Netherlands, the U.K. and Ireland are the first country to launch. In Canada, where the PEN has been available since the start of June, 70% of the AVONEX new start are on PEN, and 20% of new AVONEX PEN patients switch from other disease modifying therapies. While we are in the very early days, there is much interest in the AVONEX PEN for both new patients and current AVONEX users. This will be an important launch for letting us to secure AVONEX position in the ABCRE market. 
Next, since the recent positive opinion for market authorization for FAMPYRA in the European Union in May and the recent approval, we have been getting ready for launch. Given the high unmet medical need for mobility environment in MS, the team is working to ensure that assessment and management, the working ability and how to identify treatment responders is well understood by healthcare professionals. Secure reimbursement and access are also key launch imperatives for the commercial team. By largely leveraging the current infrastructure, we will be able to apply the proper effort to maximize this important treatment. We will be negotiating country by country for pricing and distribution, and the first country to launch will be Germany in Q3 this year with other countries to follow over the course of 2011 and '12. We are fully committed to the successful launch of FAMPYRA and look forward to bringing this important treatment to patients. 
With the new launches of AVONEX PEN and FAMPYRA in the EU, we are building on the momentum we began this first half of the year. I believe, in our continued ability to deliver stock performance in the commercial group, we are invested in the ongoing education and skills improvement for our sales force. This will ensure that they are well-equipped to execute on our current products today and for the new launches in the future. In particular, the commercial team has begun internal planning to maximize the BG-12 launch. 
At the same time, we have increased the skills of the Medical Science Liaison Team, so that they are providing the needed scientific and medical support for our therapeutic areas within the medical community. We have strengthened and focused our market access capabilities to driving increased penetration and growth of our products and prepare for the new launches. And finally, in light of our culture of excellence initiative, we have continued to strengthen both the global and the local commercial teams. We have deployed tools allowing them to work better together to fully leverage the scales and the skills of our organization and to develop top-quality brand plans and focus on excellent execution. With that in mind, we will continue to focus on making our commercial team the competitive advantage for Biogen. 
I will now turn the call over to Doug Williams, our Executive Vice President of R&D."

During Q2, we made important advancements on several aspects of our R&D program and, as George mentioned, attained a significant milestone for TYSABRI risk stratification. Last month, the European Commission approved an update to the TYSABRI label to include the presence of anti-JC virus antibody as a risk factor for PML. We now have a 3-pronged approach for risk stratification, demonstrating different levels of PML risk and allowing for a more personalized benefit risk discussion for each patient on or considering TYSABRI. This update to the EU label was supported by analysis of data and our quantitative risk stratification algorithm. In the analysis, patients who were anti-JCV Antibody negative had the lowest risk for developing PML. For patients who are anti-JCV Antibody positive, the risk of PML in patients with less than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment and no prior immunosuppressant usage was estimated at 0.4 per 1,000. And this risk increased to 2.6 per 1,000 for patients with TYSABRI exposure between 2 and 4 years. For patients with less than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment and prior immunosuppressant history, the risk of PML was estimated at 1.2 per 1,000. The highest risk category was identified with all 3 risk factors, which includes anti-JCV antibody positive status, prior immunosuppressant usage and greater than 2 years of TYSABRI treatment. For these patients, the risk of PML was estimated at almost 9 per 1,000. 
We believe that approximately 10% of all MS patients are JCV Antibody positive and have prior immunosuppressant history. In Europe, physicians and patients are now equipped to make better-informed decisions about their treatment with TYSABRI either through the commercial JCV assay or via participation in JEMS, which stands for the JCV Epidemiology in MS Study. As of mid-July, we enrolled over 3,000 patients in JEMS. In the U.S., we expect a decision -- an FDA decision on our sBLA filing for TYSABRI in October. Also, we expect to make the assay commercially available in the coming months as a laboratory-developed test. In the meantime, patients have access to the assay via the STRATIFY 2 study, which, through mid-July, enrolled about 28,000 patients. 
With regards to our hemophilia franchise, we shared important data today at the 23rd Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in Kyoto, Japan. Six out of our 8 abstracts were platform presentations and focused on the advancements of our hemophilia programs. One presentation that I'll highlight includes a Phase I 2a study of our long-lasting fully recombinant Factor VIII Fc fusion protein, which showed that the drug demonstrated on approximately 1.7 fold increase in half-life compared with Advate, a commercially available Factor VIII product in 16 previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII had comparable -- in dose-dependent peak plasma concentration, comparable recovery but reduced clearance relative to Advate. Importantly, no inhibitor formation was observed. These data indicate that there would be 50 to 80 less injections per year for hemophilia A patients. During this quarter, we also made progress on all of our registrational trials. Some updates include CONFIRM, the second Phase III study of BG-12 in MS, is on track for data readout in the second half of this year. CONFIRM is a 2-year placebo-controlled dose comparison study. In order to fulfill EU regulatory requirements, the study includes a glatiramer acetate reference comparator arm. Trial is not powered for superiority or non-inferiority versus glatiramer acetate.  CONFIRM's primary endpoint is annualized relapse rate at 2 years for BG-12 versus placebo. We will present detailed results from DEFINE, the first Phase III study of BG-12 at ECTRIMS in October in Amsterdam. 
We expect data readout for SELECT, the first registration enabling study of daclizumab in MS to be this summer. Dac has the potential for treating MS with a convenient once monthly subcutaneous administration. The drug targets the pathogenic activated T-cells in MS through a novel mechanism, and a prior Phase II study showed promising efficacy and safety data. 
ADVANCE, the Phase III trial of PEGylated interferon for MS, is planned to complete enrollment by year end. This trial is conducted under a special protocol assessment with the FDA. With a one-year treatment duration, an annualized relapse rate is the primary endpoint. We expect top line data to be available in early 2013. We've activated over 80% of the clinical sites in EMPOWER, the Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS. All countries participated have at least one center activated. We and our partner, Knopp Biosciences, are very excited about the enthusiasm that we've received from both healthcare providers and patients for participation in this international trial. 
Lastly, we're pleased with the rate of enrollment for B-LONG and A-LONG, the registrational trials of long-lasting recombinant Factor IX and Factor VIII, that are on track for readout in 2012. For both of our hemophilia A and B programs, we and our partner, Swedish orphan Biovitrum, plan to initiate a global pediatric trial in previously treated patients under 12 years of age as soon as sufficient data are available from a study in older patients. 
Moving on to our early-stage pipeline programs, I want to highlight 3. First, our Phase I study of Anti-LINGO in MS continues to progress on track with data readout expected in early 2012. Primary analysis of the single and multiple ascending dose cohorts will include various safety metrics and pharmacokinetic data, as well as measurements of antibody levels in the CSF. 
Another important early-stage program is neublastin, an endogenous neurotrophic factor, the receptor for which is predominantly expressed in pain-sensing neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Based on animal studies, the drug has shown a reduction of pain behaviors to the neuropathic pain state. Phase I study includes both single and multiple ascending dose cohorts, and we expect data readout for the single ascending portion of the trial in the first half of 2012. 
Third, we've initiated dosing now in the Phase I study of BIIB037, our fully humanized anti-A beta monoclonal antibody, also known as BART in Alzheimer's disease patients. We expect data readout in the second half of 2012. 
Let me wrap up with a brief organizational update. As George told you earlier, we continue to make progress on our R&D invigoration efforts to build a world-class R&D organization. I’m very excited to announce the addition of 3 key hires. First, Dr. Tim Harris, as the Senior Vice President of our Translational Medicine Group. Tim joined us from NCI-Frederick, where he was Chief Technology Officer and Director of the Advanced Technology Program. Tim will provide leadership in our efforts for personalized medicine. His group will focus on molecular, serologic or cell-based markers to identify patients most likely to benefit from our drugs and drug candidates. Our efforts with PML risk stratification is just one example of putting those approaches into practice. 
Second, Dr. Jo Viney, as the Vice President of Immunology Research. Jo joins us from Amgen, where she was Executive Director of Research Inflammation and led the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Jo will provide strategic direction and scientific leadership for our immunology research efforts. 
And third, Dr. Teresa Compton, as Vice President of Virology Research. She'll be taking the leadership role with our PML research efforts. Teresa joins us from Novartis, where she was Executive Director of Infectious Diseases. The addition of Teresa shows our commitment to risk stratification. 
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress the R&D organization has attained this quarter, especially with the TYSABRI EU label and turning around the FAMPYRA appeal. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

I'll begin with our GAAP financials, which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the second",1210,"Thanks, Doug. I'll begin with our GAAP financials, which are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the second quarter was $55 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, partially offset by the tax impact on our reconciling items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.18 in the second quarter, an increase of 5% over the second quarter 2010. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.36 for Q2, representing a 4% increase versus prior year. Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.2 billion, flat year-over-year. These results, both revenue and earnings per share, including approximate charge of $50 million to Biogen Idec in the second quarter, as a result of an accrual for estimated damages related to an intermediate decision in Genentech's ongoing arbitration with Hoechst. This amounted to an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.15 to our reported non-GAAP earnings per share. 
Going through our product revenues, I'll focus on adding financial details to Francesco's comments. Q2 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was strong, growing 5% to $659 million. In the U.S., where AVONEX grew 10% to $409 million, inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.3 weeks, a slight increase from last quarter, while shipping days remained consistent with last quarter. Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $250 million, which was a 3% decrease compared to Q2 2010. The decrease was impacted primarily by unfavorable hedge comparison. International AVONEX revenue in Q2 includes a $15 million hedge loss as compared to Q2 2010, which included a $15 million hedge gain. 
TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $389 million in the second quarter. For Biogen Idec, we recorded TYSABRI product sales of $281 million in Q2, a 28% increase over Q2 2010. In the U.S., Q2 TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 31% to $81 million. Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $200 million, a 27% increase over the prior year, reflecting higher volumes across the majority of markets. Current quarter included a $3 million loss from hedging. 
Now moving on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues. First, our share of U.S. RITUXAN profits.  U.S. RITUXAN collaboration sales were $749 million in the second quarter, up 6% versus prior year. This was driven by the launch of new indications, including first-line maintenance use in follicular lymphoma and 2 forms of vasculitis. Our profit share from the U.S. business was $190 million. Second, royalties and profit share on sales of RITUXIMAB outside the U.S. were $25 million in Q2. And third, we were reimbursed $2 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN in Q2. The $50 million charge from the accrual relating to Genentech's ongoing arbitration reduced our U.S. profit share by $45 million and reduced the x U.S. royalties and profit by $5 million. The results netted to $216 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q2. Royalties were $29 million for the second quarter, a slight decrease from the second quarter of 2010. We also recorded $7 million of corporate partner revenue in the second quarter. 
Now turning to the expense lines of the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $101 million or 8% of revenues. Q2 R&D expense was $285 million or 24% of revenues. The late-stage pipeline accounted for over half of the R&D investment in the quarter as we continue to make progress on a very exciting set of programs. Additionally, we recognized the $5 million milestone to AVEO, resulting from the initiation of a tox study to support an IND filing. 
Q2 SG&A expense was $265 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. Foreign exchange accounted for all of the increase as SG&A was down on a constant currency basis. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $88 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $12 million in Q2. Included in this amount was $6 million of losses related to various strategic investments in early-stage biotechs. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%, which is favorable compared to our historical rate due to the relative change in business mix with the shift towards our international business in the current quarter. We also benefited from a higher level of expenditures eligible for the orphan drug credit. 
Let me also call attention to the non-controlling interest line on the P&L. In the second quarter, we incurred a $16 million charge in NCI. Included in this amount is a $15 million payment to Neurimmune due to the progress of the BIIB037 program for an IND submission. 
In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million. During Q2, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $191 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and outside the U.S., which brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.36 in the second quarter. 
As George mentioned, we signed 2 leases this month in preparation for our consolidation to Cambridge, Mass. We expect construction to begin in late 2011. We expect to incur a GAAP charge of approximately $35 million in the second half of 2013, when we occupy the new buildings. 
Now moving on to our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of low- to mid-single digit versus 2010, improved from our original outlook. The improvement in revenues is a result of favorable foreign exchange and, more importantly, the continued strength we've seen from TYSABRI with an annualized run rate for in-market TYSABRI revenues now trending over $1.5 billion. With respect to cost of goods sold, I want to point out that we will see approximately 50 to 75 basis points increase in the balance of year COGS, as we'll be finding the AVONEX PEN and JCV assay in order to ensure accessibility for patients. 
We expect COGS to be between 9% and 10% of sales. R&D is expected to be between 22% to 24% of sales, unchanged from prior communication. SG&A expense is expected to be at the higher end of the range of 20% to 21% of revenue, driven partially by foreign exchange and a modest growth in expenses in the second half to support the launch of FAMPYRA and some prep investment in BG-12. 
Our tax rate outlook is unchanged at 26% to 28% of PBT. As a result, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share results above $4.91 and $5.70, respectively. We've maintained our non-GAAP EPS guidance, while covering the RITUXAN arbitration charge from this quarter in the incremental second half launch investments. 
So the outlook continues to capture the economic savings from the 2010 restructuring, drive solid performance from each of the core brands and invest behind a more focused pipeline. We expect this will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2011. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George."

We've accomplished a lot. There's a lot on our plate for the rest of the year, and we're focused on execution and on continuing to deliver on the goals we defined for 2011. 
There are several important events for the company in the upcoming months. The first daclizumab registrational trial will read out this summer. The commercial launch of FAMPYRA in the EU will begin in September. The full results for DEFINE will be presented at ECTRIMS in the fall, and the confirmed study will read out later this year. We're expecting a response from the FDA in the fall for our request to update the TYSABRI label to include JC Virus Antibody Status as part of risk stratification. We'll see Phase II data for GA101 in NHL later this year. Our hemophilia registration studies are enrolling well and on track for a data readout in 2012, and we’ve had very robust enrollment in our dexpramipexole study for ALS.
We enter the second half of the year with a positive momentum, a clarity of mission and a reinvigorated organization.

There's some minor differences in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria. They're vastly the same. The only difference is that you couldn't have been on glatiramer acetate previously to enroll in CONFIRM because they would go back on potentially a drug that they had been on before. The only other difference is the endpoint, is the annualized relapse rate, is the primary endpoint in CONFIRM, whereas it was a secondary endpoint in DEFINE. And now, the proportion of patients relapsing, which was the primary endpoint for DEFINE, is now a secondary endpoint in CONFIRM. So those are the major differences.

Let me kind of wind us back to what were the 4 initiatives, 3 or 4 key initiatives in how we're making on progress. I mean, overall, I'd say, Eric, that we are right on track. This was -- right on track of -- our guidance actually contemplated the $300 million. The 4 key initiatives that we had was a number of programs that were de-prioritized, and all of those have happened, ranging from Galiximab to HSP90 to IGF-1R, Cripto, RAF, Lixivaptan. Those have all been de-prioritized, wound down. And we've attempted to partner a couple of those. We've made modest progress on that. Actually in the first quarter, there's a couple of kind of very small potential deals still in the waiting. We've closed sites. That was the second big initiative. The San Diego site was the biggest impact and then consolidation of some Massachusetts sites. Those have all essentially happened. Formally, the San Diego site will be closed the third quarter. The workforce reduction was the second one. We had a 13% workforce reduction that has been executed. And then the restructuring of the RITUXAN collaboration, which has an impact in the P&L on a few different places has been finished. And happy to report, actually, that the performance of the RITUXAN business as evidenced even by this quarter, with the 6% increase on the top line in the United States, that restructuring has been -- actually has not only led to efficiencies but effectiveness. Simultaneously, we anticipated as we move into this year into 2011 that we'd invest some of that behind defending the oral business. And I think that is probably what's showing up in SG&A, an increase. And then the second thing that's showing up in SG&A increase this year is the foreign exchange impact. So Q2 was probably the most pressing impact on that because we're comparing a spot rate of 143 last year to -- or this year to 127. That has had, actually, the full impact of the increase in SG&A. So I feel very good that we're achieving that and that we're making the right kind of impacts and investments back in SG&A to defend in the new landscape. And then balance of year, we'll probably, as I pointed out, make some investments in SG&A, both to launch FAMPYRA, which actually wasn't included in the original plan, as well have some prep stuff on BG-12."

On the quality side, we should also mention that recently, we have seen during the month of June and a more trend also in percentage of naive staff, so this is encouraging for the business. As long as the landscape for MS is concerned, we think that over time, there will be an increased penetration of orals, there will be a continuous need of high efficacy drugs like TYSABRI, for example, and the risk stratification that we are implementing will allow to capture this opportunity. And we shall see a, not rapid but a decline in the ABCRE, the traditional ABCRE market in favor of this category of drugs. We are fully equipped to compete in this market with a very complete offer, still having AVONEX as , we think, a very good drug to play in the traditional ABCRE market, when we play for market share gains. We have a drug that will address the need for high efficacy to TYSABRI, and we are going to be fully prepared to exploit the potential of what we think will be an excellent offer in the euro segment, while continuing investing in the development of new options, like for example, DAC, that we are going to readout in a few months."

What's working there? Especially given that the latest comments from Novartis and the data from IMS suggest that, really, AVONEX is sort of beginning to stabilize a little bit. And then secondly, relating to daclizumab, the study -- the second Phase III is going head-to-head against daclizumab versus AVONEX, and I know that, that wasn't you guys' decision sort of, that's the previous management team. But maybe help us understand, why was the study designed that way? Why not go against Copaxone or another drug? And then sort of how would daclizumab fit in?"

It's a more complex setting, so messaging is one component. We have been constantly training the field force in making sure that they deliver the message that -- still AVONEX delivered unsurpassed efficacy and being the most convenient and drug and the most studied drug in the ABCRE segment. So the message is clear. The counter message is versus Gilenya is always updated, and the people are constantly trained according to what is the evolution of the Gilenya trend. And this is one element of the ingredients. There are other elements that are helping delivering what we think is a good performance is. Rightly [ph] for sizing, rightly [ph] for training.  Now they have been trained for selling skill, they have been trained scientifically, they have been trained to target the segment, target the market and to manage account by account in a much better way. So there is much more quality, right size and focus of the field force. And finally, we have concentrated the effort on providing additional patient surveys like, for example, deploying nurses in the field in the United States but also in Europe, refining also the messaging of the patient servicing, allowing patients to go and stay more stable in therapy. Finally, I would like to quote something that is related to the dynamic of the switches. AVONEX has always been getting a high proportion of the naive -- of the new patient start and have always been one of the largest sources of switches, switches to the ABCRE in the past. Now things have not changed too much, simply some of the switches that from AVONEX who are going to the other ABCREs now go to Gilenya without a real big impact on increased number of switches. So as you see, the field force effectiveness is messaging and also on the intriguing characteristic of AVONEX, that is continuing to do very well in the new patient segment, has continued to keep the same position as it had in the past in the switch market, maybe even strengthening it a little bit."

First of all, I think the interferons are viewed by most prescribers now as roughly similar in efficacy, particularly over the longer period, 2 years. There are, as you know, head-to-head data and shorter-term studies that seem to suggest that the higher dose interferons are more effective. But I think over a 2-year period, certainly, when you look -- when you compare cross interferons, they're pretty comfortable in terms of efficacy. So that's the first thing. And the second thing from a scientific point of view, we kind of like being able to do a double-dummy, double-blind study. And since all of these interferons now come in pre-filled syringes, we couldn't do a double-dummy double-blind study with other drugs, whereas we can with AVONEX since we make it. And so from a purely scientific point of view, that's the highest way -- that's the highest form of scientifically pure study. So for the both of those reasons, AVONEX was chosen."

So anecdotally, what we're hearing is very similar type of trend, that there is some modest upward pressure on discontinuations but that TYSABRI is being used more, particularly with respect to the benefit of risk stratification. If you think about it, between STRATIFY 1, STRATIFY 2, what we saw in terms of JC Virus assay use in Unilabs, as well as JEMS. Worldwide, there's over 45 -- over 40,000 patients now that have been tested on the JC assay. So that is really, really underscores what we're seeing in terms of this interest in risk stratification. And certainly in the United States, as well as outside the United States, anecdotally, what we’ve heard is that has slowly but surely moved early on in those tests to be primarily TYSABRI patients, to be moving towards a number of, as Francesco had mentioned, non-TYSABRI patients. So I think the dynamic that we've all thought would play out in terms of risk stratification playing into be a meaningful tool for TYSABRI is playing out.

The drivers of the quality trend in the sequential quarter is, again, linked to some, not only one driver. One is that the continuous interest in the segment of high efficacy drug, clearly there is a need. Risk stratification is providing the right tool to a -- first of all, to screen those patients who are more at-risk, and the big wave has already been -- we have already gone through that. But second to start identifying patients even in first line who could benefit because of the status of their disease by these segments. So we have seen, as I mentioned before, an increase or so of the use of -- is an adopter, not really an adopter, it's a trend over the past 4 or 5 weeks. And that we're trending in the use of TYSABRI for first line. So discontinuation are going down as I mentioned because most of the patients who were approaching the 2-year duration of treatment and prior exposure have been already, probably taken out from the -- or had gone into drug holidays. We have seen an increasing percent of patients utilizing drug holidays and alternative dosage. So all of these elements contribute to the upward trend, and we think that this is a trend that is probably going to be sustainable for our -- will last for also the future. And on FAMPYRA, the straight answer is, yes. There is clearly a team that is cross-regional. That team capitalize on the U.S. experience as a help in crafting the right messages in Europe. We think we have a good basis of patients to work with. And Europe, as you know, there are more or less 0.5 million MS patients. Roughly -- slightly more than 1/3 fall in the category of EDSS 4 to 7, so there is a regional pool of patients. We are crafting the messaging to make sure that the physician understands and the payers understand the value proposition which is linked not only to walking distance but also to the ability of the patient to be a little bit more independent in their daily life."

If you think about that in the context of particularly pediatric patients on prophylaxis, it's really a significant reduction in the burden in terms of infusions that they have to take. Also from a practical perspective, a lot of this pediatric patients have central lines, so it reduces the numbers of interventions and lowers the infection risk as a result of, essentially, accessing those central lines. So we think, there's a lot of ammunition here to persuade physicians and persuade patients to move to Factor VIII, the long-acting Factor VIII that we're bringing forward.

We have to use the endpoints that the regulatory authorities require for pivotal registrational trials, and there's really only 2 that have been approved: annualize relapse rate and disability progression, which leads me to the point that disability progression is another key endpoint. We've always believed in it as an important endpoint. In fact, AVONEX was the first drug to use the EDSS as a primary endpoint. And all of our drugs have been tested on that endpoint, and all of our drugs are effective on that point, both AVONEX and TYSABRI. And as we announced in the first BG-12 trial, disability progression was also statistically significant compared to placebo. So I think EDSS is going to be increasingly important, and disability progression will be noticed. I do think that looking forward, we're going to be looking at novel endpoints such as improvement and function, and for example, we have a program in early stages Anti-LINGO which will probably not affect relapse rate because it doesn't affect inflammation in the brain. But our -- it promises to repair the brain, and if it does do that, we'll be looking at sustained improvement in disability, which will be a completely novel endpoint. And with, of course, highly differentiate Anti-LINGO and drugs like it from all the other drugs that are out there now."

We made a very productive third quarter and several exciting announcements during the month of October as well. Our financial performance was excellent as our products like TYSABRI continue to do extremely well. Our pipeline advanced substantially led obviously by BG-12, but also including significant advances in many other portfolio compounds both early and late. And we're also visible from outside the company is executing extremely well and is much more effective and efficient than it was a year ago. 
Let me start out with our business performance. We're now to a 3 quarters of the year, and we continue to deliver solid financial results. For the quarter, product revenues grew by 11% year-over-year. Avonex continue to do well this quarter, with revenues up 6% year-over-year. The continued rollout of the Avonex autoinjector device in the EU and Canada fueled addition patient and physician interest in Avonex, one of the most trusted MS therapies in the world. TYSABRI was a key driver of our overall growth. Revenues were up 26% year-over-year and TYSABRI is on a trajectory to reach over $1.5 billion in annualized end market sales. As a result, total revenues were $1.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 19% at $1.61.
This was a good quarter for TYSABRI, which continues to be a main growth driver for us. First, key data were presented at ECTRIMS in Amsterdam last week that showed that patients who received treatment with TYSABRI early in the course of MS received more clinical benefit than those who delayed treatment with TYSABRI and were first treated with immunosuppressive therapies or switched between acetate. Second, we made important progress on our JCV risk stratification efforts. As the JCV antibody assay became commercially available in the U.S., as well as the EU. There are now over 59,000 patients who tested for JCV antibody status, highlighting the tremendous interest in risk stratification. We believe that this interest means that many patients and physicians are aware of the substantial benefits that can be gained from TYSABRI, as well as the potential risk of using the information to make appropriate treatment decisions. I'm particularly encouraged by the increasing number of patients have been tested or not current TYSABRI patients and I believe that bodes very well for the future of the drug.
Turning to the ADVANCE methorelate stage pipeline, as you all know, details of the defined study for BG-12, our oral candidate for MS, were presented at ECTRIMS last week and top line data for CONFIRM, the second registration on trial for BG-12 were announced Wednesday. Doug will provide more details, but let me just say that both DEFINE and CONFIRM had been compelling efficacy and safety data for BG-12. We now have strong positive results for BG-12 and 2 robust pivotal clinical trials with more than 2,600 patients. We're now focused on filing BG-12 with both the FDA in EMA, which will occur in the first half of next year, with the intent of bringing this potentially major new therapy to patients with MS as soon as possible.
Additional news this quarter from our late-stage pipeline, including data presented at last week's a gross meeting for SELECT, the first of 2 registrational trials for daclizumab, which is being evaluated as once monthly or biweekly subcutaneous injection for relapsing-remitting MS. SELECT showed impressive clinical results for daclizumab and supports the continuation of the second registrational study aside.  We also continue to make progress on the enrollment of ADVANCE, our Phase III trial evaluating once monthly subcutaneous PEGylated Interferon for relapsing-remitting MS, and we expect enrollment to be complete by the end of the year. All of these accomplishments highlight the emerging suite of products that allow Biogen Idec to fully serve all of the segments in the MS market, well-established, well chronicled Injectables, the highest efficacy segment, as well as the growing Oral segment.
Moving on to the rest of the pipeline, we completed enrollment for EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. This was the fastest enrolling trial in Biogen Idec's history, which is largely a reflection of the tremendous need for therapies for this devastating disease. We now expect this trial to read out towards the end of next year. Our hemophilia, long-losing Factor VIII and Factor IX programs continue to enroll well and both of those trials also are on track for data rollout in 2012.
Finally, we announced yesterday that we entered into a collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize an oral highly selective Syk inhibitor. This program plays to our strengths and experience and immunology and has the potential to provide therapies for a variety of autoimmune diseases. This deal is an example of executing on our strategy to fill in our early-stage pipeline with high-quality assets.
As we continue the transformation of the company, I'm pleased to announce this quarter the promotion of Tony Kingsley, Chairman of Global Commercial Operations, starting next month. Tony's been a key member of the commercial team and has led the turnaround of AVONEX sales in the U.S., with this combination of strategic insight and operational expertise, and confident that he the right person to lead our global commercial business and prepare for the potential launch of multiple products in the next several years. As you know, Francesco Granata has led a successful transformation of our commercial group as evidenced by the continuing excellent performance of AVONEX and TYSABRI. I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank Francesco for his contribution to the success of Biogen Idec and for his positive leadership in the organization. At the same time, I want to welcome Tony into his new role. We're all convinced that Tony will take the baton and continue to lead an industry-leading commercial organization.
So with that, I'll turn the call now over to Francesco for a more detailed update on our commercial performance for the quarter."

As we have mentioned over the last several quarters, we started our journey with very clear goals and milestones for substantial growth of the business. I'm proud to say that we continue to be on track to meet or exceed those goals. 
Starting with our MS franchise part of revenue, overall we saw 11% growth year-over-year. Avonex growth continued this quarter and units widely increased 1% and revenues grew 6% on a year-over-year basis. Looking region by region, in the U.S., where we have focused on strategy and execution, AVONEX was seen around 164,000 relatively stable over the last number of quarters and in line with our expectations while revenues grew 6%. The brand has performed quite well in light of a new entrant in the competition for a share of voice in the physician's office. In the European Union and Canada, Avonex remains the market leader and units grew 6% while revenues grew 2% on a year-over-year basis. The Avonex spend is balance in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. There is a new interest in the brand for existing patients, new patients and those switching from other brands. In the U.K., where the PEN was launched this quarter the number of net new stores for Avonex is more than tripled compared to 6 months before the launch. And our U.K. affiliate has added more Avonex patients in the last 3 months than it did for all of 2010. We are very pleased with the momentum the PEN is creating for Avonex while meeting the needs of the patients.
For the markets outside of Europe and North America, our MS franchise revenues grew 26% year-over-year, growing at a faster rate than our overall business. Avonex revenues grew 20%, driven in part by tender market shipment for Q2 that were realized this quarter. An addition highlight is Japan, where Avonex has reached 37% market share year-to-date. Our global footprint and emerging market strategy has paid dividends, continuing to provide revenue upside, as well as opportunity for future growth.
Turning to TYSABRI where wide units are up 16% year-over-year and net new patients are up 2,100 since last quarter. While we saw positive growth in net new patients in the U.S., quarter-over-quarter we saw some slowing of the growth of net new patients in the European Union, due in part to some seasonality among a number of markets and the penetration of DSA. This was not unexpected, and the continued growth of JCV testing by patients not currently taking TYSABRI is very good news. While there will be some quarter-over-quarter variation in TYSABRI net new patients, the overall trend remains positive and we believe risk stratification is helping patients and physicians to make an informed choice about TYSABRI therapy. 
In the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 15% year-over-year and patients number grew 8%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter where we delivered unit growth for TYSABRI in the United States. The JCV assay became a commercial available in the U.S. this quarter as a laboratory developed test, and there are roughly 33,500 patients enrolled we certified through to the end of September. This is a trend towards more nonuser of TYSABRI being tested for JCV status. Patient discontinuation have stabilized and there is strong positive momentum for new touchtone phones.
In the European Union and Canada, TYSABRI units grew 17% year-over-year, and patients number grew 20%. The commercial JCV assay has now been assessed by approximately 1,200 physicians and almost 20,000 patients as for the end of September. While these are initial trends, our market research indicated that nearly a quarter of the patients being tested are not TYSABRI users, and that approximately 70% of JCV positive patients and 98% of JC negative patients stay on treatment with TYSABRI after being tested showing the tremendous opportunity for TYSABRI's continued success and acceptance by the MS marketplace. 
In the emerging markets and rest of the road, TYSABRI units grew 23% and patients grew 30% year-over-year. Brazil launched TYSABRI during the quarter and TYSABRI is now available in over 60 countries. 
This quarter, we acquired the Dompé  JV in Italy and Switzerland. We are grateful for the job that the Dompé launching in establishing our products in this markets. Making Italy and Switzerland direct affiliates for Biogen Idec was important for the profitability of our future Europe product launches. Our European footprint is now direct distribution for all of the major European countries.
I am pleased to announce that Carlos Dorado joined Biogen Idec this quarter to run our Emerging Market group, an area of the business that will benefit from his specific skills and experience. Carlos spent 32 years in various management roles with Schering-Plough in Brazil, Middle East, Europe, the United States and Canada. Carlos will be instrumental as we prepare to enter new markets such as China, Asia Pacific and other important future markets that will help shape our broader global presence. 
While it is still early days, the launch of FAMPYRA in Germany has gained positive momentum. FAMPYRA addresses a higher medical need and has shown to improve walking in all types of MS amount both relapsing and progressing. It can also be given concomitantly with currently available MS treatments.
AMPYRA also became available during the quarter in Australia and U.K., and we anticipate launched in Denmark shortly. Additional launch preparation is underway for the rest of Europe and we expect additional accounts running down in 2012 and reimbursement discussion are finalized.
As you know, I have decided to leave Biogen Idec for personal reasons. I am proud that I have been able to accomplish the mission discussed when I joined the company, deliver strong commercial performance while preparing for future launches. I will be pursuing some other opportunities, which in due time will be communicated. And I am pleased that Tony Kingsley will take on the role of the Head of Global Commercial Operations. Tony has been responsible for the tremendous turnaround in the U.S. business and brings many important skills to the table. He has experience in leading several new product launches, as well as leading complex organization. He has turned around the mode of the U.S. business from a defensive posture to an offensive winning spirit. I have enjoyed my time at Biogen Idec. It is a great company, and I have tremendous confidence in the team that will now move the business forward. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Doug Williams, EVP of R&D."

During Q3, we made important advances on several aspects of our R&D programs, which highlight our novel science continue to position the company for substantial future growth. 
As George mentioned, on Wednesday, we announced positive top line results from CONFIRM, the second Phase III study of BG-12 in relapsing MS. We have now successfully completed, define and confirm 2 randomized blinded, well-controlled Phase III studies is in 2,600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, with very comparable, very positive outcomes. While there's still ongoing analysis being done with the CONFIRM study results, we're now aggressively working on regulatory submissions for BG-12 to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of next year.
Very briefly, the CONFIRM study was a 2-year multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose comparison study in over 1,400 relapsing-remitting MS patients, evaluating 2 doses of BG-12 in comparison to placebo for the reduction in annualized relapse rate or ARR at 2 years. The glatiramer acetate referenced comparer arm was also evaluated versus placebo. Both the BID and TID doses of BG-12 met the study's primary and secondary relapse and MRI endpoints. With respect to reduction of ARR, the primary endpoint of the study, we saw 44% and 51% reduction for BID and TID doses of BG-12 respectively, and a 29% reduction for glatiramer acetate reference arm versus placebo. Data from CONFIRM also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile, consistent with what was seen in DEFINE. Further detailed information from CONFIRM will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
Last week, we also shared comprehensive data from DEFINE, the first registrational study of BG-12 at the ECTRIMS Meeting in Amsterdam. Both doses of BG-12 demonstrated significant clinical effects compared to placebo in the proportion of patients relapsing at 2 years, annualized relapse rate, multiple MRI measures and disability progression. Incidence of infections and severe infections were similar across all treatment arms and no opportunistic infections were observed in the BG-12 treatment arms. While the incidence of flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher with BG-12, these events were primarily mild to moderate and decreased substantially after the first month of treatment. We're very impressed with the robustness of the positive BG-12 data from both DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, and plan to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of 2012. The data shows that BG-12 has a very favorable benefit risk profile, and we believe that if approved, it will provide an important treatment option for patients with relapsing-remitting MS.
Turning to TYSABRI, 28 posters and presentations were presented at last week's ECTRIMS meeting in Amsterdam, highlighting the high standard of efficacy that TYSABRI has set in the MS market. Data from AFFIRM, a long-term outcome study showed ARR and EDSS benefits seen with earlier treatment of TYSABRI over delayed treatment. Data was also presented from the TYSABRI observational study known as TOP. This study assessed long-term outcomes in almost 3,500 patients, and showed that mean ARR and TYSABRI-treated patients were lowest in those that were treatment at naïve at baseline and highest in patients who were previously treated with immunosuppressant agent or switch from another disease modifying therapy further supporting the benefit of early treatments with TYSABRI.
Lastly, we and our partner Elan announced that the FDA notified us of a 3-month extension to the PDUFA date for the TYSABRI sBLA, for updating the prescribing information for TYSABRI to include anti-JC virus antibody status to further help stratify the risk of PML. The FDA has indicated that this extension is needed to allow time for review of the changes being incorporated into the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, also known as REMS, to be consistent with the anticipated subscribing information.  We and Elan are working with the agency to facilitate a timely review of the REMS changes and the sBLA. And finally, for TYSABRI, we initiated patient enrollment in ASCEND, the Phase III trial of TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS. This trial is expected to enroll 860 patients and will investigate whether TYSABRI treatment slows the accumulation of disability not related to relapses and subjects with SPMS.
Turning now to other important aspects of our MS pipeline, in a late breaker presentation at ECTRIMS, we and our partner, Abbott Labs, announced additional data from SELECT, our first registrational study of daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS. SELECT showed significant reduction in annualized relapse rate at 1 year and met key secondary endpoints. The overall incidence of adverse events and treatment discontinuations s were similar in all study arms. Serious infections, serious cutaneous events and liver function test abnormalities greater than 5x the upper limit of normal occurred more frequently in the DAC treated patients. We placed additional monitoring and management measures in the ongoing clinical programs for the cutaneous and LFT events. These data further support investigation of DAC in the ongoing DECIDE study, which is a randomized blinded study of 1,500 patients with the primary endpoint of ARR at 2 years.
I'm pleased to say that we have received the positive decision from the European Commission for the Avonex titration kit. The titration kit is designed to help mitigate flu-like symptoms at the start of therapy, making for better initial experience with Avonex with the most trusted MS therapies available. 
Lastly, enrollment for ADVANCE, our Phase III trial of PEGylated Interferon for MS, is on track to be completed by year-end. The trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA. With an annualized relapse rate at 1 year as its primary endpoint, we anticipate top line data to be available in early 2013. 
From Avonex with its 15 years of safety and efficacy experience, to TYSABRI which sets the standard for high efficacy and our anticipated introductions of BG-12 and daclizumab, we hope to offer MS patients a wide range of treatment options. Our portfolio of MS drugs is unparalleled within the industry and speaks to our commitment to the individual needs of different segments of the MS population.
Turning to the rest of the Neurology pipeline, patient enrollment in EMPOWER, the First Global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, has been completed well ahead of schedule. This highlights the high unmet need for new and effective therapies for ALS. Recall that we've agreed with the FDA on a special protocol assessment for the design of this study. We anticipate top line data readout in the second half of 2012. We expect to initiate the second Phase III study of DECS the first half of 2012. DECS is a novel, oral compound that potentially has neuroprotective properties based on experimental and preclinical studies and may slow the loss of motor neuron function, which is the hallmark of this devastating disease.
Moving on to our hemophilia programs, we continue to expect to complete the bulk of patient enrollment in both B-LONG and A-LONG studies in 2011, but there may be some carryover into the first half of next year. Recall that in the B-LONG steady, there's a surgical arm which may take enrollment into next year. Data readout for both trials, however, remains on track for the second half of 2012.
Along with substantial progress on our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken steps to bolster our earlier stage development pipeline. We announced yesterday an exclusive, worldwide collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize what we believe will be a potent, oral, highly selective Syk inhibitor. In addition Syk has the potential to provide effective, well-tolerated therapies for a variety of autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and atopic diseases. We're encouraged by the preclinical and Phase I clinical data to date, and see an opportunity to develop a best-in-class, highly selective, once daily oral treatment for a broad range of autoimmune diseases. We expect to begin Phase IIa testing of the lead compound next year in ARA. This program plays to our strength and experience in immunology and strengthens our Phase I II pipeline. 
I'm extremely pleased with the progress that the R&D organization as a team this quarter for our pipeline, which is one of the most enviable in the industry. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul Clancy, our Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer."

Table 3 includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the third quarter include $49 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $3 million for contingent consideration, $2 million for restructuring and $5 million in stock comp expense. This is partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43 in the third quarter, an increase of 36% over prior year. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP and P&L which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61 for Q3, a 19% increase versus prior year. 
Moving to revenue, total revenue for the third quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of 11% over prior year. In the U.S., where Avonex grew 6% to $411 million, inventory in the channel ended at just under 2.2 weeks, a slight decrease from last quarter, while shipping days remained consistent. 
Internationally, Avonex product revenue was $271 million, also an increase of 6% compared to prior year. The impact of foreign exchange, strengthened Avonex revenue by $22 million. However, this was offset by a $9 million hedge loss in the quarter as compared to a $17 million hedge gain in prior year. 
Now moving on to TYSABRI, TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $393 million in third quarter, up 28% versus last year, essentially flat versus the second quarter. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenue of $277 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 41% to $85 million, driven by unit and price growth. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenue was $192 million, a 20% increase. The impact of foreign exchange added $16 million to TYSABRI revenue versus prior year, which was offset by a $2 million hedge loss compared to a $4 million hedge gain in prior year.
Now I'll move to RITUXAN collaboration revenues. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $733 million in the third quarter, up 9% versus prior year, driven by increased penetration in the maintenance setting in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and continued uptake in CLL. Our profit share from that business was $234 million. Loyalties and profit share and sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q3 were $32 million down 17% due to royalty expirations. And we were reimbursed $1 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN in Q3. The result was $266 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q3, an increase of 3% over prior year.
Internationally, FAMPYRA revenue were $3 million as we began commercializing in Germany. Royalties were $52 million for the third quarter, an increase of 43% from prior year. The increase was due to hitting a new royalty tier in our partnership on ANGIOMAX. This new tier is applied to all year to date revenue in all our accounting model. We achieved this 1 quarter prior to expectations, resulting in a potentially lower, more normalized royalty revenue in Q4. Additionally, we recorded $16 million of corporate partner revenue, driven by third-party manufacturing contracts with a strategic partner.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L, Q3 cost of goods sold were $124 million, representing 9% of revenues. The increase was due to a number of factors, including the third-party manufacturing, increased JCV assay test in Europe and increased cost for the AVONEX PEN, all important revenues driving investments. Q3 R&D expense was $300 million or 23% of revenues. R&D expense was driven by the accrual on the dexpramipexole trial and the continued progression of the late-stage programs. 
Q3 SG&A expense was $258 million or 20% of revenues, an increase of 7% over same period last year. Foreign exchange impacted SG&A by $12 million, and increase spend supporting new product launches to the increase. This was offset by changes in our sales and marketing of RITUXAN. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $81 million for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $8 million and our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4% as we benefited from a higher level of orphan drug research credit. 
In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $245 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash in marketable securities, split approximately 65%, 35% between the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which again were $1.61 in the third quarter, a 19% increase over the prior year. Let me provide a little bit financial detail on a few recent events. As Francesco noted in September, we completed the acquisition of our 50% increase interest in our joint ventures in Italy and Switzerland. The upfront purchase price was $153 million, which represents the settlement of equity reserves to our former partner and for future cash flow. Additionally, we're obligated to payments of $43 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones.  We also entered into an agreement whereby Dompé agreed to purchase 100% of the outstanding receivables in Italy. Prior to the transaction, the entities were fully consolidated into our income statement, yet 50% of the profits from the sales affiliates have been reported as a noncontrolling interest.  Going forward, there will be no allocation to noncontrolling interest and as a result, 100% of the operations will be reflected on our financial statement.
Moving to Portola, under the collaboration agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals, we will provide an upfront payment of $36 million in cash and $9 million in equity. These will be reflected in our financial statements in the fourth quarter.
Now moving onto our full year guidance, we now expect full year revenue growth of mid-single digits. We continue to expect COGS to be between 9% and 10% of sales, including the impact of AVONEX PEN, the JC virus assay investment and the increased cost of goods sold from contract manufacturing activity. R&D is expected to be at the higher end of 22% to 24% of sales, which now includes the $36 million payment in Q4 associated with our announcement with Portola Pharmaceuticals.
SG&A expense outlook is unchanged at the higher end of the range of 20% to 21% of revenue, driven partially by foreign exchange, launch cost for FAMPYRA and investment in BG-12.  Our tax rate outlook for the full year is unchanged at 26% to 28% of PBT. As a result, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP EPS results above $4.91 and $5.70 respectively. Importantly, we've maintained our non-GAAP EPS guidance while covering the RITUXAN obligation charge from Q2, second half launch investments and the business development activity just recently announced with Portola. 
So a very strong financial outlook for 2011, driving double-digit earnings per share growth. Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

I think it's important that MS is not a homogeneous disease, different patients, some patients progress more than others, some patients more concerned with safety than others, some really focused on efficacy, some don't like needles. And so it's really a heterogenous patient population. The neurologists who treat them have different views as well, some more focused on safety, some more focused on efficacy. And so we now have products that play in all the major segments. So we will -- assuming BG-12 gets on to the market. So Avonex is a great product, it's been on the market 15 years. Now it's has no side effects, it's safe, it's effective and for a lot of patients, Avonex will be a very good choice for them. We have the PEGylated Interferon come in which if successful could make that those see much more convenient to patients and increased interest there. TYSABRI, amazingly efficacious product and for patients who are really concerned about efficacy who have more aggressive form of the disease, who really want to get in charge of their disease, TYSABRI is a great product. And we have the recent data now showing that earlier treatment with TYSABRI has reached a better long-term outcome. So I think for an increasing number of patients, TYSABRI will be a very good choice. And BG-12, you saw the data. It's a remarkable compound. So there'll be a large segment of the patient population, I believe, that will want on oral compound. Obviously BG-12's not the only oral compound that we'll have to choose from, but we believe BG-12 that's a very well and will be a very strong competitor in the segment of the market for patients who want an oral therapy. So I think by having a variety of products like that for patients with different needs, different concerns, we can really maximize the total market share that we have."

One is the high-level of stability of patients who are virus-positive, and we expect this to continue given the efficacy profile of the drug, given also the other risk factor which is associated, time and prior exposure to immunosuppressant. The other -- we have seen also in an extended use of the JC virus on testing patients who are not on TYSABRI, which make us feel that there will be more patients who will be considered for TYSABRI use than before because of the JC virus assay. What we see in Europe is not very different from what we have seen in the United States. You should remember that Europe has a slightly higher immunosuppressant as a first-line therapy for MS than the United States. So it might be that the initial impact could be slightly different from the United States. But the key learnings that we have in the U.S. market has been shared with the European affiliates. So there is a more robust questioning assay management done by Repsol whenever possible or by MS. So we are really confident that the tool will become an important tool to expand the use of TYSABRI user and keep the right positive patients on the drug. I cannot comment on exact percentage. We are still investigating to a market research. But again, we're listing the TYSABRI will continue to be an important tool for patients and physician to treat MS."

You went through the deck, so you probably have these stats, but maybe for everyone. To date, going back to spring of 2010, we now have had over 59,000 patients globally that have been tested for the JCV antibody status. The highest proportion of that is STRATIFY 2. That is just under 34,000 patients. To your specific question on Qwest versus STRATIFY 2, which is kind of really the nub of your detailed question, which is in the United States, those are the 2 options. Qwest is really just about 30 days in. So there is a de minimis amount of Qwest assays in the third quarter. The majority are still STRATIFY 2 in the third quarter. Obviously, the difference is in STRATIFY 2, it's a limited number of sites -- a big number of sites but limited not all the centers across the United States whereas Qwest allows that penetrated yet. Obviously, we're awaiting the PDUFA deadline in the United States, the extend PDUFA deadline in order to really kind of get that thing going. Our objective always was to try to synchronize the label with the commercial availability in the United States. We've got the commercial availability a little bit prior to the label. Unilabs is outside the United States that is about 20,000 tests to date. Of that 20,000, there were about 10,000 assay test in the third quarter alone. So that uptake in Europe per se has been very, very very strong. And I kind of think it probably had as we have alluded in our line alluded, a bit of an impact on discontinuations. But it still is quite strong kind of patient growth, even in light of that in Europe. And as Francesco had noted, we're now seeing as a migration to both naïves of non-TYSABRI patients being considered in Europe. Hopefully, that provide a little bit of color."

So I think it all bodes well, but it just is a little bit longer term. In the short term, the assay, the PEN are very, very good investments. I view them as very, very good investments that are showing up and helping out the buoyancy of Avonex and certainly restratification on TYSABRI penetration."

And we have also seen that there is probably an increase of switches. The switches will occur a little bit earlier, switches for both efficacy and tolerability. And so we expect that this trend that there is a high expectation for oral drug, we continue to be in the market and we'll probably expand a little bit. And on top of that as I said before, there will be more patients coming from emerging markets. Not all of them because of the prevalence of the disease, but emerging market will have better diagnosis and will have also better healthcare system in the future. So we expect that there will be a continuous growth of the MS market with this combined factoring, particular as you mentioned for oral treatment. Still noticing that there will be also some these remain for the high efficacy in that. And still, market will remain for also drugs that are well-established on the market because of their long-term established efficacy and safety profile. So we think we are in a very good market, and we are competing in this market with the right answer for the all the patients and physicians."

We had a very productive third quarter and several exciting announcements during the month of October as well.

We had a very productive third quarter and several exciting announcements during the month of October as well. Our financial performance was excellent as our products with TYSABRI continued to do extremely well. Our pipeline advanced substantially, led obviously by BG-12, but also including significant advances in many other portfolio compounds, both early and late. And while not so visible from the outside, the company is executing extremely well and is much more effective and efficient than it was a year ago. 
Let me start with our business performance. We're now through our 3 quarters of the year, and we continued to deliver solid financial results. For the quarter, product revenues grew by 11% year-over-year. AVONEX continued to do well this quarter, with revenues up 6% year-over-year. The continued rollout of the AVONEX autoinjector device in the EU and Canada fueled addition patient and physician interest in AVONEX, one of the most trusted MS therapies in the world. TYSABRI was a key driver of our overall growth. Revenues were up 26% year-over-year, and TYSABRI is on a trajectory to reach over $1.5 billion in annualized end market sales. As a result, total revenues were $1.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 19% at $1.61.
This was a good quarter for TYSABRI, which continues to be a main growth driver for us. First, key data were presented at ECTRIMS in Amsterdam last week that showed that patients who received treatment with TYSABRI early in the course of MS received more clinical benefit than those who delayed treatment with TYSABRI and were first treated with immunosuppressive therapies or switched between glatiramer acetate and the interferon. 
Second, we made important progress on our JCV risk stratification efforts, as the JCV antibody assay became commercially available in the U.S., as well as the EU. There are now over 59,000 patients who have been through JCV antibody status, highlighting the tremendous interest in risk stratification. We believe that this interest means that many patients and physicians are aware of the substantial benefits that can be gained from TYSABRI, as well as the potential risk of PML, and are using the information to make appropriate treatment decisions. I'm particularly encouraged by the increasing number of patients who have been tested, who are not current TYSABRI patients, and I believe that bodes very well for the future of the drug.
Turning to the advancement of our late-stage pipeline, as you all know, details of the defined study for BG-12, our oral candidate for MS, were presented at ECTRIMS last week. And top line data for CONFIRM, the second registrational trial for BG-12, were announced Wednesday. Doug will provide more details. Let me just say that both DEFINE and CONFIRM displayed compelling efficacy and safety data for BG-12. We now have strong positive results for BG-12 and 2 robust pivotal clinical trials, with more than 2,600 patients. We're now focused on filing BG-12 with both the FDA and EMA, which will occur in the first half of next year, with the intent of bringing this potentially major new therapy to patients with MS as soon as possible.
Additional news this quarter from our late-stage pipeline, including data presented at last week's ECTRIMS meeting for SELECT, the first of 2 registrational trials for daclizumab, which is being evaluated as once monthly or biweekly subcutaneous injection for relapsing-remitting MS. SELECT showed impressive clinical results for daclizumab and supports the continuation of the second registrational study, DECIDE. 
We also continued to make progress in the enrollment of ADVANCE, our Phase III trial, evaluating once monthly subcutaneous PEGylated Interferon for relapsing-remitting MS. And we expect the enrollment to be complete by the end of the year. All of these accomplishments highlight the emerging suite of products that will allow Biogen Idec to fully serve all of the segments in the MS market, well-established, well-chronicled injectables, the highest efficacy segment, as well as the growing oral segment.
Moving on to the rest of the pipeline, we completed enrollment for EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole, for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. This was the fastest enrolling trial in Biogen Idec's history, which is largely a reflection of a tremendous need for therapies for this devastating disease. We now expect this trial to read out towards the end of next year. Our hemophilia, long-losing Factor VIII and Factor IX programs, continued to enroll well. And both of those trials also are on track for data readout in 2012.
Finally, we announced yesterday that we entered into a collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize an oral highly-selective Syk inhibitor. This program plays to our strength and experience and immunology and has the potential to provide therapies for a variety of autoimmune diseases. This deal is an example of executing on our strategy to fill in our early-stage pipeline with high-quality assets.
As we continue the transformation of the company, I'm pleased to announce this quarter the promotion of Tony Kingsley to run Global Commercial Operations starting next month. Tony's been a key member of the commercial team and has led the turnaround of AVONEX sales in the U.S. With his combination of strategic insight and operational expertise, I'm confident that he's the right person to lead our Global Commercial business and prepare for the potential launch of multiple products in the next several years. 
As you know, Francesco Granata has led a successful transformation of our commercial group, as evidenced by the continuing excellent performance of AVONEX and TYSABRI. I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank Francesco for his contribution to the success of Biogen Idec and for his positive leadership in the organization. At the same time, I want to welcome Tony into his new role. We're all convinced that Tony will take the ball -- take the baton and continue to built an industry-leading commercial organization.
So with that, I'll turn the call now over to Francesco for a more detailed update on our commercial performance for the quarter."

As we have mentioned over the last several quarters, we started our journey with very clear goals and milestones for substantial growth of the business. I am proud to say that we continue to be on track to meet or exceed those goals. 
Starting with our MS franchise part of revenue, overall, we saw 11% growth year-over-year. AVONEX growth continued this quarter, and units worldwide increased 1%. And revenues grew 6% on a year-over-year basis. Looking region by region, in the U.S., where we had focus on strategy and execution, AVONEX units were around 164,000, relatively stable over the last number of quarters and in line with our expectations, while revenues grew 6%. The brand has performed quite well in light of a new oral entrant and the competition for share of voice in the physician office. 
In the European Union and Canada, AVONEX remains the market leader. And units grew 6%, while revenues grew 2% on a year-over-year basis. The AVONEX spend has now launched in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. The PEN has a new interest in the brand for existing patients, new patients and those switching from other brands. In the U.K., where the PEN was launched this quarter, the number of net new starts for AVONEX has more than tripled compared to the 6 months before the launch. And our U.K. affiliate has added more AVONEX patients in the last 3 months than it did for all of 2010. We are very pleased with the momentum the PEN is creating for AVONEX while meeting the needs of the patients.
For the markets outside of Europe and North America, our MS franchise revenues grew 26% year-over-year, growing at a faster rate than our overall business. AVONEX revenues grew 20%, driven in part by tender market shipment for Q2 that were realized this quarter. An additional highlight is Japan, where AVONEX has reached 37% market share year-to-date. Our global footprint and emerging market strategy has paid dividends, continuing to provide revenue upside, as well as opportunity for future growth.
Turning to TYSABRI, where wide units are up 16% year-over-year, and net new patients are up 2,100 since last quarter. While we saw positive growth in net new patients in the U.S., quarter-over-quarter, we saw some slowing of the growth of net new patients in the European Union, due in part to some seasonality among a number of markets and the penetration of the assay. This was not unexpected, and the continued growth of JCV testing by patients not currently taking TYSABRI is very good news. While there will be some quarter-over-quarter variation in TYSABRI net new patients, the overall trend remained positive, and we believe risk stratification is helping patients and physician to make an informed choice about TYSABRI therapy. 
In the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 15% year-over-year, and patients number grew 8%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter where we delivered unit growth for TYSABRI in the United States. The JCV assay became commercially available in the U.S. this quarter as a laboratory-developed test, and there are roughly 33,500 patients enrolled and certified, too, through the end of September. This is a trend toward more nonuser of TYSABRI being tested for JCV status. Patient discontinuation have stabilized, and there is strong positive momentum for new TOUCH forms. 
In the European Union and Canada, TYSABRI units grew 17% year-over-year, and patients number grew 20%. The commercial JCV assay has now been assessed by approximately 1,200 physicians and almost 20,000 patients as for the end of September. While these are initial trends, our market research indicated that nearly 1/4 of the patients being tested are not TYSABRI users, and that's approximately 70% of JCV positive patients. And 98% of JC negative patients stay on treatment with TYSABRI after being tested, showing the tremendous opportunity for TYSABRI continued success and acceptance by the MS marketplace. 
In the emerging markets and rest of the world, TYSABRI units grew 23%, and patients grew 30% year-over-year. Brazil launched TYSABRI during the quarter, and TYSABRI is now available in over 60 countries. 
This quarter, we acquired the Dompé JV in Italy and Switzerland. We are grateful for the job that Dompé did in launching and establishing our products in these markets. Making Italy and Switzerland direct affiliates for Biogen Idec was important for the profitability of our future Europe product launches. Our European footprint is now direct distribution for all of the major European countries.
I am pleased to announce that Carlos Dourado joined Biogen Idec this quarter to run our Emerging Market group, an area of the business that will benefit from his specific skills and experience. Carlos spent 32 years in various management roles with Schering-Plough in Brazil, Middle East, Europe, the United States and Canada. Carlos will be instrumental as we prepare to enter new markets such as China, Asia Pacific and other important future markets that will help shape our broader global presence. 
While it is still early days, the launch of FAMPYRA in Germany has gained positive momentum. FAMPYRA addresses a high unmet medical need and has been shown to improve walking in all types of MS, both relapsing and progressive. It can also be given concomitantly with currently available MS treatments. FAMPYRA also became available during the quarter in Australia and U.K., and we anticipate launch in Denmark shortly. Additional launch preparation is underway for the rest of Europe, and we expect additional countries rolling out in 2012. And reimbursement discussion are finalized.
As you know, I have decided to leave Biogen Idec for personal reasons. I am proud that I have been able to accomplish the mission discussed when I joined the company: deliver strong commercial performance while preparing for future launches. I will be pursuing some other opportunities, which in due time will be communicated. And I am pleased that Tony Kingsley will take on the role of the Head of Global Commercial Operations. Tony has been responsible for the tremendous turnaround in the U.S. business and brings many important skills to the table. He has experience in leading several new product launches, as well as leading complex organization. He has turned around the mode of the U.S. business from a defensive posture to an offensive winning spirit. I have enjoyed my time at Biogen Idec. It is a great company, and I have tremendous confidence in the team that will now move the business forward. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Doug Williams, EVP of R&D."

During Q3, we made important advances on several aspects of our R&D programs, which highlight our novel science, and continued to position the company for substantial future growth. As George mentioned, on Wednesday, we announced p",1390,"Thank you, Francesco. During Q3, we made important advances on several aspects of our R&D programs, which highlight our novel science, and continued to position the company for substantial future growth. 
As George mentioned, on Wednesday, we announced positive top line results from CONFIRM, the second Phase III study of BG-12 in relapsing MS. We have now successfully completed DEFINE and CONFIRM, 2 randomized, blinded, well-controlled Phase III studies in 2,600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, with very comparable, very positive outcomes. While there's still ongoing analysis being done with the CONFIRM study results, we're now aggressively working on regulatory submissions for BG-12 to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of next year.
Very briefly, the CONFIRM study was a 2-year multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-comparison study in over 1,400 relapsing-remitting MS patients, evaluating 2 doses of BG-12 in comparison to placebo for the reduction in annualized relapse rate or ARR at 2 years. The glatiramer acetate reference comparator arm was also evaluated versus placebo. Both the BID and TID doses of BG-12 met the study's primary and secondary relapse and MRI endpoints. With respect to reduction of ARR, the primary endpoint of the study, we saw 44% and 51% reduction for BID and TID doses of BG-12, respectively, and a 29% reduction for glatiramer acetate reference arm versus placebo. Data from CONFIRM also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile, consistent with what was seen in DEFINE. Further detailed information from CONFIRM will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
Last week, we also shared comprehensive data from DEFINE, the first registrational study of BG-12, at the ECTRIMS meeting in Amsterdam. Both doses of BG-12 demonstrated significant clinical effects compared to placebo in the proportion of patients relapsing at 2 years, annualized relapse rate, multiple MRI measures and disability progression. Incidence of infections and severe infections were similar across all treatment arms, and no opportunistic infections were observed in the BG-12 treatment arms. While the incidence of flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher with BG-12, these events were primarily mild to moderate and decreased substantially after the first month of treatment. We're very impressed with the robustness of the positive BG-12 data from both DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, and plan to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of 2012. The data shows that BG-12 has a very favorable benefit risk profile, and we believe that if approved, it will provide an important treatment option for patients with relapsing-remitting MS.
Turning to TYSABRI, 28 posters and presentations were presented at last week's ECTRIMS meeting in Amsterdam, highlighting the high standard of efficacy that TYSABRI has set in the MS market. Data from AFFIRM, a long-term outcome study, showed ARR and EDSS benefits seen with earlier treatment of TYSABRI over delayed treatment. Data was also presented from the TYSABRI observational study known as TOP. This study assessed long-term outcomes in almost 3,500 patients, and showed that mean ARRs in TYSABRI-treated patients were lowest in those that were treatment naïve at baseline and highest in patients who were previously treated with immunosuppressant agent or switched from another disease-modifying therapy, further supporting the benefits of early treatment with TYSABRI.
Last week, we and our partner, Elan, announced that the FDA notified us of a 3-month extension to the PDUFA date for the TYSABRI sBLA, for updating the prescribing information for TYSABRI to include anti-JC virus antibody status to further help stratify the risk of PML. The FDA has indicated that this extension is needed to allow time for review of the changes being incorporated into the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, also known as REMS, to be consistent with the anticipated subscribing information. We and Elan are working with the agency to facilitate a timely review of the REMS changes and the sBLA. 
And finally, for TYSABRI, we initiated patient enrollment in ASCEND, the Phase III trial of TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS. This trial is expected to enroll 860 patients, and we'll investigate whether TYSABRI treatment slows the accumulation of disability not related to relapses and subjects with SPMS.
Turning now to other important aspects of our MS pipeline, in a late breaker presentation at ECTRIMS, we and our partner, Abbott Labs, announced additional data from SELECT, our first registrational study of daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS. SELECT showed significant reduction in annualized relapse rate at 1 year and met key secondary endpoints. The overall incidence of adverse events and treatment discontinuations were similar in all study arms. Serious infections, serious cutaneous events and liver function test abnormalities greater than 5x the upper limit of normal occurred more frequently in the DAC-treated patients. We placed additional monitoring and management measures in the ongoing clinical programs for the cutaneous and LFT events. These data further support investigation of DAC in the ongoing DECIDE study, which is a randomized, blinded study of 1,500 patients with a primary endpoint of ARR at 2 years.
I'm pleased to say that we have received a positive decision from the European Commission for the AVONEX titration kit. The titration kit is designed to help mitigate flu-like symptoms at the start of therapy, making for better initial experience with AVONEX, with the most trusted MS therapies available. 
Lastly, enrollment for ADVANCE, our Phase III trial of PEGylated Interferon for MS, is on track to be completed by year-end. The trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA. With an annualized relapse rate at 1 year as its primary endpoint, we anticipate top line data to be available in early 2013. 
From AVONEX, with its 15 years of safety and efficacy experience, to TYSABRI, which sets the standard for high efficacy and our anticipated introductions of BG-12 and daclizumab, we hope to offer MS patients a wide range of treatment options. Our portfolio of MS drugs is [indiscernible] in the industry and speaks to our commitment to the individual needs of different segments of the MS population.
Turning to the rest of the Neurology pipeline, patient enrollment in EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, has been completed well ahead of schedule. This highlights the high unmet need for new and effective therapies for ALS. Recall that we've agreed with the FDA on a Special Protocol Assessment for the design of this study. We anticipate top line data readout in the second half of 2012. We expect to initiate the second Phase III study of dex in the first half of 2012. Dex is a novel, oral compound that potentially has neuroprotective properties based on experimental and preclinical studies and may slow the loss of motor neuron function, which is the hallmark of this devastating disease.
Moving on to our hemophilia programs, we continue to expect to complete the bulk of patient enrollment in both B-LONG and A-LONG studies in 2011, but there may be some carryover into the first half of next year. Recall that in the B-LONG study, there's a surgical arm which may take enrollment into next year. Data readout for both trials, however, remains on track for the second half of 2012.
Along with substantial progress on our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken steps to bolster our earlier-stage development pipeline. We announced yesterday an exclusive, worldwide collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize what we believe will be a potent, oral, highly-selective Syk inhibitor. Inhibition of Syk has the potential to provide effective, well-tolerated therapies for a variety of autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and atopic diseases. We're encouraged by the preclinical and Phase I clinical data to date and see an opportunity to develop a best-in-class, highly-selective, once-daily oral treatment for a broad range of autoimmune diseases. We expect to begin Phase IIa testing of the lead compound next year in RA. This program plays to our strength and experience in immunology and strengthens our Phase I, II pipeline. 
I'm extremely pleased with the progress at the R&D organization as a team this quarter for our pipeline, which is one of the most enviable in the industry. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul Clancy, our Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer."

Table 3 includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the third quarter include $49 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $3 million for contingent consideration, $2 million for restructuring and $5 million in stock comp expense. This is partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43 in the third quarter, an increase of 36% over prior year. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP and P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61 for Q3, a 19% increase versus prior year. 
Moving to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of 11% over prior year. In the U.S., where AVONEX grew 6% to $411 million, inventory in the channel ended at just under 2.2 weeks, a slight decrease from last quarter, while shipping days remained consistent. 
Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $271 million, also an increase of 6% compared to prior year. The impact of foreign exchange strengthened AVONEX revenue by $22 million. However, this was offset by a $9 million hedge loss in the quarter as compared to a $17 million hedge gain in prior year. 
Now moving on to TYSABRI. TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $393 million in third quarter, up 28% versus last year, essentially flat versus the second quarter. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenue of $277 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 41% to $85 million, driven by unit and price growth. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenue was $192 million, a 20% increase. The impact of foreign exchange added $16 million to TYSABRI revenue versus prior year, which was offset by a $2 million hedge loss compared to a $4 million hedge gain in prior year.
Now I'll move to RITUXAN collaboration revenues. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $733 million in the third quarter, up 9% versus prior year, driven by increased penetration in the maintenance setting in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and continued uptake in CLL. Our profit share from that business was $234 million. Royalties and profit share and sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q3 were $32 million, down 17% due to royalty expirations. And we were reimbursed $1 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN in Q3. The result was $266 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q3, an increase of 3% over prior year.
Internationally, FAMPYRA revenue were $3 million, as we began commercializing in Germany. Royalties were $52 million for the third quarter, an increase of 43% from prior year. The increase was due to hitting a new royalty tier in our partnership on ANGIOMAX. This new tier is applied to all year-to-date revenue in our accounting model. We achieved this 1 quarter prior to expectations, resulting in a potentially lower, more normalized royalty revenue in Q4. Additionally, we recorded $16 million of corporate partner revenue, driven by third-party manufacturing contracts with a strategic partner.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $124 million, representing 9% of revenues. The increase was due to a number of factors, including the third-party manufacturing, increased JCV assay test in Europe and increased costs for the AVONEX PEN, all important revenue-driving investments. Q3 R&D expense was $300 million or 23% of revenues. R&D expense was driven by the accrual on the dexpramipexole trial and the continued progression of the late-stage programs. 
Q3 SG&A expense was $258 million or 20% of revenues, an increase of 7% over same period last year. Foreign exchange impacted SG&A by $12 million, and increased spend supporting new product launches drove the increase. This was offset by changes in our sales and marketing of RITUXAN. 
Continuing down to P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $81 million for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $8 million, and our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4%, as we benefited from a higher level of orphan drug research credit. 
In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $245 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 65%, 35% between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which again were $1.61 in the third quarter, a 19% increase over prior year. 
Let me provide a little bit financial detail on a few recent events. As Francesco noted in September, we completed the acquisition of our 50% interest in our joint ventures in Italy and Switzerland. The upfront purchase price was $153 million, which represents the settlement of equity reserves to our former partner and for future cash flow. Additionally, we're obligated to payments of $43 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. We also entered into an agreement, whereby Dompé agreed to purchase 100% of the outstanding receivables in Italy. Prior to the transaction, the entities were fully consolidated into our income statement, yet 50% of the profits from the sales affiliates have been reported as a noncontrolling interest. Going forward, there will be no allocation to noncontrolling interest, and as a result, 100% of the operations will be reflected on our financial statement.
Moving to Portola. Under the collaboration agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals, we will provide an upfront payment of $36 million in cash and $9 million in equity. These will be reflected in our financial statements in the fourth quarter.
Now moving onto our full-year guidance. We now expect full-year revenue growth of mid-single digits. We continue to expect COGS to be between 9% and 10% of sales, including the impact of AVONEX PEN, the JC virus assay investment and the increased cost of goods sold from contract manufacturing activity. R&D is expected to be at the higher end of 22% to 24% of sales, which now includes the $36 million payment in Q4, associated with our announcement with Portola Pharmaceuticals.
SG&A expense outlook is unchanged at the higher end of the range of 20% to 21% of revenue, driven partially by foreign exchange, launch cost for FAMPYRA and investment in BG-12. Our tax rate outlook for the full year is unchanged at 26% to 28% of PBT. As a result, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP EPS results above $4.91 and $5.70, respectively. Importantly, we've maintained our non-GAAP EPS guidance while covering the RITUXAN arbitration charge from Q2, second half launch investments and the business development activity just recently announced with Portola. 
So a very strong financial outlook for 2011, driving double-digit earnings per share growth. Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

So to quickly sum up the quarter, we're very pleased with the solid performance of both AVONEX and TYSABRI, and with a strong overall financial results. At the same time, we made excellent progress on the pipeline. We have numerous programs in late-stage that have the potential to bring meaningful products to patients. Some of these will make it to the market and will therefore pose poised for considerable growth over the next 5 years. We've continued the transformation of the company, adding to our early-stage pipeline with the recent Portola transaction, as well as the promotion of Tony Kingsley to EVP of Commercial Operations.
We've made solid progress on the goals we set out for ourselves at the beginning of the year and continue our positive momentum, clarity of mission and reinvigorated organization. Although we've accomplished a lot so far, we have a long way to go. We have to be and we will be focused on execution to make sure that we do our best for investors, ourselves and our patients and effectively and efficiently move our late-stage pipeline through the clinic and registration and onto the market.
Finally, I want to thank the many employees at Biogen Idec, who work long and hard to help us achieve our goals. Without their dedication and passion, the achievements of the year-to-date wouldn't have been possible. 
So with that, we'll close our remarks and open up the call for questions."

Look, I think it's important to remember, MS is not a homogeneous disease. Different patients, some patients progress more than others, some patients more concerned with safety than others, some really focused on efficacy, some don't like needles. And so it's really a heterogenous patient population. And then neurologists who treat them have different views as well, some more focused on safety, some more focused on efficacy. And so we now have products that play in all the major segments. So we will, assuming BG-12 gets on to the market. So AVONEX is a great product. It's been on the market 15 years. Now it's no side effects, it's safe, it's effective. And for a lot of patients, AVONEX will be a very good choice for them for -- we have the PEGylated AVONEX -- PEGylated Interferon come in, which if successful, could make that dose seem much more convenient to patients and increase interest there. TYSABRI is amazingly efficacious product. And for patients who are really concerned about efficacy, who have more aggressive form of the disease, who really want to get in charge of their disease, TYSABRI is a great product. And we have the recent data now showing that earlier treatment with TYSABRI has -- leads to better long-term outcomes. So I think for an increasing number of patients, TYSABRI will be a very good choice. And BG-12, you saw the data. It's a remarkable compound. So there will be a large segment of the patient population, I believe, that will want on oral compound. Obviously, BG-12 is not the only oral compound that they'll have to choose from, but we believe BG-12 stacks up very well and will be a very strong competitor in this segment of the market for patients who want an oral therapy. So I think by having a variety of products like that for patients with different needs, different concerns, we can really maximize the total market share that we have."

Our estimates have been that those are at least 100,000 patients, kind of on the sidelines, potentially more than that. I think what we're seeing in the launch period of Gilenya is bringing some of those into the marketplace. Clearly, you've seen from them that at least half or more of their patients are coming from that pool. I think it bodes extremely well for BG-12 and the potential to launch into that marketplace, especially as BG-12 safety profile has this opportunity to differentiate itself in the kind of oral -- emerging oral segment."

What we see in Europe is not very different from what we have seen in the United States. You should remember that Europe has a slightly higher use of immunosuppressant as a first-line therapy for MS than the United States. So it might be that the initial impact could be slightly different from the United States. But the key learnings that we have from the U.S. market has been shared with the European affiliates. So there is a more robust [indiscernible] management done by the reps whenever possible or by MSs.

And you went through the deck, so you probably have these stats, but maybe for everyone. To date, going back to spring of 2010, we now have had over 59,000 patients globally that have been tested for the JCV antibody status. The highest proportion of that is STRATIFY 2, that is just under 34,000 patients. To your specific question on Quest versus STRATIFY 2, which is kind of really -- kind of, I think, the nub of your detailed question, which is in the United States, those are the 2 options. Quest is really just about 30 days in. So there is a de minimis amount of Quest assays through the third quarter. The majority are still STRATIFY 2 in the third quarter. And obviously, the difference is in STRATIFY 2. It's a limited number of sites -- it's a big number of sites, but a limited -- it's not all the centers across the United States, whereas Quest allows that to happen. That hasn't really penetrated yet. Obviously, we're awaiting the PDUFA deadline in the United States, the extended PDUFA deadline in order to really kind of get that thing going. Our objective always was to try to synchronize the label with the commercial availability in the United States. We've got the commercial availability a little bit prior to the label. Unilabs is outside the United States that is about 20,000 tests to date. Of that 20,000, there were about 10,000 test -- assay test in the third quarter alone. So that uptake in Europe, per se, has been very, very, very strong. And I kind of think it probably had, as we have alluded and the line alluded, a bit of an impact on discontinuations. But it still is quite strong kind of patient growth, even in light of that in Europe. And as Francesco had noted, what we're now seeing is a migration to both naïves of non-TYSABRI patients being considered in Europe. Hopefully, that provides a little bit of color."

We will be funding that in the United States, and that will impact the cost of goods sold line. And then this impact that we saw that helped out a little bit on revenue in terms of contract manufacturing comes with very high cost of goods sold. So -- but all of those, to some extent, will alleviate over the longer term, right? We hope to get the assay, particularly in the United States at some point in time, reimbursed through normal channels. The contract manufacturing, while it comes with high cost of goods sold in the short term, the longer-term impact of that is creating a far more efficient biologics manufacturing platform, but far more efficient in that has benefits through all of our products. And that shows up essentially around -- very correlated with the months of inventory that we have in the business, which is plentiful because of the nature of this business. And then we also do see improved margins down the road again, with kind of the opening up of the Denmark plants, and specifically third-party royalties avoidance on the TYSABRI products. So I think it all bodes well, but it just is a little bit longer term. In the short term, the assay, the PEN are very, very good investments. I view them as very, very good investments that are showing up and helping out the buoyancy of AVONEX and certainly restratification on TYSABRI penetration."

We had a very productive third quarter and several exciting announcements during the month of October as well. Our financial performance was excellent as our products with TYSABRI continued to do extremely well. Our pipeline advanced substantially, led obviously by BG-12, but also including significant advances in many other portfolio compounds, both early and late. And while not so visible from the outside, the company is executing extremely well and is much more effective and efficient than it was a year ago. 
Let me start with our business performance. We're now through 3 quarters of the year, and we continue to deliver solid financial results. For the quarter, product revenues grew by 11% year-over-year. AVONEX continued to do well this quarter, with revenues up 6% year-over-year. The continued rollout of the AVONEX PEN autoinjector device in the EU and Canada fueled additional patient and physician interest in AVONEX, one of the most trusted MS therapies in the world. TYSABRI was a key driver of our overall growth. Revenues were up 26% year-over-year, and TYSABRI is on a trajectory to reach over $1.5 billion in annualized end market sales. As a result, total revenues were $1.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 19% at $1.61.
This was a good quarter for TYSABRI, which continues to be a main growth driver for us. First, key data were presented at ECTRIMS in Amsterdam last week that showed that patients who received treatment with TYSABRI early in the course of MS received more clinical benefit than those who delayed treatment with TYSABRI and were first treated with immunosuppressive therapies or switched between glatiramer acetate and the interferons. 
Second, we made important progress on our JCV risk stratification efforts, as the JCV antibody assay became commercially available in the U.S., as well as the EU. There are now over 59,000 patients who have been tested for JCV antibody status, highlighting the tremendous interest in risk stratification. We believe that this interest means that many patients and physicians are aware of the substantial benefits that can be gained from TYSABRI, as well as the potential risk of PML, and are using the information to make appropriate treatment decisions. I'm particularly encouraged by the increasing number of patients who have been tested, who are not current TYSABRI patients, and I believe that bodes very well for the future of the drug.
Turning to the advancement of our late-stage pipeline, as you all know, details of the defined study for BG-12, our oral candidate for MS, were presented at ECTRIMS last week. And top line data for CONFIRM, the second registrational trial for BG-12, were announced Wednesday. Doug will provide more details. Let me just say that both DEFINE and CONFIRM displayed compelling efficacy and safety data for BG-12. We now have strong positive results for BG-12 and 2 robust pivotal clinical trials with more than 2,600 patients. We're now focused on filing BG-12 with both the FDA and EMA, which will occur in the first half of next year, with the intent of bringing this potentially major new therapy to patients with MS as soon as possible.
Additional news this quarter from our late-stage pipeline, including data presented at last week's ECTRIMS meeting for SELECT, the first of 2 registrational trials for daclizumab, which is being evaluated as once monthly or biweekly subcutaneous injection for relapsing-remitting MS. SELECT showed impressive clinical results for daclizumab and supports the continuation of the second registrational study, DECIDE. 
We also continued to make progress in the enrollment of ADVANCE, our Phase III trial, evaluating once monthly subcutaneous PEGylated Interferon for relapsing-remitting MS. And we expect enrollment to be complete by the end of the year. All of these accomplishments highlight the emerging suite of products that will allow Biogen Idec to fully serve all of the segments of the MS market, well-established, well-chronicled injectables, the highest efficacy segment, as well as the growing oral segment.
Moving on to the rest of the pipeline, we completed enrollment for EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole, for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. This was the fastest enrolling trial in Biogen Idec's history, which is largely a reflection of a tremendous need for therapies for this devastating disease. We now expect this trial to read out towards the end of next year. Our hemophilia long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX programs continued to enroll well. And both of those trials also are on track for data readout in 2012.
Finally, we announced yesterday that we entered into a collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize an oral highly-selective Syk inhibitor. This program plays to our strength and experience in immunology and has the potential to provide therapies for a variety of autoimmune diseases. This deal is an example of executing on our strategy to fill in our early-stage pipeline with high-quality assets.
As we continue the transformation of the company, I'm pleased to announce this quarter the promotion of Tony Kingsley to run Global Commercial Operations starting next month. Tony's been a key member of the commercial team and has led the turnaround of AVONEX sales in the U.S. With his combination of strategic insight and operational expertise, I'm confident that he's the right person to lead our Global Commercial business and prepare for the potential launch of multiple products in the next several years. 
As you know, Francesco Granata has led a successful transformation of our commercial group, as evidenced by the continuing excellent performance of AVONEX and TYSABRI. I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank Francesco for his contributions to the success of Biogen Idec and for his positive leadership in the organization. At the same time, I want to welcome Tony into his new role. We're all convinced that Tony will take the ball -- take the baton and continue to build an industry-leading commercial organization.
So with that, I'll turn the call now over to Francesco for a more detailed update on our commercial performance for the quarter."

As we have mentioned over the last several quarters, we started our journey with very clear goals and milestones for substantial growth of the business. I am proud to say that we continue to be on track to meet or exceed those goals. 
Starting with our MS franchise part of revenue, overall, we saw 11% growth year-over-year. AVONEX growth continued this quarter, and units worldwide increased 1%. And revenues grew 6% on a year-over-year basis. Looking region by region, in the U.S., where we had focus on strategy and execution, AVONEX units were around 164,000, relatively stable over the last number of quarters and in line with our expectations, while revenues grew 6%. The brand has performed quite well in light of a new oral entrant and the competition for share of voice in the physician office. 
In the European Union and Canada, AVONEX remains the market leader. And units grew 6%, while revenues grew 2% on a year-over-year basis. The AVONEX spend has now launched in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. The PEN has a new interest in the brand for existing patients, new patients and those switching from other brands. In the U.K., where the PEN was launched this quarter, the number of net new starts for AVONEX has more than tripled compared to the 6 months before the launch. And our U.K. affiliate has added more AVONEX patients in the last 3 months than it did for all of 2010. We are very pleased with the momentum the PEN is creating for AVONEX while meeting the needs of the patients.
For the markets outside of Europe and North America, our MS franchise revenues grew 26% year-over-year, growing at a faster rate than our overall business. AVONEX revenues grew 20%, driven in part by tender market shipment for Q2 that were realized this quarter. An additional highlight is Japan, where AVONEX has reached 37% market share year-to-date. Our global footprint and emerging market strategy has paid dividends, continuing to provide revenue upside, as well as opportunity for future growth.
Turning to TYSABRI, worldwide units are up 16% year-over-year, and net new patients are up 2,100 since last quarter. While we saw positive growth in net new patients in the U.S., quarter-over-quarter, we saw some slowing of the growth of net new patients in the European Union, due in part to some seasonality among a number of markets and the penetration of the assay. This was not unexpected, and the continued growth of JCV testing by patients not currently taking TYSABRI is very good news. While there will be some quarter-over-quarter variation in TYSABRI net new patients, the overall trend remained positive, and we believe risk stratification is helping patients and physician to make an informed choice about TYSABRI therapy. 
In the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 15% year-over-year, and patients number grew 8%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter where we delivered unit growth for TYSABRI in the United States. The JCV assay became commercially available in the U.S. this quarter as a laboratory-developed test, and there are roughly 33,500 patients enrolled and certified, too, through the end of September. This is a trend toward more nonuser of TYSABRI being tested for JCV status. Patient discontinuation have stabilized, and there is strong positive momentum for new TOUCH forms. 
In the European Union and Canada, TYSABRI units grew 17% year-over-year, and patients number grew 20%. The commercial JCV assay has now been assessed by approximately 1,200 physicians and almost 20,000 patients as for the end of September. While these are initial trends, our market research indicated that nearly 1/4 of the patients being tested are not TYSABRI users, and that's approximately 70% of JCV positive patients. And 98% of JC negative patients stay on treatment with TYSABRI after being tested, showing the tremendous opportunity for TYSABRI continued success and acceptance by the MS marketplace. 
In the emerging markets and rest of the world, TYSABRI units grew 23%, and patients grew 30% year-over-year. Brazil launched TYSABRI during the quarter, and TYSABRI is now available in over 60 countries. 
This quarter, we acquired the Dompé JV in Italy and Switzerland. We are grateful for the job that Dompé did in launching and establishing our products in these markets. Making Italy and Switzerland direct affiliates for Biogen Idec was important for the profitability of our future Europe product launches. Our European footprint is now direct distribution for all of the major European countries.
I am pleased to announce that Carlos Dourado joined Biogen Idec this quarter to run our emerging market group, an area of the business that will benefit from his specific skills and experience. Carlos spent 32 years in various management roles with Schering-Plough in Brazil, Middle East, Europe, the United States and Canada. Carlos will be instrumental as we prepare to enter new markets such as China, Asia Pacific and other important future markets that will help shape our broader global presence. 
While it is still early days, the launch of FAMPYRA in Germany has gained positive momentum. FAMPYRA addresses a high unmet medical need and has been shown to improve walking in all types of MS, both relapsing and progressive. It can also be given concomitantly with currently available MS treatments. FAMPYRA also became available during the quarter in Australia and U.K., and we anticipate launch in Denmark shortly. Additional launch preparation is underway for the rest of Europe, and we expect additional countries rolling out in 2012. And reimbursement discussion are finalized.
As you know, I have decided to leave Biogen Idec for personal reasons. I am proud that I have been able to accomplish the mission discussed when I joined the company: deliver strong commercial performance while preparing for future launches. I will be pursuing some other opportunities, which in due time will be communicated. And I am pleased that Tony Kingsley will take on the role of the Head of Global Commercial Operations. Tony has been responsible for the tremendous turnaround in the U.S. business and brings many important skills to the table. He has experience in leading several new product launches, as well as leading complex organization. He has turned around the mode of the U.S. business from a defensive posture to an offensive winning spirit. I have enjoyed my time at Biogen Idec. It is a great company, and I have tremendous confidence in the team that will now move the business forward. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Doug Williams, EVP of R&D."

During Q3, we made important advances on several aspects of our R&D programs, which highlight our novel science and continue to position the company for substantial future growth. As George mentioned, on Wednesday, we announced pos",1388,"Thank you, Francesco. During Q3, we made important advances on several aspects of our R&D programs, which highlight our novel science and continue to position the company for substantial future growth. 
As George mentioned, on Wednesday, we announced positive top line results from CONFIRM, the second Phase III study of BG-12 in relapsing MS. We have now successfully completed DEFINE and CONFIRM, 2 randomized, blinded, well-controlled Phase III studies in 2,600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, with very comparable, very positive outcomes. While there's still ongoing analysis being done with the CONFIRM study results, we're now aggressively working on regulatory submissions for BG-12 to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of next year.
Very briefly, the CONFIRM study was a 2-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-comparison study in over 1,400 relapsing-remitting MS patients, evaluating 2 doses of BG-12 in comparison to placebo for the reduction in annualized relapse rate or ARR at 2 years. The glatiramer acetate reference comparator arm was also evaluated versus placebo. Both the BID and TID doses of BG-12 met the study's primary and secondary relapse and MRI endpoints. With respect to reduction of ARR, the primary endpoint of the study, we saw 44% and 51% reduction for BID and TID doses of BG-12, respectively, and a 29% reduction for glatiramer acetate reference arm versus placebo. Data from CONFIRM also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile, consistent with what was seen in DEFINE. Further detailed information from CONFIRM will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
Last week, we also shared comprehensive data from DEFINE, the first registrational study of BG-12, at the ECTRIMS meeting in Amsterdam. Both doses of BG-12 demonstrated significant clinical effects compared to placebo in the proportion of patients relapsing at 2 years, annualized relapse rate, multiple MRI measures and disability progression. Incidence of infections and severe infections were similar across all treatment arms, and no opportunistic infections were observed in the BG-12 treatment arms. While the incidence of flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher with BG-12, these events were primarily mild to moderate and decreased substantially after the first month of treatment. We're very impressed with the robustness of the positive BG-12 data from both DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, and plan to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of 2012. The data shows that BG-12 has a very favorable benefit-risk profile, and we believe that if approved, it will provide an important treatment option for patients with relapsing-remitting MS.
Turning to TYSABRI, 28 posters and presentations were presented at last week's ECTRIMS meeting in Amsterdam, highlighting the high standard of efficacy that TYSABRI has set in the MS market. Data from AFFIRM, a long-term outcome study, showed ARR and EDSS benefits seen with earlier treatment of TYSABRI over delayed treatment. Data was also presented from the TYSABRI observational study known as TOP. This study assessed long-term outcomes in almost 3,500 patients, and showed that mean ARRs in TYSABRI-treated patients were lowest in those that were treatment naïve at baseline and highest in patients who were previously treated with immunosuppressive agent or switched from another disease-modifying therapy, further supporting the benefits of early treatment with TYSABRI.
Last week, we and our partner, Elan, announced that the FDA notified us of a 3-month extension to the PDUFA date for the TYSABRI sBLA, for updating the prescribing information for TYSABRI to include anti-JC virus antibody status to further help stratify the risk of PML. The FDA has indicated that this extension is needed to allow time for review of the changes being incorporated into the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, also known as REMS, to be consistent with the anticipated prescribing information. We and Elan are working with the agency to facilitate a timely review of the REMS changes and the sBLA. 
And finally, for TYSABRI, we initiated patient enrollment in ASCEND, the Phase III trial of TYSABRI in secondary-progressive MS. This trial is expected to enroll 860 patients, and we'll investigate whether TYSABRI treatment slows the accumulation of disability not related to relapses and subjects with SPMS.
Turning now to other important aspects of our MS pipeline, in a late breaker presentation at ECTRIMS, we and our partner, Abbott Labs, announced additional data from SELECT, our first registrational study of daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS. SELECT showed significant reduction in annualized relapse rate at 1 year and met key secondary endpoints. The overall incidence of adverse events and treatment discontinuations were similar in all study arms. Serious infections, serious cutaneous events and liver function test abnormalities greater than 5x the upper limit of normal occurred more frequently in the DAC-treated patients. We placed additional monitoring and management measures in the ongoing clinical programs for the cutaneous and LFT events. These data further support investigation of DAC in the ongoing DECIDE study, which is a randomized, blinded study of 1,500 patients with a primary endpoint of ARR at 2 years.
I'm pleased to say that we have received a positive decision from the European Commission for the AVONEX titration kit. The titration kit is designed to help mitigate flu-like symptoms at the start of therapy, making for better initial experience with AVONEX, one of the most trusted MS therapies available. 
Lastly, enrollment for ADVANCE, our Phase III trial of PEGylated Interferon for MS, is on track to be completed by year-end. The trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA. With an annualized relapse rate at 1 year as its primary endpoint, we anticipate top line data to be available in early 2013. 
From AVONEX, with its 15 years of safety and efficacy experience, to TYSABRI, which sets the standard for high efficacy, and our anticipated introductions of BG-12 and daclizumab, we hope to offer MS patients a wide range of treatment options. Our portfolio of MS drugs is unrivaled in the industry and speaks to our commitment to the individual needs of different segments of the MS population.
Turning to the rest of the neurology pipeline, patient enrollment in EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, has been completed well ahead of schedule. This highlights the high unmet need for new and effective therapies for ALS. Recall that we've agreed with the FDA on a Special Protocol Assessment for the design of this study. We anticipate top line data readout in the second half of 2012. We expect to initiate the second Phase III study of dex in the first half of 2012. Dex is a novel oral compound that potentially has neuroprotective properties based on experimental and preclinical studies and may slow the loss of motor neuron function, which is the hallmark of this devastating disease.
Moving on to our hemophilia programs, we continue to expect to complete the bulk of patient enrollment in both B-LONG and A-LONG studies in 2011, but there may be some carryover into the first half of next year. Recall that in the B-LONG study, there's a surgical arm which may take enrollment into next year. Data readout for both trials, however, remains on track for the second half of 2012.
Along with substantial progress on our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken steps to bolster our earlier-stage development pipeline. We announced yesterday an exclusive, worldwide collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize what we believe will be a potent, oral, highly-selective Syk inhibitor. Inhibition of Syk has the potential to provide effective, well-tolerated therapies for a variety of autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and atopic diseases. We're encouraged by the preclinical and Phase I clinical data to date and see an opportunity to develop a best-in-class, highly-selective, once-daily oral treatment for a broad range of autoimmune diseases. We expect to begin Phase IIa testing of the lead compound next year in RA. This program plays to our strengths and experience in immunology and strengthens our Phase I, II pipeline. 
I'm extremely pleased with the progress that the R&D organization has attained this quarter for our pipeline, which is one of the most enviable in the industry. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul Clancy, our Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer."

Table 3 includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the third quarter include $49 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $3 million for contingent consideration, $2 million for restructuring and $5 million in stock comp expense. This is partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43 in the third quarter, an increase of 36% over prior year. 
Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP and P&L, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61 for Q3, a 19% increase versus prior year. 
Moving to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of 11% over prior year. In the U.S., where AVONEX grew 6% to $411 million, inventory in the channel ended at just under 2.2 weeks, a slight decrease from last quarter, while shipping days remained consistent. 
Internationally, AVONEX product revenue was $271 million, also an increase of 6% compared to prior year. The impact of foreign exchange strengthened AVONEX revenue by $22 million. However, this was offset by a $9 million hedge loss in the quarter as compared to a $17 million hedge gain in prior year. 
Now moving on to TYSABRI. TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $393 million in third quarter, up 28% versus last year, essentially flat versus the second quarter. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenue of $277 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 41% to $85 million, driven by unit and price growth. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenue was $192 million, a 20% increase. The impact of foreign exchange added $16 million to TYSABRI revenue versus prior year, which was offset by a $2 million hedge loss compared to a $4 million hedge gain in prior year.
Now I'll move to RITUXAN collaboration revenues. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $733 million in the third quarter, up 9% versus prior year, driven by increased penetration in the maintenance setting in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and continued uptake in CLL. Our profit share from that business was $234 million. Royalties and profit share and sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q3 were $32 million, down 17% due to royalty expirations. And we were reimbursed $1 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN in Q3. The result was $266 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q3, an increase of 3% over prior year.
Internationally, FAMPYRA revenue were $3 million, as we began commercializing in Germany. Royalties were $52 million for the third quarter, an increase of 43% from prior year. The increase was due to hitting a new royalty tier in our partnership on ANGIOMAX. This new tier is applied to all year-to-date revenue in our accounting model. We achieved this one quarter prior to expectations, resulting in a potentially lower, more normalized royalty revenue in Q4. Additionally, we recorded $16 million of corporate partner revenue, driven by third-party manufacturing contracts with a strategic partner.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $124 million, representing 9% of revenues. The increase was due to a number of factors, including the third-party manufacturing, increased JCV assay test in Europe and increased costs for the AVONEX PEN, all important revenue-driving investments. Q3 R&D expense was $300 million or 23% of revenues. R&D expense was driven by the accrual on the dexpramipexole trial and the continued progression of the late-stage programs. 
Q3 SG&A expense was $258 million or 20% of revenues, an increase of 7% over same period last year. Foreign exchange impacted SG&A by $12 million, and increased spend supporting new product launches drove the increase. This was offset by changes in our sales and marketing of RITUXAN. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $81 million for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of $8 million, and our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4%, as we benefited from a higher level of orphan drug research credit. 
In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $245 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 65%-35% between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which again were $1.61 in the third quarter, a 19% increase over prior year. 
Let me provide a little bit financial detail on a few recent events. As Francesco noted, in September we completed the acquisition of our 50% interest in our joint ventures in Italy and Switzerland. The upfront purchase price was $153 million, which represents the settlement of equity reserves to our former partner and for future cash flow. Additionally, we're obligated to payments of $43 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. We also entered into an agreement whereby Dompé agreed to purchase 100% of the outstanding receivables in Italy. Prior to the transaction, the entities were fully consolidated into our income statement, yet 50% of the profits from the sales affiliates have been reported as a noncontrolling interest. Going forward, there will be no allocation to noncontrolling interest, and as a result, 100% of the operations will be reflected on our financial statement.
Moving to Portola. Under the collaboration agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals, we will provide an upfront payment of $36 million in cash and $9 million in equity. These will be reflected in our financial statements in the fourth quarter.
Now moving onto our full-year guidance. We now expect full-year revenue growth of mid-single digits. We continue to expect COGS to be between 9% and 10% of sales, including the impact of AVONEX PEN, the JC virus assay investment and the increased cost of goods sold from contract manufacturing activity. R&D is expected to be at the higher end of 22% to 24% of sales, which now includes the $36 million payment in Q4 associated with our announcement with Portola Pharmaceuticals.
SG&A expense outlook is unchanged at the higher end of the range of 20% to 21% of revenue, driven partially by foreign exchange, launch cost for FAMPYRA and investment in BG-12. Our tax rate outlook for the full year is unchanged at 26% to 28% of PBT. As a result, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP EPS results above $4.91 and $5.70, respectively. Importantly, we've maintained our non-GAAP EPS guidance while covering the RITUXAN arbitration charge from Q2, second half launch investments and the business development activity just recently announced with Portola. 
So a very strong financial outlook for 2011, driving double-digit earnings per share growth. Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

Look, I think it's important to remember, MS is not a homogeneous disease. Different patients -- some patients progress more than others, some patients more concerned with safety than others, some really focused on efficacy, some don't like needles. And so it's really a heterogenous patient population. And the neurologists who treat them have different views as well, some more focused on safety, some more focused on efficacy. And so we now have products that play in all the major segments -- or we will, assuming BG-12 gets onto the market. So AVONEX is a great product. It's been on the market 15 years. Now it's no side effects, it's safe, it's effective. And for a lot of patients, AVONEX will be a very good choice for them for -- we have the PEGylated AVONEX -- PEGylated Interferon coming, which if successful, could make that dosing much more convenient to patients and increase interest there. TYSABRI is amazingly efficacious product. And for patients who are really concerned about efficacy, who have more aggressive form of the disease, who really want to get in charge of their disease, TYSABRI is a great product. And we have the recent data now showing that earlier treatment with TYSABRI has -- leads to better long-term outcomes. So I think for an increasing number of patients, TYSABRI will be a very good choice. And BG-12, you saw the data. It's a remarkable compound. So there will be a large segment of the patient population, I believe, that will want on oral compound. Obviously, BG-12 is not the only oral compound that they'll have to choose from, but we believe BG-12 stacks up very well and will be a very strong competitor in this segment of the market for patients who want an oral therapy. So I think by having a variety of products like that for patients with different needs, different concerns, we can really maximize the total market share that we have."

I think what we're seeing in the launch period of Gilenya is bringing some of those into the marketplace. Clearly, you've seen from them that at least half or more of their patients are coming from that pool.

We review strategic opportunities, I think, fundamentally as a management team, as a board. We believe shareholder value creation happens with bringing in assets, pre-proof of concept, bias. And I think that's what we've shown over a long period of time with the evolution of our late-stage programs now. Many of those were deals that were done in a number of years ago in a very efficient way. So we'll continue to look at it, nothing to report, per se. But we have our eye on trying to be very disciplined, very strategic about kind of deploying that cash, a good high-class problem to have. With respect to kind of your specific question, I think nothing -- those opportunities aren't lost on us in terms of, are there ways to deploy it -- deploy cash to buy down future obligations? It really becomes, does it make sense? And is it a bid-and-ask type of thing? It really is very deal-specific and specific to each individual opportunity. And we'll be equally disciplined on that front as well."

One is the high-level of stability of patients who are virus-positive, and we expect this to continue, given the efficacy profile of the drug and given also the other risk factor which associated time and prior exposure to immunosuppressant. The other -- we have seen also an extended use of the JC virus on testing patients who are not on TYSABRI, which make us feel that there will be more patients who will be considered for TYSABRI use than before because of the JC virus assay. What we see in Europe is not very different from what we have seen in the United States. You should remember that Europe has a slightly higher use of immunosuppressant as a first-line therapy for MS than the United States. So it might be that the initial impact could be slightly different from the United States. But the key learnings that we have from the U.S. market has been shared with the European affiliates. So there is a more robust question in the asset management done by the reps whenever possible or by MSs. So we are really confident that the tool will become an important tool to expand the use of TYSABRI user and keep the right positive patients on the drug. I cannot comment on exact percentage. We are still investigating through market research. But, again, we're listing that TYSABRI will continue to be an important tool for patients and physician to treat MS."

And you went through the deck, so you probably have these stats, but maybe for everyone. To date, going back to spring of 2010, we now have had over 59,000 patients globally that have been tested for the JCV antibody status. The highest proportion of that is STRATIFY 2. That is just under 34,000 patients. To your specific question on Quest versus STRATIFY 2, which is kind of really -- kind of, I think, the nub of your detailed question, which is in the United States, those are the 2 options. Quest is really just about 30 days in. So there is a de minimis amount of Quest assays through the third quarter. The majority are still STRATIFY 2 in the third quarter. And obviously the difference is, in STRATIFY 2 it's a limited number of sites. It's a big number of sites, but a limited -- it's not all the centers across the United States, whereas Quest allows that to happen. That hasn't really penetrated yet. Obviously, we're awaiting the PDUFA deadline in the United States, the extended PDUFA deadline in order to really kind of get that thing going. We had -- our objective always was to try to synchronize the label with the commercial availability in the United States. We've got the commercial availability a little bit prior to the label. Unilabs is outside the United States. That is about 20,000 tests to date. Of that 20,000, there were about 10,000 test -- assay tests in the third quarter alone. So that uptake in Europe, per se, has been very, very, very strong. And I kind of think it probably had, as we have alluded and Elan alluded, a bit of an impact on discontinuations. But it still is quite strong kind of patient growth, even in light of that in Europe. And as Francesco had noted, what we're now seeing is a migration to both naïves of non-TYSABRI patients being considered in Europe. Hopefully, that provides a little bit of color."

And the PEN put a little bit of pressure on that. The assay, we're now funding that -- we're essentially funding that in Europe. We will be funding that in the United States, and that will impact the cost of goods sold line. And then this impact that we saw that helped out a little bit on revenue in terms of contract manufacturing comes with very high cost of goods sold. So -- but all of those, to some extent, will alleviate over the longer term, right? We hope to get the assay, particularly in the United States at some point in time, reimbursed through normal channels. The contract manufacturing, while it comes with high cost of goods sold in the short term, the longer-term impact of that is creating a far more efficient biologics manufacturing platform, a far more efficient in that has benefits through all of our products. And that shows up essentially around -- very correlated with the months of inventory that we have in the business, which is plentiful because of the nature of this business. And then we also do see improved margins down the road again, with kind of the opening up of the Denmark plants, and specifically third-party royalties avoidance on the TYSABRI products. So I think it all bodes well, but it just is a little bit longer term. In the short term, the assay, the PEN are very, very good investments. I view them as very, very good investments that are showing up and helping out the buoyancy of AVONEX and certainly risk stratification on TYSABRI penetration."
