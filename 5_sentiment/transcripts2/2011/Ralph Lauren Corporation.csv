We're pleased to be reporting excellent third quarter results today. Consolidated sales rose 24%, including 15% comp store growth at our directly operated retail stores and concession shops, and a 21% increase",1539,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting excellent third quarter results today. 
Consolidated sales rose 24%, including 15% comp store growth at our directly operated retail stores and concession shops, and a 21% increase in our wholesale shipments. All regions of the world contributed to the strong performance. Most of the growth was fueled by the incredible appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand in our core Men's, Women's and children's apparel products.
Our merging products and regions also continue to contribute, but the real momentum in the quarter came from the strength of our core. The customers are responding to the high-quality and compelling value of our merchandise across channels. We are clearly picking up substantial market share, particularly in the United States and in Europe.
Simply put, we have a superb holiday season. we offered exceptional merchandise across all lifestyle sensibilities, the more luxurious products at our Ralph Lauren stores to our aspirational assortments in our department stores worldwide. 
The strength of our merchandise was supported by world-class advertising and marketing efforts. Our innovative 4D light show alone has delivered more than $600 million media impressions worldwide since the event took place. And at point of sale, our product was showcased with spectacular in-store presentations. 
The holiday windows in our stores around the world are a destination. And we have strong placement in leading department stores as well, including our exclusive holiday program at Macy's. We invest considerable resources at our creative presentations and field teams to ensure we are delivering the most compelling customer experience we can. These teams are tireless and a competitive advantage for us. 
We are effectively monetizing our top line momentum as you can see in our profit matrix. Operating profits increased 43%, and diluted EPS rose 56% for the quarter. The clarity of our brand message drove highly profitable sell through, and we'd love it's just even as we incurred incremental investments in our growth initiatives. The disciplined execution of our global teams delivered results that were better than we planned for but entirely consistent with our strategies. So on behalf of Ralph and myself, I want to congratulate and thank our employees for a job well done.
we made important progress in each of our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter. On January 1, we successfully transitioned our former licensing South Korea operations go directly controlled operation. As a result, we welcomed 200 new associates the Polo Ralph Lauren family, add more stores at 179 concession shops for global distribution network. 
As you know, we progressively assumed direct control of our distribution through Asia. Beginning with Japan in fiscal 2008, most of the rest of Asia and fiscal '10 in South Korea in January. Collectively, this region of the world is currently comprised of 44 directly operated stores and 503 concession shops. This primarily represents the former licensees distribution strategy.
With the transition of South Korea, we have now completed an important first phase of our broader Asia strategy that is expected to transform our company over the long term. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to custom build this region in a manner that is allied would've a global luxury images strategies. So we intend to be deliberate with the sequencing of our efforts. We have new leadership in place and a team that is incredibly energized and focused on driving the next phase of our Asia strategy, which will be more focused on refining and expanding that the distribution in building customer awareness.
For more than 30 years, the entire region has been built primarily around Men's sportswear. Most of you are well aware that the breadth of our product assortments and more developed markets such as the United States and Europe is far more expensive. 
So far, we have found that the more we elevate our stores in the merchandise mix, the stronger the customer response. So over the next several years, we intend to intensify the exposure of our premium brands and showcase the breadth of our lifestyle offerings. 
We see a particularly compelling opportunity with our accessory products, handbags, small leather goods, watches and jewelry, included. Customer receptivity to these product categories will be very important for our success is in the region.
As you can imagine, takes a fair amount of time for us to execute our plans, Japan and South Korea and what I'll call China territories, are each a different stages of development for us. And it takes time to understand the varying tastes and preferences of our customers throughout this region. We are simultaneously looking for ways to maximize operational efficiencies throughout the region. This is easiest to do with our corporate shared services and creative teams, but we are also exploring synergies with inventory management and merchandising initiatives, again, recognizing there are often substantial differences between countries.
We've made good progress in Japan in a relatively short period of time and despite extremely unfavorable market conditions. But we're still far away from where we want to be. And in the China territories, we're beginning to see improvement in our sales philosophy as we become more stood with our planning and tiering of our merchandise, especially as customers are exposed to our more premium labels and products.
In South Korea, much of our first year will be spent on gradually normalizing inventory levels, which are exceptionally lean today. Renovating shops are important as well as implementing a target-door strategy to test of our more elevated merchandising strategies.
The Asian customer is driving a large part of the growth in the luxury market, both at home and abroad. They have a sophisticated appreciation for quality, craftsmanship and the integrity of design. These qualities lie at of the core of our company, and it's all that we do and think about. When we are dealing with this level of customer, our products really shine. 
Given the relatively modest scope of our existing Asia business, we are confident there's a considerable opportunity for us there. With $1.3 billion in cash and investments in our balance sheet, we are obviously not constrained by capital to pursue our goals. And we will commit more of our resources throughout the region and realize the returns we believe are achievable.
But with a deliberate pace of growth, which needs to be measured to ensure we are executing with the highest standards we acquire and what we've achieved in the rest of the world. This long tail to our growth aspirations is the right thing to do.
We successfully executed a similar strategy in Europe, the region that is an important contributed to our strong financial results and continues to offer considerable growth for us. Year-to-date, European sales and profits have grown at a double-digit pace reflecting excellent productivity gains in our core apparel categories. We have a lot more terrain to explore in Europe both in terms of incremental distribution and leveraging our full range of lifestyle sensibilities and product categories.
Our focus on expanding our direct-to-customer reach is also contributing to sales and profit growth. Our spectacular new Madison Avenue flagship stores are performing well ahead of plan as our most of the flagships worldwide. We're also driving better productivity in our existing stores. 
Over the last several years, we've expanded our Retail segment operating profit margin significantly. I believe that is a consistent investment we've made to create the world's most fantastic shopping environment enhance customer service experiences has supported this profit expansion. It enables us to capture our customer in a more meaningful way as we showcase the world of Ralph Lauren and immerse them in all that we have to offer.
The growing acceptance of our accessory products in our retail stores is very encouraging. As these products grow, the percent of our overall sales mix, they should enhance our retail productivity metrics further. More targeted in sophisticated marketing strategies are also to our retail results. 
At our brick-and-mortar store, we've increased our focus on our most loyal and highest-spending customer on in-store events. Online, we've developed more efficient search-optimization techniques and customer-engagement strategies and innovative events such as virtual fashion shows and other interactive merchant payment, which has proven to be very successful for us, both in terms of new customer acquisition and inspiring deeper loyalty from our existing customers. You can certainly see the impact on RalphLauren.com as we continue to go from strength to strength, registering a 33% increase in sales during the prior quarter. 
And consistent with our strategies to distort resource the high-growth high-margin opportunities, last week we launched the first phase of the next generation of RalphLauren.com in the United States. The site features a new look with enhanced product presentation and an improved customer experience. I encourage you all to check it out along with our new spring collections. 
And momentum is building at our new U.K. e-commerce site, where traffic is improving weekly, and we're experiencing stronger conversion rates. We're on track to launch e-commerce in France and Germany next summer, and we continue to explore Asian e-commerce opportunities.
At this point, I'd like to have Jackie Nemerov expand a bit more our product development strategies that she has day-to-day oversight of them."

There was no question that the momentum in our business around the world was fueled by the strength of our products. We are fortunate to be working with one of the world's most desirable brands and we support this",822,"Thank you, Roger. Good morning, everyone. There was no question that the momentum in our business around the world was fueled by the strength of our products. We are fortunate to be working with one of the world's most desirable brands and we support this with an extraordinary investment in new merchandise development and product innovation. I believe it is at the core competitive advantage for us.
With 43 years of experience as a company, we know our customers really well. And in that time, we appropriately evolved to address their dynamic lifestyle needs. In this last year alone, we have introduced exciting new handbag collections, a broad and compelling active wear assortment with RLX, our first fine jewelry collection. And just this week we introduced a new luxury denim offering. 
Ralph Lauren denim is an entirely new lifestyle expression for us and new terrain to the Women's designer-level merchandise. As Ralph's incredible vision is translated into new product ideas and lifestyle sensibilities, we were able to find incremental distribution opportunities to showcase the product. It not only makes us even more relative to our existing customers but also allows us to appeal to new customers. This is especially important as we grow our international presence since many of the regions of the world don't yet appreciate all we have to offer.
Given the diversity of our lifestyle labels and the complexity of our distribution around the world, we are careful to develop discrete products for discrete channels. As the businesses grown over the years and as we've come to more directly controlled various labels and product categories, the complexity of what we are executing has also increased. But with this rate of control, we were able to more effectively leverage our in-house expertise in design, manufacturing and merchandising across the portfolio of lifestyle sensibilities and develop more impactful, strategic merchandising initiatives on an increasingly global scale.
This benefit of greater cohesion begins with concept-design process, and Rawls all the rate through to spectacular, customized in-store presentation that deliver clear brand message to the customer. As a global luxury brand, the quality of our product and the consistency of our presentation is critical. And we invest considerable resources to ensure that Ralph's vision is properly executed. We do this for each and every one of our brands across the channel.
A recent and good example of this is our successful holiday tar program which Roger reference, wormer offer apparel, accessories and home products in a crisp, unified way that exacted the customer over the holidays and ultimately drove strong sell-throughs. 
We've executed similar strategies with our various lifestyle sensibilities. In just a few short years, Men's Black Label has evolved from tailor clothing and furnishings to now include a strong sportswear element and associated accessories. The launch of Ralph Lauren denim will be yet another extension of the Black Label sensibility for men. There was a similar story for the evolution of Purple Label, which now has an extremely compelling and fast-growing sportswear element to complement its core tailored clothing assortment.
In the department store arena, our Lauren brand has also evolved considerably. While Lauren has always been a fully realized lifestyle brand in its own right, with product offering across the rear, casual and weekend sportswear, it also has its own successful sub-brand, with Lauren Jeans Company, Lauren Active and Lauren Home. 
Of course, we've recently introduced exciting new Lauren product categories with footwear, handbag and dresses. Each of which has its own range of lifestyle sensibilities and use of location for the brands to address. These products quickly benefit from a high-brand awareness and considerable distribution platform of core existing Lauren business. 
Today, Lauren has primarily distributed in the United States but we believe there was considerable global growth for it. We intend to expand European distribution, including layering in Ralph Lauren various lifestyle elements over the next few seasons. We managed all of these tremendous content with extraordinary discipline, how we force the product, plan the assortment, allocate the inventory and delivered a merchandise equally important. 
This blend of art and science is absolutely critical to our success. Our precise execution and the consistent quality of the merchandise in terms of design and make are what enable us to elevate our brands and ultimately drive strong sell-through rates and profitability. The benefits still only a group our company, but also to our retail partners, which is why we continue to gain share. It is also why they're eager for us to continue to innovate.
When you consider the categories we have just that our toes in like accessories and denim, there are a number of global opportunities across us sensibilities in the world of Ralph Lauren. So as far as we've come we've always done, we still have a long way to go, which is really exciting for us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,118548721,100774,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen on this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow through to profit growth. Consolidate",1958,"Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen on this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow through to profit growth. 
Consolidated net revenues in the third quarter were $1.5 billion, a 24% increase from the prior year period with growth in both our wholesale and retail segments exceeding 20%. Solid performance of our core Men's, Women's and children's apparel was enhanced by incremental sales from our newly transitioned Asian operations and some favorable calendar shifts, which accounted for approximately 400 basis points of the consolidated sales increase.
Revenue growth exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the strength of our Retail segment, including considerable same-store sales growth and our directly operated stores and RalphLauren.com. Shipments to our global department store customers also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. The net impact of foreign currency translation on our total reported revenue growth was negligible for the third quarter. 
The gross profit rate of 58.6% in the third quarter was 40 basis points above the prior year period, reflecting stronger full priced sales up more than offset the initial impact of increasing cost of goods. Our comprehensive merchandising initiatives across all product categories and focus on our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce sites, supported the excellence full price sell-throughs we experience. The strengthening of the Japanese yen more than offset the magnitude of the unfavorable currency impact we experienced form the euro translation and that we anticipated when we spoke with you in November.
Expenses in the quarter included incremental costs associated with our Hong Kong operation as well as the South Korean pre-acquisition costs, our European e-commerce launch expenses, higher incentive compensation costs and global infrastructure support costs. Despite these investment expenditures, we achieved 160 basis points of operating expense leverage, which was better than a modest levers we had expected. The magnitude of the operating expense leverage in the quarter was another important contributor to our outperformance relative to our expectations.
Operating income of $246 million was 43% above the prior year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 200 basis points to 15.9% and reflecting improved profitability across all of our reporting segments. 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 52% to $168 million, and net income per diluted share rose 56% or $1.72. The lower effective tax rate of 29% compared to 33% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items that was partially offset by a greater proportion of earnings generated in higher tax jurisdictions this fiscal year.
Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales rose 21% to $676 million, a result of double-digit shipment growth in both the United States and European market. Third quarter wholesale operating income of $130 million was 21% greater than last year, and the wholesale operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 19.3%. Higher profits flow-through on the growth and shipment volumes and disciplined operation management of expenses were the primary drivers of improved wholesale operating income and margin rate, although they were somewhat offset by the first signs of cost of good inflation.
For our retail group. Our marketing and merchandising efforts substantially benefited our direct-to-consumer channel during the quarter. From the opening of our 888 Madison Avenue flagship stores here in New York in October and the considerable response to it to the strength of our global merchandising product lines for fall and holiday to our visual presentation, both in-store and online of the brand, we seem to resonate with consumers globally. 
Our customer traffic at retail continue to build throughout the quarter. As a result, strong comparable store sales grow, the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from our newly assumed stores and concession shops in Asia drove third quarter revenue up 29% to $822 million.
Our overall comp store sales increased 15% during the quarter, reflecting 7% growth at Ralph Lauren stores and concession shops, a 15% increase at global factory stores and 12% growth at Club Monaco stores. Improved traffic and improved conversion trends, in addition to increased full price selling, were all key drivers of comp growth. It is encouraging for all of us to see a broad range of key performance indicators delivering in a retail environment that were still fairly unpredictable and promotional in the quarter.
In the U.S., stores in key tourist destinations, like New York, California, Dallas and Florida, have rebounded and are outperforming the average comp trend. Club Monaco continues to benefit from compelling Women's fashion assortments and the Men's business also gained some momentum during the quarter. 
RalphLauren.com's spectacular 33% sales growth was also supported by higher traffic to the site and improved conversion, with accessories and children's were registering the rate of sales gains on the site. Even as consumers are shopping more online, the momentum at RalphLauren.com combined with the solid comp growth at our brick-and-mortar stores and our strength and wholesale suggest we are providing a compelling customer experience and desirable product assortments, and therefore, capturing a higher share of wallet across all channels and formats.
We opened 14 directly operated freestanding stores and closed five directly operated freestanding stores during the quarter, ending the period with 376 company-operated stores. We also operated 520 concession shop locations worldwide at the end of the third quarter. 
Included in these store counts are four directly operated stores and 179 concession shop locations assumed in the transition of the formerly licensed South Korea operations, which occurred on January 1, 2011, the last day of our fiscal quarter, although we did not record any sales associated with the network during that period.
Retail segment operating income grew 52% to $153 million in the third quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 280 basis points to 18.6%. This is a new peak level of Retail segment profitability for the third quarter period. The considerable improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate were a result of strong comparable store sales growth, higher full-priced sell-through rates across most retail concepts and disciplined operating management. 
Partially offsetting these gains were incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations and start-up costs for our international e-commerce efforts. Investments we've made in product develop and presentation, product flow, sales training for our associates in marketing and advertising are also clearly supporting our improvement in sales productivity.
Licensing royalties grew 4% to $50 million in the third quarter, as higher domestic product licensing revenues more than offset lower international royalties due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations. Operating income for our Licensing segment increased 23% to $30 million, primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with the Asian transition. 
Our strong operating results are reflected in our solid financial condition. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in net cash. Consolidated inventories were up 28% from the prior year period on a reported basis, which includes the incremental inventory to support over 300 Asian concession shops and stores in the Hong Kong region and the newly transitioned South Korea network.
Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated comp inventory was up 19% from the comparable period last year. The remaining growth in inventory primarily reflects the investment to support our new and enhanced merchandising programs, such as handbags, basic stock replenishment and our new European e-commerce site. 
In addition, we've taken proactive measures to avoid potential supply chain disruptions in light of the timing of the lunar new year in Asia, which is February 3 through February 14, by receiving goods earlier. In fact, hiring transit inventory accounted for about half of the total increase on the like-for-like basis. The inflationary impact of cost of goods also affected our ending inventory balance approximately 400 basis points.
Based on our third quarter sales results and our current perspective on our aggregate strength summer shipment schedule, we are comfortable with the currency of our inventory. We spent approximately $78 million on CapEx during the third quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. 
For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 20%, and our return on investment was 40% due to the continued strength of our free cash flow generation and with confidence in our strategic agenda. As we announced in our press release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program bringing our aggregate current authorization to approximately $719 million. 
In addition, the board has doubled the company's quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.20 per share from the current level of $0.10 per share. The board's actions enable us to enhance shareholder return even as we continue to invest in high-growth, high-margin opportunities. Our strong financial metrics were also recognize by Moody’s recently, who raised our corporate debt rating to A3 from Baa in January.
Our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 clearly showcased the considerable performance of our entire organization. That momentum has been enhanced by the growing contribution from emerging category categories and channels and our disciplined operational management. Collectively, these dynamics have helped to fund the investments we are making and will continue to make in Asia and offset the additional signs of based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are obviously raising our profit outlook for the full year.
In this morning's press release, we outlined our revised expectations for fiscal 2011 and I'd like to briefly review those with you now. For the full year period, we continue to expect revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate. Implicit in this outlook is an expectation for high single-digit growth in wholesale shipments and mid-teen growth for our Retail segment revenue. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect our full year operating margin rate to be approximately equal to fiscal 2010's level, which compares to our prior expectations of a 50 basis point decline.
Our outlook continues to imply both increased pressure from cost of goods inflation and exchange rate pressure in the fourth quarter as well as dilution related to the initial transition of the South Korea operations. In addition, we have encountered ships that impact the fourth quarter most notably, the fiscal 2011 as a 52-week year versus fiscal 2010's 53 weeks. And at the week between Christmas and new year, within our fiscal third quarter this year versus the fiscal fourth quarter last year. Collectively, we estimate these shifts to account for approximately 10 full basis points in sales growth and about 200 basis points in operating profit margin. 
We currently expect the fiscal 2011 tax rate of approximately 32%. Our year-to-date results confirmed a successful execution of our business strategies. We've demonstrated our ability to drive substantial profit flow-through on strong top line momentum, which speaks to the operational discipline of our team. We are proactive about pursuing market share opportunities and operational efficiencies as we consistently reinvest in the business to support our long-term strategic goal.
Second half calendar shifts aside, we continue to seek encouraging underlying demand trends for our products. This includes early reads on fall, holiday 2011 orders, which suggest we are strengthening our leadership position in a more developed merchandise categories and gaining traction with our newer product categories. Around the world, customers are voting for the Ralph Lauren brand and the compelling value proposition of our high-quality luxury products. This gives us further confidence to continue to reinvesting for future growth. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that please?"

So it gets as much information out there that we're able to provide. Clearly, you've all heard, read and know the extraordinary inflationary raw materials issue. cotton for sure, but all other fiber, Cashmere, will on and on and on are experiencing enormous increases. Some of that I think you have to recognize is coming off the low base post-recession, so the comparison is distorted. But even with that said, it's extraordinary by any measure. So with raw materials being the most important part of garment's costs, it's having a meaningful impact on how we think and plan and organize ourselves with that beginning to come into play in the back half of this year as we've talked about before, moving gradually through spring and then really coming on in more of a spike for fall and beyond. So I think we're all trying to monitor and watch that regularly. The other piece of that is the manufacturing cost are rising as well. And so, it sort of a double whammy of that, that is impacting everybody. We have taken a very clear position that we will not alter the quality of our materials, our manufacturing, our finding, our trims, or really where we are making product at this point. The backbone we think of our brand equity is the extraordinary products we make, and we think they've always been fairly priced for what they are. So that won't change. Our ability, we believe, to responsibly increase our prices later in the year, are based on that brand equity. And our customers believe that the products we provide, represent not only extraordinary design but extraordinary value. So for us, our thoughts, as we head into fall and beyond, is to look at products, look at pricing by category, by region, and again, make a responsible adjustment that reflects the reality of cost of goods increases. And beyond the short-term impact of this, the question is, where is it going to go over the next two or three years? And quite frankly, at this point nobody knows. So we have to be thoughtful about our expectation of our consumers that are going to react. And I don't think we'll really see a fair read on that until the fall. I think there would be selected price increases during the spring in the marketplace. We may get some modest read off of that. But I think, really, until we all get the fall of next year, we won't no whether the end consumer understands and accepts what will be an overall increase for most product categories. We just think with our brand, and our quality and the momentum we have, we've got to make responsible decisions about how we adjust our thinking on this."

When we built the plans for the year, we had anticipated, in our third quarter, in our fourth quarter, that cost of goods would be rising because we saw that coming. And we have made a decision not to adjust at our retail pricing for third and fourth quarter, and therefore, the plan was built on compression. And what you saw in the third quarter, and it's why we're somewhat looking at the back half of the year, the whole six months block of time, is our sell-throughs have been that much better. We are getting higher sell-throughs at full price, both in retail, online and our wholesale accounts worldwide. When that improved, full-price sell-through has mitigated the gradual cost of goods increases. So with the kind of sales momentum we've had and the sell-throughs we've had, we've had, obviously, reported today strong margin improvement against that backdrop. And that sort of what we're looking at for the go forward until we really get to the full impact of fall '11."

And I think it's on everybody's mind. The other piece, and then I'll answer your question more directly, is we've noticed the extraordinary impact that the Chinese customer has had on the other parts of the world as they travel. So getting our brand properly established in China and Hong Kong and other major capitals, we think will not only improve that part of the world, but their impact on Europe or the United States. Because what we're observing and other luxury brands is the extraordinary power they're exhibiting to buy those products outside their home market. With that said, we've now completed the major part of putting together what was a very fragmented licensing strategy in Asia. And as we've talked about in the past, the bulk of our licensees at the national have focused on Men's Blue Label sportswear. So the locations, the concessions, or street locations, or mall locations, were primarily positioned to maximize that particular merchandise class. And so, as we look to elevate the brand, bring more of a luxury assortment, clearly expand our Women's and accessory and high end Men's business. We've got to look at the portfolio of distribution points we have to see how they reflect against our go-forward position. Parallel to that, we are going to be aggressive in our desire to get the kind of locations. And it's really going to more than a 24 month period, but it's going to be for a very long time period to get the kind of locations we think we need to properly position the brand. What happening in China is clearly major city growth in the Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong regions, but a lot of second and third tier cities are now beginning to gel and exhibiting the customer demand. and so we're going to have to look at those second and third tier at the same time. we're looking at the primary cities for key locations. I also think it's clear to us that China, Hong Kong, is going to be more direct to customer, where a lot of the current network in Japan and Korea are concession shop in shops. So for us in China, more about the direct to customer through our own brick and mortar. And ultimately, through e-commerce. We're going to have to move quickly to accelerate our strategy of e-commerce in that region, because I think that will help overlay the brand positioning we're trying to achieve. So I tried to cover my comments at the beginning with sequencing and thoughtfulness because I think this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set properly the most unique region in the world. And what we've learned in the United States and what we've learned in Europe, we're going to try to apply."

The strong market positioning we have in the key markets of Europe has continued. So England, France, Germany have all been very, very strong markets as well as the Scandinavian countries. Spain, which went through a difficult period in the recession has started to come back a bit, and Italy has been added a bit more difficult. And I would say that's the most challenged market there. Most of the distribution in Italy is through multi-brand specialty stores, and I think they've struggled the most coming through the recession. So over time, I think Europe will continue to perform, but it's going to be with some ups and downs by country. And our ability to go direct to the customer is going to be critical, and that's why we're pleased with yearly U.K. e-commerce results and excited about France and Germany coming online, and then we have a rollout plan after that for the rest of the countries. South Korea, while mostly department store driven and concession shop driven, is actually a more vibrant market right now that Japan by a lot. The organic growth in that market has been strong. They also have a much stronger tourist business of Chinese. most of that of arbitrage on pricing, because the price of luxury goods is South Korea are cheaper than they are in China. So many Chinese see a weekend shopping experience into Seoul as an exciting to do. So the organic market, while developed as you said, is continuing to grow and is getting a healthier tourist play than the markets in Japan."

One is just the acquisition costs related to the transaction. So we certainly incurred some fees related to the transition of the business from licensed to owned, whether it be legal fees or other fees associated with that, some incremental people cost as we added people to the business from a transition standpoint. And then, we did pay about $47 million to this for the business. And that's with a combination of the inventory that was transferred over the fixed assets, so the net value of the we acquired in the transition and other considerations. So the amortization of all that from a purchase accounting standpoint is what's somewhat included in the dilution, and that is impacting the fourth quarter. The other part of the fourth quarter and we had the same experience with Dixon from a transition standpoint. When we transitioned our license often times, the transition leaves us with life fall inventory. And we have the same experience in Korea, so we are a bit light on our fall clearance inventory that will be would normally be selling this time in the year of January and February. We certainly have spring inventory from a selling standpoint. So the first couple of months of sales will be a bit light. But we expect that to certainly catch up in the second quarter as well. So all of those things are factored into the dilution. It's really a onetime dilution impact related to the transition of the business."

We thought we had aggressive plans, and we exceeded those. I think any local customer who watch the store go up for many, many years, as you all know, and was curious what we have done to their neighborhood came in and was overwhelmed with the presentation of the world of Ralph Lauren as well as the tourist customer. So both stores, the Men's store and the Women's and home stores, recorded extraordinary November, December performances. And really, the high end and the best products are what we sold the most of. The combination of the presentation, the merchandise and the extraordinary service levels that those stores provide, had us registering average sales checks more than 100% larger than in prior holiday seasons in those locations. So it was a combination of foot traffic and conversion. But really the higher price products that we were converting to sales was extraordinary. The accessory presentations on the main floor is really Ralph's vision for the future. And for us to take an entire main floor and make it accessories, when this store was in the planning stage years ago, was a bold commitment to our ability to develop the right handbags, accessories, footwear and of course, jewelry and watches. And we saw a strong customer reaction to all of that. Our challenge now will be to take that layering and representation of accessories and roll it out to more of our existing fleet as well as distorting new stores. As many of you know, our model in the past, where we have a lifestyle store was of the main floor, the second row was Men's. And then you hit the third floor maybe that was Women's and maybe a fourth that was home. So we always had strong Men's representation. But the Women's business, the Women's accessory businesses, never got the real estate they deserved. This is really at stake in the ground and the customer reaction has been up only exciting but reinforces that strategy. So new stores in Asia, new stores in Europe and our portfolio in the U.S. will be viewed with an eye towards that kind of distortion level."

They continue to registers strong double-digit performance. Much of that has been on extraordinary Women's performance. So the marketplace where Women's has not been as bouyant over the last 12 months, Club Monaco has really struck a chord with their customer. And I think, if you've been in the store, their fashion look, the fit and the quality are all resonating with that customer. We're also getting strong performance from our large network of stores in Asia with the same products. So today, Club Monaco in the United States and Club Monaco in Asia has the same kind of products, and it is resonating very well. Additionally, this holiday season, we saw Men's come on. so Men's was lagging a bit. It really picked up momentum into the holiday season, and we're pleased with the way that product is performing. So we're sticking our toe in Europe this month with a unique partnership with Brown's, and we are partnering with our European management to bring Club Monaco properly to Europe over time. And I think we'll hear more about that strategy as it unfolds. We regularly have European coming into the United States asking us to bring Club Monaco and its sensibility to Europe. And we think that's a real opportunity as well. The third leg of that stool will obviously be to get Club Monaco from a commerce point of view online and not just informational. We think that there will be a high demand, and we're working with our in-house e-commerce team to make sure we're properly positioning them to participate in that part of the growth. So for us, it's international, not dissimilar to the Ralph Lauren strategy, direct to customer through e-commerce. And I think as we've now seen the product consistency and the customer reaction, we feel more comfortable with our response, which is a more integrated growth strategy. So that, I think will be an important part of our success going forward.  So with that, I know we've run a little long. We apologize, we started out in the late. It's been an extraordinary quarter and nine months. Hopefully, some of the noise and shifts between quarter, we've tried to explain. But in the end, I think we're tracking to a year that is in excess of where we started at the beginning for all the right reasons.

We're pleased to be reporting excellent third quarter results today. 
Consolidated sales rose 24%, including 15% comp store growth at our directly operated retail stores and concession shops, and a 21% increase in our wholesale shipments. All regions of the world contributed to the strong performance. Most of the growth was fueled by the incredible appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand in our core men's, women's and children's apparel products.
Emerging products and regions also continued to contribute, but the real momentum in the quarter came from the strength of our core, where customers are responding to the high-quality and compelling value of our merchandise across channels. We are clearly picking up substantial market share, particularly in the United States and in Europe.
Simply put, we had a superb holiday season. We offered exceptional merchandise across all lifestyle sensibilities, from our most luxurious products at our Ralph Lauren stores to our aspirational assortments in our department stores worldwide. 
The strength of our merchandise was supported by world-class advertising and marketing efforts. Our innovative 4D light show alone has delivered more than $600 million media impressions worldwide since the event took place. And at point of sale, our product was showcased with spectacular in-store presentations. 
The holiday windows at our stores around the world are a destination. And we have strong placement in leading department stores as well, including our exclusive holiday tartan program at Macy's. We invest considerable resources on our creative presentations and field teams to ensure we are delivering the most compelling customer experience we can. These teams are tireless and a competitive advantage for us. 
We are effectively monetizing our top line momentum as you can see in our profit metrics. Operating profits increased 43%, and diluted EPS rose 56% for the quarter. The clarity of our brand message drove highly profitable sell-throughs, and we'd leverage this even as we incurred incremental investments in our growth initiatives. The disciplined execution of our global teams delivered results that were better than we planned for but entirely consistent with our strategies. So on behalf of Ralph and myself, I want to congratulate and thank our employees for a job well done.
We made important progress on each of our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter. On January 1, we successfully transitioned our former licensed South Korean operations to directly controlled operations. As a result, we welcomed 200 new associates to Polo Ralph Lauren family, add more stores and 179 concession shops to our global distribution network. 
As you know, we progressively assumed direct control of our distribution through Asia, beginning with Japan in fiscal 2008, most of the rest of Asia in fiscal 2010 and South Korea in January. Collectively, this region of the world is currently comprised of 44 directly operated stores and 503 concession shops. This primarily represents the former licensees distribution strategy.
With the transition of South Korea, we have now completed an important first phase of our broader Asia strategy that is expected to transform our company over the long term. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to custom build this region in a manner that is aligned with our global luxury image and strategies, so we intend to be deliberate with the sequencing of our efforts. We have new leadership in place and a team that is incredibly energized and focused on driving the next phase of our Asia strategy, which will be more focused on refining and expanding the distribution and building customer awareness.
For more than 30 years, the entire region has been built primarily around men's sportswear. Most of you are well aware that the breadth of our product assortment in more developed market such as the United States and Europe is far more expansive. 
So far, we have found that the more we elevate our stores and the merchandise mix, the stronger the customer response. So over the next several years, we intend to intensify the exposure of our premium brands and showcase the breadth of our lifestyle offerings. 
We see a particularly compelling opportunity with our accessory products, handbags, small leather goods, watches and jewelry, included. Customer receptivity to these product categories will be very important for our success in the region.
As you can imagine, it takes a fair amount of time for us to execute our plans, Japan and South Korea and what I'll call China territories, are each at different stages of development for us. And it takes time to understand the varying taste and preferences of our customers throughout this region. We are simultaneously looking for ways to maximize operational efficiencies throughout the region. This is easiest to do with our corporate shared services and creative teams, but we are also exploring synergies with inventory management and merchandising initiative, again, recognizing there are often substantial differences between countries.
We've made good progress in Japan in a relatively short period of time and despite extremely unfavorable market conditions. But we're still far away from where we want to be. And in the China territories, we're beginning to see improvement in our sale velocity as we become more stood with our planning and tiering of our merchandise, especially as customers are exposed to our more premium labels and products.
In South Korea, much of our first year will be spent on gradually normalizing inventory levels, which are exceptionally lean today. Renovating shops are important as well as implementing a target-door strategy to test of our more elevated merchandising strategies.
The Asian customer is driving a large part of the growth in the luxury market, both at home and abroad. They have a sophisticated appreciation for quality, craftsmanship and the integrity of design. These qualities lie at the core of our company, and it's all that we do and think about. When we are dealing with this level of customer, our products really shine. 
Given the relatively modest scope of our existing Asia business, we are confident there's a considerable opportunity for us there. With $1.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are obviously not constrained by capital to pursue our goals. And we will commit more of our resources to develop the region and realize the returns we believe are achievable.
But with a deliberate pace of growth, which needs to be measured to ensure we are executing with the highest standards we require and what we've achieved in the rest of the world. This long tail to our growth aspirations is the right thing to do.
We successfully executed a similar strategy in Europe, a region that is an important contributor to our strong financial results and continues to offer considerable growth for us. Year-to-date, European sales and profits have grown at a double-digit pace reflecting excellent productivity gains in our core apparel categories. We have a lot more terrain to explore in Europe both in terms of incremental distribution and leveraging our full range of lifestyle sensibilities and product categories.
Our focus on expanding our direct-to-customer reach is also contributing to sales and profit growth. Our spectacular new Madison Avenue flagship stores are performing well ahead of plan as our most of the flagships worldwide. We're also driving better productivity in our existing stores. 
Over the last several years, we've expanded our Retail segment operating profit margin significantly. I believe that consistent investment we've made to create the world's most fantastic shopping environments enhance customer service experiences has supported this profit expansion. It enables us to capture our customer in a more meaningful way as we showcase the world of Ralph Lauren and immerse them in all that we have to offer.
The growing acceptance of our accessory products in our retail stores is very encouraging. As these products grow as a percent of our overall sales mix, they should enhance our retail productivity metrics further. More targeted in sophisticated marketing strategies are also contributing to our retail results. 
At our brick-and-mortar store, we've increased our focus on our most loyal and highest-spending customer on in-store events. Online, we developed more efficient search-optimization techniques and customer-engagement strategies and innovative events such as virtual fashion shows and other interactive merchant payment, which has proven to be very successful for us, both in terms of new customer acquisition and inspiring deeper loyalty from our existing customers. You can certainly see the impact on RalphLauren.com as we continue to go from strength to strength, registering a 33% increase in sales during the prior quarter. 
And consistent with our strategies to distort resources to high-growth, high-margin opportunities, last week, we launched the first phase of the next generation of RalphLauren.com in the United States. The site features a new look with enhanced product presentation and an improved customer experience. I encourage you all to check it out along with our new spring collections. 
And momentum is building at our new U.K. e-commerce site, where traffic is improving weekly, and we're experiencing strong conversion rates. We're on track to launch e-commerce in France and Germany next summer, and we continue to explore Asian e-commerce opportunities.
At this point, I'd like to have Jacki Nemerov expand a bit more on our product development strategies that she has day-to-day oversight of them."

As Ralph's incredible vision is translated into new product ideas and lifestyle sensibilities, we were able to find incremental distribution opportunities to showcase the product. It not only makes us even more relevant to our existing customers but also allows us to appeal to new customers. This is especially important as we grow our international presence since many of the regions of the world don't yet appreciate all we have to offer.
Given the diversity of our lifestyle labels and the complexity of our distribution around the world, we are careful to develop discrete product for discrete channels. As the businesses grown over the years and as we've come to more directly controlled various labels and product categories, the complexity of what we are executing has also increased. But with this greater control, we were able to more effectively leverage our in-house expertise in design, manufacturing and merchandising across the portfolio of lifestyle sensibilities and develop more impactful, strategic merchandising initiatives on an increasingly global scale.
This benefit of greater cohesion begins with the concept-design process, and runs all the way through to spectacular, customized in-store presentations that deliver a clear brand message to the customer. At the global luxury brand, the quality of our product and the consistency of our presentation is critical. And we invest considerable resources to ensure that Ralph's vision is properly executed. We do this for each and every one of our brands across the channel.
A recent and good example of this is our successful holiday tartan program, which Roger referenced, where we offered apparel, accessories and home products in a crisp, unified way that excited the customer over the holidays and ultimately drove strong sell-throughs. 
We've executed similar strategies with our various lifestyle sensibilities. In just a few short years, men's Black Label has evolved from tailored clothing and furnishings to now include a strong sportswear element and associated accessories. The launch of Ralph Lauren denim will be yet another extension of the Black Label sensibility for men. There's a similar story for the evolution of Purple Label, which now has an extremely compelling and fast-growing sportswear element to complement its core tailored clothing assortment.
In the department store arena, our Lauren brand has also evolved considerably. While Lauren has always been a fully realized lifestyle brand in its own right, with product offerings across career, polished casual and weekend sportswear, it also has its own successful sub-brands with Lauren Jeans Co., Lauren Active and Lauren Home. 
Of course, we've recently introduced exciting new Lauren product categories with footwear, handbags and dresses. Each of which has its own range of lifestyle sensibilities and usage occasions for the brands to address. These products quickly benefit from a high-brand awareness and considerable distribution platform of the core existing Lauren business. 
Today, Lauren is primarily distributed in the United States, but we believe there is considerable global growth for it. We intend to expand European distribution, including layering in more of Lauren various lifestyle elements over the next few seasons. We managed all of these tremendous content with extraordinary discipline, how we source the product, plan the assortments, allocate the inventory and deliver the merchandise is equally important. 
This blend of art and science is absolutely critical to our success. Our precise execution and the consistent quality of the merchandise in terms of design and make are what enable us to elevate our brands and ultimately drive strong sell-through rates and profitability. The benefits don't accrue to our company, but also to our retail partners, which is why we continue to gain share. It is also why they are eager for us to continue to innovate.
When you consider the categories we have just dipped our toes in like accessories and denim, there are enormous global opportunities for us across all sensibilities in the world of Ralph Lauren. So as far as we've come, with all we've done, we still have a long way to go, which is really exciting for us. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,118548721,100905,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow through to profit growth. Consolidated",1957,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow through to profit growth. 
Consolidated net revenues in the third quarter were $1.5 billion, a 24% increase from the prior year period with growth in both our Wholesale and Retail segments exceeding 20%. Solid performance of our core men's, women's and children's apparel was enhanced by incremental sales from our newly transitioned Asian operations and some favorable calendar shifts, which accounted for approximately 400 basis points of the consolidated sales increase.
Revenue growth exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the strength of our Retail segment, including considerable same-store sales growth at our directly operated stores at RalphLauren.com. Shipments to our global department store customers also exceeded our expectations this quarter. The net impact of foreign currency translation on our total reported revenue growth was negligible for the third quarter. 
The gross profit rate of 58.6% in the third quarter was 40 basis points above the prior year period, reflecting stronger full-priced sales that more than offset the initial impact of increasing cost of goods. Our comprehensive merchandising initiatives across all product categories and focused on our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce sites, supported the excellent full-price sell-throughs we experienced. The strengthening of the Japanese yen more than offset the magnitude of the unfavorable currency impact we experienced from the euro translation and that we anticipated when we spoke with you in November.
Expenses in the quarter included incremental costs associated with our Hong Kong operation as well as the South Korean pre-acquisition costs, our European e-commerce launch expenses, higher incentive compensation costs and global infrastructure to support cost. Despite these investment expenditures, we achieved 160 basis points of operating expense leverage, which was better than the modest leverage we had expected. The magnitude of the operating expense leverage in the quarter was another important contributor to our outperformance relative to our expectations.
Operating income of $246 million was 43% above the prior year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 200 basis points to 15.9% and reflecting improved profitability across all of our reporting segments. 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 52% to $168 million, and net income per diluted share rose 56% to $1.72. The lower effective tax rate of 29% compared to 33% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items that was partially offset by a greater proportion of earnings generated in higher-tax jurisdictions this fiscal year.
Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales rose 21% to $676 million, a result of double-digit shipment growth in both the United States and European markets. Third quarter wholesale operating income of $130 million was 21% greater than last year, and the wholesale operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 19.3%. Higher profit flow-through on the growth in shipment volumes and disciplined operational management of expenses were the primary drivers of improved wholesale operating income and margin rate, although they were somewhat offset by the first signs of cost of good inflation.
For our Retail group, our marketing and merchandising efforts substantially benefited our direct-to-consumer channel during the quarter. From the opening of our 888 Madison Avenue flagship store here in New York in October and the considerable response to it, to the strength of our global merchandising product lines for fall and holiday, to our visual presentation, both in-store and online of the brand, which seem to resonate with consumers globally. 
Our customer traffic at Retail continued to build throughout the quarter. As a result, strong comparable store sales grow, the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from our newly assumed stores and concession shops in Asia drove third quarter revenue up 29% to $822 million.
Our overall comp store sales increased 15% during the quarter, reflecting 7% growth at Ralph Lauren stores and concession shops, a 15% increase at global factory stores and 12% growth at Club Monaco stores. Improved traffic and improved conversion trends, in addition to increased full-price selling, were all key drivers of comp growth. It is encouraging for all of us to see a broad range of key performance indicators delivering in a retail environment that was still fairly unpredictable and promotional in the quarter.
In the U.S., stores in key tourist destinations like New York, California, Dallas and Florida, have rebounded and are outperforming the average comp trend. Club Monaco continues to benefit from compelling women's fashion assortments and the Men's business also gained some momentum during the quarter. 
RalphLauren.com's spectacular 33% sales growth was also supported by higher traffic to the site and improved conversion, with accessories and children's wear registering the greatest sales gains on the site. Even as consumers are shopping more online, the momentum at RalphLauren.com, combined with the solid comp growth at our brick-and-mortar stores and our strength at wholesale, suggest we are providing a compelling customer experience and desirable product assortments and therefore, capturing a higher share of wallet across all channels and formats.
We opened 14 directly operated freestanding stores and closed five directly operated freestanding stores during the quarter, ending the period with 376 company-operated stores. We also operated 520 concession shop locations worldwide at the end of the third quarter. 
Included in these store counts are four directly operated stores and 179 concession shop locations assumed in the transition of the formerly licensed South Korea operations, which occurred on January 1, 2011, the last day of our fiscal quarter, although we did not record any sales associated with the network during that period.
Retail segment operating income grew 52% to $153 million in the third quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 280 basis points to 18.6%. This is a new peak level of Retail segment profitability for the third quarter period. The considerable improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate were a result of strong comparable store sales growth, higher full-price sell-through rates across most retail concepts and disciplined operating management. 
Partially offsetting these gains were incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations and start-up costs for our international e-commerce efforts. Investments we've made in product development and presentation, product flow, sales training for our associates in marketing and advertising are also clearly supporting our improvement in sales productivity.
Licensing royalties grew 4% to $50 million in the third quarter, as higher domestic product licensing revenues more than offset lower international royalties due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations. Operating income for our Licensing segment increased 23% to $30 million, primarily as a result of lower net cost associated with the Asian transition. 
Our strong operating results are reflected in our solid financial condition. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in net cash. Consolidated inventories were up 28% from the prior year period on a reported basis, which includes the incremental inventory to support over 300 Asian concession shops and stores in the Hong Kong region and the newly transitioned South Korea network.
Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated comp inventory was up 19% from the comparable period last year. The remaining growth in inventory primarily reflects the investment to support our new and enhanced merchandising programs such as handbags, basic stock replenishment and our new European e-commerce site. 
In addition, we've taken proactive measures to avoid potential supply chain disruption in light of the timing of the lunar new year in Asia, which is February 3 through February 14, by receiving goods earlier. In fact, higher in-transit inventory accounted for about half of the total increase on a like-for-like basis. The inflationary impact of cost of goods also affected our ending inventory balance approximately 400 basis points.
Based on our third quarter sales results and our current perspective on our aggregate spring summer shipment schedule, we are comfortable with the currency of our inventory. We spent approximately $78 million on CapEx during the third quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. 
For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 20%, and our return on investment was 40% due to the continued strength of our free cash flow generation and with confidence in our strategic agenda. As we announced in our press release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program, bringing our aggregate current authorizations to approximately $719 million. 
In addition, the board has doubled the company's quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.20 per share from the current level of $0.10 per share. The board's actions enable us to enhance shareholder return even as we continue to invest in high-growth, high-margin opportunities. Our strong financial metrics were also recognized by Moody’s recently, who raised our corporate debt rating to A3 from Baa1 in January.
Our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 clearly showcased the considerable performance of our entire organization. That momentum has been enhanced by the growing contribution from emerging product categories and channels and our disciplined operational management. Collectively, these dynamics have helped to fund the investments we are making and will continue to make in Asia and offset the initial signs of cost of goods inflation. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are obviously raising our profit outlook for the full year.
In this morning's press release, we outlined our revised expectations for fiscal 2011, and I'd like to briefly review those with you now. For the full year period, we continue to expect revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate. Implicit in this outlook is an expectation for high single-digit growth in wholesale shipment and mid-teen growth for our Retail segment revenue. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect our full year operating margin rate to be approximately equal to fiscal 2010's level, which compares to our prior expectation of a 50 basis point decline.
Our outlook continues to imply both increased pressure from cost of goods inflation and exchange rate pressure in the fourth quarter, as well as dilution related to the initial transition of the South Korea operations. 
In addition, we have some calendar shift that impact the fourth quarter, most notably, the fiscal 2011 as a 52-week year versus fiscal 2010's 53 weeks and at the week between Christmas and new year, within our fiscal third quarter this year versus the fiscal fourth quarter last year. Collectively, we estimate these shifts to account for approximately 10 full basis points in sales growth and about 200 basis points in operating profit margin. 
We currently expect the fiscal 2011 tax rate of approximately 32%. Our year-to-date results affirmed the successful execution of our business strategies. We've demonstrated our ability to drive substantial profit flow-through on strong top line momentum, which speaks to the operational discipline of our team. We are proactive about pursuing market share opportunities and operational efficiencies as we consistently reinvest in the business to support our long-term strategic goal.
Second half calendar shifts aside, we continue to seek encouraging underlying demand trends for our products. This includes early reads on fall, holiday 2011 orders, which suggest we are strengthening our leadership position in our more developed merchandise categories and gaining traction with our newer product categories. Around the world, customers are voting for the Ralph Lauren brand and the compelling value proposition of our high-quality luxury products. This gives us further confidence to continue reinvesting for future growth. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that please?"

Clearly, you've all heard, read and know the extraordinary inflationary raw materials issue. Cotton for sure, but all other fibers, cashmere, wool, on and on and on are experiencing enormous increases. Some of that I think you have to recognize is coming off the low base post-recession, so the comparison is distorted. But even with that said, it's extraordinary by any measure. So with raw materials being the most important part of a garment's cost, it's having a meaningful impact on how we think and plan and organize ourselves with that beginning to come into play in the back half of this year as we've talked about before, moving gradually through spring and then really coming on in more of a spike for fall and beyond. So I think we're all trying to monitor and watch that regularly. The other piece of that is the manufacturing costs are rising as well. And so it's sort of a double whammy event that is impacting everybody. We have taken a very clear position that we will not alter the quality of our materials, our manufacturing, our findings, our trims, or really where we're making product at this point. The backbone we think of our brand equity is the extraordinary products we make, and we think they've always been fairly priced for what they are. So that won't change. Our ability, we believe, to responsibly increase our prices later in the year, are based on that brand equity, in our customers' belief that the products we provide represent not only extraordinary design but extraordinary value. So for us, our thoughts, as we head into fall and beyond, is to look at products, look at pricing by category, by region, and again, make a responsible adjustment that reflects the reality of cost of goods increases. And beyond the short-term impact of this, the question is, where is it going to go over the next two or three years? And quite frankly, at this point, nobody knows. So we have to be thoughtful about our expectation of how our consumers are going to react. And I don't think we'll really see a fair read on that until the fall. I think there will be selective price increases during the spring in the marketplace. We may get some modest read off of that. But I think, really, until we all get to fall of next year, we won't know whether the end consumer understands and accepts what will be a overall increase for most product categories. We just think with our brand, and our quality and the momentum we have, we've got to make responsible decisions about how we adjust our thinking on this."

When we built the plans for the year, we had anticipated, in our third quarter, in our fourth quarter, that cost of goods would be rising because we saw that coming. And we had made a decision not to adjust retail pricing for third and fourth quarter, and therefore, the plan was built on compression. And what you saw on the third quarter, and it's why we're somewhat looking at the back half of the year, the whole six months block of time, is our sell-throughs have been that much better. We are getting higher sell-throughs at full price, both in retail, online and our wholesale accounts worldwide. When that improved, full-price sell-through has mitigated the gradual cost of goods increases. So with the kind of sales momentum we've had and the sell-throughs we've had, we have, obviously, reported today strong margin improvement against that backdrop. And that's sort of what we're looking at for the go forward until we really get to the full impact of fall '11."

And I think it's on everybody's mind. The other piece, and then I'll answer your question more directly, is we've noticed the extraordinary impact that the Chinese customer has had on other parts of the world as they travel. So getting our brand properly established in China and Hong Kong and other major capitals, we think will not only improve that part of the world, but their impact on Europe or the United States because what we're observing in other luxury brands is the extraordinary power they're exhibiting to buy those products outside their home market. With that said, we've now completed the major part of putting together what was a very fragmented licensing strategy in Asia. And as we've talked about in the past, the bulk of our licensees internationally have focused on men's Blue Label sportswear. So the locations, the concessions, or street locations, or mall locations, were primarily positioned to maximize that particular merchandise class. And so as we look to elevate the brand, bring more of a luxury assortment, clearly, expand our women's and accessory and high-end Men's business. We've got to look at the portfolio of distribution points we have to see how they reflect against our go-forward position. Parallel to that, we are going to be aggressive in our desire to get the kind of locations. And it's really going to be more than a 24-month period, but it's going to be for a very long time period to get the kind of locations we think we need to properly position the brand. What's happening in China is clearly a major city growth in the Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong regions, but a lot of second and third tier cities are now beginning to gel and exhibiting the customer demand, and so we're going to have to look at those second and third tiers the same time we're looking at the primary cities for key locations. I also think it's clear to us that China, Hong Kong, is going to be more direct to customer, where a lot of the current network in Japan and Korea are concession shop in shops. So for us in China, more about the direct-to-customer through our own brick-and-mortar and ultimately, through e-commerce. We're going to have to move quickly to accelerate our strategy of e-commerce in that region because I think that will help overlay the brand positioning we're trying to achieve. So I tried to pepper my comments at the beginning with sequencing and thoughtfulness because I think this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set properly the most unique region in the world. And what we've learned in the United States and what we've learned in Europe, we're going to try to apply."

The strong market positioning we have in the key markets of Europe has continued. So England, France, Germany have all been very, very strong markets as well as the Scandinavian countries. Spain, which went through a difficult period in the recession has started to come back a bit. In Italy, it's been a little bit more difficult. And I would say that's the most challenged market there. Most of the distribution in Italy is through multi-brand specialty stores that I think they've struggled the most coming through the recession. So over time, I think Europe will continue to perform, but it's going to be with some ups and downs by country. And our ability to go direct to the customer is going to be critical, and that's why we're pleased with the early U.K. e-commerce results and excited about France and Germany coming online, and then we have a rollout plan after that for the rest of the countries. South Korea, while mostly department store driven and concession shop driven, is actually a more vibrant market right now than Japan by a lot. The organic growth in that market has been strong. They also have a much stronger Tourist business of Chinese. Most of that is an arbitrage on pricing because the price of luxury goods is South Korea are cheaper than they are in China. So many Chinese see a weekend shopping excursion into Seoul as a exciting to do.

One is just the acquisition costs related to the transaction. So we certainly incurred some fees related to the transition of the business from licensed to owned, whether it be legal fees or other fees associated with that, some incremental people cost as we added people to the business from a transition standpoint. And then, we did pay about $47 million to Doosan for the business. And that was a combination of the inventory that was transferred over the fixed assets, the net book value of the fixed assets that we acquired in the transition and other considerations. So the amortization of all that from a purchase accounting standpoint is what's somewhat included in the dilution and that is impacting the fourth quarter. The other part of the fourth quarter and we had the same experience with Dickson from a transition standpoint, when we transitioned our license, often times, the transition leaves us with life fall inventory. And we have the same experience in Korea, so we are a bit light on our fall clearance inventory that we would normally be selling this time of the year in January and February. We certainly have spring inventory from a selling standpoint. So the first couple of months of sale will be a bit light. But we expect that to certainly catch up in the second quarter as well. So all of those things are factored into the dilution. It's really a onetime dilution impact related to the transition of the business"

We thought we had aggressive plans, and we exceeded those. I think any local customer who watch the store go up for many, many years, as you all know, and was curious what we have done to their neighborhood came in and was overwhelmed with the presentation of the world of Ralph Lauren as well as the tourist customer. So both stores, the men's store and the women's and home stores, recorded extraordinary November, December performances. And really, the high end and the best products are what we sold the most of. The combination of the presentation, the merchandise and the extraordinary service levels that those stores provide, had us registering average sales checks more than 100% larger than in prior holiday seasons in those locations. So it was a combination of foot traffic and conversion. But really, the higher-priced products that we were converting to sales was extraordinary. The accessory presentations on the main floor is really Ralph's vision for the future. And for us to take an entire main floor and make it accessories, when this store was in the planning stage years ago, it was a bold commitment to our ability to develop the right handbags, accessories, footwear and, of course, jewelry and watches. And we saw a strong customer reaction to all of that. Our challenge now will be to take that layering and representation of accessories and roll it out to more of our existing fleet as well as distorting new stores. As many of you know, our model in the past, where we had a lifestyle store was of the main floor. The second floor was men's, and then you hit a third floor, maybe that was women's and maybe a fourth that was home. So we always had strong men's representation. But the Women's business, the Women's Accessory businesses, never got the real estate they deserved. This is really a stake in the ground and the customer reaction has been not only exciting, but reinforces that strategy. So new stores in Asia, new stores in Europe and our portfolio in the U.S. will be viewed with an eye towards that kind of distortion level."

Through the first nine months, they continue to registers strong double-digit performance. Much of that has been on extraordinary women's performance. So on a marketplace where women's has not been as bouyant over the last 12 months, Club Monaco has really struck a chord with their customer. And I think, if you've been in the store, their fashion look, the fit and the quality are all resonating with that customer. We're also getting strong performance from our large network of stores in Asia with the same products. So today, Club Monaco in the United States and Club Monaco in Asia has the same kind of products, and it is resonating very well. Additionally, this holiday season, we saw men's come on. So where men's was lagging a bit, it really picked up momentum into the holiday season, and we're pleased with the way that product is performing. So we're sticking our toe in Europe this month with a unique partnership with Brown's, and we are partnering with our European management to bring Club Monaco properly to Europe over time. And I think we'll hear more about that strategy as it unfolds. We regularly have European coming into the United States asking us to bring Club Monaco and its sensibility to Europe. And we think that's a real opportunity as well. The third leg of that stool will obviously be to get Club Monaco from a commerce point of view online and not just informational. We think that there will be a high demand, and we're working with our in-house e-commerce team to make sure we're properly positioning them to participate in that part of the growth. So for us, it's international, not dissimilar to the Ralph Lauren strategy, direct to customer through e-commerce. And I think as we've now seen the product consistency and the customer reaction, we feel more comfortable with our response, which is a more integrated growth strategy. So that, I think, will be an important part of our success going forward. So with that, I know we've run a little long. We apologize, we started a little late. It's been a extraordinary quarter and nine months. Hopefully, some of the noise and shifts between quarter, we've tried to explain. But in the end, I think we're tracking to a year that is in excess of where we started at the beginning for all the right reasons. And we're obviously very excited about the new growth opportunities by product category that Jacki talked about were obviously the whole Asia-Pacific region, which we'll continue to talk about the never call.

We're pleased to be reporting excellent third quarter results today. Consolidated sales rose 24%, including 15% comp store growth at our directly operated retail stores and concession shops, and a 21% increase",1540,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting excellent third quarter results today. 
Consolidated sales rose 24%, including 15% comp store growth at our directly operated retail stores and concession shops, and a 21% increase in our wholesale shipments. All regions of the world contributed to the strong performance. Most of the growth was fueled by the incredible appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand in our core men's, women's and children's apparel products.
Emerging products and regions also continued to contribute, but the real momentum in the quarter came from the strength of our core, where customers are responding to the high-quality and compelling value of our merchandise across channels. We are clearly picking up substantial market share, particularly in the United States and in Europe.
Simply put, we had a superb holiday season. We offered exceptional merchandise across all lifestyle sensibilities, from our most luxurious products at our Ralph Lauren stores to our aspirational assortments in our department stores worldwide. 
The strength of our merchandise was supported by world-class advertising and marketing efforts. Our innovative 4D light show alone has delivered more than $600 million media impressions worldwide since the event took place. And at point of sale, our product was showcased with spectacular in-store presentations. 
The holiday windows at our stores around the world are a destination. And we have strong placement in leading department stores as well, including our exclusive holiday tartan program at Macy's. We invest considerable resources on our creative presentations and field teams to ensure we are delivering the most compelling customer experience we can. These teams are tireless and a competitive advantage for us. 
We are effectively monetizing our top line momentum as you can see in our profit metrics. Operating profits increased 43%, and diluted EPS rose 56% for the quarter. The clarity of our brand message drove highly profitable sell-throughs, and we'd leverage this even as we incurred incremental investments in our growth initiatives. The disciplined execution of our global teams delivered results that were better than we planned for but entirely consistent with our strategies. So on behalf of Ralph and myself, I want to congratulate and thank our employees for a job well done.
We made important progress on each of our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter. On January 1, we successfully transitioned our former licensed South Korean operations to directly controlled operations. As a result, we welcomed 200 new associates to Polo Ralph Lauren family, add more stores and 179 concession shops to our global distribution network. 
As you know, we progressively assumed direct control of our distribution through Asia, beginning with Japan in fiscal 2008, most of the rest of Asia in fiscal 2010 and South Korea in January. Collectively, this region of the world is currently comprised of 44 directly operated stores and 503 concession shops. This primarily represents the former licensees distribution strategy.
With the transition of South Korea, we have now completed an important first phase of our broader Asia strategy that is expected to transform our company over the long term. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to custom build this region in a manner that is aligned with our global luxury image and strategies, so we intend to be deliberate with the sequencing of our efforts. We have new leadership in place and a team that is incredibly energized and focused on driving the next phase of our Asia strategy, which will be more focused on refining and expanding the distribution and building customer awareness.
For more than 30 years, the entire region has been built primarily around men's sportswear. Most of you are well aware that the breadth of our product assortment in more developed market such as the United States and Europe is far more expansive. 
So far, we have found that the more we elevate our stores and the merchandise mix, the stronger the customer response. So over the next several years, we intend to intensify the exposure of our premium brands and showcase the breadth of our lifestyle offerings. 
We see a particularly compelling opportunity with our accessory products, handbags, small leather goods, watches and jewelry, included. Customer receptivity to these product categories will be very important for our success in the region.
As you can imagine, it takes a fair amount of time for us to execute our plans, Japan and South Korea and what I'll call China territories, are each at different stages of development for us. And it takes time to understand the varying taste and preferences of our customers throughout this region. We are simultaneously looking for ways to maximize operational efficiencies throughout the region. This is easiest to do with our corporate shared services and creative teams, but we are also exploring synergies with inventory management and merchandising initiative, again, recognizing there are often substantial differences between countries.
We've made good progress in Japan in a relatively short period of time and despite extremely unfavorable market conditions. But we're still far away from where we want to be. And in the China territories, we're beginning to see improvement in our sale velocity as we become more stood with our planning and tiering of our merchandise, especially as customers are exposed to our more premium labels and products.
In South Korea, much of our first year will be spent on gradually normalizing inventory levels, which are exceptionally lean today. Renovating shops are important as well as implementing a target-door strategy to test of our more elevated merchandising strategies.
The Asian customer is driving a large part of the growth in the luxury market, both at home and abroad. They have a sophisticated appreciation for quality, craftsmanship and the integrity of design. These qualities lie at the core of our company, and it's all that we do and think about. When we are dealing with this level of customer, our products really shine. 
Given the relatively modest scope of our existing Asia business, we are confident there's a considerable opportunity for us there. With $1.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are obviously not constrained by capital to pursue our goals. And we will commit more of our resources to develop the region and realize the returns we believe are achievable.
But with a deliberate pace of growth, which needs to be measured to ensure we are executing with the highest standards we require and what we've achieved in the rest of the world. This long tail to our growth aspirations is the right thing to do.
We successfully executed a similar strategy in Europe, a region that is an important contributor to our strong financial results and continues to offer considerable growth for us. Year-to-date, European sales and profits have grown at a double-digit pace reflecting excellent productivity gains in our core apparel categories. We have a lot more terrain to explore in Europe both in terms of incremental distribution and leveraging our full range of lifestyle sensibilities and product categories.
Our focus on expanding our direct-to-customer reach is also contributing to sales and profit growth. Our spectacular new Madison Avenue flagship stores are performing well ahead of plan as our most of the flagships worldwide. We're also driving better productivity in our existing stores. 
Over the last several years, we've expanded our Retail segment operating profit margin significantly. I believe that consistent investment we've made to create the world's most fantastic shopping environments enhance customer service experiences has supported this profit expansion. It enables us to capture our customer in a more meaningful way as we showcase the world of Ralph Lauren and immerse them in all that we have to offer.
The growing acceptance of our accessory products in our retail stores is very encouraging. As these products grow as a percent of our overall sales mix, they should enhance our retail productivity metrics further. More targeted in sophisticated marketing strategies are also contributing to our retail results. 
At our brick-and-mortar store, we've increased our focus on our most loyal and highest-spending customer on in-store events. Online, we developed more efficient search-optimization techniques and customer-engagement strategies and innovative events such as virtual fashion shows and other interactive merchant payment, which has proven to be very successful for us, both in terms of new customer acquisition and inspiring deeper loyalty from our existing customers. You can certainly see the impact on RalphLauren.com as we continue to go from strength to strength, registering a 33% increase in sales during the prior quarter. 
And consistent with our strategies to distort resources to high-growth, high-margin opportunities, last week, we launched the first phase of the next generation of RalphLauren.com in the United States. The site features a new look with enhanced product presentation and an improved customer experience. I encourage you all to check it out along with our new spring collections. 
And momentum is building at our new U.K. e-commerce site, where traffic is improving weekly, and we're experiencing strong conversion rates. We're on track to launch e-commerce in France and Germany next summer, and we continue to explore Asian e-commerce opportunities.
At this point, I'd like to have Jacki Nemerov expand a bit more on our product development strategies that she has day-to-day oversight of them."

There was no question that the momentum in our business around the world was fueled by the strength of our products. We are fortunate to be working with one of the world's most desirable brands, and we support this with an extraordinary investment in new merchandise development and product innovation. I believe it is a core competitive advantage for us.
With 43 years of experience as a company, we know our customers really well. And in that time, we've appropriately evolved to address their dynamic lifestyle needs. In this last year alone, we have introduced exciting new handbag collections, a broad and compelling active wear assortment with RLX, our first fine jewelry collection, and just this week, we introduced a new luxury denim offering. 
Ralph Lauren denim is an entirely new lifestyle expression for us and new terrain for the women's designer-level merchandise. As Ralph's incredible vision is translated into new product ideas and lifestyle sensibilities, we were able to find incremental distribution opportunities to showcase the product. It not only makes us even more relevant to our existing customers but also allows us to appeal to new customers. This is especially important as we grow our international presence since many of the regions of the world don't yet appreciate all we have to offer.
Given the diversity of our lifestyle labels and the complexity of our distribution around the world, we are careful to develop discrete product for discrete channels. As the businesses grown over the years and as we've come to more directly controlled various labels and product categories, the complexity of what we are executing has also increased. But with this greater control, we were able to more effectively leverage our in-house expertise in design, manufacturing and merchandising across the portfolio of lifestyle sensibilities and develop more impactful, strategic merchandising initiatives on an increasingly global scale.
This benefit of greater cohesion begins with the concept-design process, and runs all the way through to spectacular, customized in-store presentations that deliver a clear brand message to the customer. At the global luxury brand, the quality of our product and the consistency of our presentation is critical. And we invest considerable resources to ensure that Ralph's vision is properly executed. We do this for each and every one of our brands across the channel.
A recent and good example of this is our successful holiday tartan program, which Roger referenced, where we offered apparel, accessories and home products in a crisp, unified way that excited the customer over the holidays and ultimately drove strong sell-throughs. 
We've executed similar strategies with our various lifestyle sensibilities. In just a few short years, men's Black Label has evolved from tailored clothing and furnishings to now include a strong sportswear element and associated accessories. The launch of Ralph Lauren denim will be yet another extension of the Black Label sensibility for men. There's a similar story for the evolution of Purple Label, which now has an extremely compelling and fast-growing sportswear element to complement its core tailored clothing assortment.
In the department store arena, our Lauren brand has also evolved considerably. While Lauren has always been a fully realized lifestyle brand in its own right, with product offerings across career, polished casual and weekend sportswear, it also has its own successful sub-brands with Lauren Jeans Co., Lauren Active and Lauren Home. 
Of course, we've recently introduced exciting new Lauren product categories with footwear, handbags and dresses. Each of which has its own range of lifestyle sensibilities and usage occasions for the brands to address. These products quickly benefit from a high-brand awareness and considerable distribution platform of the core existing Lauren business. 
Today, Lauren is primarily distributed in the United States, but we believe there is considerable global growth for it. We intend to expand European distribution, including layering in more of Lauren various lifestyle elements over the next few seasons. We managed all of these tremendous content with extraordinary discipline, how we source the product, plan the assortments, allocate the inventory and deliver the merchandise is equally important. 
This blend of art and science is absolutely critical to our success. Our precise execution and the consistent quality of the merchandise in terms of design and make are what enable us to elevate our brands and ultimately drive strong sell-through rates and profitability. The benefits don't accrue to our company, but also to our retail partners, which is why we continue to gain share. It is also why they are eager for us to continue to innovate.
When you consider the categories we have just dipped our toes in like accessories and denim, there are enormous global opportunities for us across all sensibilities in the world of Ralph Lauren. So as far as we've come, with all we've done, we still have a long way to go, which is really exciting for us. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."

As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow through to profit growth. Consolidated",1957,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow through to profit growth. 
Consolidated net revenues in the third quarter were $1.5 billion, a 24% increase from the prior year period with growth in both our Wholesale and Retail segments exceeding 20%. Solid performance of our core men's, women's and children's apparel was enhanced by incremental sales from our newly transitioned Asian operations and some favorable calendar shifts, which accounted for approximately 400 basis points of the consolidated sales increase.
Revenue growth exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the strength of our Retail segment, including considerable same-store sales growth at our directly operated stores at RalphLauren.com. Shipments to our global department store customers also exceeded our expectations this quarter. The net impact of foreign currency translation on our total reported revenue growth was negligible for the third quarter. 
The gross profit rate of 58.6% in the third quarter was 40 basis points above the prior year period, reflecting stronger full-priced sales that more than offset the initial impact of increasing cost of goods. Our comprehensive merchandising initiatives across all product categories and focused on our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce sites, supported the excellent full-price sell-throughs we experienced. The strengthening of the Japanese yen more than offset the magnitude of the unfavorable currency impact we experienced from the euro translation and that we anticipated when we spoke with you in November.
Expenses in the quarter included incremental costs associated with our Hong Kong operation as well as the South Korean pre-acquisition costs, our European e-commerce launch expenses, higher incentive compensation costs and global infrastructure to support cost. Despite these investment expenditures, we achieved 160 basis points of operating expense leverage, which was better than the modest leverage we had expected. The magnitude of the operating expense leverage in the quarter was another important contributor to our outperformance relative to our expectations.
Operating income of $246 million was 43% above the prior year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 200 basis points to 15.9% and reflecting improved profitability across all of our reporting segments. 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 52% to $168 million, and net income per diluted share rose 56% to $1.72. The lower effective tax rate of 29% compared to 33% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items that was partially offset by a greater proportion of earnings generated in higher-tax jurisdictions this fiscal year.
Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales rose 21% to $676 million, a result of double-digit shipment growth in both the United States and European markets. Third quarter wholesale operating income of $130 million was 21% greater than last year, and the wholesale operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 19.3%. Higher profit flow-through on the growth in shipment volumes and disciplined operational management of expenses were the primary drivers of improved wholesale operating income and margin rate, although they were somewhat offset by the first signs of cost of good inflation.
For our Retail group, our marketing and merchandising efforts substantially benefited our direct-to-consumer channel during the quarter. From the opening of our 888 Madison Avenue flagship store here in New York in October and the considerable response to it, to the strength of our global merchandising product lines for fall and holiday, to our visual presentation, both in-store and online of the brand, which seem to resonate with consumers globally. 
Our customer traffic at Retail continued to build throughout the quarter. As a result, strong comparable store sales grow, the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from our newly assumed stores and concession shops in Asia drove third quarter revenue up 29% to $822 million.
Our overall comp store sales increased 15% during the quarter, reflecting 7% growth at Ralph Lauren stores and concession shops, a 15% increase at global factory stores and 12% growth at Club Monaco stores. Improved traffic and improved conversion trends, in addition to increased full-price selling, were all key drivers of comp growth. It is encouraging for all of us to see a broad range of key performance indicators delivering in a retail environment that was still fairly unpredictable and promotional in the quarter.
In the U.S., stores in key tourist destinations like New York, California, Dallas and Florida, have rebounded and are outperforming the average comp trend. Club Monaco continues to benefit from compelling women's fashion assortments and the Men's business also gained some momentum during the quarter. 
RalphLauren.com's spectacular 33% sales growth was also supported by higher traffic to the site and improved conversion, with accessories and children's wear registering the greatest sales gains on the site. Even as consumers are shopping more online, the momentum at RalphLauren.com, combined with the solid comp growth at our brick-and-mortar stores and our strength at wholesale, suggest we are providing a compelling customer experience and desirable product assortments and therefore, capturing a higher share of wallet across all channels and formats.
We opened 14 directly operated freestanding stores and closed five directly operated freestanding stores during the quarter, ending the period with 376 company-operated stores. We also operated 520 concession shop locations worldwide at the end of the third quarter. 
Included in these store counts are four directly operated stores and 179 concession shop locations assumed in the transition of the formerly licensed South Korea operations, which occurred on January 1, 2011, the last day of our fiscal quarter, although we did not record any sales associated with the network during that period.
Retail segment operating income grew 52% to $153 million in the third quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 280 basis points to 18.6%. This is a new peak level of Retail segment profitability for the third quarter period. The considerable improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate were a result of strong comparable store sales growth, higher full-price sell-through rates across most retail concepts and disciplined operating management. 
Partially offsetting these gains were incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations and start-up costs for our international e-commerce efforts. Investments we've made in product development and presentation, product flow, sales training for our associates in marketing and advertising are also clearly supporting our improvement in sales productivity.
Licensing royalties grew 4% to $50 million in the third quarter, as higher domestic product licensing revenues more than offset lower international royalties due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations. Operating income for our Licensing segment increased 23% to $30 million, primarily as a result of lower net cost associated with the Asian transition. 
Our strong operating results are reflected in our solid financial condition. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in net cash. Consolidated inventories were up 28% from the prior year period on a reported basis, which includes the incremental inventory to support over 300 Asian concession shops and stores in the Hong Kong region and the newly transitioned South Korea network.
Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated comp inventory was up 19% from the comparable period last year. The remaining growth in inventory primarily reflects the investment to support our new and enhanced merchandising programs such as handbags, basic stock replenishment and our new European e-commerce site. 
In addition, we've taken proactive measures to avoid potential supply chain disruption in light of the timing of the lunar new year in Asia, which is February 3 through February 14, by receiving goods earlier. In fact, higher in-transit inventory accounted for about half of the total increase on a like-for-like basis. The inflationary impact of cost of goods also affected our ending inventory balance approximately 400 basis points.
Based on our third quarter sales results and our current perspective on our aggregate spring summer shipment schedule, we are comfortable with the currency of our inventory. We spent approximately $78 million on CapEx during the third quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. 
For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 20%, and our return on investment was 40% due to the continued strength of our free cash flow generation and with confidence in our strategic agenda. As we announced in our press release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program, bringing our aggregate current authorizations to approximately $719 million. 
In addition, the board has doubled the company's quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.20 per share from the current level of $0.10 per share. The board's actions enable us to enhance shareholder return even as we continue to invest in high-growth, high-margin opportunities. Our strong financial metrics were also recognized by Moody’s recently, who raised our corporate debt rating to A3 from Baa1 in January.
Our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 clearly showcased the considerable performance of our entire organization. That momentum has been enhanced by the growing contribution from emerging product categories and channels and our disciplined operational management. Collectively, these dynamics have helped to fund the investments we are making and will continue to make in Asia and offset the initial signs of cost of goods inflation. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are obviously raising our profit outlook for the full year.
In this morning's press release, we outlined our revised expectations for fiscal 2011, and I'd like to briefly review those with you now. For the full year period, we continue to expect revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate. Implicit in this outlook is an expectation for high single-digit growth in wholesale shipment and mid-teen growth for our Retail segment revenue. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect our full year operating margin rate to be approximately equal to fiscal 2010's level, which compares to our prior expectation of a 50 basis point decline.
Our outlook continues to imply both increased pressure from cost of goods inflation and exchange rate pressure in the fourth quarter, as well as dilution related to the initial transition of the South Korea operations. 
In addition, we have some calendar shift that impact the fourth quarter, most notably, the fiscal 2011 as a 52-week year versus fiscal 2010's 53 weeks and at the week between Christmas and new year, within our fiscal third quarter this year versus the fiscal fourth quarter last year. Collectively, we estimate these shifts to account for approximately 10 full basis points in sales growth and about 200 basis points in operating profit margin. 
We currently expect the fiscal 2011 tax rate of approximately 32%. Our year-to-date results affirmed the successful execution of our business strategies. We've demonstrated our ability to drive substantial profit flow-through on strong top line momentum, which speaks to the operational discipline of our team. We are proactive about pursuing market share opportunities and operational efficiencies as we consistently reinvest in the business to support our long-term strategic goal.
Second half calendar shifts aside, we continue to seek encouraging underlying demand trends for our products. This includes early reads on fall, holiday 2011 orders, which suggest we are strengthening our leadership position in our more developed merchandise categories and gaining traction with our newer product categories. Around the world, customers are voting for the Ralph Lauren brand and the compelling value proposition of our high-quality luxury products. This gives us further confidence to continue reinvesting for future growth. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that please?"

Clearly, you've all heard, read and know the extraordinary inflationary raw materials issue. Cotton for sure, but all other fibers, cashmere, wool, on and on and on are experiencing enormous increases. Some of that I think you have to recognize is coming off the low base post-recession, so the comparison is distorted. But even with that said, it's extraordinary by any measure. So with raw materials being the most important part of a garment's cost, it's having a meaningful impact on how we think and plan and organize ourselves with that beginning to come into play in the back half of this year as we've talked about before, moving gradually through spring and then really coming on in more of a spike for fall and beyond. So I think we're all trying to monitor and watch that regularly. The other piece of that is the manufacturing costs are rising as well. And so it's sort of a double whammy event that is impacting everybody. We have taken a very clear position that we will not alter the quality of our materials, our manufacturing, our findings, our trims, or really where we're making product at this point. The backbone we think of our brand equity is the extraordinary products we make, and we think they've always been fairly priced for what they are. So that won't change. Our ability, we believe, to responsibly increase our prices later in the year, are based on that brand equity, in our customers' belief that the products we provide represent not only extraordinary design but extraordinary value. So for us, our thoughts, as we head into fall and beyond, is to look at products, look at pricing by category, by region, and again, make a responsible adjustment that reflects the reality of cost of goods increases. And beyond the short-term impact of this, the question is, where is it going to go over the next two or three years? And quite frankly, at this point, nobody knows. So we have to be thoughtful about our expectation of how our consumers are going to react. And I don't think we'll really see a fair read on that until the fall. I think there will be selective price increases during the spring in the marketplace. We may get some modest read off of that. But I think, really, until we all get to fall of next year, we won't know whether the end consumer understands and accepts what will be a overall increase for most product categories. We just think with our brand, and our quality and the momentum we have, we've got to make responsible decisions about how we adjust our thinking on this."

When we built the plans for the year, we had anticipated, in our third quarter, in our fourth quarter, that cost of goods would be rising because we saw that coming. And we had made a decision not to adjust retail pricing for third and fourth quarter, and therefore, the plan was built on compression. And what you saw on the third quarter, and it's why we're somewhat looking at the back half of the year, the whole six months block of time, is our sell-throughs have been that much better. We are getting higher sell-throughs at full price, both in retail, online and our wholesale accounts worldwide. When that improved, full-price sell-through has mitigated the gradual cost of goods increases. So with the kind of sales momentum we've had and the sell-throughs we've had, we have, obviously, reported today strong margin improvement against that backdrop. And that's sort of what we're looking at for the go forward until we really get to the full impact of fall '11."

And I think it's on everybody's mind. The other piece, and then I'll answer your question more directly, is we've noticed the extraordinary impact that the Chinese customer has had on other parts of the world as they travel. So getting our brand properly established in China and Hong Kong and other major capitals, we think will not only improve that part of the world, but their impact on Europe or the United States because what we're observing in other luxury brands is the extraordinary power they're exhibiting to buy those products outside their home market. With that said, we've now completed the major part of putting together what was a very fragmented licensing strategy in Asia. And as we've talked about in the past, the bulk of our licensees internationally have focused on men's Blue Label sportswear. So the locations, the concessions, or street locations, or mall locations, were primarily positioned to maximize that particular merchandise class. And so as we look to elevate the brand, bring more of a luxury assortment, clearly, expand our women's and accessory and high-end Men's business. We've got to look at the portfolio of distribution points we have to see how they reflect against our go-forward position. Parallel to that, we are going to be aggressive in our desire to get the kind of locations. And it's really going to be more than a 24-month period, but it's going to be for a very long time period to get the kind of locations we think we need to properly position the brand. What's happening in China is clearly a major city growth in the Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong regions, but a lot of second and third tier cities are now beginning to gel and exhibiting the customer demand, and so we're going to have to look at those second and third tiers the same time we're looking at the primary cities for key locations. I also think it's clear to us that China, Hong Kong, is going to be more direct to customer, where a lot of the current network in Japan and Korea are concession shop in shops. So for us in China, more about the direct-to-customer through our own brick-and-mortar and ultimately, through e-commerce. We're going to have to move quickly to accelerate our strategy of e-commerce in that region because I think that will help overlay the brand positioning we're trying to achieve. So I tried to pepper my comments at the beginning with sequencing and thoughtfulness because I think this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set properly the most unique region in the world. And what we've learned in the United States and what we've learned in Europe, we're going to try to apply."

The strong market positioning we have in the key markets of Europe has continued. So England, France, Germany have all been very, very strong markets as well as the Scandinavian countries. Spain, which went through a difficult period in the recession has started to come back a bit. In Italy, it's been a little bit more difficult. And I would say that's the most challenged market there. Most of the distribution in Italy is through multi-brand specialty stores that I think they've struggled the most coming through the recession. So over time, I think Europe will continue to perform, but it's going to be with some ups and downs by country. And our ability to go direct to the customer is going to be critical, and that's why we're pleased with the early U.K. e-commerce results and excited about France and Germany coming online, and then we have a rollout plan after that for the rest of the countries. South Korea, while mostly department store driven and concession shop driven, is actually a more vibrant market right now than Japan by a lot. The organic growth in that market has been strong. They also have a much stronger Tourist business of Chinese. Most of that is an arbitrage on pricing because the price of luxury goods is South Korea are cheaper than they are in China. So many Chinese see a weekend shopping excursion into Seoul as a exciting to do. So the organic market, while developed as you said, is continuing to grow and is getting a healthier tourist play than the markets in Japan."

One is just the acquisition costs related to the transaction. So we certainly incurred some fees related to the transition of the business from licensed to owned, whether it be legal fees or other fees associated with that, some incremental people cost as we added people to the business from a transition standpoint. And then, we did pay about $47 million to Doosan for the business. And that was a combination of the inventory that was transferred over the fixed assets, the net book value of the fixed assets that we acquired in the transition and other considerations. So the amortization of all that from a purchase accounting standpoint is what's somewhat included in the dilution and that is impacting the fourth quarter. The other part of the fourth quarter and we had the same experience with Dickson from a transition standpoint, when we transitioned our license, often times, the transition leaves us with life fall inventory. And we have the same experience in Korea, so we are a bit light on our fall clearance inventory that we would normally be selling this time of the year in January and February. We certainly have spring inventory from a selling standpoint. So the first couple of months of sale will be a bit light. But we expect that to certainly catch up in the second quarter as well. So all of those things are factored into the dilution. It's really a onetime dilution impact related to the transition of the business"

We thought we had aggressive plans, and we exceeded those. I think any local customer who watch the store go up for many, many years, as you all know, and was curious what we have done to their neighborhood came in and was overwhelmed with the presentation of the world of Ralph Lauren as well as the tourist customer. So both stores, the men's store and the women's and home stores, recorded extraordinary November, December performances. And really, the high end and the best products are what we sold the most of. The combination of the presentation, the merchandise and the extraordinary service levels that those stores provide, had us registering average sales checks more than 100% larger than in prior holiday seasons in those locations. So it was a combination of foot traffic and conversion. But really, the higher-priced products that we were converting to sales was extraordinary. The accessory presentations on the main floor is really Ralph's vision for the future. And for us to take an entire main floor and make it accessories, when this store was in the planning stage years ago, it was a bold commitment to our ability to develop the right handbags, accessories, footwear and, of course, jewelry and watches. And we saw a strong customer reaction to all of that. Our challenge now will be to take that layering and representation of accessories and roll it out to more of our existing fleet as well as distorting new stores. As many of you know, our model in the past, where we had a lifestyle store was of the main floor. The second floor was men's, and then you hit a third floor, maybe that was women's and maybe a fourth that was home. So we always had strong men's representation. But the Women's business, the Women's Accessory businesses, never got the real estate they deserved. This is really a stake in the ground and the customer reaction has been not only exciting, but reinforces that strategy. So new stores in Asia, new stores in Europe and our portfolio in the U.S. will be viewed with an eye towards that kind of distortion level."

Through the first nine months, they continue to registers strong double-digit performance. Much of that has been on extraordinary women's performance. So on a marketplace where women's has not been as bouyant over the last 12 months, Club Monaco has really struck a chord with their customer. And I think, if you've been in the store, their fashion look, the fit and the quality are all resonating with that customer. We're also getting strong performance from our large network of stores in Asia with the same products. So today, Club Monaco in the United States and Club Monaco in Asia has the same kind of products, and it is resonating very well. Additionally, this holiday season, we saw men's come on. So where men's was lagging a bit, it really picked up momentum into the holiday season, and we're pleased with the way that product is performing. So we're sticking our toe in Europe this month with a unique partnership with Brown's, and we are partnering with our European management to bring Club Monaco properly to Europe over time. And I think we'll hear more about that strategy as it unfolds. We regularly have European coming into the United States asking us to bring Club Monaco and its sensibility to Europe. And we think that's a real opportunity as well. The third leg of that stool will obviously be to get Club Monaco from a commerce point of view online and not just informational. We think that there will be a high demand, and we're working with our in-house e-commerce team to make sure we're properly positioning them to participate in that part of the growth. So for us, it's international, not dissimilar to the Ralph Lauren strategy, direct to customer through e-commerce. And I think as we've now seen the product consistency and the customer reaction, we feel more comfortable with our response, which is a more integrated growth strategy. So that, I think, will be an important part of our success going forward. So with that, I know we've run a little long. We apologize, we started a little late. It's been a extraordinary quarter and nine months. Hopefully, some of the noise and shifts between quarter, we've tried to explain. But in the end, I think we're tracking to a year that is in excess of where we started at the beginning for all the right reasons. And we're obviously very excited about the new growth opportunities by product category that Jacki talked about were obviously the whole Asia-Pacific region, which we'll continue to talk about the never call.

We're pleased to be reporting excellent third quarter results today. Consolidated sales rose 24%, including 15% comp store growth at our directly operated retail stores and concession shops and a 21% increase",1537,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting excellent third quarter results today. 
Consolidated sales rose 24%, including 15% comp store growth at our directly operated retail stores and concession shops and a 21% increase in our wholesale shipments. All regions of the world contributed to this strong performance. Most of the growth was fueled by the incredible appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand in our core men's, women's and children's apparel products.
Emerging products and regions also continued to contribute, but the real momentum in the quarter came from the strength of our core, where customers are responding to the high-quality and compelling value of our merchandise across channels. We are clearly picking up substantial market share, particularly in the United States and in Europe.
Simply put, we had a superb holiday season. We offered exceptional merchandise across all lifestyle sensibilities, from our most luxurious products in our Ralph Lauren stores to our aspirational assortments in our department stores worldwide. 
The strength of our merchandise was supported by world-class advertising and marketing efforts. Our innovative 4D light show alone has delivered more than $600 million media impressions worldwide since the event took place. And at point of sale, our product was showcased with spectacular in-store presentations. 
The holiday windows at our stores around the world are a destination. And we have strong placement in leading department stores as well, including our exclusive holiday tartan program at Macy's. We invest considerable resources in our creative presentations and field teams to ensure we are delivering the most compelling customer experience we can. These teams are tireless and a competitive advantage for us. 
We are effectively monetizing our top line momentum as you can see in our profit metrics. Operating profits increased 43%, and diluted EPS rose 56% for the quarter. The clarity of our brand message drove highly profitable sell-throughs, and we'd leverage this even as we incurred incremental investments in our growth initiatives. The disciplined execution of our global teams delivered results that were better than we planned for but entirely consistent with our strategies. So on behalf of Ralph and myself, I want to congratulate and thank our employees for a job well done.
We made important progress on each of our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter. On January 1, we successfully transitioned our former licensed South Korean operations to directly controlled operations. As a result, we welcome 200 new associates to the Polo Ralph Lauren family, add more stores and 179 concession shops to our global distribution network. 
As you know, we’ve progressively assumed direct control of our distribution through Asia, beginning with Japan in fiscal 2008, most of the rest of Asia in fiscal 2010 and South Korea in January. Collectively, this region of the world is currently comprised of 44 directly operated stores and 503 concession shops. This primarily represents the former licensees’ distribution strategy.
With the transition of South Korea, we have now completed an important first phase of our broader Asia strategy that is expected to transform our company over the long term. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to custom build this region in a manner that is aligned with our global luxury image and strategies, so we intend to be deliberate with the sequencing of our efforts. We have new leadership in place and a team that is incredibly energized and focused on driving the next phase of our Asia strategy, which will be more focused on refining and expanding the distribution and building customer awareness.
For more than 30 years, the entire region has been built primarily around men's sportswear. Most of you are well aware that the breadth of our product assortment in more developed markets such as the United States and Europe is far more expansive. 
So far, we have found that the more we elevate our stores and the merchandise mix, the stronger the customer response. So over the next several years, we intend to intensify the exposure of our premium brands and showcase the breadth of our lifestyle offerings. 
We see a particularly compelling opportunity with our accessory products, handbags, small leather goods, watches and jewelry included. Customer receptivity to these product categories will be very important for our success in the region.
As you can imagine, it takes a fair amount of time for us to execute our plans, Japan and South Korea and what I'll call China territories, are each at different stages of development for us. And it takes time to understand the varying taste and preferences of our customers throughout this region. We are simultaneously looking for ways to maximize operational efficiencies throughout the region. This is easiest to do with our corporate shared services and creative teams, but we are also exploring synergies with inventory management and merchandising initiative, again, recognizing there are often substantial differences between countries.
We've made good progress in Japan in a relatively short period of time and despite extremely unfavorable market conditions. But we're still far away from where we want to be. And in the China territories, we're beginning to see improvement in our sale velocity as we become more astute with our planning and tiering of merchandise, especially as customers are exposed to our more premium labels and products.
In South Korea, much of our first year will be spent on gradually normalizing inventory levels, which are exceptionally lean today. Renovating shops are important as well as implementing a target-door strategy to test our more elevated merchandising strategies.
The Asian customer is driving a large part of the growth in the luxury market, both at home and abroad. They have a sophisticated appreciation for quality, craftsmanship and the integrity of design. These qualities lie at the core of our company, and it's all that we do and think about. When we are dealing with this level of customer, our products really shine. 
Given the relatively modest scope of our existing Asia business, we are confident there's a considerable opportunity for us there. With $1.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are obviously not constrained by capital to pursue our goals. And we will commit more of our resources to develop the region and realize the returns we believe are achievable, but with a deliberate pace of growth, which needs to be measured to ensure we are executing with the highest standards we require and that we've achieved in the rest of the world. This long tail to our growth aspirations is the right thing to do.
We’ve successfully executed a similar strategy in Europe, a region that is an important contributor to our strong financial results and continues to offer considerable growth for us. Year-to-date, European sales and profits have grown at a double-digit pace reflecting excellent productivity gains in our core apparel categories. We have a lot more terrain to explore in Europe both in terms of incremental distribution and leveraging our full range of lifestyle sensibilities and product categories.
Our focus on expanding our direct-to-customer reach is also contributing to sales and profit growth. Our spectacular new Madison Avenue flagship stores are performing well ahead of plan as are most of the flagships worldwide. We're also driving better productivity in our existing stores. 
Over the last several years, we've expanded our Retail segment operating profit margin significantly. I believe that consistent investment we've made to create the world's most fantastic shopping environments, enhanced customer service experiences has supported this profit expansion. It enables us to capture our customer in a more meaningful way as we showcase the world of Ralph Lauren and immerse them in all that we have to offer.
The growing acceptance of our accessory products in our retail stores is very encouraging. As these products grow as a percent of our overall sales mix, they should enhance our retail productivity metrics further. More targeted and sophisticated marketing strategies are also contributing to our retail results. 
At our brick-and-mortar store, we've increased our focus on our most loyal and highest-spending customer on in-store events. Online, we developed more efficient search-optimization techniques and customer-engagement strategies and innovative events such as virtual fashion shows and other interactive merchantainment, which has proven to be very successful for us, both in terms of new customer acquisition and inspiring deeper loyalty from our existing customers. You can certainly see the impact on RalphLauren.com as we continue to go from strength to strength, registering a 33% increase in sales during the prior quarter. 
And consistent with our strategy to distort resources to high-growth, high-margin opportunities, last week we launched the first phase of the next generation of RalphLauren.com in the United States. The site features a new look with enhanced product presentation and improved customer experience. I encourage you all to check it out along with our new spring collections. 
And momentum is building at our new U.K. e-commerce site, where traffic is improving weekly, and we're experiencing strong conversion rates. We're on track to launch e-commerce in France and Germany next summer, and we continue to explore Asian e-commerce opportunities.
At this point, I'd like to have Jacki Nemerov expand a bit more on our product development strategies that she has day-to-day oversight of them."

There is no question that the momentum in our business around the world is fueled by the strength of our products. We are fortunate to be working with one of the world's most desirable brands, and we support this with an extraordinary investment in new merchandise development and product innovation. I believe it is a core competitive advantage for us.
With 43 years of experience as a company, we know our customers really well. And in that time, we've appropriately evolved to address their dynamic lifestyle needs. In this last year alone, we have introduced exciting new handbag collections, a broad and compelling activewear assortment with RLX, our first fine jewelry collection, and just this week, we introduced a new luxury denim offering. 
Ralph Lauren denim is an entirely new lifestyle expression for us and new terrain for the women's designer-level merchandise. As Ralph's incredible vision is translated into new product ideas and lifestyle sensibilities, we were able to find incremental distribution opportunities to showcase the product. It not only makes us even more relevant to our existing customers but also allows us to appeal to new customers. This is especially important as we grow our international presence since many of the regions of the world don't yet appreciate all we have to offer.
Given the diversity of our lifestyle labels and the complexity of our distribution around the world, we are careful to develop discrete product for discrete channels. As the business has grown over the years and as we've come to more directly control various labels and product categories, the complexity of what we are executing has also increased. But with this greater control, we were able to more effectively leverage our in-house expertise in design, manufacturing and merchandising across the portfolio of lifestyle sensibilities and develop more impactful, strategic merchandising initiatives on an increasingly global scale.
This benefit of greater cohesion begins with the concept-design process and runs all the way through to spectacular, customized in-store presentations that deliver a clear brand message to the customer. As a global luxury brand, the quality of our product and the consistency of our presentation is critical. And we invest considerable resources to ensure that Ralph's vision is properly executed. We do this for each and every one of our brands across the channels.
A recent and good example of this is our successful holiday tartan program, which Roger referenced, where we offered apparel, accessories and home products in a crisp, unified way that excited the customer over the holidays and ultimately drove strong sell-throughs. 
We've executed similar strategies with our various lifestyle sensibilities. In just a few short years, men's Black Label has evolved from tailored clothing and furnishings to now include a strong sportswear element and associated accessories. The launch of Ralph Lauren denim will be yet another extension of the Black Label sensibility for men. There's a similar story for the evolution of Purple Label, which now has an extremely compelling and fast-growing sportswear element to complement its core tailored clothing assortment.
In the department store arena, our Lauren brand has also evolved considerably. While Lauren has always been a fully realized lifestyle brand in its own right, with product offerings across career, polished casual and weekend sportswear, it also has its own successful sub-brands with Lauren Jeans Co., Lauren Active and Lauren Home. 
Of course, we've recently introduced exciting new Lauren product categories with footwear, handbags and dresses. Each of which has its own range of lifestyle sensibilities and usage occasions for the brand to address. These products quickly benefit from a high-brand awareness and considerable distribution platform of the core existing Lauren business. 
Today, Lauren is primarily distributed in the United States, but we believe there is considerable global growth for it. We intend to expand European distribution, including layering in more of Lauren’s various lifestyle elements over the next few seasons. We manage all of this tremendous content with extraordinary discipline. How we source the product, plan the assortments, allocate the inventory and deliver the merchandise is equally important. 
This blend of art and science is absolutely critical to our success. Our precise execution and the consistent quality of the merchandise in terms of design and make are what enable us to elevate our brands and ultimately drive strong sell-through rates and profitability. The benefits don't only accrue to our company, but also to our retail partners, which is why we continue to gain share. It is also why they are eager for us to continue to innovate.
When you consider the categories we have just dipped our toes in like accessories and denim, there are enormous global opportunities for us across all sensibilities in the world of Ralph Lauren. So as far as we've come, with all we've done, we still have a long way to go, which is really exciting for us. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,118548721,100977,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow-through to profit growth. Consolidated",1955,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects exceptionally strong top line momentum and even more robust flow-through to profit growth. 
Consolidated net revenues in the third quarter were $1.5 billion, a 24% increase from the prior year period with growth in both our Wholesale and Retail segments exceeding 20%. Solid performance of our core men's, women's and children's apparel was enhanced by incremental sales from our newly transitioned Asian operations and some favorable calendar shifts, which accounted for approximately 400 basis points of the consolidated sales increase.
Revenue growth exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the strength of our Retail segment, including considerable same-store sales growth at our directly operated stores at RalphLauren.com. Shipments to our global department store customers also exceeded our expectations this quarter. The net impact of foreign currency translation on our total reported revenue growth was negligible for the third quarter. 
The gross profit rate of 58.6% in the third quarter was 40 basis points above the prior year period, reflecting stronger full-priced sales that more than offset the initial impact of increasing cost of goods. Our comprehensive merchandising initiatives across all product categories and focused on our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce sites, supported the excellent full-price sell-throughs we experienced. The strengthening of the Japanese yen more than offset the magnitude of the unfavorable currency impact we experienced from the euro translation and that we anticipated when we spoke with you in November.
Expenses in the quarter included incremental costs associated with our Hong Kong operation as well as the South Korean pre-acquisition costs, our European e-commerce launch expenses, higher incentive compensation costs and global infrastructure support cost. Despite these investment expenditures, we achieved 160 basis points of operating expense leverage, which was better than the modest leverage we had expected. The magnitude of the operating expense leverage in the quarter was another important contributor to our outperformance relative to our expectations.
Operating income of $246 million was 43% above the prior year period. Our operating margin also showed considerable improvement, expanding 200 basis points to 15.9% and reflecting improved profitability across all of our reporting segments. 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 52% to $168 million, and net income per diluted share rose 56% to $1.72. The lower effective tax rate of 29% compared to 33% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items that was partially offset by a greater proportion of earnings generated in higher-tax jurisdictions this fiscal year.
Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment sales rose 21% to $676 million, a result of double-digit shipment growth in both the United States and European markets. Third quarter wholesale operating income of $130 million was 21% greater than last year, and the wholesale operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 19.3%. Higher profit flow-through on the growth in shipment volumes and disciplined operational management of expenses were the primary drivers of improved wholesale operating income and margin rate, although they were somewhat offset by the first signs of cost of goods inflation.
For our Retail group, our marketing and merchandising efforts substantially benefited our direct-to-consumer channel during the quarter. From the opening of our 888 Madison Avenue flagship store here in New York in October and the considerable response to it, to the strength of our global merchandising product lines for fall and holiday, to our visual presentation, both in-store and online of the brand, which seem to resonate with consumers globally, our customer traffic at Retail continued to build throughout the quarter. As a result, strong comparable store sales growth, the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from our newly assumed stores and concession shops in Asia drove third quarter revenue up 29% to $822 million.
Our overall comp store sales increased 15% during the quarter, reflecting 7% growth at Ralph Lauren stores and concession shops, a 15% increase at global factory stores and 12% growth at Club Monaco stores. Improved traffic and improved conversion trends, in addition to increased full-price selling, were all key drivers of comp growth. It is encouraging for all of us to see a broad range of key performance indicators delivering in a retail environment that was still fairly unpredictable and promotional in the quarter.
In the U.S., stores in key tourist destinations like New York, California, Dallas and Florida, have rebounded and are outperforming the average comp trend. Club Monaco continues to benefit from compelling women's fashion assortments and the Men's business also gained some momentum during the quarter. 
RalphLauren.com's spectacular 33% sales growth was also supported by higher traffic to the site and improved conversion, with accessories and children's wear registering the greatest sales gains on the site. Even as consumers are shopping more online, the momentum at RalphLauren.com, combined with the solid comp growth at our brick-and-mortar stores and our strength at wholesale, suggest we are providing a compelling customer experience and desirable product assortments and, therefore, capturing a higher share of wallet across all channels and formats.
We opened 14 directly operated freestanding stores and closed five directly operated freestanding stores during the quarter, ending the period with 376 company-operated stores. We also operated 520 concession shop locations worldwide at the end of the third quarter. 
Included in these store counts are four directly operated stores and 179 concession shop locations assumed in the transition of the formerly licensed South Korea operations, which occurred on January 1, 2011, the last day of our fiscal quarter, although we did not record any sales associated with the network during that period.
Retail segment operating income grew 52% to $153 million in the third quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 280 basis points to 18.6%. This is a new peak level of Retail segment profitability for the third quarter period. The considerable improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate were a result of strong comparable store sales growth, higher full-price sell-through rates across most retail concepts and disciplined operating management. 
Partially offsetting these gains were incremental expenses related to our newly assumed Asian operations and start-up costs for our international e-commerce efforts. Investments we've made in product development and presentation, product flow, sales training for our associates in marketing and advertising are also clearly supporting our improvement in sales productivity.
Licensing royalties grew 4% to $50 million in the third quarter, as higher domestic product licensing revenues more than offset lower international royalties due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations. Operating income for our Licensing segment increased 23% to $30 million, primarily as a result of lower net cost associated with the Asian transition. 
Our strong operating results are reflected in our solid financial condition. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in net cash. Consolidated inventories were up 28% from the prior year period on a reported basis, which includes the incremental inventory to support over 300 Asian concession shops and stores in the Hong Kong region and the newly transitioned South Korea network.
Excluding the incremental Asian inventory, consolidated comp inventory was up 19% from the comparable period last year. The remaining growth in inventory primarily reflects the investment to support our new and enhanced merchandising programs such as handbags, basic stock replenishment and our new European e-commerce site. 
In addition, we've taken proactive measures to avoid potential supply chain disruption in light of the timing of the lunar New Year in Asia, which is February 3 through February 14, by receiving goods earlier. In fact, higher in-transit inventory accounted for about half of the total increase on a like-for-like basis. The inflationary impact of cost of goods also affected our ending inventory balance approximately 400 basis points.
Based on our third quarter sales results and our current perspective on our aggregate spring/summer shipment schedule, we are comfortable with the currency of our inventory. We spent approximately $78 million on CapEx during the third quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. 
For the last 12 months, our return on equity was 20%, and our return on investment was 40% due to the continued strength of our free cash flow generation and with confidence in our strategic agenda. As we announced in our press release this morning, our board of directors has authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program, bringing our aggregate current authorizations to approximately $719 million. 
In addition, the board has doubled the company's quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.20 per share from the current level of $0.10 per share. The board's actions enable us to enhance shareholder return even as we continue to invest in high-growth, high-margin opportunities. Our strong financial metrics were also recognized by Moody’s recently, who raised our corporate debt rating to A3 from BAA1 in January.
Our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 clearly showcase the considerable performance of our entire organization. That momentum has been enhanced by the growing contribution from emerging product categories and channels and our disciplined operational management. Collectively, these dynamics have helped to fund the investments we are making and will continue to make in Asia and offset the initial signs of cost of goods inflation. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are obviously raising our profit outlook for the full year.
In this morning's press release, we outlined our revised expectations for fiscal 2011, and I'd like to briefly review those with you now. For the full year period, we continue to expect revenues to increase at a low-double digit rate. Implicit in this outlook is an expectation for high-single digit growth in wholesale shipment and mid-teen growth for our Retail segment revenue. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect our full year operating margin rate to be approximately equal to fiscal 2010's level, which compares to our prior expectation of a 50 basis point decline.
Our outlook continues to imply both increased pressure from cost of goods inflation and exchange rate pressure in the fourth quarter, as well as dilution related to the initial transition of the South Korea operations. 
In addition, we have some calendar shifts that impact the fourth quarter, most notably, that fiscal 2011 is a 52-week year versus fiscal 2010's 53 weeks and that the week between Christmas and New Year was in our fiscal third quarter this year versus the fiscal fourth quarter last year. Collectively, we estimate these shifts to account for approximately 10 full basis points in sales growth and about 200 basis points in operating profit margin. 
We currently expect a fiscal 2011 tax rate of approximately 32%. Our year-to-date results affirm the successful execution of our business strategies. We've demonstrated our ability to drive substantial profit flow-through on strong top line momentum, which speaks to the operational discipline of our team. We are proactive about pursuing market share opportunities and operational efficiencies as we consistently reinvest in the business to support our long-term strategic goal.
Second half calendar shifts aside, we continue to seek encouraging underlying demand trends for our products. This includes early reads on fall, holiday 2011 orders, which suggest we are strengthening our leadership position in our more developed merchandise categories and gaining traction with our newer product categories. Around the world, customers are voting for the Ralph Lauren brand and the compelling value proposition of our high-quality luxury products. This gives us further confidence to continue reinvesting for future growth. 
And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that please?"

Clearly, you've all heard, read and know the extraordinary inflationary raw materials issue. Cotton for sure, but all other fibers, cashmere, wool, on and on and on are experiencing enormous increases. Some of that I think you have to recognize is coming off the low base post-recession, so the comparison is distorted. But even with that said, it's extraordinary by any measure. So with raw materials being the most important part of a garment's cost, it's having a meaningful impact on how we think and plan and organize ourselves with that beginning to come into play in the back half of this year as we've talked about before, moving gradually through spring and then really coming on in more of a spike for fall and beyond. So I think we're all trying to monitor and watch that regularly. The other piece of that is the manufacturing costs are rising as well. And so it's sort of a double whammy of that, that is impacting everybody. We have taken a very clear position that we will not alter the quality of our materials, our manufacturing, our findings, our trims, or really where we're making product at this point. The backbone we think of our brand equity is the extraordinary products we make, and we think they've always been fairly priced for what they are. So that won't change. Our ability, we believe, to responsibly increase our prices later in the year, are based on that brand equity and our customers' belief that the products we provide represent not only extraordinary design but extraordinary value. So for us, our thoughts, as we head into fall and beyond, is to look at products, look at pricing by category, by region, and again, make a responsible adjustment that reflects the reality of cost of goods increases. And beyond the short-term impact of this, the question is, where is it going to go over the next two or three years? And quite frankly, at this point, nobody knows. So we have to be thoughtful about our expectation of how our consumers are going to react. And I don't think we'll really see a fair read on that until the fall. I think there will be selective price increases during the spring in the marketplace. We may get some modest read off of that. But I think, really, until we all get to fall of next year, we won't know whether the end consumer understands and accepts what will be a overall increase for most product categories. We just think with our brand, and our quality and the momentum we have, we've got to make responsible decisions about how we adjust our thinking on this."

When we built the plans for the year, we had anticipated, in our third quarter, in our fourth quarter, that cost of goods would be rising because we saw that coming. And we had made a decision not to adjust retail pricing for third and fourth quarter, and therefore, the plan was built on compression. And what you saw in the third quarter, and it's why we're somewhat looking at the back half of the year, the whole six-month block of time, is our sell-throughs have been that much better. We are getting higher sell-throughs at full price, both in retail, online and our wholesale accounts worldwide, and that improved full-price sell-through has mitigated the gradual cost of goods increases. So with the kind of sales momentum we've had and the sell-throughs we've had, we have, obviously, reported today strong margin improvement against that backdrop. And that's sort of what we're looking at for the go-forward until we really get to the full impact of fall '11."

And I think it's on everybody's mind.

And I think it's on everybody's mind. The other piece, and then I'll answer your question more directly, is we've noticed the extraordinary impact that the Chinese customer has had on other parts of the world as they travel. So getting our brand properly established in China and Hong Kong and other major capitals, we think will not only improve that part of the world, but their impact on Europe or the United States because what we're observing in other luxury brands is the extraordinary power they're exhibiting to buy those products outside their home market. With that said, we've now completed the major part of putting together what was a very fragmented licensing strategy in Asia. And as we've talked about in the past, the bulk of our licensees internationally have focused on men's Blue Label sportswear. So the locations, the concessions, or street locations, or mall locations, were primarily positioned to maximize that particular merchandise class. And so as we look to elevate the brand, bring more of a luxury assortment, clearly expand our women's and accessory and high-end Men's business, we've got to look at the portfolio of distribution points we have to see how they reflect against our go-forward position. Parallel to that, we are going to be aggressive in our desire to get the kind of locations -- and it's really going to be more than a 24-month period, but it's going to be for a very long time period -- to get the kind of locations we think we need to properly position the brand. What's happening in China is clearly major city growth in the Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong regions, but a lot of second and third tier cities are now beginning to gel and exhibiting the customer demand, and so we're going to have to look at those second and third tiers the same time we're looking at the primary cities for key locations. I also think it's clear to us that China, Hong Kong, is going to be more direct to customer, where a lot of the current network in Japan and Korea are concession shop in shops. So for us in China, more about the direct-to-customer through our own brick-and-mortar and ultimately, through e-commerce. We're going to have to move quickly to accelerate our strategy of e-commerce in that region because I think that will help overlay the brand positioning we're trying to achieve. So I tried to pepper my comments at the beginning with sequencing and thoughtfulness because I think this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set properly the most unique region in the world. And what we've learned in the United States and what we've learned in Europe, we're going to try to apply."

The strong market positioning we have in the key markets of Europe has continued. So England, France, Germany have all been very, very strong markets as well as the Scandinavian countries. Spain, which went through a difficult period in the recession has started to come back a bit. And Italy has been a little bit more difficult, and I would say that's the most challenged market there. Most of the distribution in Italy is through multi-brand specialty stores and I think they've struggled the most coming through the recession. So over time, I think Europe will continue to perform, but it's going to be with some ups and downs by country. And our ability to go direct to the customer is going to be critical, and that's why we're pleased with the early U.K. e-commerce results and excited about France and Germany coming online, and then we have a rollout plan after that for the rest of the countries. South Korea, while mostly department store driven and concession shop driven, is actually a more vibrant market right now than Japan by a lot. The organic growth in that market has been strong. They also have a much stronger Tourist business of Chinese. Most of that is an arbitrage on pricing because the price of luxury goods in South Korea are cheaper than they are in China. So many Chinese see a weekend shopping excursion to Seoul as a exciting thing to do. So the organic market, while developed as you said, is continuing to grow and is getting a healthier tourist play than the markets in Japan."

One is just the acquisition costs related to the transaction. So we certainly incurred some fees related to the transition of the business from licensed to owned, whether it be legal fees or other fees associated with that, some incremental people cost as we added people to the business from a transition standpoint. And then, we did pay about $47 million to Doosan for the business. And that was a combination of the inventory that was transferred over the fixed assets, the net book value of the fixed assets that we acquired in the transition and other considerations. So the amortization of all of that from a purchase accounting standpoint is what's somewhat included in the dilution and that is impacting the fourth quarter. The other part of the fourth quarter and we had the same experience with Dickson from a transition standpoint, when we transition a license, oftentimes the transition leaves us with light fall inventory. And we had the same experience in Korea, so we are a bit light on our fall clearance inventory that we would normally be selling this time of year in January and February. We certainly have spring inventory from a selling standpoint. So the first couple of months of sale will be a bit light. But we expect that to certainly catch up in the second quarter as well. So all of those things are factored into the dilution. It's really a onetime dilution impact related to the transition of business."

We thought we had aggressive plans, and we exceeded those. I think any local customer who watched the store go up for many, many years, as you all know, and was curious what we have done to their neighborhood came in and was overwhelmed with the presentation of the world of Ralph Lauren as well as the tourist customer. So both stores, the men's store and the women's and home stores, recorded extraordinary November, December performances. And really, the high end and the best products are what we sold the most of. The combination of the presentation, the merchandise and the extraordinary service levels that those stores provide, had us registering average sales checks more than 100% larger than in prior holiday seasons in those locations. So it was a combination of foot traffic and conversion. But really, the higher-priced products that we were converting to sales was extraordinary. The accessory presentations on the main floor is really Ralph's vision for the future. And for us to take an entire main floor and make it accessories, when this store was in the planning stages years ago, was a bold commitment to our ability to develop the right handbags, accessories, footwear and, of course, jewelry and watches. And we saw a strong customer reaction to all of that. Our challenge now will be to take that layering and representation of accessories and roll it out to more of our existing fleet as well as distorting new stores. As many of you know, our model in the past, where we had a lifestyle store was the main floor or the second floor was men's, and then you hit a third floor, maybe that was women's and maybe a fourth that was home. So we always had strong men's representation. But the Women's business, the Women's Accessory businesses, never got the real estate it deserved. This is really a stake in the ground and the customer reaction has been not only exciting, but reinforces that strategy. So new stores in Asia, new stores in Europe and our portfolio in the U.S. will be viewed with an eye towards that kind of distortion level."

Much of that has been on an extraordinary women's performance. So in a marketplace where women's has not been as buoyant over the last 12 months, Club Monaco has really struck a chord with their customer. And I think, if you've been in the store, their fashion look, the fit and the quality are all resonating with that customer. We're also getting strong performance from our large network of stores in Asia with the same products. So today, Club Monaco in the United States and Club Monaco in Asia has the same kind of products, and it is resonating very well. Additionally, this holiday season, we saw men's come on. So where men's was lagging a bit, it really picked up momentum into the holiday season, and we're pleased with the way that product is performing. So we're sticking our toe in Europe this month with a unique partnership with Brown's, and we are partnering with our European management to bring Club Monaco properly to Europe over time. And I think we'll hear more about that strategy as it unfolds. We regularly have Europeans coming into the United States asking us to bring Club Monaco and its sensibility to Europe. And we think that's a real opportunity as well. The third leg of that stool will obviously be to get Club Monaco from a commerce point of view online and not just informational. We think that there will be a high demand, and we're working with our in-house e-commerce team to make sure we're properly positioning them to participate in that part of the growth. So for us, it's international, not dissimilar to the Ralph Lauren strategy, direct to customer through e-commerce. And I think as we've now seen the product consistency and the customer reaction, we feel more comfortable with our response, which is a more integrated growth strategy. So that, I think, will be an important part of our success going forward. So with that, I know we've run a little long. We apologize, we started a little late. It's been an extraordinary quarter and nine months. Hopefully, some of the noise and shifts between quarter, we've tried to explain. But in the end, I think we're tracking to a year that is in excess of where we started at the beginning for all the right reasons. And we're obviously very excited about the new growth opportunities by product category that Jacki talked about or obviously the whole Asia-Pacific region, which we'll continue to talk about on every call.

We're pleased to be reporting fourth quarter and fiscal '11 results that were much better than the expectations we articulated to you during the last year. We responded to a rapidly changing environment by pursuing additional market share opportunities and working to protect margins in the face of unprecedented inflationary pressures for our industry. At the same time, we made excellent progress on each of our strategic growth objectives and deliver the best operating results in our history, continuing the 5- and 10-year terms of double-digit sales and earnings growth and generating for the first time over $1 billion in EBITDA.
Tracey will provide more complete commentary on our financial performance later on, but I did want to highlight some of our key achievements. The 14% increase in annual revenues was double our original outlook, fueled by the excellent momentum of core apparel offerings, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe, where revenues rose at a double-digit rate. Diluted EPS growth of 22% was achieved after substantial reinvestment back in the businesses, including the startup of Southeast Asia and Greater China, the transition of South Korea and the development of international e-commerce. We also manage the initial cost of goods inflation in the second half of the year and the negative impact of several calendar and holiday shifts, including a 53rd week last year that had more than a distorted impact on our fourth quarter results.
And there were extraordinary items such as restructuring and store impairment charges and the disruption in Japan. The quality and consistency of our results, reflecting the clarity of our strategic focus and our ability to execute with excellence as we now have more direct control of our operations and key merchandising categories around the world. The strong results enabled us to enhance shareholder returns by repurchasing nearly $600 million of stock and doubling our quarterly dividend during the year.
I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the incredible spirit and resilience of the Japanese people, following the devastation caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami there. I'm pleased to report that all 1,500 of our Japanese employees were safe and accounted for within hours of the disasters and we continue to support them in their time of great need with various fundraising efforts. The long process of rebuilding is just beginning and will obviously have an impact on our fiscal '12 outlook for the region, but we are happy to see the nation on a path to recovery.
Moving back to the year, our operating results were achieved in a manner that was totally consistent with the key strategic initiatives that we've been executing against for the last several years, namely the elevating of our brand as we expand our international presence, the innovation of new merchandising categories, and extending our direct-to-customer reach. These objectives are supported by world-class advertising and marketing, the continued development of our leadership teams, investments and operational infrastructure and prudent financial management. Over the next 3 years, we intend to invest over $1 billion in total capital to continue advancing our strategic objectives.
About half of that will be allocated to new stores, concession shops and additional e-commerce development, all with an emphasis on international markets.
We made major strides at our international growth objectives during fiscal '11, assuming control of our distribution in South Korea during the fourth quarter and completing the last phase of our multi-year mission to bring our Asian operations in-house that began with Japan in 2007. The South Korea transition process, which includes the on-boarding of 200 employees, multiple systems integration was very smooth. After operating South Korea for 5 months now, we are encouraged by the early business trends, sales, growth profit margins operating expenses, all of which have been favorable to plan. We look forward to executing our growth strategies in this vibrant luxury market over the next several years. 
We also completed our first full year with additional control of our distribution in Southeast Asia and Greater China. We've learned a lot in the last year. First and foremost, we were pleased with the local customer acceptance of our luxury products, particularly our accessories. The new shops we've opened are performing well ahead of our expectations, primarily due to our more elevated merchandise mix, but also to more appropriate locations and adjacencies.
Our experience in the last 12 months has provided us with excellent clarity on our future brand positioning and real estate strategies in this important market. As we consider the modest size of our existing distribution network and assess our long-term outlook for the Greater China region, we believe we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reposition and upgrade our market presence. We intend to do this in a manner that is in sync with our existing global brand elevation strategies. The multi-year process will include more concentrated expansion of our elevated apparel and accessory products. Our real estate strategy will include flagship stores in key cities and more appropriate formats for additional points of distribution and secondary markets. Similar to the Hub and Spoke approach we've used in New York and London.
Over the next 12 months, we intend to exit approximately 65 points of distribution that do not support our global real estate and merchandising strategies in this market. We believe these accelerated actions will allow us to deliver a clearer brand message to this critical customer, one that is better aligned to our presence in the Rest of the World. The Chinese are poised to become the world's largest consumers of luxury goods and they are already driving a substantial portion of the industry growth outside of China as they travel around the world, which is why the consistency of our global presence is so important.
As we've indicated before, the playbook is similar to what we've accomplished in Europe, where our local team has meticulously positioned our brand over the last decade by educating the customer of the quality and value of our products. We've supported this with considerable investment and upgrading our distribution across the continent. Today, we have a well-balanced representation across a range of formats, including our own retail stores, e-commerce in the U.K., monobrand licensing stores, as well as department stores and specialty stores. Europe continues to yield excellent sales and profit growth for us. We expect sustained double-digit sales growth in this region over the next 3 years.
We believe we can achieve this ongoing growth with our core apparel merchandising that is accentuated by the introduction of new merchandise categories and brands, including Club Monaco into selected wholesale accounts this fall, the rollout of e-commerce to additional countries and new store growth. Our focus on brand elevation is perhaps most apparent with our direct-to-customer efforts. The investments we've made in our stores and in the growing of our e-commerce platform showcased our commitment to the global luxury customer. Our stories in the world's premier gateway cities typically at a mix of locals and tourists. Similar to our advertising and marketing efforts, they're important vehicles for us to reinforce the clarity and consistency of our brand expression. They also provide a halo for merchandise we sell across all distribution channels and set the stage for a long-term growth potential across lifestyle ranges and product categories. We will continue to grow our retail presence with a focus on the world's most dynamic markets.
Of the approximately $500 million in capital we intend to invest over the next 3 years for new stores, concession shops and the continues development of global e-commerce, nearly 70% of this capital will be allocated to international markets. Shortly, Jacki will be commenting on the progress we've made with key merchandise categories and some exciting new launches for fiscal '12. Our companies success obviously begins with the appeal of our products and that is why we continuously invest in merchandise innovation. The integrity of Ralph's design process and our high production quality standards is an important part of our heritage and our customers expect nothing less than the best from us. 
As we began navigating unprecedented cost-of-good inflation in the second half of fiscal '11, a bedrock principle for us was that we would not compromise the quality of our products with the continuity of our execution. We also determined not to make material pricing adjustments to our Spring Summer merchandise. We believe these decisions have supported our strong Spring sell-throughs and market share gains across channels.
As cost pressures intensify into fiscal '12, we made a thoughtful pricing adjustment by brand and region to help mitigate inflationary pressures. In general, these adjustments do not fully offset our higher costs and this is expected to have a negative impact on our fiscal '12 gross margin, particularly as we make large fall wholesale shipments in the second quarter. We are confident in the strength of our merchandising assortments and we believe our unwavering commitment to the integrity of our product and the value proposition will be a competitive advantage for us, but we will not know the full impact of our actions until the customer react to the new pricing in the fall.
Sitting here today, we enter fiscal '12 with excellent momentum in our business. We are accelerating growth where our market share is already strongest and we're investing in a emerging opportunities that we believe will offer the most compelling long-term shareholder value creation. It is a continuation of the strategy that has delivered consistent mid-teen sales growth and even better earnings growth over the last 5- and 10-year periods. We expect that momentum to be maintained as we assess our outlook over the next 3 years when investments we've made in fiscal '11 and the ones we plan to make in fiscal '12 bear fruit in fiscal '13 and beyond.
We believe will generate over $3.5 billion of EBITDA over the next 3 years, which is a testament to the high-quality growth we are pursuing. In recognition of our strong cash flow, yesterday, our board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. And with over $1 billion in cash and investments already on our balance sheets, we are confident we have the financial strength to pursue all of our growth aspirations and we are very excited about the future.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki."

We gained market share in most merchandise categories around the world. The double-digit growth we experienced in the U.S., Europe and Asia clearly demonstrates that customers not only responded to the compelling design and quality of our products, but also to our strategic merchandising initiatives, which enabled us to generate significant sales growth.
Our core business is performing exceedingly well across men's, women's and children's. The consistent upgrading of our in-store shops and visual presentation has been an important backdrop to support the momentum in various brands. Our ability to expand the bandwidth of each of our brands to address new lifestyle sensibilities has deepened our relevance with the customer who knows they can always count on Ralph Lauren for distinct high-quality merchandising in aspect of their life. Emerging categories, such as accessories, dresses, activewear and footwear, offer excellent examples of our ability to extend our brand into new classification success in a relatively short period of time. It has also allowed us to secure incremental distribution and floor space. We built a Lauren dress division from scratch just 3 years ago, hiring industry-leading talent to address an emerging category that was a natural extension for core Lauren sportswear business. Today, we are already among, if not the, better leading dress resource in the department store channel and we still have considerable growth before us, both in terms of expanded distribution and assortment.
We just added evening and special occasion dresses, as well as special sizes to our dress assortment. Footwear is a similar story, one that is equally compelling in both men's and women's. The breadth of our footwear assortment have expanded dramatically in the 4 years since we've acquired this business. In that time, we tripled the size of our wholesale shipment. Today, we are recognized as an important footwear resource, with the ability to sell at both specialty retail and department store environment in a manner that supports our overall brand's objectives.
We will continue to evolve the assortment into exciting new lifestyles sensibilities in fiscal 2012 including footwear that complements our Black Label and RLX brand. Up until now, our success in the category has been concentrated in the United States, where we continue to have door-growth opportunities. During fiscal '12, we intend to expand our Ralph Lauren footwear and add Polo and Lauren footwear into Europe, which is an exciting next step in the evolution of our overall accessory strategy. RalphLauren.com and international markets are expected to play a key role in our long-term development of this category.
Fiscal 2011 was a pivotal year for our handbag effort. While we have Ralph Lauren luxury products for the last few years, led by our iconic Ricky bag, fiscal '11 was the first year we really began to address the broader lifestyle opportunities. As a result, in luxury handbags, we now have compelling assortment of merchandise in the sweet spot that has historically been dominated by leading European brands. This spring, we have brought success in the handbag category and did extremely well with Ralph's iconic Western-inspired design, including the novaho blanket bags and the leather lace tots. Although Ralph Lauren handbags are now primarily available in our own retail stores and on RalphLauren.com, as the assortment grows, we believe we have an important opportunity to develop worldwide distribution for this product in leading specialty and department stores that currently feature our apparel merchandise.
Our first Lauren handbag collection was introduced last fall and we have experienced excellent progress to date. Momentum has accelerated as customers became more aware of the product and as we've expanded our merchandise offering. We are very excited about the long-term global opportunity with Lauren handbags, which should evolve as we expand distribution over the next several years.
With both the Ralph Lauren and Lauren brands, we are steadily building a stable of iconic designs to further develop what we believe will be a very strong accessory platform.
With this much as we've accomplished in fiscal '11, we have several new merchandise opportunities in '12. The first is inspired by Ralph's long time love of denim, one of the most iconic staples of the American wardrobe. At the luxury level, we are launching Black Label denim for men, which will complement and extend our modern Black Label sensibility. And women's collection denim, which is a new luxury denim lifestyle offering that we feel is unique to the marketplace.
At the premium level, we are launching Ralph Lauren denim and supply, an exciting new brand that captures the heritage of denim with an edgy, Bohemian attitude that is distinctly Ralph Lauren and perfect for the young customer. The launch of Ralph Lauren denim and supply offers incremental distribution for us in North America, where the merchandise will be sold approximately 250 better department stores and on RalphLauren.com. Ralph Lauren denim and supply will replace the Polo jeans company brand in Europe and Asia and will essentially maintain the existing distribution network for those products.
The introduction of Ralph Lauren denim and supply is an important step in expanding our world of denim merchandising strategy. Fiscal '12 will also showcase a renewed focus on our Ralph Lauren and Lauren Home product merchandise categories. Over the last year, we've selectively taken more direct control of certain product including textile, which has been one of our largest licenses, while finding best-in-class partners for others. We opened a new distribution center in May for Lauren textiles to include bedding and bath products. Today, we have categories of furniture, bedding and bath, table cloths, tops, sliding, rugs, fabrics, wall covering, gifts and accessories. All the key classifications in home are in place to deliver an impactful and integrated lifestyle presentation for our customers, which we believe will support new growth opportunities.
For home, in fiscal '12, we intend to enhance distribution by partnering with our wholesale customers to showcase the products and implement strategic merchandising initiatives that appropriately tell the story of our collection. We already have a handful of flagship locations for each of our home products: 888 Madison Avenue in New York, our store in Greenwich, Connecticut and London for Ralph Lauren Home and Lauren Taylor in New York City for Lauren Home. We are also gaining traction with department stores and specialty stores in Europe.
So clearly, a lot accomplished in fiscal '11 with more opportunity in the future and with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."

As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent full year operating results in the fourth quarter, which despite the impact of meaningful calendar shifts that we described to you in our third quarter earni",2458,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent full year operating results in the fourth quarter, which despite the impact of meaningful calendar shifts that we described to you in our third quarter earnings call, exceeded our expectations given the continued momentum in our business. Incremental sales and profit within our Retail segment were the primary drivers of the upside, with all regions of the world contributing to the outperformance, although the heaviest concentration was achieved in the United States. 
Before I provide you with further insight into the fourth quarter's operational drivers, I do need to remind you of the nature of the calendar shifts we told you about in February that negatively affect comparisons with our prior year periods, impacts that will reflect in the guidance we previously provided you with the fourth quarter. Roger mentioned them as well and they do include an extra 53rd week that was in our results last year in the fourth quarter and a later Easter week this year that shifted that holiday sales growth into the first quarter of our fiscal 2012 versus the fourth quarter that we're reporting now.
Lastly, we also mention the timing of the high-volume sales week post-Christmas that fell within our third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. On a normalized calendar basis, we estimate that the shifts alone negatively affected our reported sales growth in the quarter by approximately 10 full percentage points.
Unless otherwise noted, my discussion of our fourth quarter business performance is based on our reported GAAP financial results, which reflect a 13-week period for fiscal 2011 and a 14-week period for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
On a reported basis, consolidated net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, 7% above the prior-year period and led by a double-digit gain in Retail segment sales. Our Retail performance was better than the expected in several areas, including same-store sales, the contribution from new stores and our performance in Asia, excluding Japan. We did not incur any meaningful impact from foreign currency translation on our consolidated fourth quarter sales as the strengthening of the Japanese yen was mostly offset by a modest weakening of the euro relative to last year.
The gross profit margin of 56.8% was essentially in line with our expectations. As we have communicated all year, we have incurred cost-of-good inflation for this year's Spring Summer season and we determined that we did not make any material changes to our pricing until the upcoming fall season. Some of the inflationary cost of goods pressure we experienced in the fourth quarter was offset by a higher level of full-price selling at most of our retail concepts and the seasonal variation in our overall channel mix.
Operating expenses of $693 million were 12% above the prior-year period and the operating expense margin rose 240 basis points to 48.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting incremental expenses associated with our newly transitioned South Korea operations that continued investment in our growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation costs.
Fourth quarter operating income of $117 million was 32% below the prior-year period, primarily due to the calendar shifts affecting the comparability with the prior-year period and the lower gross profit margin and higher expense rate I just discussed.
Net income was $73 million and net income per diluted share was $0.74 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter at 34.4% was approximately 250 basis points higher than the prior-year period as a greater proportion of our earnings were generated in higher tax jurisdictions.
Due to the timing of the natural disasters in Japan, which occurred in the latter part of our fiscal fourth quarter, the financial impact on our reported results was relatively modest at approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
Moving on to segment highlights. Wholesale segment sales rose 2% to $752 million in the fourth quarter as strong growth in U.S. Wholesale shipments, continued growth in department stores in Europe, as well as expanded distribution in Greater China, were mostly offset by a planned decline in Japanese Wholesale shipments and softness in some European specialty stores, most notably in Italy.
Wholesale operating income was $136 million in the fourth quarter, and the operating profit margin was 18.2% compared to 24.9% in the prior-year period. The decline in margin rate was primarily attributable to the cost of goods inflation, lower Japanese Wholesale shipments and continued investment in new merchandise categories.
The 14% increase in Retail segment sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 primarily reflects strong momentum at our factory stores worldwide and on RalphLauren.com, as well as the incremental contribution from newly transitioned South Korea operations. Overall, comparable store sales, which I'm referencing on a 13-week to 13-week basis, increased 7%, which was achieved on top of the 16% gain in the prior-year period and, of course, excludes the sales at the Asian stores and concession shops that we assumed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. These sales will be included in our costs beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as they are fully anniversaried.
The 3% decline in Ralph Lauren comps during the fourth quarter is entirely due to our Retail Japanese operation. Excluding Japan, Ralph Lauren comps were flat on top of the 17% increase in the prior-year period. Sales trends at our global flagship locations worldwide, many of which are not in our comp base, have been very strong, which is consistent with the rebound in sales of global luxury products. Factory store comps rose 8% in the fourth quarter, Club Monaco comps were up 10% with excellent performance in trend right women's fashion and sales of RalphLauren.com increased 21%.
Across all Retail formats, customers are responding to our compelling product content as Jacki mentioned and our focused merchandising strategies. Our strong third quarters sales provided us with a good start to full price spring selling in the fourth quarter. In the United States, high traffic urban locations and popular tourist destinations for both Ralph Lauren and factory store continue to post the strongest sales trends for us. We also achieved better conversion rates on higher traffic levels this quarter.
In Europe higher, unseasonably cold weather and several unrest in the Middle East negatively affected customer traffic across the continent all the trends improved meaningfully in the latter part of the period. Performance in our Greater China and South Korea concession shops was also better than anticipated during the quarter. Japan sales trended down approximately 30% in the weeks following the earthquake and tsunami, compared to relatively flat performance in the quarter to-date period prior to the disasters. Retail segment operating income of $26 million was 40% greater than the prior-year period and the operating margin improved 80 basis point to 4.1%.
Strong comp growth and higher full price sell-throughs more than offset the short-term diluted impact of South Korea, investment in international e-commerce, cost inflation and extraordinary items such as the business disruption in Japan.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $44 million, 6% below the prior-year period. Higher Fragrance Licensing revenues were more than offset by a decline in international licensing revenues related to the South Korea transition. We also have Lauren Home product licensing revenues as a result of some of the strategic changes that Jacki spoke to earlier. The 19% decline in Licensing operating income in the fourth quarter is attributable to the same international and home affects that impacted sales for Licensing.
Consolidated inventory was up 39% at the end of the fourth quarter on a reported basis. Approximately half of the increase in dollars is to support the anticipated sales growth and shipment cadence highlighted in our fiscal 2012 outlook. And a quarter of the increase is related to newly transitioned Asian operations within fiscal 2011. As you recall, we had unusually low inventory levels this time last year from the transition of the Southeast Asian and Greater China region and our South Korean inventory is entirely incremental this year versus last year. 
The remaining quarter of the increase is attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency dynamics. With a relatively flat inventory turn and near-term sales expectations in the first quarter, we remain comfortable with the content and currency of our inventory.
We spent approximately $255 million in capital expenditures during the fiscal 2011 to support our retail store and wholesale shop development worldwide, in addition to continued infrastructure investments. We also repurchased approximately 6 million shares of stock for an aggregate of $578 million during the year, including 2 million shares for $247 million during the fourth quarter. And as Roger mentioned yesterday, our board authorized an additional $500 million per share repurchase, bringing our total current authorizations to $976 million.
We ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash and investments after funding all of our capital and acquisition cost needs and returning a substantial amount of capital to shareholders via our share repurchase activity, as well as the doubling of the dividend. 
Fiscal 2011 was clearly a year of tremendous progress for advancing our strategic objective, while still growing earnings at a double-digit rate. And we are encouraged by the current momentum of our underlying business trend, even though we are mindful and experiencing intensifying inflationary dynamics that are beginning to broadly affect consumers. While we are currently benefiting from strong demand for our products across most channels and formats worldwide, we are increasingly impacted by the inflationary pressure on cost of goods as evidenced by our fourth quarter gross margin dynamics.
As most of you know, the cost of goods inflation we began to experience in the second half of fiscal 2011 intensifies in fiscal '12 with fall inventory receipts. 
Beginning this fall, as Roger indicated, we made what we believe are responsible, selective pricing adjustments to mitigate a portion of the impact. In general, we've determined not to pass on the full impact of our higher cost of goods and the magnitude of inflation is such that we do expect our gross profit margin and therefore our operating margin to be down in fiscal 2012. We believe that customer, the consumer, will accept some higher prices due to the strength of our brand and the consistent quality of our merchandise. But after a decade of apparel deflation, the actual customer reaction remains unknown until the merchandise is available for sale in the stores. 
We also remain committed to our strategy of investing in growth initiatives and infrastructure during fiscal 2012, including international retail expansion and e-commerce and continued systems enhancement. Sequencing these types of investments as we have in the past should help to drive profit growth in future years.
Now I'd like to briefly review our initial expectations for the year that we outlined in this morning's press release. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we currently expect consolidated net revenues the increase in the mid-20s range, a rate of growth that is an acceleration of the momentum we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2011 and is positively impacted by the benefit of the later Easter sales I highlighted earlier. Wholesale revenues are expected to increase at a low 20% rate based on strong shipment growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Retail segment sales are expected to grow slightly faster than Wholesale revenues, a function of low double-digit comparable store sales growth and the contribution from new stores and concession shops, inclusive of our incremental South Korean concession shops and stores. 
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately equivalent to the prior-year period, with the higher Retail mix offsetting the continued margin decline in Wholesale goods. We will also incur higher operating expenses related to the continued investment in our growth initiatives across geographies, distribution channel and emerging product categories. 
For the full fiscal 2012 period, we expect revenues to increase at a mid-teens rate with, with Retail segment sales again growing slightly faster than Wholesale revenues. Our full year operating margin is expected to decline 100 to 150 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit margin pressure I discussed earlier. We also continue to monitor our performance closely in Japan, post the unfortunate incident of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis. As the entire nation is obviously preoccupied with the safety and relief efforts, we currently expect the initial disruption and subsequent irregular shopping patterns in Japan to negatively impact our fiscal results, which is also reflected in our sales and margin guidance. 
We will also support our growth initiatives with advertising and marketing spending with new product introductions to generate more awareness for emerging product categories such as denim and to support our international expansion efforts. We have excluded any potential extraordinary charges that may result from our Greater China repositioning efforts. These charges could range from $10 million the $20 million depending on the timing of the closure. Our fiscal 2012 tax rate is planned at approximately 33% based on our forecasted in the mix and excluding any discrete items. We intend to spend approximately $325 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 to support our Retail and also growth initiatives and the consistent upgrading of our global infrastructure. We currently expect to open 47 -- 34 new stores and 47 concession shops during the year and close 65 stores and shops in the Greater China region as part of the repositioning that was discussed earlier by Roger. And much of our capital next year is dedicated to our international growth efforts, including continued expansion of Ralph's or read in the Asia Pacific region, the introduction of Rugby in Club Monaco sub-brands in Europe and the launch of denim and supply, which shops in leading department stores around the world. So we've communicated a lot to you this morning regarding our results in our plans for this year. We are clearly balancing multiple factors in our fiscal '12 outlook you go with the realities, the margin pressure as we execute our plan. Over the years, our team is demonstrated incredible agility when faced with a highly uncertain market environment and we expect the same to be true in fiscal 2012 as we navigate through the near-term impact of commodity inflation. Our ability to gain share and our largest market and expand merchandise categories is enabling us to build additional platforms for future growth and our financial strength and increasing cash generation prowess allow us to Fox contributed to invest in opportunities that will yield substantial future returns for our shareholders.

One, the fourth quarter is always the reported is a bit of a Haley's comet. The unusual combination of an extra week, the lost of Easter, the lost of the week after Christmas really is a bit of a falls read that I think Tracey tried to capture for you. If you take the run rate of sales through our third quarter, adjusted fourth quarter and the guidance we provided for first 41st quarter, you see that business is really is quite strong and really all merchandise categories, in all regions, in all channels are contributing to that. So we're actually encouraged with the customers' response to our products and strategies. We did not take many price increases in the spring, even though we began to see some cost rising but we have for fall. And those increases really are very dependent on the price point of the product and the merchandise categories. The actual cost of goods inflation depending on the products range from low- to mid-single-digit all the way up until the low-20s. And when you look at the breadth of product we have from the highest levels of collection and Purple Label, down to products we make for Chaps, for Cohl's end Penny's some of the bigger cost movements were in the lower portion of that pyramid and that's where we were more cautious about passing on the product as they came through. I also believe and this is one person's opinion, that the cost of goods that we've all seen and read and talk so much about will begin to moderate into spring and fall of next year. I think that the supply and demand imbalance was real and some of the other costs got run off for other reasons and I think the more natural supply and demand will begin to take effect as we look at next year. So our point of view has been, we're not going to alter the quality, we're not going to alter the materials trim, finding, or the cut of the product, we are not going to alter where we make goods because the principles of product and product integrity has been critical to our success we think the customers want the same product and are going to pay more for it, where appropriate. And I think this pig-in-a-python is going to play itself out over the next couple of seasons. We raised our gross margin in the last 7 years, 900 basis point. So I think we've become very expert at sourcing a logistics and distribution, merchandising and really felt that a short-term blip is not something to throw us off our strategic vision. So a lot of that is embedded in your question and I've expanded it in an effort to try to cover some of what I know is on all of your minds."

So we've had for years a lot of international retailers, knocking on the door, looking to get Club Monaco distributed in their market. We have partnered in Asia with the distribution experts. But in Europe, our European team really felt that they have the ability to distribute it to key retailers as a wholesale business, as well as looking at stand-alone store distribution. We had a test this February that started with Brown's in London that was extraordinarily successful. And we just think that product really appeals to an international customers. We see that in a lot of our New York stores, where we get a lot of tourists who are coming to buy product they can't get it in other parts of the world. We think Club Monaco represent an opportunity, not only in Asia where we are and we're growing successfully but in Europe. Rugby, we'll be opening our first store in Europe later this year in London. There again we have whether in the website. So whether here in stores in New York, we have tremendous reaction from customers. We opened a store in Japan last year as with number 2 store in volume in our network and so we think Europe represents opportunities and are looking for additional locations going forward with Rugby.

Well, the denim and supply business in Europe will replace the existing Polo Jeans company business, which, as you know, we decided to close in the U.S. about 4 years ago when we made that transition. It was a very different product in Europe and a much more elevated product for both Europe and Asia. And so what we decided to do over time and we've been working on this for quite awhile is develop a brand new statement in denim, with a very exciting Bohemian attitude, really driven to this younger customer and over time, we replace the Polo Jeans business. That will now take place for fall. So that will be the transition for Europe and Asia. The exciting part about the development of this brand is now we're planning a reintroduction in the U.S. of this vibrant category and it will be launched in about 250 stores in the U.S. and in Canada. And with prime locations in men's and women's with a very fresh impactful presentation. There will be strong marketing placed on it, really speaking to this young customer, our plan is to take a very unique style of marketing this product, really reaching this audience in a very unique way and our plans for what and exactly will be done will be developed and you'll see over the next couple of months. But it's something we're very excited about and so are the customers that we are participating with on this launch."

We have extraordinary growth in Europe and you see we are putting together and strong growth in Asia excluding issues in Japan for the moment. The only trouble is the U.S. keeps growing and without running our estimates. So while we keep growing internationally, we are growing equally fast domestically and I think as the Internet has added to the U.S. distribution pattern both our own and Wholesale as we keep launching new product categories like footwear, dresses, handbags, denim. The U.S. growth is equal to the extraordinary international growth. So I think as Tracey gave you some guidance for the first quarter and the full year, we are actually getting growth around the horn and I think one of the super surprises to us and perhaps to all of you was the strong core domestic Wholesale growth in the U.S. So I'm not sure how we are going to get to the third, third, third when the U.S. keeps growing but we'll try."

Each of those markets were run by a separate license group. So as we took that Japan, separate from China, Hong Kong, separate from Korea, it's one of those where the transition of a long-term licensed to our ownership and control. And the Japanese business and the South Korea business are really heavily driven by department stores shop in shops. And those marketplaces are heavily dominated by department stores shop-in-shops. Those businesses over many years had a focus of men's casual, Blue Label sportswear. And in Japan, where we've had control of the business longer, we've seen tremendous reaction from the customer as we've begun to elevate product in women's and in kids and in other product categories as we added visual enhancements and clarity as we sharpen our message, pretty earthquake and tsunami, we were beginning to see nice trends and in what overall it's a tough market and one of the guidance issues for '12 isn't that Japan is not beginning to show some recovery from that, but it was against what our run rates would have been prior to that. Korea, where in fact we've now had the business only for 5 months. We took on a terrific team of people that came with the acquisition, who really knew their products. And although the license a bit run down inventories as we got to the end of the license in December, so we started January at a low level as we've replenished inventory through the last 5 months. The customer there has responded and that market has responded to better products more elevated products and more fashion. But we feel very good about the long-term opportunity in Korea. Of course, many of you know that a lot of the business is in Seoul, Korea and a lot of that business is fueled by Chinese tourists, pricing and South Korea is less than it is in the mainland of China. So there is a healthy tourist component coming into Korea for shopping weekends. The year we've had China, Hong Kong and the rest of the Dixon portfolio has also been one that is a slightly different challenge because we had to build an organization from scratch. We had no history on the merchandise, we have no infrastructure, unlike the Japanese and Korea acquisition where we took on an existing team. We really had to build an organization from day 1 and get to know the stores and the territories. The other issue is that, that market will be dominated by stand-alone retail into the future. They're not really embedded into a department store-driven distribution channel. So our ability to identify and acquire key locations, both in major cities and more suburban malls will be a key to the market. We are clearly underdeveloped in women's, we're clearly underdeveloped in accessories and kids and I think our goal will be to elevate and refine the Men's business we have over time. The other thing I would just say so it doesn't get lost in small print of the script, the Chinese are traveling the world. In many of the low sure sub-brands the type top 2, talked powerfully about the impact of the Chinese tourists in there other international locations, like areas or London or Milan or Switzerland or go so we believe as we build up the proper presence and consistent with our global image in China, we will save those customers and the lift in our business in Europe, which we don't really get much of today. Is it's really a holistic approach to the Chinese customer, slightly different than the Japanese and Korean markets that we think is absolutely exciting for the medium term and long term for this company. Let's continue to take questions, in the were a little long because the end of the report was more robust it would but we'll keep fielding questions for another few minutes."

And every one of our licenses today's performance is up over last year. We've been working very closely on the content of that product. We've most recently added lightings and rugs and the market have gone extremely well for those categories and products.

Although quite frankly, the Chinese tourists today is the dominant influence in really the gateway cities. One of the interesting subjects that's not often reported is the difficulty that Chinese tourists have to get visas to visit in the United States. But today, many of the tourists that are traveling out of China are really going to Europe, while that's a wonderful trip and a wonderful experience, we'd love to get more of them into the United States. But nevertheless, where you see Hawaii or other Asian destinations for tourism, the Japanese tourist is being close to home. While I think it's going to be quarter-to-quarter update, we're already seeing some recovery in the mood and the spirit in Japan. There's definitely an attitude of trying to move on and then we'll see how that plays out for the tourist business. But the headline issue on the tourist business is the Chinese and their impact on the global shopping pattern as I said earlier, is extraordinary, not just in their home markets but as they move on to other countries."

So we called out the fact that in the fourth quarter, Retail grew faster than Wholesale. In fiscal 2012, we also called out the fact that Retail is growing faster than Wholesale and our strategy to grow Asia are primarily Retail growth, whether they're concessions shops or freestanding stores. That does have an impact on SG&A, it's a mix impact. So with Retail, you have higher gross profit and higher SG&A costs. So that too is impacting us. As it relates to fiscal '12, I can only point you back to the recession, when we were faced very suddenly with reduction in sales and made some prudent choices as it relates to discretionary spending and other spending as well. So certainly if the sales don't materialize, which we're pretty comfortable they will, again we have been very thoughtful in terms of how we've planned price increases. But there's a lot of other economics in the environment with gas prices and food prices rising and everything else, that we will certainly make prudent choices if need be to manage the year as we have previously. And in the future, I think you can expect us to continue to invest in growth strategies. I think that has working for us very well for the past few years. it's the reason why and Jacki spoke about our tremendous footwear business this year, it's the reason Europe has contributed as much as it have over the last few years for us as a company. We have been very smart and thoughtful on the executive leadership team here under Ralph's direction, investing in high-return projects, both in the near-term as well as long term and we certainly continue -- we'll continue to do that and Asia represents a very big opportunity for us a lot of those lines.

The launch of denim and supply, which is a new business, which comes with expenses before we start shipping. So we believe say that those will begin to moderate as we come full circle on most of the key license activities. And as we continue to see the kind of sales increases we've enjoyed, my expectation is we'll be able to leverage the expense line. And if I'm right, we'll begin to see over the next 12 months supply and demand getting better alignment which will help mitigate some of the margin impacts.

We're pleased to be reporting fourth quarter and fiscal '11 results that were much better than the expectations we articulated to you during the last year. We responded to a rapidly changing environment by pursuing additional market share opportunities and working to protect margins in the face of unprecedented inflationary pressures for our industry. At the same time, we made excellent progress on each of our strategic growth objectives and delivered the best operating results in our history, continuing the 5- and 10-year trends of double-digit sales and earnings growth and generating for the first time over $1 billion in EBITDA.
Tracey will provide more complete commentary on our financial performance later on, but I did want to highlight some of our key achievements. The 14% increase in annual revenues was double our original outlook, fueled by the excellent momentum of our core apparel offerings, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe, where revenues rose at a double-digit rate. Diluted EPS growth of 22% was achieved after substantial reinvestment back in the businesses, including the startup of Southeast Asia and Greater China, the transition of South Korea and the development of international e-commerce. We also managed the initial onslaught of cost of goods inflation in the second half of the year and the negative impact of several calendar and holiday shifts, including a 53rd week last year that had more than a distorted impact on our fourth quarter results. And there were extraordinary items such as restructuring and store impairment charges and the disruption in Japan. 
The quality and consistency of our results, reflecting the clarity of our strategic focus and our ability to execute with excellence as we now have more direct control of our operations and key merchandising categories around the world. The strong results enabled us to enhance shareholder returns by repurchasing nearly $600 million of stock and doubling our quarterly dividend during the year.
I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the incredible spirit and resilience of the Japanese people, following the devastation caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami there. I'm pleased to report that all 1,500 of our Japanese employees were safe and accounted for within hours of the disasters, and we continue to support them in their time of great need with various fundraising efforts. The long process of rebuilding is just beginning and will obviously have an impact on our fiscal '12 outlook for the region, but we are happy to see the nation on a path to recovery.
Moving back to the year. Our operating results were achieved in a manner that was totally consistent with the key strategic initiatives that we've been executing against for the last several years, namely the elevating of our brand as we expand our international presence, the innovation of new merchandising categories and extending our direct-to-customer reach. These objectives are supported by world-class advertising and marketing, the continued development of our leadership teams, investments and operational infrastructure and prudent financial management. Over the next 3 years, we intend to invest over $1 billion in total capital to continue advancing our strategic objectives.  About half of that will be allocated to new stores, concession shops and additional e-commerce development, all with an emphasis on international markets.
We made major strides at our international growth objectives during fiscal '11, assuming control of our distribution in South Korea during the fourth quarter and completing the last phase of our multi-year mission to bring our Asian operations in-house that began with Japan in 2007. The South Korea transition process, which includes the on-boarding of 200 employees, multiple systems integration was very smooth. After operating South Korea for 5 months now, we are encouraged by the early business trends, sales, gross profit margins operating expenses, all of which have been favorable to plan. We look forward to executing our growth strategies in this vibrant luxury market over the next several years. 
We also completed our first full year with additional control of our distribution in Southeast Asia and Greater China. We've learned a lot in the last year. First and foremost, we were pleased with the local customer acceptance of our luxury products, particularly our accessories. The new shops we've opened are performing well ahead of our expectations, primarily due to our more elevated merchandise mix, but also to more appropriate locations and adjacencies.
Our experience in the last 12 months has provided us with excellent clarity on our future brand positioning and real estate strategies in this important market. As we consider the modest size of our existing distribution network and assess our long-term outlook for the Greater China region, we believe we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reposition and upgrade our market presence. We intend to do this in a manner that is in sync with our existing global brand elevation strategies. The multi-year process will include more concentrated expansion of our elevated apparel and accessory products. Our real estate strategy will include flagship stores in key cities and more appropriate formats for additional points of distribution and secondary markets, similar to the Hub and Spoke approach we've used in New York and London.
Over the next 12 months, we intend to exit approximately 65 points of distribution that do not support our global real estate and merchandising strategies in this market. We believe these accelerated actions will allow us to deliver a clearer brand message to this critical customer, one that is better aligned with our presence in the rest of the world. the Chinese are poised to become the world's largest consumers of luxury goods, and they are already driving a substantial portion of the industry growth outside of China as they travel around the world, which is why the consistency of our global presence is so important.
As we've indicated before, the playbook is similar to what we've accomplished in Europe, where our local team has meticulously positioned our brand over the last decade by educating the customer of the quality and the value of our products. We supported this with considerable investment in upgrading our distribution across the continent. Today, we have a well-balanced representation across a range of formats, including our own retail stores, e-commerce in the U.K., mono-brand licensing stores, as well as department stores and specialty stores. Europe continues to yield excellent sales and profit growth for us. We expect sustained double-digit sales growth in this region over the next 3 years.
We believe we can achieve this ongoing growth with our core apparel merchandising that is accentuated by the introduction of new merchandise categories and brands, including Club Monaco into selected wholesale accounts this fall, the rollout of e-commerce to additional countries and new store growth. Our focus on brand elevation is perhaps most apparent with our direct-to-customer efforts. The investments we've made in our stores and in the growing of our e-commerce platform showcase our commitment to the global luxury customer. Our stores in the world's premier gateway cities typically have a mix of locals and tourists. Similar to our advertising and marketing efforts, they're important vehicles for us to reinforce the clarity and consistency of our brand expression. They also provide a halo for merchandise we sell across all distribution channels and set the stage for a long-term growth potential across lifestyle ranges and product categories. We will continue to grow our retail presence with a focus on the world's most dynamic markets.
Of the approximately $500 million in capital, we intend to invest over the next 3 years for new stores, concession shops and the continued development of global e-commerce, nearly 70% of this capital will be allocated to international markets. Shortly, Jacki will be commenting on the progress we've made with key merchandise categories and some exciting new launches for fiscal '12. 
Our Company's success obviously begins with the appeal of our product, and that is why we continuously invest in merchandise innovation. The integrity of Ralph's design process and our high production quality standards is an important part of our heritage, and our customers expect nothing less than the best from us. 
As we began navigating unprecedented cost-of-good inflation in the second half of fiscal '11, a bedrock principle for us was that we would not compromise the quality of our products with the continuity of our execution. We also determined not to make material pricing adjustments to our Spring Summer merchandise. We believe these decisions have supported our strong Spring sell-throughs and market share gains across channels.
As cost pressures intensify into fiscal '12, we made a thoughtful pricing adjustment by brand and region to help mitigate inflationary pressures. In general, these adjustments do not fully offset our higher costs, and this is expected to have a negative impact on our fiscal '12 gross margin, particularly as we make large fall wholesale shipments in the second quarter. We are confident in the strength of our merchandising assortments, and we believe our unwavering commitment to the integrity of our product and the value proposition will be a competitive advantage for us, but we will not know the full impact of our actions until the customer reacts to the new pricing in the fall.
Sitting here today, we enter fiscal '12 with excellent momentum in our business. We are accelerating growth where our market share is already strongest, and we're investing in emerging opportunities that we believe will offer the most compelling long-term shareholder value creation. It is a continuation of the strategy that has delivered consistent mid-teen sales growth and even better earnings growth over the last 5- and 10-year periods. We expect that momentum to be maintained as we assess our outlook over the next 3 years, when the investments we've made in fiscal '11 and the ones we plan to make in fiscal '12 bear fruit in fiscal '13 and beyond.
We believe we'll generate over $3.5 billion of EBITDA over the next 3 years, which is a testament to the high-quality growth we are pursuing. In recognition of our strong cash flow, yesterday, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. And with over $1 billion in cash and investments already on our balance sheets, we are confident we have the financial strength to pursue all of our growth aspirations, and we are very excited about the future.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki."

Fiscal 2011 was an exciting year for us with respect to the expansion and development of our products. We gained market share in most merchandise categories around the world. The double-digit growth we experie",1108,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2011 was an exciting year for us with respect to the expansion and development of our products. We gained market share in most merchandise categories around the world. The double-digit growth we experienced in the U.S., Europe and Asia clearly demonstrate that customers not only responded to the compelling design and quality of our products but also to our strategic merchandising initiatives, which enabled us to generate significant sales growth.
Our core business is performing exceedingly well across men's, women's and children's. The consistent upgrading of our in-store shops and visual presentation has been an important backdrop to support the momentum in our various brands. Our ability to expand the bandwidth of each of our brands to address new lifestyle sensibilities has deepened our relevance with the customer who knows they can always count on Ralph Lauren for distinctive high-quality merchandise in all aspects of their life. 
Emerging categories, such as accessories, dresses, activewear and footwear, offer excellent examples of our ability to extend our brand into new classification with tremendous success in a relatively short period of time. It has also allowed us to secure incremental distribution and floor space. We built a Lauren dress division from scratch just 3 years ago, hiring industry-leading talent to address an emerging category that was a natural extension for our core Lauren sportswear business. Today, we are already among, if not the, better leading dress resource in the department store channel, and we still have considerable growth before us, both in terms of expanded distribution and assortment. We just added evening and special occasion dresses, as well as special sizes to our dress assortment. 
Footwear is a similar story, one that is equally compelling in both men's and women's. The breadth of our footwear assortment has expanded dramatically in the 4 years since we've acquired this business. In that time, we tripled the size of our wholesale shipment. Today, we are recognized as an important footwear resource, with the ability to sell at both specialty retail and department store environments in a manner that supports our overall brand's objectives.
We will continue to evolve the assortment into exciting new lifestyle sensibilities in fiscal 2012, including footwear that complements our Black Label and RLX brand. Up until now, our success in the category has been concentrated in the United States, where we continue to have door-growth opportunities. During fiscal '12, we intend to expand our Ralph Lauren footwear and add Polo and Lauren footwear into Europe, which is an exciting next step in the evolution of our overall accessory strategy. RalphLauren.com and the international markets are expected to play a key role in our long-term development of this category.
Fiscal 2011 was a pivotal year for our handbag effort. While we've had Ralph Lauren luxury products for the last few years, led by our iconic Ricky Bag, fiscal '11 was the first year we really began to address the broader lifestyle opportunities. As a result, in luxury handbags, we now have compelling assortment of merchandise in the sweet spot that has historically been dominated by leading European brands. This spring, we had broad success in the handbag category and did extremely well with Ralph's iconic Western-inspired design, including the Navajo blanket bags and the leather lace tots. Although Ralph Lauren handbags are now primarily available in our lone retail stores and on RalphLauren.com, as the assortment grows, we believe we have an important opportunity to develop worldwide distribution for this product in leading specialty and department stores that currently feature our apparel merchandise.
Our first Lauren handbag collection was introduced last fall, and we have experienced excellent progress to date. Momentum has accelerated as customers became more aware of the product and as we've expanded our merchandise offering. We are very excited about the long-term global opportunity with Lauren handbags, which should evolve as we expand distribution over the next several years.
With both the Ralph Lauren and Lauren brands, we are steadily building a stable of iconic designs to further develop what we believe will be a very strong accessory platform.
With this much as we've accomplished in fiscal '11, we have several new merchandise opportunities in '12. The first is inspired by Ralph's long time love of denim, one of the most iconic staples of the American wardrobe. At the luxury level, we are launching Black Label denim for men, which will complement and extend our modern Black Label sensibility and women's collection denim, which is a new luxury denim lifestyle offering that we feel is unique to the marketplace.
At the premium level, we are launching Ralph Lauren denim and supply, an exciting new brand that captures the heritage of denim with an edgy, Bohemian attitude that is distinctly Ralph Lauren and perfect for the young customer. The launch of Ralph Lauren denim and supply offers incremental distribution for us in North America, where the merchandise will be sold through approximately 250 better department stores and on RalphLauren.com. Ralph Lauren denim and supply will replace the Polo Jeans Co. brand in Europe and Asia and will essentially maintain the existing distribution network for those products. The introduction of Ralph Lauren denim and supply is an important step in expanding our world of denim merchandising strategy. 
Fiscal '12 will also showcase a renewed focus on our Ralph Lauren and Lauren Home product merchandise categories. Over the last year, we've selectively taken more direct control of certain product categories including textile, which had been one of our largest licenses, while finding best-in-class partners for others. We opened a new distribution center in May for Lauren textiles to include bedding and bath products. Today, we have categories of furniture, bedding and bath, table cloth, tops, lighting, rugs, fabrics, wall coverings, gifts and accessories. All the key classifications in home are in place to deliver an impactful and integrated lifestyle presentation for our customer, which we believe will support new growth opportunities.
For home, in fiscal '12, we intend to enhance distribution by partnering with our wholesale customers to showcase the products and implement strategic merchandising initiatives that appropriately tell the story of our collection. We already have a handful of flagship locations for each of our home products: 888 Madison Avenue in New York, our store in Greenwich, Connecticut and London for Ralph Lauren Home and Lord & Taylor in New York City for Lauren Home. We are also gaining traction with department stores and specialty stores in Europe.
So clearly, a lot accomplished in fiscal '11 with more opportunity in the future, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,131507233,131583,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent full year operating results in the fourth quarter, which despite the impact of meaningful calendar shifts that we described to you on our third quarter earni",2451,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent full year operating results in the fourth quarter, which despite the impact of meaningful calendar shifts that we described to you on our third quarter earnings call, exceeded our expectations given the continued momentum in our business. Incremental sales and profit within our Retail segment were the primary drivers of the upside, with all regions of the world contributing to the outperformance, although the heaviest concentration was achieved in the United States. 
Before I provide you with further insight into the fourth quarter's operational drivers, I do need to remind you of the nature of the calendar shifts we told you about in February that negatively affect comparisons with our prior-year periods, impacts that were reflected in the guidance we previously provided you for the fourth quarter. Roger mentioned them as well, and they do include an extra 53rd week that was in our results last year in the fourth quarter and a later Easter week this year that shifted that holiday sales growth into the first quarter of our fiscal 2012 versus the fourth quarter that we're reporting now. Lastly, we also mentioned the timing of the high-volume sales week post-Christmas that fell within our third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. On a normalized calendar basis, we estimate the shifts alone negatively affected our reported sales growth in the quarter by approximately 10 full percentage points.
Unless otherwise noted, my discussion of our fourth quarter business performance is based on our reported GAAP financial results, which reflect a 13-week period for fiscal 2011 and a 14-week period for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
On a reported basis, consolidated net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, 7% above the prior-year period and led by a double-digit gain in Retail segment sales. Our Retail performance was better than we expected in several areas, including same-store sales, the contribution from new stores and our performance in Asia, excluding Japan. We did not incur any meaningful impact from foreign currency translations on our consolidated fourth quarter sales as the strengthening of the Japanese yen was mostly offset by a modest weakening of the euro relative to last year.
The gross profit margin of 56.8% was essentially in line with our expectations. As we have communicated all year, we have incurred cost-of-good inflation for this year's Spring Summer season, and we determined that we would not make any material changes to our pricing until the upcoming fall season. Some of the inflationary cost of goods pressure we experienced in the fourth quarter was offset by a higher level of full-price selling at most of our retail concepts and the seasonal variation in our overall channel mix.
Operating expenses of $693 million were 12% above the prior-year period and the operating expense margin rose 240 basis points to 48.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting incremental expenses associated with our newly transitioned South Korean operations, the continued investment in our growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation costs.
Fourth quarter operating income of $117 million was 32% below the prior-year period, primarily due to the calendar shifts affecting the comparability with the prior-year period and the lower gross profit margin and higher expense rate I just discussed.
Net income was $73 million and net income per diluted share was $0.74 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter at 34.4% was approximately 250 basis points higher than the prior-year period as the greater proportion of our earnings were generated in higher tax jurisdictions.
Due to the timing of the natural disasters in Japan, which occurred in the latter part of our fiscal fourth quarter, the financial impact on our reported results was relatively modest at approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
Moving on to segment highlights. Wholesale segment sales rose 2% to $752 million in the fourth quarter as strong growth in U.S. Wholesale shipments, continued growth in department stores in Europe, as well as expanded distribution in Greater China were mostly offset by a planned decline in Japanese Wholesale shipments and softness in some European specialty stores, most notably in Italy.
Wholesale operating income was $136 million in the fourth quarter, and the operating profit margin was 18.2% compared to 24.9% in the prior-year period. The decline in margin rate was primarily attributable to the cost of goods inflation, lower Japanese Wholesale shipments and continued investment in new merchandise categories.
The 14% increase in Retail segment sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 primarily reflects strong momentum at our factory stores worldwide and on RalphLauren.com, as well as the incremental contribution from newly transitioned South Korea operations. Overall, comparable store sales, which I'm referencing on a 13-week to 13-week basis, increased 7%, which was achieved on top of the 16% gain in the prior-year period and of course, excludes the sales at the Asian stores and concession shops that we assumed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. These sales will be included in our comps beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as they are fully anniversaried.
The 3% decline in Ralph Lauren comps during the fourth quarter is entirely due to our Retail Japanese operation. Excluding Japan, Ralph Lauren comps were flat on top of the 17% increase in the prior-year period. Sales trends at our global flagship locations worldwide, many of which are not in our comp base, have been very strong, which is consistent with the rebound in sales of global luxury products. Factory store comps rose 8% in the fourth quarter, Club Monaco comps were up 10%, with excellent performance in trend-right women's fashions and sales at RalphLauren.com increased 21%.
Across all Retail formats, customers are responding to our compelling product content, as Jacki mentioned, and our focused merchandising strategies. Our strong third quarter sales provided us with a good start to full-price spring selling in the fourth quarter. In the United States, high-traffic urban locations and popular tourist destinations for both Ralph Lauren and factory store continue to post the strongest sales trends for us. We also achieved better conversion rates on higher traffic levels this quarter.
In Europe, unseasonably cold weather and civil unrest in the Middle East during the quarter negatively affected customer traffic across the continent, although the trends improved meaningfully in the latter part of the period. Performance in our Greater China and South Korea concession shops was also better than anticipated during the quarter. Japan sales trended down approximately 30% in the weeks following the earthquake and tsunami compared to relatively flat performance in the quarter-to-date period prior to the disasters. Retail segment operating income of $26 million was 40% greater than the prior-year period and the operating margin improved 80 basis point to 4.1%.
Strong comp growth and higher full price sell-throughs more than offset the short-term diluted impact of South Korea, investment in international e-commerce, cost inflation and extraordinary items such as the business disruption in Japan.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $44 million, 6% below the prior-year period. Higher Fragrance Licensing revenues were more than offset by a decline in international licensing revenues related to the South Korea transition. We also had Lauren Home product licensing revenues as a result of some of the strategic changes that Jacki spoke to earlier. The 19% decline in Licensing operating income in the fourth quarter is attributable to the same international and home effects that impacted sales for Licensing.
Consolidated inventory was up 39% at the end of the fourth quarter on a reported basis. Approximately half of the increase in dollars is to support the anticipated sales growth and shipment cadence highlighted in our fiscal 2012 outlook. And 1/4 of the increase is related to newly transitioned Asian operations within fiscal 2011. As you recall, we had unusually low inventory levels this time last year from the transition of the Southeast Asia and Greater China region, and our South Korean inventory is entirely incremental this year versus last year.  The remaining 1/4 of the increase is attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency dynamics. With a relatively flat inventory turn and near-term sales expectations in the first quarter, we remain comfortable with the content and currency of our inventory.
We spent approximately $255 million in capital expenditures during the fiscal 2011 to support our retail store and wholesale shop development worldwide, in addition to continued infrastructure investments. We also repurchased approximately 6 million shares of stock for an aggregate of $578 million during the year, including 2 million shares for $247 million during the fourth quarter. And as Roger mentioned yesterday, our Board authorized an additional $500 million for share repurchase, bringing our total current authorizations to $976 million.
We ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash and investments after funding all of our capital and acquisition cost needs and returning a substantial amount of capital to shareholders via our share repurchase activity, as well as the doubling of the dividend. 
Fiscal 2011 was clearly a year of tremendous progress for advancing our strategic objective, while still growing earnings at a double-digit rate. And we are encouraged by the current momentum of our underlying business trends, even though we are mindful and experiencing intensifying inflationary dynamics that are beginning to broadly affect consumers. While we are currently benefiting from strong demand for our products across most channels and formats worldwide, we are increasingly impacted by the inflationary pressure on cost of goods as evidenced by our fourth quarter gross margin dynamics. As most of you know, the cost of goods inflation we began to experience in the second half of fiscal 2011 intensifies in fiscal '12 with fall inventory receipts. 
Beginning this fall, as Roger indicated, we made what we believe are responsible, selective pricing adjustments to mitigate a portion of the impact. In general, we'd determined not to pass on the full impact of our higher cost of goods and the magnitude of inflation is such that we do expect our gross profit margin and therefore, our operating margin, to be down in fiscal 2012. We believe the customer, the consumer, will accept some higher prices due to the strength of our brand and the consistent quality of our merchandise. But after a decade of apparel deflation, the actual customer reaction remains unknown until the merchandise is available for sale in the stores. 
We also remain committed to our strategy of investing in growth initiatives and infrastructure during fiscal 2012, including international retail expansion and e-commerce and continued systems enhancements. Sequencing these types of investments as we have in the past should help to drive profit growth in future years.
Now I'd like to briefly review our initial expectations for the year that we outlined in this morning's press release. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase in the mid-20s range, a rate of growth that is an acceleration of the momentum we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2011 and is positively impacted by the benefit of the later Easter sales I highlighted earlier. Wholesale revenues are expected to increase at a low 20% rate based on strong shipment growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Retail segment sales are expected to grow slightly faster than Wholesale revenues, a function of low double-digit comparable store sales growth and the contribution from new stores and concession shops, inclusive of our incremental South Korean concession shops and stores. 
Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately equivalent to the prior-year period, with the higher Retail mix offsetting the continued margin decline in Wholesale due to cost of goods. We will also incur higher operating expenses related to the continued investment in our growth initiatives across geographies, distribution channels and emerging product categories. 
For the full fiscal 2012 period, we expect revenues to increase at a mid-teens rate, with Retail segment sales again growing slightly faster than Wholesale revenues. Our full year operating margin is expected to decline 100 to 150 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit margin pressure I discussed earlier. We also continue to monitor our performance closely in Japan, post the unfortunate incident of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis. As the entire nation is obviously preoccupied with its safety and relief efforts, we currently expect the initial disruption and subsequent irregular shopping patterns in Japan to negatively impact our fiscal results, which is also reflected in our sales and margin guidance. 
We will also support our growth initiatives with advertising and marketing spending for our new product introductions to generate more awareness for emerging product categories such as denim and to support our international expansion efforts. We have excluded any potential extraordinary charges that may result from our Greater China repositioning efforts. These charges could range from $10 million the $20 million depending on the timing of the closure. 
Our fiscal 2012 tax rate is planned at approximately 33% based on our forecasted income mix and excluding any discrete items. We intend to spend approximately $325 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 to support our Retail and Wholesale growth initiatives and the consistent upgrading of our global infrastructure. We currently expect to open 34 new stores and 47 concession shops during the year and close 65 stores and shops in the Greater China region as part of the repositioning that was discussed earlier by Roger. 
And much of our capital next year is dedicated to our international growth efforts, including continued expansion of Ralph Lauren in the Asia Pacific region, the introduction of Rugby and Club Monaco brands into Europe and the launch of Denim & Supply, with shops in leading department stores around the world. 
So we've communicated a lot to you this morning regarding our results and our plans for this year. We are clearly balancing multiple factors in our fiscal '12 outlook with the realities of the margin pressure as we execute our plans. Over the years, our team has demonstrated incredible agility when faced with a highly uncertain market environment, and we expect the same to be true in fiscal 2012 as we navigate through the near-term impacts of commodity inflation. Our ability to gain share in our largest markets and expand merchandise categories is enabling us to build additional platforms for future growth, and our financial strength and increasing cash generation prowess allow us the flexibility to invest in opportunities that will yield substantive future returns for our shareholders.

One, the fourth quarter results we've reported is a bit of a Haley's Comet. The unusual combination of an extra week, the lost of Easter, the lost of the week after Christmas,",495,"Yes, Adrianne, let me just cover a couple of the questions you've got in there. One, the fourth quarter results we've reported is a bit of a Haley's Comet. The unusual combination of an extra week, the lost of Easter, the lost of the week after Christmas, really is a bit of a false read that I think Tracey tried to capture for you. If you take the run rate of sales through our third quarter, adjusted fourth quarter and the guidance we provided for first quarter, you'll see that business really is quite strong and really, all merchandise categories in all regions in all channels are contributing to that. So we're actually encouraged with the customers' response to our products and strategies. We did not take many price increases in the spring, even though we began to see some costs rising, but we have for fall. And those increases really are very dependent on the price point of the product and the merchandise categories. The actual cost of goods inflation, depending on the products, range from low- to mid-single-digits all the way up into the low-20s. And when you look at the breadth of product we have from the highest levels of collection in Purple Label down to products we make for Chaps, for Cole's [Kenneth Cole] and Penney's [J.C. Penney], some  of the bigger cost movements were in the lower portion of that pyramid, and that's where we were more cautious about passing on the products as they came through. I also believe, and this is one person's opinion, that the cost of goods that we've all seen and read and talk so much about will begin to moderate into spring and fall of next year. I think that the supply and demand imbalance was real and some of the other costs got run off for other reasons, and I think the more natural supply and demand will begin to take effect as we look at next year. So our point of view has been, we're not going to alter the quality, we're not going to alter the materials trim, findings, or the cut of the products, we're not going to alter where we make goods because our principles of product and product integrity has been so critical to our success, we think the customers want the same product and are going to pay more for it where appropriate. And I think this pig in a python is going to play itself out over the next couple of seasons. We raised our gross margin, in the last 7 years, 900 basis points. So I think we've become very expert at sourcing logistics and distribution, merchandising and really felt that a short-term blip was not something to throw us off our strategic mission. So a lot of that's embedded in your question, and I've expanded it in an effort to try to cover some of what I know is on all of your minds."

Club Monaco, as you've been following, Robbie, the comps for years now has been extraordinarily successful with identifying their customer, the product offering and then the price value of what they've made. I think you'll also know that today, that production has been integrated into our overall manufacturing cycle. So we've had, for years, a lot of international retailers, knocking on the door, looking to get Club Monaco distributed in their market. We have partnered in Asia with distribution experts. But in Europe, our European team really felt that they had the ability to distribute it to key retailers as a Wholesale business, as well as looking at stand-alone store distribution. We had a test this February that started with Brown's in London that was extraordinarily successful, and we just think that product really appeals to an international customers. We see that in a lot of our New York stores, where we get a lot of tourists who are coming in to buy product they can't get in other parts of the world. So we think Club Monaco represents an opportunity, not only in Asia where we are and we're growing successfully, but in Europe. Rugby, we'll be opening our first store in Europe later this year in London. There, again, we've had, whether it's on the website or whether it's in the stores here in New York, we've had a tremendous reaction from our international customers. We opened a store in Japan last year that actually is the number 2 store in volume in our network, and so we think Europe represents opportunities and are looking for additional locations going forward with Rugby.

That will now take place for fall. So that will be the transition for Europe and Asia. The exciting part about the development of this brand is now, we're planning a reintroduction in the U.S. of this vibrant category, and it will be launched in about 250 stores in the U.S. and in Canada. And with prime locations in men's and women's, with a very fresh impactful presentation, there will be strong marketing placed behind it, really speaking to this young customer, our plan is to take a very unique style of marketing this product, really reaching this audience in a very unique way and our plans for what and exactly will be done will be developed and you'll see over the next couple of months.

So while we keep growing internationally, we're growing equally fast domestically. And I think as the Internet has added to the U.S. distribution pattern both our own and Wholesale as we keep launching new product categories like footwear, dresses, handbags, denim. The U.S. growth is equal to the extraordinary international growth. So I think as Tracey gave you some guidance to the first quarter and the full year, we are actually getting growth around the horn. And I think one of the surprises to us, and perhaps to all of you, was the strong core domestic Wholesale growth in the U.S. So I'm not sure how we're going to get to the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 when the U.S. keeps growing, but we'll try."

Each of those markets were run by a separate license group. So as we took back Japan, separate from China, Hong Kong, separate from Korea, each one of those were the transition of a long-term license to our ownership and control",650,"Yes, it's a good question. Each of those markets were run by a separate license group. So as we took back Japan, separate from China, Hong Kong, separate from Korea, each one of those were the transition of a long-term license to our ownership and control. And the Japanese business and the South Korea business are really heavily driven by department store shop-in-shops, and those marketplaces are heavily dominated by department stores shop-in-shops. Those businesses, over many years, had a focus of men's casual, Blue Label sportswear. And in Japan, where we've had control of the business longer, we've seen tremendous reaction from the customer as we've begun to elevate product in women's and in kids and in other product categories as we've added visual enhancements and clarity, as we've sharpened our message, pre the earthquake and tsunami, we were beginning to see nice trends in what overall was a tough market. And one of the guidance issues for '12 isn't that Japan is not beginning to show some recovery from that, but it was against what our run rates would have been prior to that. Korea, where in fact, we've now had the business only for 5 months, we took on a terrific team of people that came with the acquisition, who really knew their products. And although the licensee did run down the inventories as we got to the end of the license in December, so we started January at a low level. As we've replenished inventory through the last 5 months, the customer there has responded and that market has responded to better products, more elevated products and more fashion. But we feel very good about the long-term opportunity in Korea. Of course, many of you know that a lot of the business is in Seoul, Korea and a lot of that business is fueled by Chinese tourists. Pricing in South Korea is less than it is in the mainland of China. So there is a healthy tourist component coming into Korea for shopping weekends. The year we've had China, Hong Kong and the rest of the Dickson portfolio has also been one of a slightly different challenge because we had to build an organization from scratch. We had no history on the merchandise, we had no infrastructure unlike the Japanese and Korea acquisition where we took on an existing team. We really had to build an organization from day 1 and get to know the stores and the territories. The other issue is that, that market will be dominated by stand-alone retail into the future. They're not really embedded in a department store-driven distribution channel. So our ability to identify and acquire key locations, both in major cities and more suburban malls will be a key to that market. We are clearly underdeveloped in women's, we're clearly underdeveloped in accessories and kids and I think our goal would be to elevate and refine the men's business we have over time. The other thing I would just say so it doesn't get lost in the small print of the script, the Chinese are traveling the world. In many of the luxury brands that I talked to, talked powerfully about the impact of the Chinese tourists in their other international locations, like Paris or London or Milan or Switzerland. So we believe as we build up the proper presence and consistent with our global image in China, we will see those customers and the lift in our business in Europe, which we don't really get much of today. So it's really a holistic approach to the Chinese customer, slightly different than the Japanese and Korean markets that we think is absolutely exciting for the medium-term and long-term for this company. Let's continue to take questions, I know we're a little long because the end-of-the-year report was more robust , but we'll keep fielding questions for another few minutes."

I mean, clearly, in the 2 months right after the earthquake and tsunami, the tourists travel in Japan was dramatically down. Although quite frankly, the Chinese tourist is today the dominant influence in really the gateway cities. One of the interesting subjects that's not often reported is the difficulty that Chinese tourists have to get visas to visit in the United States. So today, many of the tourists that are traveling out of China are really going to Europe. While that's a wonderful trip and a wonderful experience, we'd love to get more of them into the United States. But nevertheless, where you see Hawaii or other Asian destinations for tourism, the Japanese tourist is staying close to the home. Although I think it's going to be a quarter-to-quarter update, we're already seeing some recovery in the mood and the spirit in Japan. There's definitely an attitude of trying to move on, and then we'll see how that plays out for the tourist business. But the headline issue on the tourist business is the Chinese and their impact on the global shopping pattern, as I said earlier, is extraordinary, not just in their home market but as they move to other countries."

One of the other impacts that I didn't mention that is impacting, if you just look at our SG&A, is how we are growing. So we called out the fact that in the fourth quarter, Retail grew faster than Wholesale. In fiscal 2012, we also called out the fact that Retail is growing faster than Wholesale and our strategy to grow Asia are primarily Retail growth, whether they're concessions shops or freestanding stores. That does have an impact on SG&A. It's a mix impact. So with Retail, you have higher gross profit and higher SG&A costs. So that too is impacting us. As it relates to fiscal '12, I can only point you back to the recession, when we were faced very suddenly with reduction in sales and made some prudent choices as it relates to discretionary spending and other spending as well. So certainly, if the sales don't materialize, which we're pretty comfortable they will, again, we have been very thoughtful in terms of how we've planned price increases. But there's a lot of other economics noise in the environment with gas prices and food prices rising and everything else, that we will certainly make prudent choices, if need be, to manage the year, as we have previously. And in the future, I think you can expect us to continue to invest in growth strategies. I think that has been working very well for us in the last few years. It's the reason why Jacki spoke about our tremendous footwear growth this year, it's the reason why Europe has contributed as much as it has over the last few years for us as a company. We have been very smart and thoughtful on the executive leadership team here under Ralph's direction, investing in high-return projects, both in the near-term as well as long-term, and we certainly will continue to do that. And Asia represents, again, a very exciting opportunity for us along those lines. Roger?"

We're obviously taking on expenses that used to be licensed, same for Korea, former license category bringing it in-house. The launch of Denim & Supply, which is a new business, which comes with expenses before we start shipping. So we believe, Faye, that those will begin to moderate as we come full circle on most of the key license activities. And as we continue to see the kind of sales increases we've enjoyed, my expectation is we'll be able to leverage the expense line.

We're pleased to be reporting fourth quarter and fiscal '11 results that were much better than the expectations we articulated to you during the last year. We responded to a rapidly changing environment by pursuing additional market share opportunities and working to protect margins in the face of unprecedented inflationary pressures for our industry. At the same time, we made excellent progress on each of our strategic growth objectives and delivered the best operating results in our history, continuing the 5- and 10-year trends of double-digit sales and earnings growth and generating for the first time over $1 billion in EBITDA.
Tracey will provide more complete commentary on our financial performance later on, but I did want to highlight some of our key achievements. The 14% increase in annual revenues was double our original outlook, fueled by the excellent momentum of our core apparel offerings, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe, where revenues rose at a double-digit rate. Diluted EPS growth of 22% was achieved after substantial reinvestment back in the businesses, including the startup of Southeast Asia and Greater China, the transition of South Korea and the development of international e-commerce. We also managed the initial onslaught of cost of goods inflation in the second half of the year and the negative impact of several calendar and holiday shifts, including a 53rd week last year that had more than a distorted impact on our fourth quarter results. And there were extraordinary items such as restructuring and store impairment charges and the disruption in Japan. 
The quality and consistency of our results, reflecting the clarity of our strategic focus and our ability to execute with excellence as we now have more direct control of our operations and key merchandising categories around the world. The strong results enabled us to enhance shareholder returns by repurchasing nearly $600 million of stock and doubling our quarterly dividend during the year.
I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the incredible spirit and resilience of the Japanese people following the devastation caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami there. I'm pleased to report that all 1,500 of our Japanese employees were safe and accounted for within hours of the disasters, and we continue to support them in their time of great need with various fundraising efforts. The long process of rebuilding is just beginning and will obviously have an impact on our fiscal '12 outlook for the region, but we are happy to see the nation on a path to recovery.
Moving back to the year. Our operating results were achieved in a manner that was totally consistent with the key strategic initiatives that we've been executing against for the last several years, namely the elevating of our brand as we expand our international presence, the innovation of new merchandising categories and extending our direct-to-customer reach. These objectives are supported by world-class advertising and marketing, the continued development of our leadership teams, investments and operational infrastructure and prudent financial management. Over the next 3 years, we intend to invest over $1 billion in total capital to continue advancing our strategic objectives.  About half of that will be allocated to new stores, concession shops and additional e-commerce development, all with an emphasis on international markets.
We made major strides in our international growth objectives during fiscal '11, assuming control of our distribution in South Korea during the fourth quarter and completing the last phase of our multi-year mission to bring our Asian operations in-house that began with Japan in 2007. The South Korea transition process, which includes the on-boarding of 200 employees, multiple systems integration was very smooth. After operating South Korea for 5 months now, we are encouraged by the early business trends, sales, gross profit margins, operating expenses, all of which have been favorable to plan. We look forward to executing our growth strategies in this vibrant luxury market over the next several years. 
We also completed our first full year with additional control of our distribution in Southeast Asia and Greater China. We've learned a lot in the last year. First and foremost, we are pleased with the local customer acceptance of our luxury products, particularly our accessories. The new shops we've opened are performing well ahead of our expectations, primarily due to our more elevated merchandise mix, but also to more appropriate locations and adjacencies.
Our experience in the last 12 months has provided us with excellent clarity on our future brand positioning and real estate strategies in this important market. As we consider the modest size of our existing distribution network and assess our long-term outlook for the Greater China region, we believe we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reposition and upgrade our market presence. We intend to do this in a manner that is in sync with our existing global brand elevation strategies. The multi-year process will include more concentrated expansion of our elevated apparel and accessory products. Our real estate strategy will include flagship stores in key cities and more appropriate formats for additional points of distribution and secondary markets, similar to the hub-and-spoke approach we've used in New York and London.
Over the next 12 months, we intend to exit approximately 65 points of distribution that do not support our global real estate and merchandising strategies in this market. We believe these accelerated actions will allow us to deliver a clearer brand message to this critical customer, one that is better aligned with our presence in the rest of the world. The Chinese are poised to become the world's largest consumers of luxury goods, and they are already driving a substantial portion of the industry growth outside of China as they travel around the world, which is why the consistency of our global presence is so important.
As we've indicated before, the playbook is similar to what we've accomplished in Europe, where our local team has meticulously positioned our brand over the last decade by educating the customer about quality and the value of our products. We’ve supported this with considerable investment in upgrading our distribution across the continent. Today, we have a well-balanced representation across a range of formats, including our own retail stores, e-commerce in the U.K., mono-brand licensing stores, as well as department stores and specialty stores. Europe continues to yield excellent sales and profit growth for us. We expect sustained double-digit sales growth in this region over the next 3 years.
We believe we can achieve this ongoing growth with our core apparel merchandising that is accentuated by the introduction of new merchandise categories and brands, including Club Monaco into selected wholesale accounts this fall, the rollout of e-commerce to additional countries and new store growth. Our focus on brand elevation is perhaps most apparent with our direct-to-customer efforts. The investments we've made in our stores and in the growing of our e-commerce platform showcase our commitment to the global luxury customer. Our stores in the world's premier gateway cities typically have a mix of locals and tourists. Similar to our advertising and marketing efforts, they're important vehicles for us to reinforce the clarity and consistency of our brand expression. They also provide a halo for merchandise we sell across all distribution channels and set the stage for a long-term growth potential across lifestyle ranges and product categories. We will continue to grow our retail presence with a focus on the world's most dynamic markets.
Of the approximately $500 million in capital we intend to invest over the next 3 years for new stores, concession shops and the continued development of global e-commerce, nearly 70% of this capital will be allocated to international markets. Shortly, Jacki will be commenting on the progress we've made with key merchandise categories and some exciting new launches for fiscal '12. 
Our company's success obviously begins with the appeal of our product, and that is why we continuously invest in merchandise innovation. The integrity of Ralph's design process and our high production quality standards is an important part of our heritage, and our customers expect nothing less than the best from us. 
As we began navigating unprecedented cost-of-goods inflation in the second half of fiscal '11, a bedrock principle for us was that we would not compromise the quality of our products or the continuity of our execution. We also determined not to make material pricing adjustments to our spring/summer merchandise. We believe these decisions have supported our strong spring sell-throughs and market share gains across channels.
As cost pressures intensify into fiscal '12, we made a thoughtful pricing adjustment by brand and region to help mitigate inflationary pressures. In general, these adjustments do not fully offset our higher costs, and this is expected to have a negative impact on our fiscal '12 gross margin, particularly as we make large fall wholesale shipments in the second quarter. We are confident in the strength of our merchandising assortments, and we believe our unwavering commitment to the integrity of our product and the value proposition will be a competitive advantage for us, but we will not know the full impact of our actions until the customer reacts to the new pricing in the fall.
Sitting here today, we enter fiscal '12 with excellent momentum in our business. We are accelerating growth where our market share is already strongest, and we're investing in emerging opportunities that we believe will offer the most compelling long-term shareholder value creation. It is a continuation of the strategy that has delivered consistent mid-teen sales growth and even better earnings growth over the last 5- and 10-year periods. We expect that momentum to be maintained as we assess our outlook over the next 3 years, when the investments we've made in fiscal '11 and the ones we plan to make in fiscal '12 bear fruit in fiscal '13 and beyond.
We believe we'll generate over $3.5 billion of EBITDA over the next 3 years, which is a testament to the high-quality growth we are pursuing. In recognition of our strong cash flow, yesterday, our board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. And with over $1 billion in cash and investments already on our balance sheet, we are confident we have the financial strength to pursue all of our growth aspirations, and we are very excited about the future.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki."

The double-digit growth we experie",1108,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2011 was an exciting year for us with respect to the expansion and development of our products. We gained market share in most merchandise categories around the world. The double-digit growth we experienced in the U.S., Europe and Asia clearly demonstrate that customers not only responded to the compelling design and quality of our products but also to our strategic merchandising initiatives, which enabled us to generate significant sales growth.
Our core business is performing exceedingly well across men's, women's and children's. The consistent upgrading of our in-store shops and visual presentation has been an important backdrop to support the momentum in our various brands. Our ability to expand the bandwidth of each of our brands to address new lifestyle sensibilities has deepened our relevance with the customer who knows they can always count on Ralph Lauren for distinctive high-quality merchandise in all aspects of their life. 
Emerging categories, such as accessories, dresses, activewear and footwear, offer excellent examples of our ability to extend our brand into new classification with tremendous success in a relatively short period of time. It has also allowed us to secure incremental distribution and floor space. We built a Lauren dress division from scratch just 3 years ago, hiring industry-leading talent to address an emerging category that was a natural extension for our core Lauren sportswear business. Today, we are already among, if not the, better leading dress resource in the department store channel, and we still have considerable growth before us, both in terms of expanded distribution and assortment. We just added evening and special occasion dresses, as well as special sizes to our dress assortment. 
Footwear is a similar story, one that is equally compelling in both men's and women's. The breadth of our footwear assortment has expanded dramatically in the 4 years since we've acquired this business. In that time, we tripled the size of our wholesale shipment. Today, we are recognized as an important footwear resource with the ability to sell at both specialty retail and department store environments in a manner that supports our overall brand's objectives.
We will continue to evolve the assortment into exciting new lifestyle sensibilities in fiscal 2012, including footwear that complements our Black Label and RLX brand. Up until now, our success in the category has been concentrated in the United States, where we continue to have door-growth opportunities. During fiscal '12, we intend to expand our Ralph Lauren footwear and add Polo and Lauren footwear into Europe, which is an exciting next step in the evolution of our overall accessory strategy. RalphLauren.com and the international markets are expected to play a key role in our long-term development of this category.
Fiscal 2011 was a pivotal year for our handbag effort. While we've had Ralph Lauren luxury products for the last few years, led by our iconic Ricky Bag, fiscal '11 was the first year we really began to address the broader lifestyle opportunities. As a result, in luxury handbags, we now have compelling assortment of merchandise in the sweet spot that has historically been dominated by leading European brands. This spring, we had broad success in the handbag category and did extremely well with Ralph's iconic Western-inspired design, including the Navajo blanket bags and the leather lace totes. Although Ralph Lauren handbags are now primarily available in our own retail stores and on RalphLauren.com, as the assortment grows, we believe we have an important opportunity to develop worldwide distribution for this product in leading specialty and department stores that currently feature our apparel merchandise.
Our first Lauren handbag collection was introduced last fall, and we have experienced excellent progress to date. Momentum has accelerated as customers became more aware of the product and as we've expanded our merchandise offering. We are very excited about the long-term global opportunity with Lauren handbags, which should evolve as we expand distribution over the next several years.
With both the Ralph Lauren and Lauren brands, we are steadily building a stable of iconic designs to further develop what we believe will be a very strong accessories platform.
With this much as we've accomplished in fiscal '11, we have several new merchandise opportunities in '12. The first is inspired by Ralph's long time love of denim, one of the most iconic staples of the American wardrobe. At the luxury level, we are launching Black Label denim for men, which will complement and extend our modern Black Label sensibility, and women's collection denim, which is a new luxury denim lifestyle offering that we feel is unique to the marketplace.
At the premium level, we are launching Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply, an exciting new brand that captures the heritage of denim with an edgy, Bohemian attitude that is distinctly Ralph Lauren and perfect for the young customer. The launch of Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply offers incremental distribution for us in North America, where the merchandise will be sold through approximately 250 better department stores and on RalphLauren.com. Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply will replace the Polo Jeans Co. brand in Europe and Asia and will essentially maintain the existing distribution network for those products. The introduction of Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply is an important step in expanding our world of denim merchandising strategy. 
Fiscal '12 will also showcase a renewed focus on our Ralph Lauren and Lauren Home product merchandise categories. Over the last year, we've selectively taken more direct control of certain product categories including textiles, which had been one of our largest licenses, while finding best-in-class partners for others. We opened a new distribution center in May for Lauren textiles to include bedding and bath products. Today, we have categories of furniture, bedding and bath, table cloth, tops, lighting, rugs, fabrics, wall coverings, gifts and accessories. All the key classifications in home are in place to deliver an impactful and integrated lifestyle presentation for our customer, which we believe will support new growth opportunities.
For Home, in fiscal '12, we intend to enhance distribution by partnering with our wholesale customers to showcase the products and implement strategic merchandising initiatives that appropriately tell the story of our collections. We already have a handful of flagship locations for each of our Home products: 888 Madison Avenue in New York; our store in Greenwich, Connecticut, and London for Ralph Lauren Home; and Lord & Taylor in New York City for Lauren Home. We are also gaining traction with department stores and specialty stores in Europe.
So clearly, a lot accomplished in fiscal '11 with more opportunity in the future, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,131507233,131612,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent full year operating results, and the fourth quarter, which despite the impact of meaningful calendar shifts that we described to you on our third quarter ear",2442,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent full year operating results, and the fourth quarter, which despite the impact of meaningful calendar shifts that we described to you on our third quarter earnings call, exceeded our expectations given the continued momentum in our business. Incremental sales and profit within our Retail segment were the primary drivers of the upside, with all regions of the world contributing to the outperformance, although the heaviest concentration was achieved in the United States. 
Before I provide you with further insight into the fourth quarter's operational drivers, I do need to remind you of the nature of the calendar shifts we told you about in February that negatively affect comparisons with our prior-year periods, impacts that were reflected in the guidance we previously provided you for the fourth quarter. Roger mentioned them as well, and they do include an extra 53rd week that was in our results last year in the fourth quarter and a later Easter week this year that shifted that holiday sales growth into the first quarter of our fiscal 2012 versus the fourth quarter that we're reporting now. Lastly, we also mentioned the timing of the high-volume sales week post-Christmas that fell within our third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. On a normalized calendar basis, we estimate the shifts alone negatively affected our reported sales growth in the quarter by approximately 10 full percentage points.
Unless otherwise noted, my discussion of our fourth quarter business performance is based on our reported GAAP financial results, which reflect a 13-week period for fiscal 2011 and a 14-week period for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
On a reported basis, consolidated net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, 7% above the prior-year period and led by a double-digit gain in Retail segment sales. Our Retail performance was better than we expected in several areas, including same-store sales, the contribution from new stores and our performance in Asia, excluding Japan. We did not incur any meaningful impact from foreign currency translations on our consolidated fourth quarter sales as the strengthening of the Japanese yen was mostly offset by a modest weakening of the euro relative to last year.
The gross profit margin of 56.8% was essentially in line with our expectations. As we have communicated all year, we have incurred cost-of-goods inflation for this year's spring/summer season, and we determined that we would not make any material changes to our pricing until the upcoming fall season. Some of the inflationary cost-of-goods pressure we experienced in the fourth quarter was offset by a higher level of full-price selling at most of our retail concepts and the seasonal variations in our overall channel mix.
Operating expenses of $693 million were 12% above the prior-year period, and the operating expense margin rose 240 basis points to 48.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting incremental expenses associated with our newly transitioned South Korean operations, the continued investment in our growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation costs.
Fourth quarter operating income of $117 million was 32% below the prior-year period, primarily due to the calendar shifts affecting the comparability with the prior-year period and the lower gross profit margin and higher expense rate I just discussed.
Net income was $73 million, and net income per diluted share was $0.74 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter at 34.4% was approximately 250 basis points higher than the prior-year period as a greater proportion of our earnings were generated in higher tax jurisdictions.
Due to the timing of the natural disasters in Japan, which occurred in the latter part of our fiscal fourth quarter, the financial impact on our reported results was relatively modest at approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
Moving on to segment highlights. Wholesale segment sales rose 2% to $752 million in the fourth quarter as strong growth in U.S. Wholesale shipments, continued growth in department stores in Europe, as well as expanded distribution in Greater China were mostly offset by a planned decline in Japanese Wholesale shipments and softness in some European specialty stores, most notably in Italy.
Wholesale operating income was $136 million in the fourth quarter, and the operating profit margin was 18.2% compared to 24.9% in the prior-year period. The decline in margin rate is primarily attributable to the cost-of-goods inflation, lower Japanese Wholesale shipments and continued investment in new merchandise categories.
The 14% increase in Retail segment sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 primarily reflects strong momentum at our factory stores worldwide and on RalphLauren.com, as well as the incremental contribution from newly transitioned South Korea operations. Overall, comparable store sales, which I'm referencing on a 13-week to 13-week basis, increased 7%, which was achieved on top of a 16% gain in the prior-year period and, of course, excludes the sales at the Asian stores and concession shops that we assumed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. These sales will be included in our comps beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as they are fully anniversaried.
The 3% decline in Ralph Lauren comps during the fourth quarter is entirely due to our Retail Japanese operation. Excluding Japan, Ralph Lauren comps were flat on top of a 17% increase in the prior-year period. Sales trends at our global flagship locations worldwide, many of which are not in our comp base, have been very strong, which is consistent with the rebound in sales of global luxury products. Factory store comps rose 8% in the fourth quarter, Club Monaco comps were up 10%, with excellent performance in trend-right women's fashions, and sales at RalphLauren.com increased 21%.
Across all Retail formats, customers are responding to our compelling product content, as Jacki mentioned, and our focused merchandising strategies. Our strong third quarter sales provided us with a good start to full-price spring selling in the fourth quarter. In the United States, high-traffic urban locations and popular tourist destinations for both Ralph Lauren and factory stores continue to post the strongest sales trends for us. We also achieved better conversion rates on higher traffic levels this quarter.
In Europe, unseasonably cold weather and civil unrest in the Middle East during the quarter negatively affected customer traffic across the continent, although trends improved meaningfully in the latter part of the period. Performance in our Greater China and South Korea concession shops was also better than anticipated during the quarter. Japan sales trended down approximately 30% in the weeks following the earthquake and tsunami compared to relatively flat performance in the quarter-to-date period prior to the disasters. Retail segment operating income of $26 million was 40% greater than the prior-year period, and the operating margin improved 80 basis points to 4.1%.
Strong comp growth and higher full price sell-throughs more than offset the short-term dilutive impact of South Korea, investment in international e-commerce, cost inflation and extraordinary items such as the business disruption in Japan.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $44 million, 6% below the prior-year period. Higher fragrance licensing revenues were more than offset by a decline in international licensing revenues related to the South Korea transition. We also had Lauren Home product licensing revenues as a result of some of the strategic changes that Jacki spoke to earlier. The 19% decline in licensing operating income in the fourth quarter is attributable to the same international and home effects that impacted sales for licensing.
Consolidated inventory was up 39% at the end of the fourth quarter on a reported basis. Approximately half of the increase in dollars is to support the anticipated sales growth and shipment cadence highlighted in our fiscal 2012 outlook. And 1/4 of the increase is related to newly transitioned Asian operations within fiscal 2011. As you’ll recall, we had unusually low inventory levels this time last year from the transition of the Southeast Asia and Greater China region, and our South Korean inventory is entirely incremental this year versus last year.  The remaining 1/4 of the increase is attributable to cost-of-goods inflation and foreign currency dynamics. With a relatively flat inventory turn and near-term sales expectations in the first quarter, we remain comfortable with the content and currency of our inventory.
We spent approximately $255 million in capital expenditures during the fiscal 2011 to support our retail store and wholesale shop development worldwide, in addition to continued infrastructure investments. We also repurchased approximately 6 million shares of stock for an aggregate of $578 million during the year, including 2 million shares for $247 million during the fourth quarter. And as Roger mentioned, yesterday, our board authorized an additional $500 million for share repurchase, bringing our total current authorizations to $972 million.
We ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash and investments after funding all of our capital and acquisition cost needs and returning a substantial amount of capital to shareholders via our share repurchase activity, as well as a doubling of the dividend. 
Fiscal 2011 was clearly a year of tremendous progress for advancing our strategic objectives, while still growing earnings at a double-digit rate. And we are encouraged by the current momentum of our underlying business trends, even though we are mindful and experiencing intensifying inflationary dynamics that are beginning to broadly affect consumers. While we are currently benefiting from strong demand for our products across most channels and formats worldwide, we are increasingly impacted by the inflationary pressure on cost of goods as evidenced by our fourth quarter gross margin dynamics. As most of you know, the cost of goods inflation we began to experience in the second half of fiscal 2011 intensifies in fiscal '12 with fall inventory receipts. 
Beginning this fall, as Roger indicated, we made what we believe are responsible, selective pricing adjustments to mitigate a portion of the impact. In general, we've determined not to pass on the full impact of our higher cost of goods, and the magnitude of inflation is such that we do expect our gross profit margin and, therefore, our operating margin, to be down in fiscal 2012. We believe the customer, the consumer, will accept some higher prices due to the strength of our brand and the consistent quality of our merchandise. But after a decade of apparel deflation, the actual customer reaction remains unknown until the merchandise is available for sale in the stores. 
We also remain committed to our strategy of investing in growth initiatives in infrastructure during fiscal 2012, including international retail expansion and e-commerce and continued systems enhancements. Sequencing these types of investments as we have in the past should help to drive profit growth in future years.
Now I'd like to briefly review our initial expectations for the year that we outlined in this morning's press release. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase in the mid-20s range, a rate of growth that is an acceleration of the momentum we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2011 and is positively impacted by the benefit of the later Easter sales I highlighted earlier. Wholesale revenues are expected to increase at a low 20% rate based on strong shipment growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Retail segment sales are expected to grow slightly faster than Wholesale revenues, a function of low double-digit comparable store sales growth and the contribution from new stores and concession shops, inclusive of our incremental South Korean concession shops and stores. 
Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately equivalent to the prior-year period, with a higher Retail mix offsetting the continued margin decline in Wholesale due to cost of goods. We will also incur higher operating expenses related to the continued investment in our growth initiatives across geographies, distribution channels and emerging product categories. 
For the full fiscal 2012 period, we expect revenues to increase at a mid-teens rate with Retail segment sales again growing slightly faster than Wholesale revenues. Our full year operating margin is expected to decline 100 to 150 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit margin pressure I discussed earlier. We also continue to monitor our performance closely in Japan, post the unfortunate incidents of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis. As the entire nation is obviously preoccupied with its safety and relief efforts, we currently expect the initial disruption and subsequent irregular shopping patterns in Japan to negatively impact our fiscal results, which is also reflected in our sales and margin guidance. 
We will also support our growth initiatives with advertising and marketing spending for our new product introductions to generate more awareness for emerging product categories such as denim and to support our international expansion efforts. We have excluded any potential extraordinary charges that may result from our Greater China repositioning efforts. These charges could range from $10 million the $20 million depending on the timing of the closure. 
Our fiscal 2012 tax rate is planned at approximately 33% based on our forecasted income mix and excluding any discrete items. We intend to spend approximately $325 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 to support our Retail and Wholesale growth initiatives and the consistent upgrading of our global infrastructure. We currently expect to open 34 new stores and 47 concession shops during the year and close 65 stores and shops in the Greater China region as part of the repositioning that was discussed earlier by Roger. 
And much of our capital next year is dedicated to our international growth efforts, including continued expansion of Ralph Lauren in the Asia Pacific region, the introduction of Rugby and Club Monaco brands into Europe and the launch of Denim & Supply, with shops in leading department stores around the world. 
So we've communicated a lot to you this morning regarding our results and our plans for this year. We are clearly balancing multiple factors in our fiscal '12 outlook with the realities of the margin pressure as we execute our plans. Over the years, our team has demonstrated incredible agility when faced with highly uncertain market environments, and we expect the same to be true in fiscal 2012 as we navigate through the near-term impacts of commodity inflation. Our ability to gain share in our largest markets and expand merchandise categories is enabling us to build additional platforms for future growth, and our financial strength and increasing cash generation prowess allow us the flexibility to invest in opportunities that will yield substantive future returns for our shareholders.

Again, our operating margin guidance does exclude, as I mentioned, any potential restructuring charges that might occur from the Greater China repositioning, so we would expect some slight SG&A leverage, excluding any charges.

We are continuing to invest in advertising as we rebrand our product in the market, and those are investments that will accelerate in fiscal 2012."

One, the fourth quarter results we've reported is a bit of a Haley's Comet. The unusual combination of an extra week, the loss of Easter, the loss of the week after Christmas,",494,"Yes, Adrianne, let me just cover a couple of the questions you've got in there. One, the fourth quarter results we've reported is a bit of a Haley's Comet. The unusual combination of an extra week, the loss of Easter, the loss of the week after Christmas, really is a bit of a false read that I think Tracey tried to capture for you. If you take the run rate of sales through our third quarter, adjusted fourth quarter and the guidance we’ve provided for first quarter, you'll see that business really is quite strong, and really, all merchandise categories in all regions and all channels are contributing to that. So we're actually encouraged with the customers' response to our products and strategies. We did not take many price increases in the spring, even though we began to see some costs rising, but we have for fall. And those increases really are very dependent on the price point of the product and the merchandise categories. The actual cost-of-goods inflation, depending on the products, range from low- to mid-single-digits all the way up into the low-20s. And when you look at the breadth of product we have from the highest levels of collection in Purple Label down to products we make for Chaps, for Cole's [Kenneth Cole] and Penney's [J.C. Penney], some of the bigger cost movements were in the lower portion of that pyramid, and that's where we were more cautious about passing on the products as they came through. I also believe, and this is one person's opinion, that the cost of goods that we've all seen and read and talk so much about will begin to moderate into spring and fall of next year. I think that the supply and demand imbalance was real, and some of the other costs got run up for other reasons, and I think the more natural supply and demand will begin to take effect as we look at next year. So our point of view has been, we're not going to alter the quality, we're not going to alter the materials, trim, findings or the cut of the products. We're not going to alter where we make goods because our principles of product and product integrity has been so critical to our success, we think the customers want the same product and are going to pay more for it where appropriate. And then I think this pig in a python is going to play itself out over the next couple of seasons. We raised our gross margin in the last 7 years 900 basis points. So I think we've become very expert at sourcing, logistics and distribution, merchandising and really felt that a short-term blip was not something to throw us off our strategic mission. So a lot of that's embedded in your question, and I've expanded it in an effort to try to cover some of what I know is on all of your minds."

Club Monaco, as you've been following, Robbie, the comps for years now has been extraordinarily successful with identifying their customer, the product offering and then the price value of what they've made. I think you also know that today, that production has been integrated into our overall manufacturing cycle. So we've had, for years, a lot of international retailers, knocking on the door, looking to get Club Monaco distributed in their market. We have partnered in Asia with distribution experts. But in Europe, our European team really felt that they had the ability to distribute it to key retailers as a Wholesale business, as well as looking at stand-alone store distribution. We had a test this February that started with Brown's in London that was extraordinarily successful, and we just think that product really appeals to an international customer. We see that in a lot of our New York stores, where we get a lot of tourists who are coming in to buy product they can't get in other parts of the world. So we think Club Monaco represents an opportunity, not only in Asia where we are, and we're growing successfully, but in Europe. Rugby, we'll be opening our first store in Europe later this year in London. There, again, we've had -- whether it's on the website or whether it's in the stores here in New York, we've had a tremendous reaction from our international customers. We opened a store in Japan last year that actually is the #2 store in volume in our network, and so we think Europe represents opportunities and are looking for additional locations going forward with Rugby.

That will now take place for fall. So that will be the transition for Europe and Asia. The exciting part about the development of this brand is, now, we're planning a reintroduction in the U.S. of this vibrant category, and it will be launched in about 250 stores in the U.S. and in Canada. And with prime locations in men's and women's, with a very fresh impactful presentation, there will be strong marketing placed behind it, really speaking to this young customer. Our plan is to take a very unique style of marketing this product, really reaching this audience in a very unique way, and our plans for what and exactly will be done will be developed and you'll see over the next couple of months.

And I think as the Internet has added to the U.S. distribution pattern both our own and Wholesale as we keep launching new product categories like footwear, dresses, handbags, denim. The U.S. growth is equal to the extraordinary international growth. So I think as Tracey gave you some guidance to the first quarter and the full year, we are actually getting growth around the horn.

Each of those markets were run by a separate license group. So as we took back Japan, separate from China, Hong Kong, separate from Korea, each one of those were the transition of a long-term license to our ownership and control",650,"Yes, it's a good question. Each of those markets were run by a separate license group. So as we took back Japan, separate from China, Hong Kong, separate from Korea, each one of those were the transition of a long-term license to our ownership and control. And the Japanese business and the South Korea business are really heavily driven by department store shop-in-shops, and those marketplaces are heavily dominated by department store shop-in-shops. Those businesses, over many years, had a focus of men's casual, Blue Label sportswear. And in Japan, where we've had control of the business longer, we've seen tremendous reaction from the customer as we've begun to elevate product in women's and in kids and in other product categories as we've added visual enhancements and clarity, as we've sharpened our message, pre the earthquake and tsunami, we were beginning to see nice trends in what overall was a tough market. And one of the guidance issues for '12 isn't that Japan is not beginning to show some recovery from that, but it was against what our run rates would have been prior to that. Korea, where in fact, we've now had the business only for 5 months, we took on a terrific team of people that came with the acquisition, who really knew their products. And although the licensee did run down the inventories as we got to the end of the license in December, so we started January at a low level. As we've replenished inventory through the last 5 months, the customer there has responded, and that market has responded to better products, more elevated products and more fashion. So we feel very good about the long-term opportunity in Korea. Of course, many of you know that a lot of the business is in Seoul, Korea, and a lot of that business is fueled by Chinese tourists. Pricing in South Korea is less than it is in the mainland of China. So there is a healthy tourist component coming into Korea for shopping weekends. The year we've had China, Hong Kong and the rest of the Dickson portfolio has also been one of a slightly different challenge because we had to build an organization from scratch. We had no history on the merchandise. We had no infrastructure. Unlike the Japanese and Korea acquisition where we took on an existing team, we really had to build an organization from day one and get to know the stores and the territories. The other issue is that, that market will be dominated by stand-alone retail into the future. They're not really embedded in a department store-driven distribution channel. So our ability to identify and acquire key locations, both in major cities and more suburban malls will be a key to that market. We are clearly underdeveloped in women's. We're clearly underdeveloped in accessories and kids, and I think our goal would be to elevate and refine the men's business we have over time. The other thing I would just say so it doesn't get lost in the small print of the script, the Chinese are traveling the world. And many of the luxury brands that I talked to, talked powerfully about the impact of the Chinese tourist in their other international locations, like Paris or London or Milan or Switzerland. So we believe as we build up the proper presence and consistent with our global image in China, we will see those customers and the lift in our business in Europe, which we don't really get much of today. So it's really a holistic approach to the Chinese customer, slightly different than the Japanese and Korean markets that we think is absolutely exciting for the medium-term and long-term for this company. Let's continue to take questions. I know we're a little long because the end-of-the-year report was more robust , but we'll keep fielding questions for another few minutes."

I mean, clearly, in the 2 months right after the earthquake and tsunami, the tourist travel in Japan was dramatically down, although quite frankly, the Chinese tourist is today the dominant influence in really the gateway cities. One of the interesting subjects that's not often reported is the difficulty that Chinese tourists have to get visas to visit in the United States. So today, many of the tourists that are traveling out of China are really going to Europe. While that's a wonderful trip and a wonderful experience, we'd love to get more of them into the United States. But nevertheless, where you see Hawaii or other Asian destinations for tourism, the Japanese tourist is staying closer to home, although I think it's going to be a quarter-to-quarter update. We're already seeing some recovery in the mood and the spirit in Japan. There's definitely an attitude of trying to move on, and then we'll see how that plays out for the tourist business. But the headline issue on the tourist business is the Chinese, and their impact on the global shopping pattern, as I said earlier, is extraordinary, not just in their home market but as they move to other countries."

One of the other impacts that I didn't mention that is impacting, if you just look at our SG&A, is how we are growing. So we called out the fact that in the fourth quarter, Retail grew faster than Wholesale. In fiscal 2012, we also called out the fact that Retail is growing faster than Wholesale, and our strategies to grow Asia are primarily Retail growth, whether they're concessions shops or freestanding stores. That does have an impact on SG&A. It's a mix impact. So with Retail, you have higher gross profit and higher SG&A costs. So that too is impacting us. As it relates to fiscal '12, I can only point you back to the recession, when we were faced very suddenly with reduction in sales and made some prudent choices as it relates to discretionary spending and other spending as well. So certainly, if the sales don't materialize, which we're pretty comfortable they will, again, we have been very thoughtful in terms of how we've planned price increases. But there's a lot of other economics noise in the environment with gas prices and food prices rising and everything else, that we will certainly make prudent choices, if need be, to manage the year, as we have previously. And in the future, I think you can expect us to continue to invest in growth strategies. I think that has been working very well for us in the last few years. It's the reason why Jacki spoke about our tremendous footwear growth this year. It's the reason why Europe has contributed as much as it has over the last few years for us as a company. We have been very smart and thoughtful on the executive leadership team here under Ralph's direction of investing in high-return projects, both in the near-term as well as long-term, and we certainly will continue to do that. And Asia represents, again, a very exciting opportunity for us along those lines. Roger?"

We're obviously taking on expenses that used to be licensed, same for Korea, from a licensed category bringing it in-house. The launch of Denim & Supply, which is a new business, which comes with expenses before we start shipping. So we believe, Faye, that those will begin to moderate as we come full circle on most of the key license activities. And as we continue to see the kind of sales increases we've enjoyed, my expectation is we'll be able to leverage the expense line. And if I'm right, we'll begin to see, over the next 12 months, supply and demand get in better alignment, which will help mitigate some of the margin impacts. 
So I know we've run long this morning. We tried to cover a lot of information on fourth quarter, fiscal '12, some small highlights of the next 3-year outlook and what our focuses are going to be. We're very excited about the consumer trends and reactions to our strategies. We'll see how the fall pricing impacts. My guess is Polo Ralph Lauren product will continue to win and take market share, but when we get together in August to talk about early reads on fall, I think we'll have a better idea.

We're reporting excellent first quarter results today, with consolidated sales rising 32%, operating income increasing 62% and earnings per diluted share up 57%. Our performance reflects strong global momentum across merchandise categories, channels and regions and comes on top of equally strong results in the comparable prior-year period. We are expanding our market share on multiple dimensions as our Wholesale, Retail stores and e-commerce operations are all achieving strong rates of growth. We believe the broad base nature of our sales growth is a direct function of the clarity of Ralph's luxury lifestyle vision that runs through all that we do, from design to world-class marketing to our spectacular in-store presentations. We are leveraging this clarity of vision and purpose with an expanding range of merchandise and store environments around the world. 
Our results also demonstrate the relevance of our strategy as we consistently innovate new products, we're expanding our international presence and we continue to extend our direct-to-consumer reach which is all supported by our ongoing infrastructure investments and the focused development of our worldwide talent our worldwide talent. These strategies have enabled us to deliver consistent double-digit sales and earnings growth over the last 1, 5 or 10-year periods. The extraordinary profits flow-through we achieved on the quarter's better-than-expected sales highlights the power of our operating model, one that leverages the incredible strength and appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand, while respecting the uniqueness of each customer in a particular channel or region of the world. 
The sustained double-digit growth of our domestic operations across all channels is noteworthy, especially when we consider the scale of our business in the United States. The team continues to raise the bar and maximize the opportunities with our largest merchandise categories, while driving excellent productivity gains and incremental distributions of exciting new products. As we continue to make significant progress with our international development efforts, international revenues rose 60% during the quarter, accounting for 36% of our consolidated sales, a 600-basis point gain from the prior-year period. Our business is growing along many dimensions in Europe, including new wholesale and retail distribution, the expansion of existing and highly productive locations, and the contribution of new merchandise categories such as Lauren and accessories. We're also growing our presence in Eastern Europe and the Middle East through partnerships with strong locally based experts. 
There's a lot of excitement planned for the remainder of the year in Europe. We intend to launch e-commerce in France and Germany in the next 3 months and Club Monaco and Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply will be introduced into leading department stores this fall. And we're also opening our first European Rugby store in London Covent Gardens in a few weeks. 
In Asia, we are exceeding our sales and profit plans in all major regions. Everyday, we're learning more about this dynamic emerging region and we are steadily improving our operational capabilities. We've made the most impactful progress in Japan, which we've directly operated for 4 years. In that time, our sales trends have consistently outperformed the overall market. Our profitability has also improve substantially as we integrated Japan into our global sourcing and distribution organizations, we've invested in system upgrades and we've leveraged our best practices with respect to planning and merchandising. Our recent transition of the South Korean operation was executed seamlessly and the team has already begun relocating and renovating shops as part of our long-term market development strategy. We all co-commenced our multi-year brand repositioning efforts in Greater China, closing a handful of shops while simultaneously opening of more appropriate points of distribution that supports our luxury merchandise strategies and that can accommodate our growing accessory assortments. We're very pleased with the customer response to our elevated merchandising assortments throughout Asia, the ready acceptance of Ralph Lauren handbags and watches when they are appropriately merchandised in dedicated space is very encouraging. Especially since these categories are expected to be an important driver of our growth aspirations in the region. 
In the near-term, our locally based management teams remain focused on brand elevation efforts, expanding distribution for new and existing merchandise categories and identifying ways to leverage the shared services throughout the Asia-Pacific region as of the scale of our operations there expands. Our global direct-to-customer efforts are accelerating as evidenced by our impressive sales growth and substantial profit improvement of our Retail segment. Exceptional merchandise and customer services drove stronger conversion rates and higher full price sell-throughs in the quarter. Sales trends were strongest in the stores located in the world's major cities and destinations, which typically service both local and tourist customers. These stores tend to have the most compelling and complete representation of the World of Ralph Lauren and it's increasingly clear that customers want access to our full range of products and lifestyle sensibilities, especially accessories. 
The strength of our first quarter operating results is effectively an extension of the strategies that have supported our momentum over the last 12 to 24 months. But as you are all well aware the retail landscape is changing greatly as I year prices emerge with the full [indiscernible]. We will not to know the full impact of our pricing actions until mid- to late September year. By then the customers probably have had enough time to digest the new pricing paradigm and we should have a sound sense of the recent macroeconomic uncertainties have affected the global consumer sentiment and consumption trends. 
Over the last several weeks, it's becoming increasingly clear that the global macroeconomic environment is very fragile and that we are operating in the context of tremendous uncertainty and volatility. Austerity measures in the U.S. and Europe are a necessity, but the complexity and magnitude of these measures is unknown. Since the U.S. and Europe are important regions for us, we're very focused on modest monitoring how the customer reacts to these macro-dynamics. We have set the bar high with respect to our sales plans for the year, but we are confident in the rigor of our planning process and our ability to proactively manage the gates through emerging challenges. The sophistication of our sourcing, supply chain and logistics operations enable us to better read and react to changes in market dynamics than ever before. We're also confident in the strength of our merchandise assortments and we believe our unwavering commitment to the integrity of our products and our value propositions will remain a competitive advantage for us. 
The diversity and resilience of our operating model across channels, regions has typically served us well in turbulent times, which is why we remain committed to investing in our growth initiatives and infrastructure, particularly for the Asia-Pacific development and international e-commerce. This is consistent with the strategies that we have supported over sustained periods of time, including the last downturn when we're able to grow earnings despite the ongoing investment in our growth initiatives. By staying the course, we believe these investments will yield incremental returns for our shareholders over the long-term. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki for some merchandise highlights."

It is no question that the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across all channels worldwide is a function of best-in-class products and compelling merchandising strategies. Ralph's commitment to product innovation have enabled us to continually satisfy our customers and gain meaningful global market share. We have leveraged the sustained success of our most iconic products to gain traction with exciting and fast-moving new merchandise categories such as dresses, footwear and accessories. This morning, I'd like to take you through some key highlights of our home, childrenswear, denim and accessory initiatives. 
Today, we are delivering the World of Ralph Lauren in a more consistent, more competitive and more impactful way than ever before, taking the vision from design, to production, to merchandise, planning and ultimately to the in-store presentation. This consistently applied approach has supported the extraordinary growth we are experiencing across all product categories on a global scale. The clarity of our merchandise initiatives, which focus on assortment that offer outstanding value and unique channels of distribution has allowed us to achieve growth across all channels worldwide, from our own stores to leading department stores, specialty stores and of course the rapidly expanding online space. The strong customer appetite for our products is a testament to the vitality and desirability of the Ralph Lauren brand. In fact, the remarkable performance of our men's product, the foundation and origin of our entire company, is perhaps the best example of the brand's appeal around the world. The expansion of our assortments across Purple Label, Black Label, Polo, golf, RRL and RLX not only gives the loyal customer something fresh, but also attract a new customer into the World of Ralph Lauren menswear. 
Last quarter, I highlighted some strategic changes and how we're managing our Home category. I'm pleased to report that with more direct control over our bed and bath merchandise, which is our largest classification in terms of sales, we are already experiencing improved operating efficiencies, customer satisfaction and sell-through rates. We look forward to expanding our distribution and strengthening our productivity across all Home product categories worldwide over the next several years. 
Since acquiring our childrenswear license in 2005, we've developed a meaningful global presence that includes a wholesale distribution and stand-alone stores. We recently opened a childrenswear store in ocean terminal in Hong Kong, which joins our other stores throughout the U.S., Europe and Middle East. We are excited about the global growth prospects for childrenswear, particularly as we continue to apply merchandising strategies and operating disciplines that have worked so well for us in other categories. 
This fall, we're introducing a new active dimension to our boys apparel that take its inspiration from the sporting heritage of Polo and the contemporary aesthetic of RLX. With our leadership and more polished aspect of boys dressing, this active line really nicely rounds out our total offering. 
Denim & Supply, our new denim-based lifestyle collection for men and women, is launching now. Merchandise is being set in leading department stores worldwide and will be available on RalphLauren.com on August 11. Denim & Supply was developed to speak to a 20-something customer in a fresh and distinctive way that is still grounded in the heritage and authenticity of Ralph Lauren. Based on the demographic, we will have a strong online presence to drive awareness and interest in the Brand. Wholesale customers around the world have responded favorably to the merchandise. Orders for the fall season were strong, confirming the ease in which we expect to replace and significantly upgrade the former Polo Jeans Co. brand throughout Europe and Asia. The product and in-store environments are spectacular and the quality, authenticity and distinctiveness of the brand really shines. There is truly no other denim line quite like this and we believe customers will respond very favorably. 
Consistent with our overall corporate focus, accessories are an integral part of the overall assortment. Denim & Supply is the latest component of our tier-denim strategy that includes our women's collection, denims business Black Label denim for men's and as well as denim in the existing RRL, Polo and Lauren lines. The progress we are making with accessories each season is very exciting. As the Ralph Lauren and luxury handbag in footwear as a man expand global customers interest in an appetite have been strong. We are experiencing the same success in the Wholesale channel with our Polo and Lauren accessories brands and we intend to meaningfully expand global distribution of these products over the next few years. Our increasingly diversed global sales base and product mix, our ability to continually gain share in our largest markets and product categories, our success of expanding into new merchandise categories and of course the unrivaled power and prestige of the Ralph Lauren brand, our enabling us to build new strong new platforms for future growth and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey."

As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent first quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 32% greater than the prior-year period and better than the mid-20s sales growth",2016,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent first quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 32% greater than the prior-year period and better than the mid-20s sales growth expectations we outlined for you in May. The increase in net revenues reflects double-digit gains at our Wholesale and Retail segments, both exceeding our original expectations for the quarter. Sales of our core apparel merchandise categories, particularly our men's product across all channels of distribution, our strong e-commerce growth and performance at our factory stores worldwide surpassed even our robust initial expectations. Sales in Japan also stabilized more quickly than we anticipated, following the earthquake and tsunami events in March. And of the 32% net revenue growth, favorable currency translation did impact our total reported revenue growth by approximately 4 percentage points. 
Our gross profit margin of 63%, which was 120 basis points greater than the prior-year period was driven entirely by our Retail segment and reflects strong full price sell-throughs and a higher penetration of international store and concession sales. These benefits more than offset the negative impact of cost of goods inflation across all Wholesale and Retail formats. The improvement in the first quarter gross profit margin was another contributor to our outperformance relative to the expectations we communicated in May. As Jacki mentioned, the strength of our merchandise assortments across apparel and accessories, combined with our in-store presentations, continue to support highly profitable sell-throughs across all channels of our business. 
Operating expenses of $679 million were 26% greater than the prior-year period. The increase in operating expenses were driven by overall growth in our core operations, an increase in our retail channel mix, incremental costs associated with the newly transitioned South Korea and Home operations and continued investment in our other strategic growth initiatives, including international e-commerce, new store openings and infrastructure support. Currency translation also impacted expense growth by approximately 4%. We were able to achieve 210 basis points of operating expense leverage during the quarter, primarily as a result of better-than-expected sales growth and this was another important contributor to our outperformance relative to our first quarter expectation. As a result of our strong sales growth, our operating income of $282 million was 62% greater than the prior-year period. We achieved a record operating margin of 18.5%, which was 340 basis points above the prior-year period. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 increased 52% to $184 million and net income per diluted share rose 57% to $1.90. 
The higher effective tax rate of 33% this year compared to 29% in the prior-year period, primarily reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items last year and is consistent with our guidance to you on the fourth quarter. 
Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter. Our Wholesale segment reported sales increase of 29% to $673 million and constant dollar sales increased 25%. As I mentioned earlier, shipments of our core apparel and accessories merchandise sell-through at exceptionally strong rates, which allows for increased replenishment across several categories. 
In Europe, strength in sales in the U.K., Germany and France across virtually all brands offset the continued softness we have experienced in sales in Italy. Wholesale operating margin and operating income in the first quarter rose 14% to $151 million and the Wholesale operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 22.5%. The substantial improvement in Wholesale operating income and margin rate was entirely a result of higher global shipment volumes and expense leverage on the better-than-expected shipment growth which more than offset the impact of cost of goods inflation. 
For our Retail group, first quarter sales rose 37% to $814 million and were up 33% in constant dollars, reflecting strong comparable store sales growth across all Retail concepts. The contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from our newly assumed South Korean operations. Retail sales also benefited from a late Easter this year, which we estimate contributed approximately 2% to total segment growth for the quarter. 
Overall, comp store sales increased 19%, reflecting 14% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, 20% increase at factory stores and 16% growth at Club Monaco stores. RalphLauren.com sales continue to expand at a double-digit rate, increasing 28% in the first quarter. Our comp gains were achieved through a mixture of transaction growth and average dollar sales growth, with the latter mostly due to higher full-priced sales in our stores. Urban markets and key tourist destinations, particularly in the U.S. continue to outperform average traffic trends and concession shops sales across Asia were exceptionally strong in the quarter. We opened 7 directly operated freestanding stores, closed 6 stores and assumed control of 3 formerly licensed locations during the quarter, ending the period with 371 company-operated stores. We also operated 535 concession shop locations globally at the end of the first quarter. 
Retail segment operating income grew 67% to $173 million in the first quarter and the Retail operating margin increased 380 basis points to 21.3%. This substantial improvement in Retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate comes as a result of strong comparable store sales growth as I mentioned earlier and higher price sell-throughs which drove broad-based Robert improvement across most Retail concepts, particularly in the U.S. and in Asia. Retail operating income also benefited from the inclusion of the South Korean acquisition this year. The improved Retail segment profitability was partially offset by cost of goods inflation. 
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $40 million, 6% greater than the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and primarily due to increased fragrance royalties that were partially offset by lower international Licensing royalties related to the transition of formerly licensed South Korean operations. Operating income for our Licensing segment rose 6% to $25 million as a result. 
Our financial condition remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $981 million in cash and investments and $677 million in net cash and that was after investing over $300 million in share repurchase activity within the quarter. Consolidated inventory was up 42% at the end of the first quarter on a reported basis. In-transit inventory was an important driver of the overall increase as we have taken ownership of certain key items of our merchandise earlier than normal. We made this decision in an effort to minimize any potential supply-chain disruption that could have been a potential risk when we were replacing our fall orders last year when both factory and transportation capacity was extraordinarily tight and cotton prices were at peak levels. Approximately half of the increase in dollars is to support the anticipated sales growth and shipment cadence of comparable product categories, geographies and channels. Approximately 30% of the increase is attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency impacts and the remaining 20% of the increase is related to new merchandise categories or new business operations such as South Korea, Home textile, Denim & Supply in the U.S. and international e-commerce. And with the assumption of realizing our current sales projections, we remain comfortable with the content and currency of our inventory. We expect inventory growth to become progressively more aligned with sales trends throughout fiscal 2012 as we cycle through changes and year-over-year shipment cadence. 
We spent approximately $39 million on CapEx during the first quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock, utilizing $302 million of our current authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $670 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. We informed you back in May that our first quarter results were expected to be a continuation of the strong performance we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2011, prior to the full impact of fall price increases. And our first quarter results are truly exceptional by any measure and they were achieved on top of very strong operating performance in the prior-year period, as Roger mentioned. While we have begun this new fiscal year with broad-based momentum across all regions in our business, we have incurred as we anticipated, 4 substantial cost of goods inflation with fall shipment in the second quarter and have made thoughtful and selective pricing adjustments by brand and by region to help mitigate some of the intensifying inflationary pressures. This is expected to have a negative impact on our balance of year fiscal 2012 gross margin, particularly as we make large fall shipments at Wholesale in the second quarter. And although the price of cotton and other commodities have recently retreated from peak levels, initial costs projections for our spring 2012 merchandise are aligned with the expectations embedded in our initial fiscal 2012 outlook, which we provided you on the last call. 
As Roger highlighted earlier, it is unclear how the recent and extraordinary volatility in the global equity and credit markets might affect global consumer sentiment and demand. At this point, we intend to continue executing against our regional strategic objectives and sales plans for fiscal 2012. We are closely monitoring trends across all channels and regions in order to proactively address any material changes that could affect our plans and outlook for the year, which I'd like to review with you now. 
For the second quarter, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high-teens to a low-20s percent. Our expectations are based on mid-teens increase in global Wholesale sales and a mid-20% increase in Retail segment sales and as a reminder, the acquisition of the South Korea license is noncomp for us until the fourth quarter this year and is driving approximately 3% of the overall year-over-year sales growth I just mentioned. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points below that achieved in the comparable year period. This decline is a relatively equal mix of gross margin pressure from cost of goods inflation and higher operating expenses. The anticipated deleverage in our operating expenses is primarily related to the timing of cost, related to additional channel distribution expansions, including preopening costs for a portion of the 34 new stores and 47 shops we intend to open worldwide during fiscal 2012, e-commerce investments for Ralph Lauren sites in France and Germany and for Club Monaco in North America and the incremental expense of our South Korean operations. 
So based on our strong first quarter performance, we have raised our full year fiscal 2012 sales and profit outlook. And for the full year fiscal 2012 period, we now expect revenues to increase at a mid- to high-teens rate, which compares to our prior expectation of mid-teens growth. Our full year operating margin outlook is now estimated to be down 50 to 100 basis points from the prior-year period, which is an improvement relative to our initial expectation of 100 to 150 basis points decline. In addition to the investments we are making throughout Asia and in international e-commerce, we currently still intend to support our growth expectations with incremental advertising and marketing, which we believe is critical to generate more awareness for new and emerging categories and to raise our profile in international markets. We have revised our expectations of the restructuring charges associated with our Greater China repositioning efforts to $8 million to $12 million for the full year and those costs are not included in the operating margin outlook I just provided you. 
The exceptional process [indiscernible] through in our better-than-expected first quarter sales reflect both the innovation and execution of discipline of our organization, particularly as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives and while the challenge of the near-term economic uncertainty is real, we will continue to balance this reality with the investments that we believe are appropriate to continue to drive long-term shareholder value creation. 
We have a clear, compelling growth strategy ahead of us and our company has a long standing track record of success in executing against our strategies. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that."

One, we would not alter the quality, make, materials or findings of any of our products and we chose very specifically to make sure our customers maintain the quality they've come to expect. Having made that decision, the price increases are different by merchandise categories and different merchandise categories play out also geographically differently. So what we really tried to do was take the product categories and the regions and come up with an overall point of view about what to pass on and what not. I think embedded in the second quarter guidance reflects some margin pressure because the cost of goods in general are higher than all the prices we passed on. But not unlike the first quarter, our strategy of quality first and merchandising the pricing, we think drives the sell-throughs and market share opportunities again at the first quarter exemplified the kind of flow-through we can get. So by market, by merchandise categories, some sensitivity, the channel, the distribution, mid-tier versus luxury, were baked into the matrix of pricing that second and third quarter reflects. I think as Tracey talked about while we are seeing raw materials come down for next spring, there's a lot of merchandising of old higher-priced yarns and materials with new pricing that will play out through spring. So if raw materials stay down by summer and next fall, I think we'll begin to see overall cost of goods come down. By then, we'll know how the customers react to the price increases and where we go from there."

Let me try to answer it this way. Our model is an integrated model and whether it's Europe, United States or now, Asia, we've gotten much better at trying to think through channels of distribution and appropriateness",434,"Well, it's a very important question. Let me try to answer it this way. Our model is an integrated model and whether it's Europe, United States or now, Asia, we've gotten much better at trying to think through channels of distribution and appropriateness of how we speak to the customer, whether it's brick and mortar retail, freestanding stores or concession, or whether it's online or e-commerce, we try to marry that by market against the wholesale points of distribution that we feel are appropriate. Clearly, in this quarter, with the addition of important business in Asia, Retail was larger than Wholesale, which is kind of new for us. I think we'll see a similar phenomena in our third quarter and then second and fourth quarters is for us our larger Wholesale quarters Retail being a bit smaller. But the success that you're seeing in the numbers and you see in the stores is really a result of many, many years for those who have followed the story of investing in talent, in products, in presentation and very innovative marketing. The car show we have going on in Paris has been extraordinarily successful and has helped build the brand awareness in that market where we have important Retail and where we have also important Wholesale. So the entire model is make an integrated pieces clearly direct to consumer, brick-and-mortar or online is a growing part of our business and will be the dominant part of our Asia business. There's no doubt that each country has a different distribution model but in Asia, the bulk of the business will come through flagships, dedicated freestanding stores either by men or women or accessories. We've opened recently a kid's store that's been extraordinarily successful. So the opportunities in Asia is almost unlimited and most of that will be approached by our ability to execute at Retail. Today, our Retail profitability in the merchandise categories that we're in I think stands second to no one. And as we grow the accessory business and that becomes an increased part of our direct-to-consumer, I think it's only going to get better. Where we've given accessory space to our own stores, whether it's Madison Avenue or Belle Harbor or our recent store we opened in Hong Kong in the Peninsula, the reaction to accessories whether it's handbags or watches or belts or scarves has been truly satisfying. So we really think we're on the right trend and the combination of accessory growth, Asia growth and the success in U.S. and Europe, I think we'll continue to push the Retail to higher heights."

Our second quarter, I think, I was saying to Omar, the penetration of the Wholesale, the Retail begins to flip. So with that, we get a different kind of margin mix and the impact of cost of goods hits the mark up. What work so extraordinarily well in the first quarter was the full price sell-throughs and that was true to Wholesale or Retail or online and that really drove the extraordinary margin performance that allowed us to ride over the cost of goods increases. If that were to repeat itself in the second quarter and at the moment, our forecast do not include a 19% comp store Retail increase, but if that were to occur, my guess is that the guidance would look conservative in hindsight. But I think at this point, sitting here in the early part of August, we really haven't gotten enough of a read on full products and we haven't got enough of a read on the new pricing to make that kind of prediction. So more to follow as the customer begins to react to products. What we have delivered for fall, whether it's in Ralph Lauren brands or Club Monaco that does seem to be resonating with the customer is really wear-now fabrics, silhouettes, in full colors. So we're getting a good read on those new deliveries and that's a good sign for what second quarter May bring us. But at this point, it's really based more on the mix than anything else."

It's a huge category in the U.S. and one that I'm surprised we're sitting here today saying you guys have a bigger share. Is there something structurally gives you more confidence as you refocus on it now versus how you proposed in the past and what they think is maybe cause of construct results ship your expectations in the past is you reenter that category?"

Interestingly enough, historically, first quarters is our highest gross margin quarter in the year and that's not only driven by the growing Retail penetration. But it's really about the product mix because April, May, June period for us is heavily key item classification, high margin, strong sell-through time of year. And those products tend to come with higher margins. So even though we're up to a record-setting level this first quarter, we've historically run higher margins in the first quarter than the rest of the year. The second, third or fourth quarters tend to be more similar as we work our way through the year, particularly second and fourth quarter tend to be more collection deliveries. And then first and third quarter tend to be more key item and classification. So there's a lot of products mix within the channels and within the segments that do alter meaningfully the gross margin by quarter. The denim question, we agree with you. We think it's an extraordinary opportunity. We think no one has a sit at the table larger than Ralph Lauren. And I think we're now very comfortable with the pyramid of denim that we're representing to the customer. So the high-end RRL, where we just opened a new store downtown, if you haven't seen it, but we're very pleased with how that's performing, whether it's in the 72 Street store or whether it's in our freestanding stores, we are really looking for that business to not only in halo but grow into a business of size and scale as it's already the hottest item we have in Japan and will later this fall open a store in London. From there, we actually have this fall Black Label denim coming, which we think is an important extension of the Black Label customers and sensibility. You'll see that in our stores later this year and we think that speaks to a very specific audience. And then as Jacki talked about, the relaunch of a broader based denim which will not only replaced here in the United States the Polo Jeans business but in Europe and in Asia, we think profiles us against that business beautifully. So that for us is the beginning of a worldwide opportunity in men's and women's and then of course there's a trickle down into kid's. So we don't disagree that the denim business is an enormous opportunity and there are no structural or brand carriers to have that succeed."

I'm not sure at this point we can do anything about it other than watch it play out. We have not seen yet any impact on our customers, both here in the United States or Europe but as Tracey said, we're watching it carefully. A lot of the issues that seems to be behind the volatility are not new issues. So the uncertainty over debt in Europe, some of the issues here in the United States are not ones that have just come up in the last week. So what is creating the volatility? Where the consumer begins to be impacted by it? We really don't know. So we are, until proven otherwise, pressing ahead with our plans and we feel good about the trends. The first quarter was clearly a big downpayment on the year. The business in Asia, while it's infant state is still very strong. And we're seeing good strong global tourism. So at this point, we're watching carefully but our forecast reflect our best thinking. The Retail accessory question that you mentioned, I think if you go to the 72 Street store, where we've devoted the entire main floor to our accessory businesses, if you went to Paris, if you went to the Peninsula in Hong Kong or any of the new stores, you can see that the distortion we've given accessories and our thoughts are to circle back on many of our key flagships and look at how to make those stores similarly reflect our commitment and belief. Having gotten back the footwear business and then the accessory business, more leather, goods belts over the years, I think we've built extraordinarily talented teams of people, we have developed the sourcing capabilities and I think you're now beginning to see that reflected in the products that the customers are seeing and where we've given a proper representation [indiscernible] voting yes.

So we've got total visibility to all of our inventory worldwide. As a matter of fact, I think in somewhat of a pioneering investment, we also have visibility into raw materials, where it is in the manufacturing cycle, where it is in the transportation cycle. And so any part of that, that you want to review, you can. One of the things we chose to do was concern about factory capacity and transportation capacity was the pull forward inventory in order to minimize disruption. That also allows us to be most efficient in our transportation and distribution costs. But one of the things we were able to do with that pull forward, which we used our balance sheet to carry heavier inventories coming out of June, is ensure timely deliveries, which are driving sales and I think the cost of goods is somewhat impacted positively by more thoughtful transportation and logistics, which did save us some in the margin component. So we do have it by region, channel, brand and we're managing that carefully. I think as Tracey said, by the end of the second quarter, I think you'll see some of these in-transit and some of these pull forward in the fall, level back out.

You're either distributing through mono-brand stores or through specialty distribution and I think they're not only filling it, they're struggling with their own cash flows.

And while it's an important country to us, I think you can see in the overall international results and particularly the European results, the strong countries i.e. France and Germany, the U.K., the Scandinavian markets are all so extraordinarily strong that we're managing the softness in Southern Europe whether it's Italy or to some degree, Spain. In Asia, we're really in our infancy and our ability to work with the existing networks that we took back from our licensees reposition those and move forward as we're elevating product and content, we're also looking at pricing. So we're trying to take a more global point of view on the appropriateness of price differentiation whether it's Japan or China or South Korea. The Asian customer is very savvy and cross-shops whether they cross-shops within Asia Pac, or whether they travel to Europe. Spending the subject of global pricing excluding for a moment the duties is going to be one in the future. In general, we were priced through our licensed distribution too low.

We're reporting excellent first quarter results today with consolidated sales rising 32%, operating income increasing 62% and earnings per diluted share up 57%. Our performance reflects strong global momentum across merchandise categories, channels and regions and comes on top of equally strong results in the comparable prior year period. We are expanding our market share on multiple dimensions as our wholesale, retail stores and e-commerce operations are all achieving strong rates of growth. We believe the broad-based nature of our sales growth is a direct function of the clarity of Ralph's luxury lifestyle vision that runs through all that we do, from design to world-class marketing to our spectacular in-store presentations. We are leveraging this clarity of vision and purpose with an expanding range of merchandise and store environments around the world.
Our results also demonstrate the relevance of our strategies as we consistently innovate new products, we're expanding our international presence and we continue to extend our direct-to-consumer reach, which is all supported by our ongoing infrastructure investments and the focused development of our worldwide talent. These strategies have enabled us to deliver consistent double-digit sales and earnings growth over the last 1-, 5- or 10-year periods. The extraordinary profits flow-through we achieved on the quarter's better-than-expected sales highlights the power of our operating model, one that leverages the incredible strength and appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand, while respecting the uniqueness of each customer we touch in a particular channel or region of the world.
The sustained double-digit growth of our domestic operations across all channels is noteworthy, especially when we consider the scale of our business in the United States. The team continues to raise the bar and maximize the opportunities with our largest merchandise categories, while driving excellent productivity gains and incremental distribution of exciting new products. As we continue to make significant progress with our international development efforts, international revenues rose 60% during the quarter, accounting for 36% of our consolidated sales, a 600-basis point gain from the prior year period. Our business is growing along many dimensions in Europe, including new wholesale and retail distribution, the expansion of existing and highly productive locations and the contribution of new merchandise categories such as Lauren and accessories. We're also growing our presence in Eastern Europe and the Middle East through partnerships with strong locally based experts.
There's a lot of excitement planned for the remainder of the year in Europe. We intend to launch e-commerce in France and Germany in the next 3 months, and Club Monaco and Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply will be introduced into leading department stores this fall. And we're also opening our first European Rugby store in London's Covent Garden in a few weeks.
In Asia, we are exceeding our sales and profit plans in all major regions. Everyday, we're learning more about this dynamic emerging region, and we are steadily improving our operational capabilities. We've made the most impactful progress in Japan, which we've directly operated for 4 years. In that time, our sales trends have consistently outperformed the overall market. Our profitability has also improved substantially as we integrated Japan into our global sourcing and distribution organizations. We've invested in system upgrades, and we've leveraged our best practices with respect to planning and merchandising. Our recent transition of the South Korean operation was executed seamlessly, and the team has already begun relocating and renovating shops as part of our long-term market development strategy. We all co-commenced our multiyear brand repositioning efforts in Greater China, closing a handful of shops while simultaneously opening more appropriate points of distribution that support our luxury merchandise strategies and that can accommodate our growing accessory assortments. We are very pleased with the customer response to our elevated merchandising assortments throughout Asia. The ready acceptance of Ralph Lauren handbags and watches when they are appropriately merchandised in dedicated space is very encouraging, especially since these categories are expected to be an important driver of our growth aspirations in the region.
In the near term, our locally based management teams remain focused on brand elevation efforts, expanding distribution for new and existing merchandise categories and identifying ways to leverage the shared services throughout the Asia-Pacific region as the scale of our operations there expand. Our global direct-to-customer efforts are accelerating as evidenced by our impressive sales growth and substantial profit improvement of our retail segment. Exceptional merchandise and customer services drove stronger conversion rates and higher full-price sell-throughs in the quarter. Sales trends were strongest at stores located in the world's major cities and destinations, which typically service both local and tourist customers. These stores tend to have the most compelling and complete representation of the World of Ralph Lauren, and it's increasingly clear that customers want access to our full range of products and lifestyle sensibilities, especially accessories.
The strength of our first quarter operating results is effectively an extension of the strategies that have supported our momentum over the last 12 to 24 months. But as you are all aware, the retail landscaping is changing greatly as higher prices emerge with the full floor sets. We will not to know the full impact of our pricing actions until mid- to late September. By then, the customer has probably had enough time to digest the new pricing paradigm, and we should have some sense of how recent macroeconomic uncertainties have affected the global consumer sentiment and consumption trends.
Over the last several weeks, it's become increasingly clear that the global macroeconomic environment is very fragile and that we are operating in the context of tremendous uncertainty and volatility. Austerity measures in the U.S. and Europe are a necessity, but the complexity and magnitude of these measures is unknown. Since the U.S. and Europe are important regions for us, we're very focused on monitoring how the customer reacts to these macrodynamics. We have set the bar high with respect to our sales plans for the year, but we are confident in the rigor of our planning process and our ability to proactively navigate through emerging challenges. The sophistication of our sourcing, supply chain and logistics operations enable us to better read and react to changes in market dynamics than ever before. We're also confident in the strength of our merchandise assortments, and we believe our unwaving commitment to the integrity of our products and our value propositions will remain a competitive advantage for us.
The diversity and resilience of our operating model across channels, regions has typically served us well in turbulent times, which is why we remain committed to investing in our growth initiative and infrastructure, particularly for the Asia-Pacific development and international e-commerce. This is consistent with the strategies that we have supported over sustained periods of time, including the last downturn when we're able to grow earnings despite the ongoing investment in our growth initiatives. By staying the course, we believe these investments will yield incremental returns for our shareholders over the long term.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki for some merchandise highlights."

There's no question that the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across all channels worldwide is a function of best-in-class products and compelling merchandising strategies. Ralph's commitment to product",822,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. There's no question that the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across all channels worldwide is a function of best-in-class products and compelling merchandising strategies. Ralph's commitment to product innovation have enabled us to continually satisfy our customers and gain meaningful global market share. We have leveraged the sustained success of our most iconic products to gain traction with exciting and fast-moving new merchandise categories such as dresses, footwear and accessories. This morning, I'd like to take you through some key highlights of our home, childrenswear, denim and accessory initiatives.
Today, we are delivering the World of Ralph Lauren in a more consistent, more comprehensive and more impactful way than ever before, taking the vision from design to production to merchandise, planning and ultimately to the in-store presentation. This consistently applied approach has supported the extraordinary growth we are experiencing across all product categories on a global scale. The clarity of our merchandising initiatives, which focus on targeted assortments that offer outstanding value and unique channels of distribution has allowed us to achieve growth across all channels worldwide from our own stores to leading department stores, specialty stores and of course, the rapidly expanding online space. The strong customer appetite for our products is a testament to the vitality and desirability of the Ralph Lauren brand. In fact, the remarkable performance of our men's product, the foundation and origin of our entire company, is perhaps the best example of the brand's appeal around the world. The expansion of our assortments across Purple Label, Black Label, Polo, Golf, RRL and RLX not only give the loyal customers something fresh, but also attract a new customer into the World of Ralph Lauren menswear.
Last quarter, I highlighted some strategic changes and how we're managing our home category. I'm pleased to report that with more direct control over our bed and bath merchandise, which is our largest classification in terms of sales, we already experienced improved operating efficiencies, customer satisfaction and sell-through rates. We look forward to expanding our distribution and strengthening our productivity across all home product categories worldwide over the next several years.
Since acquiring our childrenswear license in 2005, we've developed a meaningful global presence that includes a wholesale distribution and stand-alone stores. We recently opened a childrenswear store in ocean terminal in Hong Kong, which joins our other stores throughout the U.S., Europe and Middle East. We are excited about the global growth prospects for childrenswear, particularly as we continue to apply merchandising strategies and operating disciplines that have worked so well for us in other categories.
This fall, we're introducing a new active dimension to our boys' apparel that take its inspiration from the sporty heritage of Polo and the contemporary aesthetic of RLX. With our leadership and the more polished aspect of boys' dressing, this active line really nicely rounds out our total offering.
Denim & Supply, our new denim-based lifestyle collection for men and women, is launching now. Merchandise is being set in leading department stores worldwide and will be available on RalphLauren.com on August 11. Denim & Supply was developed to speak to a 20-something customer in a fresh and distinctive way that is still grounded in the heritage and authenticity of Ralph Lauren. Based on the demographic, we will have a strong online presence to drive awareness and interest in the brand. Wholesale customers around the world have responded favorably to the merchandise. Orders for the fall season were strong, confirming the ease in which we expect to replace and significantly upgrade the former Polo Jeans Co. brand throughout Europe and Asia. The product and in-store environments are spectacular and the quality, authenticity and distinctiveness of the brand really shine. There is truly no other denim line quite like this, and we believe customers will respond very favorably.
Consistent with our overall corporate focus, accessories are an integral part of the overall assortment. Denim & Supply is the latest component of our tiered denim strategy that includes our women's collection denim business, Black Label denim for men's and as well as denim in the existing RRL, Polo and Lauren lines. The progress we are making with accessories each season is very exciting. As the Ralph Lauren luxury handbag and footwear assortments expand, global customers' interest and appetite have been strong. We are experiencing the same success in the wholesale channel with our Polo and Lauren accessory brands, and we intend to meaningfully expand global distribution of these products over the next few years. Our increasingly diversed global sales base and product mix, our ability to continually gain share in our largest markets and product categories, our success of expanding into new merchandise categories and of course, the unrivaled power and prestige of the Ralph Lauren brand are enabling us to build new strong new platforms for future growth. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,138168270,155915,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2011",2011-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent first quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 32% greater than the prior year period and better than the mid-20s sales growth",2024,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent first quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 32% greater than the prior year period and better than the mid-20s sales growth expectations we outlined for you in May. The increase in net revenues reflects double-digit gains at our wholesale and retail segments, both exceeding our original expectations for the quarter. Sales of our core apparel merchandise categories, particularly our men's product across all channels of distribution, our strong e-commerce growth and performance at our factory stores worldwide surpassed even our robust initial expectations. Sales in Japan also stabilized more quickly than we anticipated, following the earthquake and tsunami events in March. And of the 32% net revenue growth, favorable currency translation did impact our total reported revenue growth by approximately 4 percentage points.
Our gross profit margin of 63%, which was 120 basis points greater than the prior year period was driven entirely by our retail segment and reflects strong full-price sell-throughs and a higher penetration of international store and concession sales. These benefits more than offset the negative impact of cost of goods inflation across all wholesale and retail formats. The improvement in the first quarter gross profit margin was another contributor to our outperformance relative to the expectations we communicated in May. As Jacki mentioned, the strength of our merchandise assortments across apparel and accessories, combined with our in-store presentations, continue to support highly profitable sell-throughs across all channels of our business.
Operating expenses of $679 million were 26% greater than the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses were driven by overall growth in our core operations, an increase in our retail channel mix, incremental costs associated with the newly transitioned South Korea and home operations and continued investment in our other strategic growth initiatives, including international e-commerce, new store openings and infrastructure support. Currency translation also impacted expense growth by approximately 4%. We were able to achieve 210 basis points of operating expense leverage during the quarter, primarily as a result of better-than-expected sales growth, and this was another important contributor to our outperformance relative to our first quarter expectation. As a result of our strong sales growth, our operating income of $282 million was 62% greater than the prior year period. We achieved a record operating margin of 18.5%, which was 340 basis points above the prior year period. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 increased 52% to $184 million, and net income per diluted share rose 57% to $1.90.
The higher effective tax rate of 33% this year compared to 29% in the prior year period, primarily reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items last year and is consistent with our guidance to you in the fourth quarter.
Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter. Our wholesale segment reported sales increase of 29% to $673 million and constant dollar sales increased 25%. As I mentioned earlier, shipments of our core apparel and accessories merchandise sell-through at exceptionally strong rates, which allows for increased replenishment across several categories.
In Europe, strength in sales in the U.K., Germany and France across virtually all brands offset the continued softness we have experienced in sales in Italy. Wholesale operating margin and operating income in the first quarter rose 14% to $151 million, and the Wholesale operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 22.5%. The substantial improvement in wholesale operating income and margin rate was entirely a result of higher global shipment volumes and expense leverage on the better-than-expected shipment growth, which more than offset the impact of cost of goods inflation.
For our retail group, first quarter sales rose 37% to $814 million and were up 33% in constant dollars, reflecting strong comparable store sales growth across all retail concepts. The contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from our newly assumed South Korean operations. Retail sales also benefited from a late Easter this year, which we estimate contributed approximately 2% to total segment growth for the quarter.
Overall, comp store sales increased 19%, reflecting 14% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, 20% increase at factory stores and 16% growth at Club Monaco stores. RalphLauren.com sales continue to expand at a double-digit rate, increasing 28% in the first quarter. Our comp gains were achieved through a mixture of transaction growth and average dollar sales growth, with the latter mostly due to higher full-priced sales in our stores. Urban markets and key tourist destinations, particularly in the U.S. continue to outperform average traffic trends, and concession shops sales across Asia were exceptionally strong in the quarter. We opened 7 directly operated freestanding stores, closed 6 stores and assumed control of 3 formerly licensed locations during the quarter, ending the period with 371 company-operated stores. We also operated 535 concession shop locations globally at the end of the first quarter.
Retail segment operating income grew 67% to $173 million in the first quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 380 basis points to 21.3%. This substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate comes as a result of strong comparable store sales growth as I mentioned earlier and higher full-price sell-throughs, which drove broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts, particularly in the U.S. and in Asia. Retail operating income also benefited from the inclusion of the South Korean acquisition this year. The improved retail segment profitability was partially offset by cost of goods inflation.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $40 million, 6% greater than the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and primarily due to increased fragrance royalties that were partially offset by lower international licensing royalties related to the transition of formerly licensed South Korean operations. Operating income for our licensing segment rose 6% to $25 million as a result.
Our financial condition remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $981 million in cash and investments and $677 million in net cash, and that was after investing over $300 million in share repurchase activity within the quarter. Consolidated inventory was up 42% at the end of the first quarter on a reported basis. In-transit inventory was an important driver of the overall increase as we have taken ownership of certain key items of our merchandise earlier than normal. We made this decision in an effort to minimize any potential supply chain disruption that could have been a potential risk when we were placing our fall orders last year when both factory and transportation capacity was extraordinarily tight and cotton prices were at peak levels. Approximately half of the increase in dollars is to support the anticipated sales growth and shipment cadence of comparable product categories, geographies and channels. Approximately 30% of the increase is attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency impacts and the remaining 20% of the increase is related to new merchandise categories or new business operations such as South Korea, home textile, Denim & Supply in the U.S. and international e-commerce. And with the assumption of realizing our current sales projections, we remain comfortable with the content and currency of our inventory. We expect inventory growth to become progressively more aligned with sales trends throughout fiscal 2012 as we cycle through changes and year-over-year shipment cadence.
We spent approximately $39 million on CapEx during the first quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock, utilizing $302 million of our current authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $670 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs. We informed you back in May that our first quarter results were expected to be a continuation of the strong performance we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2011 prior to the full impact of fall price increases. And our first quarter results are truly exceptional by any measure, and they were achieved on top of very strong operating performance in the prior year period as Roger mentioned. While we have begun this new fiscal year with broad-based momentum across all regions in our business, we have incurred as we anticipated, 4 substantial cost of goods inflation with fall shipments in the second quarter and have made thoughtful and selective pricing adjustments by brand and by region to help mitigate some of the intensifying inflationary pressures. This is expected to have a negative impact on our balance of year fiscal 2012 gross margin, particularly as we make large fall shipments at wholesale in the second quarter. And although the price of cotton and other commodities have recently retreated from peak levels, initial costs projections for our spring 2012 merchandise are aligned with the expectations embedded in our initial fiscal 2012 outlook, which we provided you on the last call.
As Roger highlighted earlier, it is unclear how the recent and extraordinary volatility in the global equity and credit markets might affect global consumer sentiment and demand. At this point, we intend to continue executing against our original strategic objective and sales plans for fiscal 2012. We are closely monitoring trends across all channels and regions in order to proactively address any material changes that could affect our plans and outlook for the year, which I'd like to review with you now.
For the second quarter, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high-teens to a low-20s percent. Our expectations are based on a mid-teens increase in global wholesale sales and a mid-20% increase in retail segment sales, and as a reminder, the acquisition of the South Korea license is noncomp for us until the fourth quarter this year and is driving approximately 3% of the overall year-over-year sales growth I just mentioned.
Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points below that achieved in the comparable year period. This decline is a relatively equal mix of gross margin pressure from cost of goods inflation and higher operating expenses. The anticipated deleverage in our operating expenses is primarily related to the timing of cost related to additional channel distribution expansion, including preopening costs for a portion of the 34 new stores and 47 shops we intend to open worldwide during fiscal 2012, e-commerce investments for Ralph Lauren sites in France and Germany and for Club Monaco in North America and the incremental expense of our South Korean operations.
So based on our strong first quarter performance, we have raised our full year fiscal 2012 sales and profit outlook. And for the full year fiscal 2012 period, we now expect revenues to increase at a mid- to high-teens rate, which compares to our prior expectation of mid-teens growth. Our full year operating margin outlook is now estimated to be down 50 to 100 basis points from the prior year period, which is an improvement relative to our initial expectation of a 100 to 150 basis point decline. In addition to the investments we are making throughout Asia and in international e-commerce, we currently still intend to support our growth expectations with incremental advertising and marketing, which we believe is critical to generate more awareness for new and emerging categories and to raise our profile in international markets. We have revised our expectations of the restructuring charges associated with our Greater China repositioning efforts to $8 million to $12 million for the full year, and those costs are not included in the operating margin outlook I just provided you.
The exceptional profit flow-through on our better-than-expected first quarter sales reflects both the innovation and executional discipline of our organization, particularly as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives. And while the challenge of the near-term economic uncertainty is real, we will continue to balance this reality with the investments that we believe are appropriate to continue to drive long-term shareholder value creation.
We have a clear, compelling growth strategy ahead of us, and our company has a long standing track record of success in executing against our strategies.
At this point, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that."

One, we would not alter the quality, make, materials or findings of any of our products, and we chose very specifically to make sure our customers maintain the quality they've come to expect. Having made that decision, the price increases are different by merchandise categories, and different merchandise categories play out also geographically differently. So what we really tried to do was take the product categories and the regions and come up with an overall point of view about what to pass on and what not. I think embedded in the second quarter guidance reflects some margin pressure because the cost of goods in general are higher than all the prices we passed on. But not unlike the first quarter, our strategy of quality first and merchandising the pricing, we think drives sell-throughs and market share opportunities, again, at the first quarter exemplified the kind of flow-through we can get. So by market, by merchandise categories, some sensitivity, the channel, the distribution, mid-tier versus luxury were baked into the matrix of pricing that second and third quarter reflects. I think as Tracey talked about, while we are seeing raw materials come down for next spring, there's a lot of merchandising of old higher-priced yarns and materials with new pricing that will play out through spring. So if raw materials stay down by summer and next fall, I think we'll begin to see overall cost of goods come down. By then, we'll know how the customers react to the price increases and where we go from there."

Let me try to answer it this way. Our model is an integrated model, and whether it's Europe, United States or now Asia, we've gotten much better at trying to think through channels of distribution and appropriateness",436,"Well, it's a very important question. Let me try to answer it this way. Our model is an integrated model, and whether it's Europe, United States or now Asia, we've gotten much better at trying to think through channels of distribution and appropriateness of how we speak to the customer, whether it's brick-and-mortar retail, freestanding stores or concession or whether it's online and e-commerce. We try to marry that by market against the wholesale points of distribution that we feel are appropriate. Clearly, in this quarter with the addition of important business in Asia, retail was larger than wholesale, which is kind of new for us. I think we'll see a similar phenomena in our third quarter, and then second and fourth quarters is for us, our larger wholesale quarters, retail being a bit smaller. But the success that you're seeing in the numbers and you see in the stores is really a result of many, many years for those who have followed the story of investing in talent, in products, in presentation and very innovative marketing. The car show we have going on in Paris has been extraordinarily successful and has helped build the brand awareness in that market where we have important retail and we have also important wholesale. So the entire model is a mosaic of integrated pieces, clearly, direct to consumer, brick and mortar or online is a growing part of our business and will be the dominant part of our Asia business. There's no doubt that each country has a different distribution model, but in Asia, the bulk of the business will come through flagships, dedicated freestanding stores either by men or women or accessories. We've opened recently a kid's store that's been extraordinarily successful. So the opportunities in Asia are almost unlimited and most of that will be approached through our ability to execute at retail. Today, our retail profitability in the merchandise categories that we're in I think stands second to no one. And as we grow the accessory business and that becomes an increased part of our direct to consumer, I think it's only going to get better. Where we've given accessory space to our own stores, whether it's Madison Avenue or Belle Harbor or our recent store we opened in Hong Kong in the Peninsula, the reaction to accessories whether it's handbags or watches or belts or scarves has been truly satisfying. So we really think we're on the right trend and the combination of accessory growth, Asia growth and the success in U.S. and Europe, I think we'll continue to push the retail to higher heights."

Our second quarter, I think, I was saying to Omar, the penetration of wholesale to retail begins to flip. So with that, we get a different kind of margin mix and the impact of cost of goods hits the mark up. What works so extraordinarily well in the first quarter was the full price sell-throughs, and that was true with wholesale or retail or online. And that really drove the extraordinary margin performance that allowed us to ride over the cost of good increases. If that were to repeat itself in the second quarter and at the moment, our forecast do not include a 19% comp store retail increase. But if that were to occur, my guess is that the guidance would look conservative in hindsight. But I think at this point, sitting here in the early part of August, we really haven't gotten enough of a read on full products, and we haven't got enough of a read on the new pricing to make that kind of prediction. So more to follow as the customer begins to react to products. What we have delivered for fall, whether it's in Ralph Lauren brands or Club Monaco, that does seem to be resonating with the customer is really wear-now fabrics, silhouettes in full colors. So we are getting a good read on those new deliveries, and that's a good sign for what second quarter may bring us. But at this point, it's really based more on the mix than anything else."

If you could help me understand, I'm trying to figure out why gross margins go down from here sequentially. I understand the makeshift and second quarter, being a big wholesale, fell in the quarter, and then you'll see cost inflation in that part of the business. But it sounds like pricing is about to take hold and the current trends you're seeing, your gross margins are up, almost your peers are seeing them down. I'm having a hard time trying figuring out how to model that lower from here. And then secondly on denim, that's been a category where I think the company has had mixed success in the past. It's a huge category in the U.S. and one that I'm surprised that we aren't sitting here today seeing you guys have a bigger share. Is there something structurally that gives you more confidence as you refocus on it now versus how you've approached in the past? And what do you think has maybe caused the results to fall short of your expectations in the past to help us think about it as you reenter that category?"

Interestingly enough, historically, first quarter is our highest gross margin quarter of the year, and that's not only driven by the growing retail penetration. But it's really about the product mix because April, May, June period for us is heavily a key item classification, high margin, strong sell-through time of year. And those products tend to come with higher margins. So even though we're up to a record-setting level this first quarter, we've historically run higher margins in the first quarter than the rest of the year. The second, third or fourth quarters tend to be more similar as we work our way through the year, particularly second and fourth quarter tend to be more collection deliveries. And then first and third quarter tend to be more key item and classification. So there's a lot of product mix within the channels and within the segments that do alter meaningfully the gross margin by quarter. The denim question, we agree with you. We think it's an extraordinary opportunity. We think no one has a seat at the table larger than Ralph Lauren. And I think we're now very comfortable with the pyramid of denim that we're representing to the customer. So at the high-end RRL, where we just opened a new store downtown, if you haven't seen it, but we're very pleased with how that's performing, whether it's in the 72nd Street store or whether it's in our freestanding stores, we are really looking for that business to not only halo but grow into a business of size and scale as it's already the hottest item we have in Japan, and we'll later this fall open a store in London. From there, we actually have this fall Black Label denim coming, which we think is an important extension of the Black Label customers and sensibility. You'll see that in our stores later this year, and we think that speaks to a very specific audience. And then as Jacki talked about, the relaunch of a broader-based denim, which will not only replace here in the United States the Polo Jeans business, but in Europe and in Asia, we think profiles us against that business beautifully. So that, for us, is the beginning of a worldwide opportunity in men's and women's and then of course there's a trickle down into kid's. So we don't disagree the denim business is an enormous opportunity, and there are no structural or brand barriers to have that succeed."

I'm not sure at this point, we can do anything about it other than watch it play out. We have not seen yet any impact on our customers, both here in the United States or Europe, but as Tracey said, we're watching it carefully. A lot of the issues that seem to be behind the volatility are not new issues. So the uncertainty over debt in Europe, some of the issues here in the United States are not ones that have just come up in the last week. So what is creating the volatility? Where the consumer begins to be impacted by it? We really don't know. So we are, until proven otherwise, pressing ahead with our plans, and we feel good about the trends. First quarter was clearly a big downpayment on the year, the business in Asia, while it's infant state is still very strong. And we're seeing good strong global tourism. So at this point, we're watching carefully, but our forecast reflect our best thinking. The retail accessory question that you mentioned, I think if you go to the 72nd Street store where we've devoted the entire main floor to our accessory businesses, if you went to Paris, if you went to The Peninsula in Hong Kong or any of the new stores, you can see the distortion we've given accessories and our thoughts are now to circle back on many of our key flagships and look at how to make those stores similarly reflect our commitment and belief. Having gotten back the footwear business and then the accessory business, more leather good, belts over the years, I think we've built extraordinarily talented teams of people. We have developed the sourcing capabilities, and I think you're now beginning to see that reflected in the products that the customers are seeing, and where we've given a proper representation, they're voting yes. So that's an exciting opportunity for us as we push forward."

So we've got total visibility to all of our inventory worldwide. As a matter of fact, I think in somewhat of a pioneering investment, we also have visibility into raw materials, where it is in the manufacturing cycle, where it is in the transportation cycle. And so any part of that, that you want to review, you can. One of the things we chose to do when there was concern about factory capacity and transportation capacity was the pull-forward inventory in order to minimize disruption. That also allowed us to be most efficient in our transportation and distribution costs. But one of the things we were able to do with that pull forward, which we used our balance sheet to carry heavier inventories coming out of June, is ensure timely deliveries, which are driving sales. And I think the cost of goods is somewhat impacted positively by more thoughtful transportation and logistics, which did save us some on the margin component. So we do have it by region, channel, brand and we're managing that carefully. I think as Tracey said, by the end of the second quarter, I think you'll see some of these in-transit and some of these pull forward on the fall level back out.

Those local merchants are really feeling the squeeze of the difficult economic environment. It's not a market that has a meaningful department store   exposure. Rinascente in Milan is probably the one exception. So you're really distributing through either mono-brand stores or through a specialty distribution, and I think they're not only feeling it, they're struggling with their own cash flows. So at least for the moment, we're looking at a fall that's probably more the same. And while it's an important country to us, I think you can see in the overall international results and particularly the European results, the strong countries i.e. France and Germany, the U.K., the Scandinavian markets are all so extraordinarily strong that we're managing the softness in Southern Europe whether it's Italy or to some degree, Spain. In Asia, we're really in our infancy and our ability to work with the existing networks that we took back from our licensees reposition those and move forward. As we're elevating product and content, we're also looking at pricing. So we're trying to take a more global point of view on the appropriateness of price differentiation whether it's Japan or China or South Korea. The Asian customer is very savvy and cross shops whether they cross shop within Asia Pac, or whether they travel to Europe. So I think the subject of global pricing excluding for a moment the duties is going to be one in the future. In general, we were priced through our licensed distribution too low. So we think we have found opportunities by merchandise categories to get better alignment with the market conditions."

We're reporting excellent first quarter results today with consolidated sales rising 32%, operating income increasing 62% and earnings per diluted share up 57%. Our performance reflects strong global momentum across merchandise categories, channels and regions and comes on top of equally strong results in the comparable prior-year period. We are expanding our market share on multiple dimensions as our wholesale, retail stores and e-commerce operations are all achieving strong rates of growth. We believe the broad-based nature of our sales growth is a direct function of the clarity of Ralph's luxury lifestyle vision that runs through all that we do, from design to world-class marketing to our spectacular in-store presentations. We are leveraging this clarity of vision and purpose with an expanding range of merchandise and store environments around the world.
Our results also demonstrate the relevance of our strategies as we consistently innovate new products, we're expanding our international presence and we continue to extend our direct-to-consumer reach, which is all supported by our ongoing infrastructure investments and the focused development of our worldwide talent. These strategies have enabled us to deliver consistent double-digit sales and earnings growth over the last 1-, 5- or 10-year periods. The extraordinary profits flow-through we achieved on the quarter's better-than-expected sales highlights the power of our operating model, one that leverages the incredible strength and appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand, while respecting the uniqueness of each customer we touch in a particular channel or region of the world.
The sustained double-digit growth of our domestic operations across all channels is noteworthy, especially when we consider the scale of our business in the United States. The team continues to raise the bar and maximize the opportunities with our largest merchandise categories, while driving excellent productivity gains and incremental distribution of exciting new products. As we continue to make significant progress with our international development efforts, international revenues rose 60% during the quarter, accounting for 36% of our consolidated sales, a 600-basis-point gain from the prior year period. Our business is growing along many dimensions in Europe, including new wholesale and retail distribution, the expansion of existing and highly productive locations and the contribution of new merchandise categories such as Lauren and accessories. We're also growing our presence in Eastern Europe and the Middle East through partnerships with strong, locally based experts.
There's a lot of excitement planned for the remainder of the year in Europe. We intend to launch e-commerce in France and Germany in the next 3 months, and Club Monaco and Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply will be introduced into leading department stores this fall. And we're also opening our first European Rugby store in London's Covent Gardens in a few weeks.
In Asia, we are exceeding our sales and profit plans in all major regions. Every day, we're learning more about this dynamic emerging region, and we are steadily improving our operational capabilities. We've made the most impactful progress in Japan, which we've directly operated for 4 years. In that time, our sales trends have consistently outperformed the overall market. Our profitability has also improved substantially as we integrated Japan into our global sourcing and distribution organizations. We've invested in system upgrades, and we've leveraged our best practices with respect to planning and merchandising. Our recent transition of the South Korean operations was executed seamlessly, and the team has already begun relocating and renovating shops as part of our long-term market development strategy. We also commenced our multiyear brand repositioning efforts in Greater China, closing a handful of shops while simultaneously opening more appropriate points of distribution that support our luxury merchandise strategies and that can accommodate our growing accessory assortments. We are very pleased with the customer response to our elevated merchandising assortments throughout Asia. The ready acceptance of Ralph Lauren handbags and watches, when they are appropriately merchandised in dedicated space, is very encouraging, especially since these categories are expected to be an important driver of our growth aspirations in the region.
In the near term, our locally based management teams remain focused on brand elevation efforts, expanding distribution for new and existing merchandise categories and identifying ways to leverage the shared services throughout the Asia-Pacific region as the scale of our operations there expand. Our global direct-to-customer efforts are accelerating as evidenced by our impressive sales growth and substantial profit improvement of our retail segment. Exceptional merchandise and customer services drove stronger conversion rates and higher full-price sell-throughs in the quarter. Sales trends were strongest at stores located in the world's major cities and destinations, which typically service both local and tourist customers. These stores tend to have the most compelling and complete representation of the World of Ralph Lauren, and it's increasingly clear that customers want access to our full range of products and lifestyle sensibilities, especially accessories.
The strength of our first-quarter operating results is effectively an extension of the strategies that have supported our momentum over the last 12 to 24 months. But as you are all aware, the retail landscaping is changing greatly as higher prices emerge with the full floor sets. We will not to know the full impact of our pricing actions until mid to late September. By then, the customer has probably had enough time to digest the new pricing paradigm, and we should have some sense of how recent macroeconomic uncertainties have affected the global consumer sentiment and consumption trends.
Over the last several weeks, it's become increasingly clear that the global macroeconomic environment is very fragile and that we are operating in the context of tremendous uncertainty and volatility. Austerity measures in the U.S. and Europe are a necessity, but the complexity and magnitude of these measures is unknown. Since the U.S. and Europe are important regions for us, we're very focused on monitoring how the customer reacts to these macrodynamics. We have set the bar high with respect to our sales plans for the year, but we are confident in the rigor of our planning process and our ability to proactively navigate through emerging challenges. The sophistication of our sourcing, supply chain and logistics operations enable us to better read and react to changes in market dynamics than ever before. We're also confident in the strength of our merchandise assortments, and we believe our unwaving commitment to the integrity of our products and our value propositions will remain a competitive advantage for us.
The diversity and resilience of our operating model across channels, regions has typically served us well in turbulent times, which is why we remain committed to investing in our growth initiative and infrastructure, particularly for the Asia-Pacific development and international e-commerce. This is consistent with the strategies that we have supported over sustained periods of time, including the last downturn when we're able to grow earnings despite the ongoing investment in our growth initiatives. By staying the course, we believe these investments will yield incremental returns for our shareholders over the long term.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki for some merchandise highlights."

There's no question that the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across all channels worldwide is a function of best-in-class products and compelling merchandising strategies. Ralph's commitment to product innovation have enabled us to continually satisfy our customers and gain meaningful global market share. We have leveraged the sustained success of our most iconic products to gain traction with exciting and fast-moving new merchandise categories such as dresses, footwear and accessories. This morning, I'd like to take you through some key highlights of our home, childrenswear, denim and accessory initiatives.
Today, we are delivering the World of Ralph Lauren in a more consistent, more comprehensive and more impactful way than ever before, taking the vision from design to production to merchandise, planning and ultimately to the in-store presentation. This consistently applied approach has supported the extraordinary growth we are experiencing across all product categories on a global scale. The clarity of our merchandising initiatives, which focus on targeted assortments that offer outstanding value and unique channels of distribution has allowed us to achieve growth across all channels worldwide from our own stores to leading department stores, specialty stores and of course, the rapidly expanding online space. The strong customer appetite for our products is a testament to the vitality and desirability of the Ralph Lauren brand. In fact, the remarkable performance of our men's product, the foundation and origin of our entire company, is perhaps the best example of the brand's appeal around the world. The expansion of our assortments across Purple Label, Black Label, Polo, Golf, RRL and RLX not only give the loyal customer something fresh, but also attract a new customer into the World of Ralph Lauren menswear.
Last quarter, I highlighted some strategic changes and how we're managing our home category. I'm pleased to report that with more direct control over our bed and bath merchandise, which is our largest classification in terms of sales, we are already experiencing improved operating efficiencies, customer satisfaction and sell-through rates. We look forward to expanding our distribution and strengthening our productivity across all home product categories worldwide over the next several years.
Since acquiring our childrenswear license in 2005, we've developed a meaningful global presence that includes a wholesale distribution and stand-alone stores. We recently opened a childrenswear store in Ocean Terminal in Hong Kong, which joins our other stores throughout the U.S., Europe and Middle East. We are excited about the global growth prospects for childrenswear, particularly as we continue to apply merchandising strategies and operating disciplines that have worked so well for us in other categories.
This fall, we're introducing a new active dimension to our boys' apparel that take its inspiration from the sporty heritage of Polo and the contemporary aesthetic of RLX. With our leadership and the more polished aspect of boys' dressing, this active line really nicely rounds out our total offering.
Denim & Supply, our new denim-based lifestyle collection for men and women, is launching now. Merchandise is being set in leading department stores worldwide and will be available on RalphLauren.com on August 11. Denim & Supply was developed to speak to a 20-something customer in a fresh and distinctive way that is still grounded in the heritage and authenticity of Ralph Lauren. Based on the demographic, we will have a strong online presence to drive awareness and interest in the brand. Wholesale customers around the world have responded favorably to the merchandise. Orders for the fall season were strong, confirming the ease in which we expect to replace and significantly upgrade the former Polo Jeans Co. brand throughout Europe and Asia. The product and in-store environments are spectacular and the quality, authenticity and distinctiveness of the brand really shine. There is truly no other denim line quite like this, and we believe customers will respond very favorably.
Consistent with our overall corporate focus, accessories are an integral part of the overall assortment. Denim & Supply is the latest component of our tiered denim strategy that includes our women's collection denim business, Black Label denim for men's and as well as denim in the existing RRL, Polo and Lauren lines. The progress we are making with accessories each season is very exciting. As the Ralph Lauren luxury handbag and footwear assortments expand, global customers' interest and appetite have been strong. We are experiencing the same success in the wholesale channel with our Polo and Lauren accessory brands, and we intend to meaningfully expand global distribution of these products over the next few years. Our increasingly diverse global sales base and product mix, our ability to continually gain share in our largest markets and product categories, our success of expanding into new merchandise categories and of course, the unrivaled power and prestige of the Ralph Lauren brand are enabling us to build strong new platforms for future growth. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,138168270,156075,"Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2011",2011-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent first quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 32% greater than the prior-year period and better than the mid-20s sales growth",1994,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent first quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.5 billion, 32% greater than the prior-year period and better than the mid-20s sales growth expectations we outlined for you in May. The increase in net revenues reflects double-digit gains in our wholesale and retail segments, both exceeding our original expectations for the quarter. Sales of our core apparel merchandise categories, particularly our men's product across all channels of distribution, our strong e-commerce growth and performance at our factory stores worldwide surpassed even our robust initial expectations. Sales in Japan also stabilized more quickly than we anticipated, following the earthquake and tsunami events in March. And of the 32% net revenue growth, favorable currency translation did impact our total reported revenue growth by approximately 4 percentage points.
Our gross profit margin of 63%, which was 120 basis points greater than the prior-year period was driven entirely by our retail segment and reflects strong full-price sell-throughs and a higher penetration of international store and concession sales. These benefits more than offset the negative impact of cost-of-goods inflation across all wholesale and retail formats. The improvement in the first quarter gross profit margin was another contributor to our outperformance relative to the expectations we communicated in May. As Jacki mentioned, the strength of our merchandise assortments across apparel and accessories, combined with our in-store presentations, continue to support highly profitable sell-throughs across all channels of our business.
Operating expenses of $679 million were 26% greater than the prior-year period. The increase in operating expenses were driven by overall growth in our core operations, an increase in our retail channel mix, incremental costs associated with the newly transitioned South Korea and home operations and continued investment in our other strategic growth initiatives, including international e-commerce, new store openings and infrastructure support. Currency translation also impacted expense growth by approximately 4%. We were able to achieve 210 basis points of operating expense leverage during the quarter, primarily as a result of better-than-expected sales growth, and this was another important contributor to our outperformance relative to our first-quarter expectation. As a result of our strong sales growth, our operating income of $282 million was 62% greater than the prior-year period. We achieved a record operating margin of 18.5%, which was 340 basis points above the prior-year period. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 increased 52% to $184 million, and net income per diluted share rose 57% to $1.90.
The higher effective tax rate of 33% this year, compared to 29% in the prior-year period, primarily reflects the favorable resolution of discrete tax items last year and is consistent with our guidance to you in the fourth quarter.
Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter. Our wholesale segment reported sales increase of 29% to $673 million and constant-dollar sales increased 25%. As I mentioned earlier, shipments of our core apparel and accessories merchandise sold through at exceptionally strong rates, which allowed for increased replenishment across several categories.
In Europe, strength in sales in the U.K., Germany and France across virtually all brands offset the continued softness we have experienced in sales in Italy. Wholesale operating margin and operating income in the first quarter rose 14% to $151 million, and the Wholesale operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 22.5%. The substantial improvement in wholesale operating income and margin rate was entirely a result of higher global shipment volumes and expense leverage on the better-than-expected shipment growth, which more than offset the impact of cost-of-goods inflation.
For our retail group, first quarter sales rose 37% to $814 million and were up 33% in constant dollars, reflecting strong comparable store sales growth across all retail concepts, the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from our newly assumed South Korean operations. Retail sales also benefited from a late Easter this year, which we estimate contributed approximately 2% to total segment growth for the quarter.
Overall, comp store sales increased 19%, reflecting 14% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, 20% increase at factory stores and 16% growth at Club Monaco stores. RalphLauren.com sales continued to expand at a double-digit rate, increasing 28% in the first quarter. Our comp gains were achieved through a mixture of transaction growth and average dollar sales growth, with the latter mostly due to higher full-priced sales in our stores. Urban markets and key tourist destinations, particularly in the U.S., continue to outperform average traffic trends, and concession shops sales across Asia were exceptionally strong in the quarter. We opened 7 directly operated freestanding stores, closed 6 stores and assumed control of 3 formerly licensed locations during the quarter, ending the period with 371 company-operated stores. We also operated 535 concession shop locations globally at the end of the first quarter.
Retail segment operating income grew 67% to $173 million in the first quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 380 basis points to 21.3%. This substantial improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate comes as a result of strong comparable store sales growth as I mentioned earlier and higher full-price sell-throughs, which drove broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts, particularly in the U.S. and in Asia. Retail operating income also benefited from the inclusion of the South Korean acquisition this year. The improved retail segment profitability was partially offset by cost-of-goods inflation.
Licensing royalties for the quarter were $40 million, 6% greater than the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and primarily due to increased fragrance royalties that were partially offset by lower international licensing royalties related to the transition of formerly licensed South Korean operations. Operating income for our licensing segment rose 6% to $25 million as a result.
Our financial condition remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $981 million in cash and investments and $677 million in net cash, and that was after investing over $300 million in share repurchase activity within the quarter. Consolidated inventory was up 42% at the end of the first quarter on a reported basis. In-transit inventory was an important driver of the overall increase as we have taken ownership of certain key items of our merchandise earlier than normal. We made this decision in an effort to minimize any potential supply chain disruption that could have been a potential risk when we were placing our fall orders last year when both factory and transportation capacity was extraordinarily tight and cotton prices were at peak levels. Approximately half of the increase in dollars is to support the anticipated sales growth and shipment cadence of comparable product categories, geographies and channels. Approximately 30% of the increase is attributable to cost-of-goods inflation and foreign currency impacts and the remaining 20% of the increase is related to new merchandise categories or new business operations such as South Korea, home textile, Denim & Supply in the U.S. and international e-commerce. And with the assumption of realizing our current sales projections, we remain comfortable with the content and currency of our inventory. We expect inventory growth to become progressively more aligned with sales trends throughout fiscal 2012 as we cycle through changes and year-over-year shipment cadence.
We spent approximately $39 million on CapEx during the first quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock, utilizing $302 million of our current authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $670 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs. We informed you back in May that our first-quarter results were expected to be a continuation of the strong performance we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2011 prior to the full impact of fall price increases. And our first quarter results are truly exceptional by any measure, and they were achieved on top of very strong operating performance in the prior-year period, as Roger mentioned. While we have begun this new fiscal year with broad-based momentum across all regions in our business, we have incurred, as we anticipated, 4 substantial cost-of-goods inflation with fall shipments in the second quarter and have made thoughtful and selective pricing adjustments by brand and by region to help mitigate some of the intensifying inflationary pressures. This is expected to have a negative impact on our balance-of-year fiscal 2012 gross margin, particularly as we make large fall shipments at wholesale in the second quarter. And although the price of cotton and other commodities have recently retreated from peak levels, initial cost projections for our spring 2012 merchandise are aligned with the expectations embedded in our initial fiscal 2012 outlook, which we provided you on the last call.
As Roger highlighted earlier, it is unclear how the recent and extraordinary volatility in the global equity and credit markets might affect global consumer sentiment and demand. At this point, we intend to continue executing against our original strategic objectives and sales plans for fiscal 2012. We are closely monitoring trends across all channels and regions in order to proactively address any material changes that could affect our plans and outlook for the year, which I'd like to review with you now.
For the second quarter, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a high-teens to a low-20s percent. Our expectations are based on a mid-teens increase in global wholesale sales and a mid-20% increase in retail segment sales, and as a reminder, the acquisition of the South Korea license is noncomp for us until the fourth quarter this year and is driving approximately 3% of the overall year-over-year sales growth I just mentioned.
Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points below that achieved in the comparable year period. This decline is a relatively equal mix of gross margin pressure from cost-of-goods inflation and higher operating expenses. The anticipated deleverage in our operating expenses is primarily related to the timing of cost related to additional channel distribution expansion, including preopening costs for a portion of the 34 new stores and 47 shops we intend to open worldwide during fiscal 2012, e-commerce investments for Ralph Lauren sites in France and Germany and for Club Monaco in North America and the incremental expense of our South Korean operations.
So based on our strong first quarter performance, we have raised our full-year fiscal 2012 sales and profit outlook. And for the full-year fiscal 2012 period, we now expect revenues to increase at a mid- to high-teens rate, which compares to our prior expectation of mid-teens growth. Our full-year operating margin outlook is now estimated to be down 50 to 100 basis points from the prior-year period, which is an improvement relative to our initial expectation of a 100- to 150-basis-point decline. In addition to the investments we are making throughout Asia and in international e-commerce, we currently still intend to support our growth expectations with incremental advertising and marketing, which we believe is critical to generate more awareness for new and emerging categories and to raise our profile in international markets. We have revised our expectations of the restructuring charges associated with our Greater China repositioning efforts to $8 million to $12 million for the full year, and those costs are not included in the operating margin outlook I just provided you.
The exceptional profit flow-through on our better-than-expected first quarter sales reflects both the innovation and executional discipline of our organization, particularly as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives. And while the challenge of the near-term economic uncertainty is real, we will continue to balance this reality with the investments that we believe are appropriate to continue to drive long-term shareholder value creation.
We have a clear, compelling growth strategy ahead of us, and our company has a long-standing track record of success in executing against our strategies.
At this point, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

One, we would not alter the quality, make, materials or findings of any of our products, and we chose very specifically to make sure our customers maintain the quality they've come to expect. Having made that decision, the price increases are different by merchandise categories, and different merchandise categories play out also geographically differently. So what we really tried to do was take the product categories and the regions and come up with an overall point of view about what to pass on and what not. I think embedded in the second-quarter guidance reflects some margin pressure because the cost of goods in general are higher than all the prices we passed on. But not unlike the first quarter, our strategy of quality first and merchandising of pricing, we think drives sell-throughs and market share opportunities, again, that the first quarter exemplified the kind of flow-through we can get. So by market, by merchandise categories, some sensitivity, the channel, the distribution, mid-tier versus luxury were baked into the matrix of pricing that second and third quarter reflects. I think, as Tracey talked about, while we are seeing raw materials come down for next spring, there's a lot of merchandising of old higher-priced yarns and materials with new pricing that will play out through spring. So if raw materials stay down by summer and next fall, I think we'll begin to see overall cost of goods come down. By then, we'll know how the customers react to the price increases and where we go from there."

Let me try to answer it this way. Our model is an integrated model, and whether it's Europe, United States or now Asia, we've gotten much better at trying to think through channels of distribution and appropriateness",435,"Well, it's a very important question. Let me try to answer it this way. Our model is an integrated model, and whether it's Europe, United States or now Asia, we've gotten much better at trying to think through channels of distribution and appropriateness of how we speak to the customer, whether it's brick-and-mortar retail, freestanding stores or concession or whether it's online and e-commerce. We try to marry that by market against the wholesale points of distribution that we feel are appropriate. Clearly, in this quarter, with the addition of important business in Asia, retail was larger than wholesale, which is kind of new for us. I think we'll see a similar phenomena in our third quarter, and then second and fourth quarters for us, are larger wholesale quarters, retail being a bit smaller. But the success that you're seeing in the numbers and you see in the stores is really a result of many, many years for those who have followed the story of investing in talent, in products, in presentation and very innovative marketing. The car show we have going on in Paris has been extraordinarily successful and has helped build the brand awareness in that market where we have important retail and we have also important wholesale. So the entire model is a mosaic of integrated pieces, clearly, direct to consumer, brick and mortar or online is a growing part of our business and will be the dominant part of our Asia business. There's no doubt that each country has a different distribution model, but in Asia, the bulk of the business will come through flagships, dedicated freestanding stores either by men or women or accessories. We've opened recently a kid's store that's been extraordinarily successful. So the opportunities in Asia are almost unlimited and most of that will be approached through our ability to execute at retail. Today, our retail profitability in the merchandise categories that we're in I think stands second to no one. And as we grow the accessory business and that becomes an increased part of our direct to consumer, I think it's only going to get better. Where we've given accessory space to our own stores, whether it's Madison Avenue or Belle Harbor or our recent store we opened in Hong Kong in the Peninsula, the reaction to accessories, whether it's handbags or watches or belts or scarves, has been truly satisfying. So we really think we're on the right trend and the combination of accessory growth, Asia growth and the success in U.S. and Europe, I think, will continue to push the retail to higher heights."

Our second quarter, I think, I was saying to Omar, the penetration of wholesale to retail begins to flip. So with that, we get a different kind of margin mix and the impact of cost of goods hits the markup. What worked so extraordinarily well in the first quarter was the full-price sell-throughs, and that was true at wholesale or retail or online. And that really drove the extraordinary margin performance that allowed us to ride over the cost-of-good increases. If that were to repeat itself in the second quarter, and at the moment, our forecasts do not include a 19% comp store retail increase. But if that were to occur, my guess is that the guidance would look conservative in hindsight. But I think at this point, sitting here in the early part of August, we really haven't gotten enough of a read on fall products, and we haven't got enough of a read on the new pricing to make that kind of prediction. So more to follow as the customer begins to react to products. What we have delivered for fall, whether it's in Ralph Lauren brands or Club Monaco, that does seem to be resonating with the customer is really wear-now fabrics, silhouettes, in fall colors. So we are getting a good read on those new deliveries, and that's a good sign for what second quarter may bring us. But at this point, it's really based more on the mix than anything else."

If you could help me understand, I'm still trying to figure out why gross margins go down from here sequentially. I understand the mix shift and second quarter being a big wholesale selling quarter, and then you'll see cost inflation in that part of the business. But it sounds like pricing is about to take hold and the current trends you're seeing, your gross margins are up, while most of your peers are seeing them down. I'm having a hard time trying figuring out how to model that lower from here. And then secondly on denim, that's been a category where I think the company has had mixed success in the past. It's a huge category in the U.S. and one that I'm surprised that we aren't sitting here today seeing you guys have a bigger share. Is there something structurally that gives you more confidence as you refocus on it now versus how you've approached in the past? And what do you think has maybe caused the results to fall short of your expectations in the past to help us think about it as you reenter that category?"

Interestingly enough, historically, first quarter is our highest gross margin quarter of the year, and that's not only driven by the growing retail penetration. But it's really about the product mix because April, May, June period for us is heavily a key item classification, high margin, strong sell-through time of year. And those products tend to come with higher margins. So even though we're up to a record-setting level this first quarter, we've historically run higher margins in the first quarter than the rest of the year. The second, third or fourth quarters tend to be more similar as we work our way through the year, particularly second and fourth quarter tend to be more collection deliveries. And then first and third quarter tend to be more key item and classification. So there's a lot of product mix within the channels and within the segments that do alter meaningfully the gross margin by quarter. The denim question, we agree with you. We think it's an extraordinary opportunity. We think no one has a seat at the table larger than Ralph Lauren. And I think we're now very comfortable with the pyramid of denim that we're representing to the customer. So at the high-end RRL, where we've just opened a new store downtown, if you haven't seen it, but we're very pleased with how that's performing, whether it's in the 72nd Street store or whether it's in our freestanding stores, we are really looking for that business to not only halo but grow into a business of size and scale as it's already the hottest item we have in Japan, and we'll later this fall open a store in London. From there, we actually have this fall Black Label denim coming, which we think is an important extension of the Black Label customers and sensibility. You'll see that in our stores later this year, and we think that speaks to a very specific audience. And then as Jacki talked about, the relaunch of a broader-based denim, which will not only replace here in the United States the Polo Jeans business, but in Europe and in Asia, we think profiles us against that business beautifully. So that, for us, is the beginning of a worldwide opportunity in men's and women's and then of course there's a trickle down into kid's. So we don't disagree the denim business is an enormous opportunity, and there are no structural or brand barriers to have that succeed."

A lot of the issues that seem to be behind the volatility are not new issues. So the uncertainty over debt in Europe, some of the issues here in the United States are not ones that have just come up in the last week. So what is creating the volatility? Where the consumer begins to be impacted by it? We really don't know. So we are, until proven otherwise, pressing ahead with our plans, and we feel good about the trends. First quarter was clearly a big downpayment on the year, the business in Asia, while it's infant state is still very strong. And we're seeing good strong global tourism. So at this point, we're watching carefully, but our forecasts reflect our best thinking. The retail accessory question that you mentioned, I think if you go to the 72nd Street store, where we've devoted the entire main floor to our accessory businesses, if you went to Paris, if you went to The Peninsula in Hong Kong or any of the new stores, you can see the distortion we've given accessories and our thoughts are now to circle back on many of our key flagships and look at how to make those stores similarly reflect our commitment and belief. Having gotten back the footwear business and then the accessory business, more leather good, belts over the years, I think we've built extraordinarily talented teams of people. We have developed the sourcing capabilities, and I think you're now beginning to see that reflected in the products that the customers are seeing, and where we've given a proper representation, they're voting yes. So that's an exciting opportunity for us as we push forward."

So we've got total visibility to all of our inventory worldwide. As a matter of fact, I think in somewhat of a pioneering investment, we also have visibility into raw materials, where it is in the manufacturing cycle, where it is in the transportation cycle. And so any part of that, that you want to review, you can. One of the things we chose to do when there was concern about factory capacity and transportation capacity was to pull forward inventory in order to minimize disruption. That also allowed us to be most efficient in our transportation and distribution costs. But one of the things we were able to do with that pull forward, which we used our balance sheets to carry heavier inventories coming out of June, is ensure timely deliveries, which are driving sales. And I think the cost of goods is somewhat impacted positively by a more thoughtful transportation and logistics, which did save us some on the margin component. So we do have it by region, channel, brand and we're managing that carefully. I think as Tracey said, by the end of the second quarter, I think you'll see some of this in-transit and some of this pull forward on the fall level back out. So we're very comfortable with where we are given our sales forecast at the moment."

Those local merchants are really feeling the squeeze of the difficult economic environment. It's not a market that has a meaningful department store   exposure. Rinascente in Milan is probably the one exception. So you're really distributing through either mono-brand stores or through a specialty distribution, and I think they're not only feeling it, they're struggling with their own cash flows. So at least for the moment, we're looking at a fall that's probably more the same. And while it's an important country to us, I think you can see in the overall international results and particularly the European results, the strong countries, i.e. France and Germany, the U.K., the Scandinavian markets are all so extraordinarily strong that we're managing the softness in Southern Europe, whether it's Italy or to some degree, Spain. In Asia, we're really in our infancy, and our ability to work with the existing networks that we took back from our licensees, reposition those and move forward. As we're elevating product and content, we're also looking at pricing. So we're trying to take a more global point of view on the appropriateness of price differentiation whether it's Japan or China or South Korea. The Asian customer is very savvy and cross shops whether they cross shop within Asia Pac, or whether they travel to Europe. So I think the subject of global pricing, excluding for a moment the duties, is going to be one in the future. In general, we were priced through our licensed distribution too low. So we think we have found opportunities by merchandise categories to get better alignment with the market conditions."

I'm going to keep my remarks relatively brief this morning since I really got a cold and I'm losing my voice.

I'm going to keep my remarks relatively brief this morning since I really got a cold and I'm losing my voice. There's no question that we're reporting better-than-expected second quarter results today. Double-digit revenue growth in each of our major geographies contributed to consolidated sales that were 24% better than prior year. The 18% increase in second quarter earnings per share reflects strong profit flow-through even as we're managing through substantial cost of goods inflation and continued investment in our long-term growth initiatives, including the integration of the strategically important regions and products now as directly controlled operations. 
The double-digit sales and profit growth come on top of double-digit gains in the prior year period, a clear demonstration of the growing desirability of Ralph Lauren brands across an expanding range of merchandise categories and on an increasingly global platform. The high teens domestic revenue we achieved in the quarter is extraordinary considering the existing scale of our business. It's also well-balanced across distribution channels supported by a fantastic growth in our Men's business, kids, dresses and the successful launch of Denim & Supply. 
Our international revenues grew twice as fast as our domestic sales and represented approximately 38% of our consolidated revenues. In Europe, we are capturing share with our core merchandise offerings through a combination of productivity gains and incremental distribution, including the expansion of existing shops to accommodate the growing bandwidth of each of our brands. 
As we've discussed in the past, we don't have distribution for all of our brands in Europe yet, so we are rolling out new merchandise categories including Lauren, footwear and Club Monaco, which is yielding incremental distribution and extending our reach through the continent. There's been a lot of concern about the European business trends, given the sovereign debt crisis that has gripped headlines over the last 6 months. 
Having been in Europe last week, it is a key topic of conversation. However, there is clearly a long-term opportunity for us to continue to expand there. Much of our focus in Europe over the next several years will be the introduction of new product categories and additional direct-to-customer efforts, which include Mono brand stores, e-commerce or shop-in-shops. 
As you know, Asia is a high-growth region for us and the appetite for the Ralph Lauren brand continues to expand across all major territories. Greater China represents the biggest single long-term growth opportunity in the region. Today, Greater China represents only 3% of our consolidated revenues. That is unlikely to change very much in the near term since we are closing important points of our legacy distribution this year. After resetting our local market presence, we intend to pursue measured thoughtful growth in the region. We are confident with our brands and the luxury product acceptance in Greater China. The response to our most elevated products, including apparel and accessories, have been tremendous in the new locations that we sell. We need to raise the understanding and awareness of the Ralph Lauren lifestyle brands. Establishing flagship presence the region is critical. We've identified the need for flagship presence in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing and are actively working to secure locations in each city. 
We are also looking for the right opportunities to go directly to our customers on a broader scale. While new stores are important component of our expanding direct-to-customer reach, e-commerce is another major area of focus for us. In the United States, RalphLauren.com continues to grow at a mid-20s-percent rate. It is an increasingly important vehicle to educate customers about the scope of the World of Ralph Lauren. From the useful platform to showcase new and emerging merchandise categories, particularly those with more limited distribution in our stores. 
As a result, we find that the Childrenswear, accessories and home products enjoy a higher sales penetration online than we experienced in our brick-and-mortar stores, and the ready acceptance of Denim & Supply on RalphLauren.com is also very encouraging. We're expanding our online reach in Europe by going live in France and several other French-speaking countries. We did that during the second quarter. We also recently launched Germany on October 14. And we'll continue to execute against the broad global e-commerce strategy, one that we believe will include parts of Asia over the next 1 to 2 years. 
We are proud of the excellent results we've achieved across the company in the first half of the year, both in terms of financial performance and really progress on all of our key growth initiatives. There is no doubt that our long-standing commitment to invest in design and to innovate with new merchandising that is made to the highest quality standards and presented in a unique, aspirational shopping environment has supported our performance. 
The customer has been most excited to spend on new fashion products. So we're comfortable with our decision that we made to deal with the higher cost, particularly since the customer continues to vote for Ralph Lauren brands across merchandise categories. 
Over the last 2 months, we've seen extreme stock market movement and negative economic news, which resulted in more volatile sales and traffic at Ralph Lauren stores in the United States and Europe, particularly with local customers. Our past experience suggests that the volatility in traffic has more to do with sentiment than it does with our ability -- customers' ability to spend. Having said that, the near-term outlook for the global economy historically has been a good indicator for discretionary sales trends but has slowed. And while we are raising our sales and profit outlook for the year, it's important to remember in the context of geopolitical uncertainty, the critical holiday selling period is still ahead of us. We believe we are well positioned for holiday, and that we've invested in the right merchandise strategies to leverage our brand strength as we go to source for gifts and self purpose. 
Macroeconomic dynamics are clearly out of our control, but we are an agile organization, and we believe we are prepared to navigate through them as we've successfully done in the past. We are armed with the strongest, most desirable brand in the world, one that has managed to outperform in good times and bad. And we have been thoughtful to invest in high-return strategic initiatives that allow us to deliver both near-term and long-term results. 
Our sustained focus on our growth initiatives is validated by the resilience and consistency of our performance over the last several years. But despite the near-term headwinds, we believe we are well positioned to generate substantial shareholder value over the long term, and we continue to believe the best is yet to come. 
Now I'll last Jacki to comment on the product and merchandising highlights for the quarter."

The second quarter was yet another period of strong global expansion for us as evidenced by our most channel revenue growth. Our products are certainly an important driver of that success as are the thoughtful planning and merchandising strategies that have both supported market share gains and helping to mitigate the impact of cost of goods inflation. 
As Ralph commented in this morning's press release, we continue to pursue exciting new avenues of growth by leveraging the desirability of our brand across the growing range of merchandise categories. Our unwavering commitment to product innovation is supporting the momentum in both core and emerging classification. This morning, I'd like to take you through some key second quarter product highlights, as well as update you on milestones for our denim and accessories initiatives. 
First and foremost, the growth in our Men's business worldwide continues to be spectacular. This season, Ralph and the design team create distinctive new products that further distinguished us in the marketplace and drive incremental market share gains. The iconic vernacular of the Ralph Lauren brand enabled us to address the more traditional aesthetic with Purple Label and Polo and more contemporary ones of Black Label and RLX. 
We're now addressing a younger, more casual and more eclectic male customers with our Denim & Supply line but more on that exciting introduction in a moment. The momentum in Childrenswear is a similar story to men's, and Childrenswear merchandise was an important driver of our revenue growth across channel and regions during the second quarter. The investments we've made in developing our assortment from to boys and girls has fueled the appetite for our product worldwide. 
We are uniquely positioned to address the child's complete wardrobe requirement from school and play to special occasion, and we continue to enjoy preference as the go to brand for, which is a testament to the quality of the product and the prestige of the brand. Innovative marketing initiatives such as the RL gang interactive and shoppable digital storybook and the first ever online fashion show for girls 7 to 14 solidify our position as the leader in premium Childrenswear. 
We believe there is much more category growth for us, especially in the international markets, and Childrenswear is expected to be an important part of our overall Asian growth strategy. For the critical holiday season, we continue to leverage the gift-giving appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand across every product territory. We know that the aspirational nature of our brand and the quality of our product are a powerful combination when consumer is selecting the right gifts for everyone on the list. 
Where appropriate, we carry a design theme and product story across multiple categories to create a more unified world of Ralph Lauren presentation at this time of year. And our in-store digital and print marketing emphasize the timeless appeal of a gift from Ralph Lauren. In terms of newer initiatives, one of the most exciting milestones of the second quarter was the global launch of our newest brand, Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply. Consumer interest and acceptance is very encouraging across both men's and women's, particularly for more of the international-oriented novelty pieces that are unique to our portfolio. 
The combination of the brand positioning, the product content and the in-store and online presentation is resonating with the consumer. The sensibility of the Denim & Supply product and the power of the Ralph Lauren brand allows us to secure a significant incremental floor space to present this newest offering to the consumer. Our investment in the shopping environment is a powerful demonstration of our long-term commitment to the category and reinforces our belief in the ability of the unique and strongly branded in-store environment to both attract attention on the selling floor and bring the merchandise to life. 
Our online marketing and social media efforts were extremely effective at creating awareness with the Denim & Supply brands, and we'll continue to invest in that messaging to drive awareness. We believe that our lifestyle approach to this category makes Denim & Supply both distinctive in the marketplace and represents a meaningful global opportunity for us. 
As you've heard in previous calls, developing a large dynamic accessories offering has been one of our key strategic initiatives. And while it's still a new business for us, we are experiencing great acceptance of our accessory merchandise. In September, we hosted 300 fashion editors and buyers from around the world for a special preview of the spring 2012 Ralph Lauren accessories collection at our women flagship store in 88 [ph] Madison. The reaction was spectacular. 
We effectively communicated the substantial evolution of the breadth of our handbags, footwear, belts and scarf offerings and the importance of these categories which underscores by their positioning in the store. Editors and buyers alike were particularly impressed by our new shape, materials, colors and the range of price forms for our handbags. We are confident that with the additional distribution, we will grow Ralph Lauren accessories into a large-scale International business. 
Our Lauren handbags and small leather goods have also gained momentum. With the benefit of reading first couple seasons of market response, we've been able to calibrate our assortments to have the right balance of offering and seasonal fashion. Our dual focus on design and function combined with the extraordinary relevance of consumer confidence in the Lauren brand will support additional distribution of Lauren accessories over the next several years. 
The opportunity in men's is also evolving nicely to both the Ralph Lauren and Polo brands, and we'll look to expand distribution of men's and accessories over the next few season. In order to grow awareness of our presence in the category and to showcase the product in the most aspirational way, we've continued to accessories in our global advertising campaign. We believe that the power of the Ralph Lauren brand and our unique lifestyle approach to design will be as successful for our Accessories business as it has been for apparel, and we see tremendous long-term opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,141879705,188334,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2011",2011-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we reported excellent second quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.9 billion, 24% greater than the prior year period and better than the h",2142,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we reported excellent second quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.9 billion, 24% greater than the prior year period and better than the high teens to low 20% growth expectation we outlined for you in August. The increase in net revenues reflects double-digit gains at our wholesale and retail segments with higher sales of our core apparel products, particularly men's and Childrenswear supporting our top line momentum across all channels worldwide. 
The combination of both the incremental revenues from the South Korean license transition and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation affected our total reported revenue growth by approximately 6%. The second quarter gross profit margin of 56.6% was 140 basis points below the prior year period and was in line with our expectations as we experienced the full impact of higher cost of goods inflation, which outweighed the combined offsetting effect of our selective price increases, a higher Retail segment penetration and the beneficial margin impact of international sales growth penetration. 
Operating expenses of $728 million were 25% greater than the prior year period. We gain leverage operating expenses by 30 basis points, which was considerably below the approximately 150 basis points of deleverage we anticipated in the quarter. The upside to our expectations was mostly due to our ability to leverage expenses on the higher sales level we achieved. The modest deleverage reflects a higher retail channel mix, including the transition of our formally licensed South Korea operations, which is entirely retail distribution. 
Our operating income of $351 million was 14% greater than the prior year period, and our operating margin was 18.4%, which was 170 basis points below the record 20.1% level achieved in the prior year period. The decline in our operating margin was primarily a function of the gross margin impact of the unprecedented cost of goods inflation we experienced during the quarter, in addition to shifts in our overall channel mix. 
The growth in operating income drove the 14% increase in second quarter net income to $233 million, and net income per diluted share rose 18% to $2.46. Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter, our Wholesale segment sales increased 20% to $996 million, and constant dollars sales increase 17%. Global sales of our core merchandise, particularly men's and Childrenswear, in addition to new merchandise categories such as Denim & Supply in the U.S. and the expansion of footwear distribution in Europe, all contributed to our growth. 
In the U.S. we continue to see broad-based strength across multiple men's labels in both department stores, as well as specialty stores. Polo Sportswear trends have been particularly good, especially for novelty and exclusive items, and men's Black Label continues to gain momentum as its merchandise offering expands. Women's sportswear trends remain challenging in the U.S., although our dresses and accessories benefited from expanded assortments and incremental distribution. 
In Europe, menswear sales to department stores were strong as we continue to improve productivity and capture additional floor space for existing and new merchandise categories. European wholesale shipments also benefited from expanded distribution from Lauren sportswear and the introduction of Polo footwear. However, shipments to independent specialty stores throughout Europe and in Italy, in particular, were more challenging as they have been for us and many others over the last several quarters. 
Total operating income for the second quarter rose 4% to $247 million, although the wholesale operating margin declined 400 basis points to 24.8%. The decline in wholesale operating margin was primarily due to cost of goods inflation and incremental expenses associated with investment in new product expansion such as home textiles, Denim & Supply and Club Monaco in Europe. 
Our continued success in expanding our direct to consumer reach is evidenced in the 31% growth in Retail segment sales to $861 million during the quarter. We achieved comparable store sales growth across most retail concepts, and the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from the newly assumed South Korean operation were other important drivers of growth. 
Overall comp store sales increased 13%, reflecting 5% growth at Ralph Lauren stores and 14% increase in factory stores and 24% growth at Club Monaco stores. RalphLauren.com sales continue to expand at a double-digit rate, increasing comp sales 25% in the second quarter. Overall comp gains were primarily a combined result of the transaction growth and an increase in average dollars sales per transaction with the latter mostly due to higher average unit retail prices resulting from the price increases taken due to the cost of goods inflation. 
However, traffic trends were mixed across our global retail format during the quarter. At our Ralph Lauren stores, we did experience lower traffic in the U.S. and Europe during the extreme stock market volatility in August and September although generally speaking, our flagship stores globally continue to outperform in the quarter. Sales trends at our stores and concession shops around Asia were very strong in the quarter, and the recovery in Japan remains on track. 
Momentum at our factory stores worldwide continue to be exceptional in the quarter. In addition to increased traffic to our factory stores, the strength of our brand combined with our compelling assortment this season across men, women and Childrenswear is driving a higher conversion. Online, men's, Childrenswear and accessories were particularly strong during the quarter as was the introduction of our new Denim & Supply line. 
Club Monaco's robust sale gains are continuing to be driven primarily by trend like women's merchandise. We opened 12 directly operated freestanding stores and closed 9 stores during the second quarter, 5 of which were in the Greater China region. In conjunction with our Greater China repositioning effort, we also closed 23 shop locations and 5 franchise stores during the quarter. We ended the period with 374 company operated stores and 522 concession shop locations globally. 
Retail operating income grew 39% to $146 million in the second quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 100 basis points to 17%. The improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate are primarily due to comparable store sales growth and improved profit trends in Asia, both in Greater China, as well as in Japan. These improvements offset the substantial pressure we had from cost of goods inflation, expenses related to the transition of the South Korea operations and continued investment in international e-commerce development. 
Licensing royalties were $48 million in the second quarter, 3% greater than the prior year period, primarily due to increased domestic apparel product royalties. Growth was partially offset by lower fragrance and international licensing royalty as we were anniversary-ing both last year's big fragrance launch and the transition of formally licensed South Korea operations. 
Operating income for our licensing segment also rose 8% to $30 million, a result of higher royalty revenues and lower net costs. We ended the quarter with $979 million in cash and investments and $606 million in net cash. Consolidated inventory was up 35% at the end of the second quarter on a reported basis. 
The components of the 35% increase are as follows. Non-comp items included in our inventory this year are new merchandise categories like Denim & Supply and home textiles, newly transitioned operations such as South Korea and new channels of distribution such as our international e-commerce site and new retail stores. These all combined to represent 14% of the 35% total growth. 
Another 14% of the increase is to support the comp anticipated sales growth and changes in shipment cadence across previously existing product categories, geographies and channels. The remaining 7% of the 35% increase is primarily attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency impacts. We continue to expect inventory growth to become aggressively more in line with sales trends throughout fiscal 2012 as we cycle through changes in year-over-year shipment cadence and anniversary of the transition of formally licensed operations. 
We spent approximately $53 million on CapEx during the second quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 773,000 shares of stock utilizing $92 million of our current authorization, and we had approximately $579 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program at the end of the second quarter. We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results, which demonstrate continued momentum in our core and emerging businesses around the world. We've once again achieved double-digit profit expansion in the quarter even as we continue to make important incremental investment in each of our key growth initiatives in order to support continued future growth of our business. 
As you are all acutely aware, the extraordinary volatility in global equity and credit markets that began in early August and intensified in the last 2 months. Political and macroeconomic uncertainties are weighing on business and consumer confidence, and we have seen increased weekly sales volatility in our U.S. and European stores. And so while we are raising our sales and profit outlook for the year on the strength of our first half performance, we do continue to monitor trends across all channels and regions in order to proactively address any material changes that could affect our plans and outlook, which I'd like to review with you now. 
For the third quarter, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a low teens rate. Our expectations are based on a mid-single digit increase in global wholesale sales and a high teens increase in Retail segment sales, including high single-digit comparable store sales growth. In addition to a more challenging environment, particularly in Europe, wholesale revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2012 is expected to be additionally suppressed as the continued channel shift in Japan, where we have transitioned certain wholesale distribution to directly operated concession shops, and the closure of some of our shops in greater China as part of our repositioning efforts. 
For our Retail segment, we will anniversary the acquisition of the South Korea license in the fourth quarter this year. So incremental non-comp revenue growth we have experienced from South Korea in the first half of this year will be reduced in the second half. Our Retail segment sales and profit in the second half of the year will also begin to reflect a more pronounced impact from our Greater China repositioning efforts, many of which were planned to transmission at the end of the second quarter as I mentioned earlier and during the fourth quarter. 
Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points below that achieved in the comparable prior year with the decline split evenly between gross margin pressure and expense de-leverage. Indeed, we expect as we have experienced gross margin to also be down for the balance of fiscal 2012, including for our spring shipments as costing remains above the prior year levels. 
Operating expenses are also expected to continue to de-leverage compared to last year due to the higher retail channel mix shift this year, driven primarily by both South Korea and new stores and investment in infrastructure related to international e-commerce distribution. We have also incurred additional investments for the launch of new product categories in the U.S. and Europe. 
For the full fiscal 2012 period, we now expect revenues to increase at a high teens to low 20% range, which compares to our prior year expectations of mid to high teens growth. Our full year operating margin outlook is now expected to be down 50 basis points from the prior year period, which is an improvement relative to our prior expectation of a 50 to 100 basis point decline. 
We have also revised our expectations of restructuring charges associated with our Greater China shop network repositioning program to approximately $5 million for the full year, $4 million of which is expected to come in the second half of the year and mostly concentrated in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs have consistently been segregated and excluded from our operating margin guidance. The substantial reduction in anticipated restructuring costs from our original $10 million to $20 million estimates reflect our active management to successfully repurpose or transfer leases and redeploy staff to other parts of the company. 
Our organization is focused on navigating through global economic uncertainty while continuing to prudently invest in our long-term strategies of international expansion, direct-to-consumer expansion and merchandise innovation. We are extremely proud of our year-to-date accomplishments. And barring any significant economic jilts in the U.S. or Europe, we are comfortable in our ability to once again deliver double-digit profit growth resulting from our strategies as reflected in our full year guidance. 
And at this point, we're going to open up the call and take any questions that you may have. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

And I think all of that we've framed in the past and we've framed in terms of aspirations about what we thought we could do and quite frankly, we're doing that and then some. One of the real surprises in the revenue story is the very strong domestic growth. A lot of prior conversations that we've modeled with all of you talk about our ambition to do 1/3 of our business in Europe and 1/3 in Asia and 1/3 in the United States, and that was somewhat predicated on slow growth U.S. scenario given the scale of what we did, the distribution we had and our belief that the international markets would grow faster. But lo and behold as we just reported, the U.S. in this quarter had a high teens growth rate and yes, Europe was double that. But given the scale of the U.S. business, that's making meaningful difference to our top line performance. And as you know, sometimes size can fight against strong revenue growth without meaningful acquisition, and that's not our story. So as we look to continue to push out around the world, I don't think it dims any of our enthusiasm for the upside there. I think we've just surprised ourselves on the both domestic and wholesale fronts, as well as the direct-to-customer fronts here in the United States."

We knew from the beginning that during the course of late summer or into fall and then through the back half of this season, costs were rising really in their most spectacular fashion with this holiday season being sort of the apex of that. A lot of the suppliers in the early part of price escalation were still blending the prices with inventory on hand that had not experienced quite as big ramp up. As that inventory was depleted and you were now bearing the full brunt of the extraordinary run-up in prices, that's really a big part of what's pressuring the third quarter cost of goods in a greater degree than other quarters. Of course, that begins to come back in line as it plays out over the next 9 months, so take that high cost of raw materials, and they'll begin to blend it in with lower cost materials. And then it should begin to play down towards next fall. So there's definitely sort of a peak to cost of goods that we'll be experiencing through the next 3 or 4 months. We chose to pass along in many cases, but not all cases the full impact of the cost of goods, and that was the decision that was made by merchandise category and by region. The combination of that for us was the thought process about margin rates, as well as sales and opportunity. And I think to Omar's question part of our the story of sales results for the first 6 months I think reflect the proper balance we struck between margin rate and sales. And we'll continue to do that as we work our way through this volatile cost of goods period. The customer, which I think is embedded in one of your questions, actually has responded very well in most cases to fashion first. So if it's new product and they're excited, they buy it. And the relative pricing of that is immaterial. I think when there's something that catches their attention that's new and different, that's been a nonissue. In terms of products that are more perennials or basics, I think there was some deceleration in unit sales for a period, and that's been climbing back. The actual results are difficult to draw final conclusions given that you're seeing the results of our July, August, September, which were extraordinary. October was a bit of a softer month. And then the businesses come back stronger in November to-date. So I think we're going to need to get through the back end of the holiday selling season to get sort of a final read on customer reaction to all this volatility."

The headline I would identify in terms of the performance is really not distinguished by geography, but it's probably distinguished by markets that have important tourist components whether they are in the United States or in Europe or even in Asia are the ones that outperformed any of the total numbers. So there is still a meaningful tourist component to gateways cities or tourist cities Europe, United States or Asia. Quite frankly, South Korea is a tourist destination for Chinese. So you really have to know that holistically. I would say the second piece of it is the local domestic customer whether that's Europe or the United States was actually slower. So fall shopping patterns in markets that are not considered gateway cities or supplemented by tourists were softer than average. So it's been a combination of those 2 factors really worldwide that make up the mix. And so as we look out over the holiday shopping period, over the next 6 weeks, one of the interesting things is a spike macroeconomic issues and all the other issues we could rattle up together, one thing that retailers don't like to talk about but it's true is the weather. And as the weather has cooled off in Europe and the United States, we've actually seen pretty healthy returns of shopping patterns.

So our performance in England or France or Germany or the Scandinavian markets is quite strong, but the southern part of Europe we don't have that much distribution in Greece, but certainly Italy or Spain have been more difficult. I think also for us a particularly difficult quarter fall where we're delivering a lot of heavyweight products. So whether it's the economic realities of Southern Europe compounded by this particular quarter is always more difficult for us. Those markets have underperformed. The northern markets have overperformed. The other thing that I guess we could debate whether it's Europe or not. But our business in territories like the Middle East, our territories like Russia have been very strong through this period. But while we can call them for us emerging markets, we can call them anything we want, the fact is our product and our elevated product in those markets is quite strong. I think the other subject that Tracey touched on was the more challenging specialty store, multi-brand specialty store business has been difficult in the southern parts of Europe for several seasons now. So our business and the strength of our business is really coming out of Mono brand stores whether they're owned or joint venture or license and/or our department store business. So kind of a country issue and it's also a channel issue. In terms of new product categories relative to the total growth at Europe, I think what's been surprising to us and this somewhat comes back to Omar's question is when we went into this year, we went in with an investment point of view about the markets, new brands, new product distribution and those are all playing out. The strength of the year-to-date has actually been the core product the core distribution outperforming. But the bulk of Europe's growth is not in the new businesses yet. I think those are seeds we're planting for the future that will ultimately give us a lot of growth in the years to come.

I'm going to keep my remarks relatively brief this morning since I really got a cold and I'm losing my voice.

I'm going to keep my remarks relatively brief this morning since I really got a cold and I'm losing my voice. There's no question that we're reporting better-than-expected second quarter results today. Double-digit revenue growth in each of our major geographies contributed to consolidated sales that were 24% better than prior year. The 18% increase in second quarter earnings per share reflects strong profit flow-through even as we're managing through substantial cost of goods inflation and continued investment in our long-term growth initiatives, including the integration of the strategically important regions and products now as directly controlled operations. 
The double-digit sales and profit growth come on top of double-digit gains in the prior year period, a clear demonstration of the growing desirability of Ralph Lauren brands across an expanding range of merchandise categories and on an increasingly global platform. The high-teens domestic revenue we achieved in the quarter is extraordinary considering the existing scale of our business. It's also well-balanced across distribution channels supported by a fantastic growth in our Men's business, kids, dresses and the successful launch of Denim & Supply. 
Our international revenues grew twice as fast as our domestic sales and represented approximately 38% of our consolidated revenues. In Europe, we are capturing share with our core merchandise offerings through a combination of productivity gains and incremental distribution, including the expansion of existing shops to accommodate the growing bandwidth of each of our brands. 
As we've discussed in the past, we don't have distribution for all of our brands in Europe yet, so we are rolling out new merchandise categories including Lauren footwear and Club Monaco, which is yielding incremental distribution and extending our reach through the continent. There's been a lot of concern about the European business trends, given the sovereign debt crisis that has gripped headlines over the last 6 months. 
Having been in Europe last week, it is a key topic of conversation. However, there is clearly a long-term opportunity for us to continue to expand there. Much of our focus in Europe over the next several years will be the introduction of new product categories and additional direct-to-customer efforts, which include mono brand stores, e-commerce or shop-in-shops. 
As you know, Asia is a high-growth region for us and the appetite for the Ralph Lauren brand continues to expand across all major territories. Greater China represents the biggest single long-term growth opportunity in the region. Today, Greater China represents only 3% of our consolidated revenues. That is unlikely to change very much in the near term since we are closing important points of our legacy distribution this year. After resetting our local market presence, we intend to pursue measured thoughtful growth in the region. We are confident with our brands and the luxury product acceptance in Greater China. The response to our most elevated products, including apparel and accessories, have been tremendous in the new locations that we sell. We need to raise the understanding and awareness of the Ralph Lauren lifestyle brands. Establishing flagship presence in the region is critical. We've identified the need for flagship presence in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing and are actively working to secure locations in each city. 
We are also looking for the right opportunities to go directly to our customers on a broader scale. While new stores are important component of our expanding direct-to-customer reach, e-commerce is another major area of focus for us. In the United States, RalphLauren.com continues to grow at a mid-20s-percent rate. It is an increasingly important vehicle to educate customers about the scope of the World of Ralph Lauren. It's been a useful platform to showcase new and emerging merchandise categories, particularly those with more limited distribution in our stores. 
As a result, we find that the Childrenswear, accessories and home products enjoy a higher sales penetration online than we experienced in our brick and mortar stores, and the ready acceptance of Denim & Supply on RalphLauren.com is also very encouraging. We're expanding our online reach in Europe by going live in France and several other French-speaking countries. We did that during the second quarter. We also recently launched Germany on October 14. And we'll continue to execute against the broad global e-commerce strategy, one that we believe will include parts of Asia over the next 1 to 2 years. 
We are proud of the excellent results we've achieved across the company in the first half of the year, both in terms of financial performance and really progress on all of our key growth initiatives. There is no doubt that our long-standing commitment to invest in design and to innovate with new merchandising that is made to the highest quality standards and presented in a unique, aspirational shopping environment has supported our performance. 
The customer has been most excited to spend on new fashion products. So we're comfortable with our decisions that we made to deal with the higher cost, particularly since the customer continues to vote for Ralph Lauren brands across merchandise categories. 
Over the last 2 months, we've seen extreme stock market movement and negative economic news, which resulted in more volatile sales and traffic at Ralph Lauren stores in the United States and Europe, particularly with local customers. Our past experiences suggests that the volatility in traffic has more to do with sentiment than it does with our ability -- customers' ability to spend. Having said that, the near-term outlook for the global economy historically has been a good indicator for discretionary sales trends but has slowed. And while we are raising our sales and profit outlook for the year, it's important to remember in the context of geopolitical uncertainty, the critical holiday selling period is still ahead of us. We believe we are well positioned for holiday, and that we've invested in the right merchandise strategies to leverage our brand strength as a go-to resource for gifts and self-purchase. 
Macroeconomic dynamics are clearly out of our control, but we are an agile organization, and we believe we are prepared to navigate through them as we've successfully done in the past. We are armed with the strongest, most desirable brand in the world, one that has managed to outperform in good times and bad. And we have been thoughtful to invest in high-return strategic initiatives that allow us to deliver both near-term and long-term results. 
Our sustained focus on our growth initiatives is validated by the resilience and consistency of our performance over the last several years. But despite the near-term headwinds, we believe we are well positioned to generate substantial shareholder value over the long term, and we continue to believe the best is yet to come. 
Now I'll ask Jacki to comment on the product and merchandising highlights for the quarter."

The second quarter was yet another period of strong global expansion for us as evidenced by our mostly channel revenue growth. Our products are certainly an important driver of that success as are the thoughtful planning and merchandising strategies that are both supporting market share gains and helping to mitigate the impact of cost of goods inflation. 
As Ralph commented in this morning's press release, we continue to pursue exciting new avenues of growth by leveraging the desirability of our brand across the growing range of merchandise categories. Our unwavering commitment to product innovation is supporting the momentum in both core and emerging classification. This morning, I'd like to take you through some key second quarter product highlights, as well as update you on milestones for our denim and accessories initiatives. 
First and foremost, the growth in our Men's business worldwide continues to be spectacular. Season after season, Ralph and the design teams create distinctive new products that further distinguished us in the marketplace and drive incremental market share gain. The iconic vernacular of the Ralph Lauren brand enables us to address the more traditional aesthetic with Purple Label and Polo and the more contemporary ones of Black Label and RLX. 
We're now addressing a younger, more casual and more eclectic male customer with our Denim & Supply line but more on that exciting introduction in a moment. The momentum in Childrenswear is a similar story to Men's, and Childrenswear merchandise was an important driver of our revenue growth across channel and regions during the second quarter. The investments we've made in developing our assortment from layette and babies to boys and girls has fueled the appetite for our product worldwide. 
We are uniquely positioned to address the child's complete wardrobe requirement from school and play to special occasion, and we continue to enjoy preference as the go-to brand for gifting, which is a testament to the quality of the product and the prestige of the brand. Innovative marketing initiatives such as the RL Gang interactive and shoppable video storybook and the first ever online fashion show for girls 7 to 14, solidify our position as the leader in premium Childrenswear. 
We believe there is much more category growth for us, especially in the international markets, and Childrenswear is expected to be an important part of our overall Asian growth strategy. For the critical holiday season, we continue to leverage the gift-giving appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand across every product territory. We know that the aspirational nature of our brand and the quality of our product are a powerful combination when the consumer is selecting the right gifts for everyone on the list. 
Where appropriate, we carry a design theme and product story across multiple categories to create a more unified world of Ralph Lauren presentation at this time of year. And our in-store digital and print marketing emphasize the timeless appeal of a gift from Ralph Lauren. In terms of newer initiatives, one of the most exciting milestones of the second quarter was the global launch of our newest brand, Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply. Consumer interest and acceptance is very encouraging across both men's and women's, particularly for more fashion-oriented novelty pieces that are unique to our portfolio. 
The combination of the brand's positioning, the product content and the in-store and online presentation is resonating with the consumer. The sensibility of the Denim & Supply product and the power of the Ralph Lauren brand allows us to secure a significant incremental floor space to present this newest offering to the consumer. Our investment in the wholesale shop environment is a powerful demonstration of our long-term commitment to the category and reinforces our belief in the ability of the unique and strongly branded in-store environment to both attract attention on the selling floor and bring the merchandise to life. 
Our online marketing and social media efforts were extremely effective at creating awareness with the Denim & Supply brands, and we'll continue to invest in that messaging to drive awareness. We believe that our lifestyle approach to this category makes Denim & Supply both distinctive in the marketplace and represents a meaningful global opportunity for us. 
As you've heard in previous calls, developing a large, dynamic accessories offering has been one of our key strategic initiatives. And while it's still a new business for us, we are experiencing great acceptance of our accessory merchandise. In September, we hosted 300 fashion editors and buyers from around the world for a special preview of the spring 2012 Ralph Lauren accessories collection at our women flagship store at 888 Madison. The reaction was spectacular. 
We effectively communicated the substantial evolution of the breadth of our handbags, footwear, belts and scarf offerings and the importance of these categories was underscored by their positioning in the store. Editors and buyers alike were particularly impressed by our new shape, materials, colors and the range of price points for our handbags. We are confident that with the additional distribution, we will grow Ralph Lauren accessories into a large-scale international business. 
Our Lauren handbags and small leather goods have also gained momentum. With the benefit of reading first couple of seasons of market response, we've been able to calibrate our assortments to have the right balance of core offering and seasonal fashion. Our dual focus on design and function combined with the extraordinary relevance of consumer confidence in the Lauren brand will support additional distribution of Lauren accessories over the next several years. 
The opportunity in men's is also evolving nicely to both the Ralph Lauren and Polo brands, and we'll look to expand distribution of men's accessories over the next few season. In order to grow awareness of our presence in the category and to showcase the product in the most aspirational way, we've continued to emphasize accessories in our global advertising campaign. We believe that the power of the Ralph Lauren brand and our unique lifestyle approach to design will be as successful for our Accessories business as it has been for apparel, and we see tremendous long-term opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,141879705,188461,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2011",2011-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we reported excellent second quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.9 billion, 24% greater than the prior year period and better than the h",2133,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we reported excellent second quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.9 billion, 24% greater than the prior year period and better than the high-teens to low-20% growth expectation we outlined for you in August. The increase in net revenues reflects double-digit gains at our wholesale and retail segments with higher sales of our core apparel products, particularly Men's and Childrenswear supporting our top line momentum across all channels worldwide. 
The combination of both the incremental revenues from the South Korea license transition and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation affected our total reported revenue growth by approximately 6%. The second quarter gross profit margin of 56.6% was 140 basis points below the prior year period and was in line with our expectations as we experienced the full impact of higher cost of goods inflation, which outweighed the combined offsetting effect of our selective price increases, a higher retail segment penetration and the beneficial margin impact of international sales growth penetration. 
Operating expenses of $728 million were 25% greater than the prior year period. We deleverage operating expenses by 30 basis points, was considerably below the approximately 150 basis points of deleverage we anticipated in the quarter. The upside to our expectations was mostly due to our ability to leverage expenses on the higher sales level we achieved. The modest deleverage reflects a higher retail channel mix, including the transition of our formally licensed South Korea operations, which is entirely retail distribution. 
Our operating income of $351 million was 14% greater than the prior year period, and our operating margin was 18.4%, which was 170 basis points below the record 20.1% level achieved in the prior year period. The decline in our operating margin was primarily a function of the gross margin impact of the unprecedented cost of goods inflation we experienced during the quarter, in addition to shifts in our overall channel mix. 
The growth in operating income drove the 14% increase in the second quarter net income to $233 million, and net income per diluted share rose 18% to $2.46. Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter, our Wholesale segment sales increased 20% to $996 million, and constant dollars sales increase 17%. Global sales of our core merchandise, particularly Men's and Childrenswear, in addition to new merchandise categories such as Denim & Supply in the U.S. and the expansion of footwear distribution in Europe, all contributed to our growth. 
In the U.S. we continue to see broad-based strength across multiple men's labels in both department stores, as well as specialty stores. Polo Sportswear trends have been particularly good, especially for novelty and exclusive items, and men's Black Label continues to gain momentum as its merchandise offering expands. Women's sportswear trends remain challenging in the U.S., although our dresses and accessories benefited from expanded assortments and incremental distribution. 
In Europe, menswear sales to department stores were strong as we continue to improve productivity and capture additional floor space for existing and new merchandise categories. European wholesale shipments also benefited from expanded distribution for Lauren sportswear and the introduction of Polo footwear. However, shipments to independent specialty stores throughout Europe and in Italy, in particular, were more challenging as they have been for us and many others over the last several quarters. 
Total operating income for the second quarter rose 4% to $247 million, although the wholesale operating margin declined 400 basis points to 24.8%. The decline in wholesale operating margin was primarily due to cost of goods inflation and incremental expenses associated with the investment in new product expansion such as home textiles, Denim & Supply and Club Monaco in Europe. 
Our continued success in expanding our direct-to-consumer reach is evidenced in the 31% growth in Retail segment sales to $861 million during the quarter. We achieved comparable store sales growth across most retail concepts, and the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from the newly assumed South Korean operation were other important drivers of growth. 
Overall comp store sales increased 13%, reflecting 5% growth at Ralph Lauren stores and 14% increase at factory stores and 24% growth at Club Monaco stores. RalphLauren.com sales continue to expand at a double-digit rate, increasing comp sales 25% in the second quarter. Overall comp gains were primarily a combined result of both transaction growth and an increase in average dollars sales per transaction, with the latter mostly due to higher average unit retail prices resulting from the price increases taken due to the cost of goods inflation. 
However, traffic trends were mixed across our global retail formats during the quarter. At our Ralph Lauren stores, we did experience lower traffic in the U.S. and Europe during the extreme stock market volatility in August and September although generally speaking, our flagship stores globally continue to outperform in the quarter. Sales trends at our stores and concession shops throughout Asia were very strong in the quarter, and the recovery in Japan remains on track. 
Momentum at our factory stores worldwide continue to be exceptional in the quarter. In addition to increased traffic to our factory stores, the strength of our brand combined with our compelling assortment this season across men's, women's and Childrenswear is driving a higher conversion. Online, men's, Childrenswear and accessories were particularly strong during the quarter as was the introduction of our new Denim & Supply line. 
Club Monaco's robust sale gains are continuing to be driven primarily by trend-right women's merchandise. We opened 12 directly-operated freestanding stores and closed 9 stores during the second quarter, 5 of which were in the Greater China region. In conjunction with our Greater China repositioning effort, we also closed 23 shop locations and 5 franchise stores during the quarter. We ended the period with 374 company-operated stores and 522 concession shop locations globally. 
Retail operating income grew 39% to $146 million in the second quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 100 basis points to 17%. The improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate are primarily due to comparable store sales growth and improved profit trends in Asia, both in Greater China, as well as in Japan. This improvement offset the substantial pressure we had from cost of goods inflation, expenses related to the transition of the South Korea operation and continued investment in international e-commerce development. 
Licensing royalties were $48 million in the second quarter, 3% greater than the prior year period, primarily due to increased domestic apparel product royalties. Growth was partially offset by lower fragrance and international licensing royalties, as we were anniversary-ing both last year's big Pony fragrance launch and the transition of formally licensed South Korea operations. 
Operating income for our licensing segment also rose 8% to $30 million, a result of higher royalty revenues and lower net costs. We ended the quarter with $979 million in cash and investments and $606 million in net cash. Consolidated inventory was up 35% at the end of the second quarter on a reported basis. 
The components of the 35% increase are as follows: Non-comp items included in our inventory this year are new merchandise categories like Denim & Supply and home textile, newly transitioned operations such as South Korea and new channels of distribution such as our international e-commerce site and new retail stores. These all combined to represent 14% of the 35% total growth. 
Another 14% of the increase is to support the comp anticipated sales growth and changes in shipment cadence across previously existing product categories, geographies and channels. The remaining 7% of the 35% increase is primarily attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency impacts. We continue to expect inventory growth to become progressively more aligned with sales trends throughout fiscal 2012, as we cycle through changes in year-over-year shipment cadence and anniversary the transition of formally licensed operations. 
We spent approximately $53 million on CapEx during the second quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 773,000 shares of stock utilizing $92 million of our current authorization, and we had approximately $579 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program at the end of the second quarter. We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results, which demonstrate continued momentum in our core and emerging businesses around the world. We've once again achieved double-digit profit expansion in the quarter even as we continue to make important incremental investments in each of our key growth initiatives in order to support continued future growth of our business. 
As you are all acutely aware, the extraordinary volatility in global equity and credit markets that began in early August and intensified in the last 2 months. Political and macroeconomic uncertainties are weighing on business and consumer confidence, and we have seen increased weekly sales volatility in our U.S. and European stores. And so while we are raising our sales and profit outlook for the year on the strength of our first half performance, we do continue to monitor trends across all channels and regions in order to proactively address any material changes that could affect our plans and outlook, which I'd like to review with you now. 
For the third quarter, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a low-teens rate. Our expectations are based on a mid-single digit increase in global wholesale sales and a high-teens increase in Retail segment sales, including high single-digit comparable store sales growth. In addition to a more challenging environment, particularly in Europe, wholesale revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2012 is expected to be additionally suppressed by the continued channel shift in Japan, where we have transitioned certain wholesale distribution to directly operated concession shops, and the closure of some of our shops in Greater China as part of our repositioning efforts. 
For our Retail segment, we will anniversary the acquisition of the South Korea license in the fourth quarter of this year. So incremental non-comp revenue growth we have experienced from South Korea in the first half of this year will be reduced in the second half. Our Retail segment sales and profit in the second half of the year will also begin to reflect a more pronounced impact from our Greater China repositioning efforts, many of which were planned to transmission at the end of the second quarter as I mentioned earlier and during the fourth quarter. 
Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points below that achieved in the comparable prior year, with the decline split evenly between gross margin pressure and expense deleverage. Indeed, we expect as we have experienced gross margin to also be down for the balance of fiscal 2012, including for our spring shipments as costing remains above the prior year levels. 
Operating expenses are also expected to continue to deleverage compared to last year due to the higher retail channel mix shift this year, driven primarily by both South Korea and new stores and the investment in the infrastructure related to international e-commerce distribution. We have also incurred additional investment for the launch of new product categories in the U.S. and Europe. 
For the full fiscal 2012 period, we now expect revenues to increase at a high-teens to low-20% range, which compares to our prior year expectations of mid- to high-teens growth. Our full year operating margin outlook is now expected to be down 50 basis points from the prior year period, which is an improvement relative to our prior expectation of a 50 to 100 basis point decline. 
We have also revised our expectations of the restructuring charges associated with our Greater China shop network repositioning program to approximately $5 million for the full year, $4 million of which is expected to come in the second half of the year and mostly concentrated in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs have consistently been segregated and excluded from our operating margin guidance. The substantial reduction in anticipated restructuring costs from our original $10 million to $20 million estimate reflects our active management to successfully refocus our transfer leases and redeploy staff to other parts of the company. 
Our organization is focused on navigating through global economic uncertainty, while continuing to prudently invest in our long-term strategies of international expansion, direct-to-consumer expansion and merchandise innovation. We are extremely proud of our year-to-date accomplishments. And barring any significant economic jolts in the U.S. or Europe, we are comfortable in our ability to once again deliver double-digit profit growth resulting from our strategies as reflected in our full year guidance.

But discounting that for a moment, as we push out around the world and as you've been a regular follower, following to the story, I think we just continue to see the global acceptance for Ralph Lauren product as we push out in Europe or as we're about to make a bigger push in Asia. And I think all of that, we've framed in the past and we've framed in terms of aspirations about what we thought we could do and quite frankly, we're doing that and then some. One of the real surprises in the revenue story is the very strong domestic growth. A lot of prior conversations that we've modeled with all of you talk about our ambition to do 1/3 of our business in Europe and 1/3 in Asia and 1/3 in the United States, and that was somewhat predicated on a slow growth U.S. scenario given the scale of what we did, the distribution we had and our belief that the international markets would grow faster. But lo and behold, as we just reported, the U.S. in this quarter had a high-teens growth rate and yes, Europe was double that. But given the scale of the U.S. business, that's made a meaningful difference to our top line performance. And as you know, sometimes size can fight against strong revenue growth without meaningful acquisition, and that's not our story. So as we look to continue to push out around the world, I don't think it dims any of our enthusiasm for the upside there. I think we've just surprised ourselves on the both domestic and wholesale fronts, as well as the direct-to-customer fronts here in the United States."

The other half is due to SG&A expenses. And we are continuing to make investments to grow the business in the future, while obviously delivering double-digit growth in the current quarters. Our growth does slow in the third quarter, some of it related to some of the door network closure in the Asia region that we spoke about, the Greater China region. So we did close a fair number of doors in the second quarter. And some of it related to some slowing of our business here in the U.S. So those 2 combined lead to greater operating margin decline."

Let's talk about the cost of goods and the way it's sort of playing out through the movie here. We knew from the beginning that during the course of late summer, into fall and then through the back half of this season, costs were rising really in their most spectacular fashion with this holiday season being sort of the apex of that. A lot of the suppliers in the early part of price escalation were still blending the prices with inventory on hand that had not experienced quite as big ramp up. As that inventory was depleted and you were now bearing the full brunt of the extraordinary run-up in prices, that's really a big part of what's pressuring the third quarter cost of goods in a greater degree than other quarters. Of course, as that begins to come back in line as it plays out over the next 9 months, so take that high cost of raw materials, and they'll begin to blend it in with lower cost materials. And then it should begin to playing down towards next fall. So there's definitely sort of a peak to cost of goods that we'll be experiencing through the next 3 or 4 months. We chose to pass along in many cases, but not all cases the full impact of the cost of goods, and that was the decision that was made by merchandise category and by region. The combination of that for us was the thought process about margin rates, as well as sales and opportunity. And I think to Omar's question, part of our -- the story at sales, the results through the first 6 months, I think reflect the proper balance we struck between the margin rate and sales dollar. And we'll continue to do that as we work our way through this volatile cost of goods period. The customer, which I think is embedded in one of your questions, actually has responded very well in most cases to fashion first. So if it's new product and they're excited, they buy it. And the relative -- the pricing of that is immaterial. I think when there's something that catches their attention, that's new and different, that's been a nonissue. In terms of products that are more perennials or basics, I think there was some deceleration in unit sales for a period, and that's been climbing back. The actual results are difficult to draw final conclusions given that you're seeing the results of our July, August, September, which were extraordinary. October was a bit of a softer month. And then the businesses come back stronger in November to date. So I think we're going to need to get through the back end of the holiday selling season to get sort of a final read on customer reaction to all this volatility."

Clearly, as we have in the past, if we see a significant slowdown in business, we will look at discretionary expenditures and make determination on how much of that we can pull back on, whether it's more purely discretionary expenditures or even some of our investment initiatives that we're pursuing. One of things I would just remind you of is, as we shift our business more and more into retail, that mix impact does have a fairly significant impact on both our SG&A rate because retail obviously comes with higher SG&A expenses, as well as our inventory levels. So versus -- the more we shift mix from wholesale to retail. Clearly, higher gross profit margins, higher SG&A and higher inventory levels."

We began here in the United States where at one point, we had a Polo Jeans Co. business, which was much more commoditized and very different than what we're presenting in Denim & Supply. We felt that this content of product would play extremely well worldwide.

The headline I would identify in terms of the performance is really not distinguished by geography, but it's probably distinguished by markets that have important tourist components, whether they are in the United States or in Europe or even in Asia are the ones that outperformed any of the total numbers. So there is still a meaningful tourist component to gateway cities or tourist cities in Europe, the United States or Asia. Quite frankly, South Korea is a tourist destination for Chinese. So you really have to know that holistically. I would say the second piece of it is, the local domestic customer whether that's Europe or the United States was actually slower. So footfalls, shopping patterns in markets that are not considered gateway cities or supplemented by tourists was softer than average. So it's been a combination of those 2 factors really worldwide that make up the mix. And so as we look out over the holiday shopping period, really over the next 6 weeks, one of the interesting things is despite the macroeconomic issues and all the other issues we could rattle up together, one thing that retailers don't like to talk about but it's true is the weather. And as the weather has cooled off in Europe and the United States, we've actually seen pretty healthy returns of shopping patterns. So I don't think it's as much Europe versus the United States or Asia. I think it's more sort of global headline issues."

Well, I'll start with the north versus south, where I'll probably say what a lot of others have said. The north is stronger. So our performance in England or France or Germany or the Scandinavian markets is quite strong. But the southern part of Europe, we don't have that much distribution in Greece, but certainly Italy or Spain have been more difficult. I think it's also for us a particularly difficult quarter fall, where we're delivering a lot of heavyweight products. So whether it's the economic realities of Southern Europe compounded by this particular quarter is always more difficult for us. Those markets have underperformed. The northern markets have overperformed. The other thing that I guess we could debate whether it's Europe or not. But our business in territories like the Middle East, our territories like Russia have been very strong through this period. But while we can call them for us emerging markets, we can call them anything we want, the fact is our product and our elevated product in those markets is quite strong. I think the other subject that Tracey touched on was the more challenging specialty store, multi-brand specialty store business has been difficult in the southern parts of Europe for several seasons now. So our business and the strength of our business is really coming out of Mono brand stores, whether they're owned or joint venture or license and/or our department store business. So kind of a country issue and it's also a channel issue. In terms of new product categories relative to the total growth of Europe, I think what's been surprising to us and this somewhat comes back to Omar's question is when we went into this year, we went in with an investment point of view about new markets, new brands, new product distribution and those are all playing out. The strength of the year-to-date has actually been the core product, the core distribution outperforming. But the bulk of Europe's growth is not in the new businesses yet. I think those are flags or seeds we're planting for the future that will ultimately give us a lot of growth in the years to come. It's the core businesses that continue to outperform that are driving the top line."

So whatever were the reasons it's spiked, they're now receding, and so we are looking at reduce cotton prices for next fall.

I'm going to keep my remarks relatively brief this morning since I really got a cold and I'm losing my voice.

I'm going to keep my remarks relatively brief this morning since I really got a cold and I'm losing my voice. There's no question that we're reporting better-than-expected second quarter results today. Double-digit revenue growth in each of our major geographies contributed to consolidated sales that were 24% better than prior year. The 18% increase in second quarter earnings per share reflects strong profit flow-through even as we're managing through substantial cost of goods inflation and continued investment in our long-term growth initiatives, including the integration of the strategically important regions and products now as directly controlled operations. 
The double-digit sales and profit growth come on top of double-digit gains in the prior year period, a clear demonstration of the growing desirability of Ralph Lauren brands across an expanding range of merchandise categories and on an increasingly global platform. The high-teens domestic revenue we achieved in the quarter is extraordinary considering the existing scale of our business. It's also well-balanced across distribution channels supported by a fantastic growth in our Men's business, kids, dresses and the successful launch of Denim & Supply. 
Our international revenues grew twice as fast as our domestic sales and represented approximately 38% of our consolidated revenues. In Europe, we are capturing share with our core merchandise offerings through a combination of productivity gains and incremental distribution, including the expansion of existing shops to accommodate the growing bandwidth of each of our brands. 
As we've discussed in the past, we don't have distribution for all of our brands in Europe yet, so we are rolling out new merchandise categories including Lauren footwear and Club Monaco, which is yielding incremental distribution and extending our reach through the continent. There's been a lot of concern about the European business trends, given the sovereign debt crisis that has gripped headlines over the last 6 months. 
Having been in Europe last week, it is a key topic of conversation. However, there is clearly a long-term opportunity for us to continue to expand there. Much of our focus in Europe over the next several years will be the introduction of new product categories and additional direct-to-customer efforts, which include mono brand stores, e-commerce or shop-in-shops. 
As you know, Asia is a high-growth region for us and the appetite for the Ralph Lauren brand continues to expand across all major territories. Greater China represents the biggest single long-term growth opportunity in the region. Today, Greater China represents only 3% of our consolidated revenues. That is unlikely to change very much in the near term since we are closing important points of our legacy distribution this year. After resetting our local market presence, we intend to pursue measured thoughtful growth in the region. We are confident with our brands and the luxury product acceptance in Greater China. The response to our most elevated products, including apparel and accessories, have been tremendous in the new locations that we sell. We need to raise the understanding and awareness of the Ralph Lauren lifestyle brands. Establishing flagship presence in the region is critical. We've identified the need for flagship presence in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing and are actively working to secure locations in each city. 
We are also looking for the right opportunities to go directly to our customers on a broader scale. While new stores are important component of our expanding direct-to-customer reach, e-commerce is another major area of focus for us. In the United States, RalphLauren.com continues to grow at a mid-20s-percent rate. It is an increasingly important vehicle to educate customers about the scope of the World of Ralph Lauren. It's been a useful platform to showcase new and emerging merchandise categories, particularly those with more limited distribution in our stores. 
As a result, we find that the Childrenswear, accessories and home products enjoy a higher sales penetration online than we experienced in our brick and mortar stores, and the ready acceptance of Denim & Supply on RalphLauren.com is also very encouraging. We're expanding our online reach in Europe by going live in France and several other French-speaking countries. We did that during the second quarter. We also recently launched Germany on October 14. And we'll continue to execute against the broad global e-commerce strategy, one that we believe will include parts of Asia over the next 1 to 2 years. 
We are proud of the excellent results we've achieved across the company in the first half of the year, both in terms of financial performance and really progress on all of our key growth initiatives. There is no doubt that our long-standing commitment to invest in design and to innovate with new merchandising that is made to the highest quality standards and presented in a unique, aspirational shopping environment has supported our performance. 
The customer has been most excited to spend on new fashion products. So we're comfortable with our decisions that we made to deal with the higher cost, particularly since the customer continues to vote for Ralph Lauren brands across merchandise categories. 
Over the last 2 months, we've seen extreme stock market movement and negative economic news, which resulted in more volatile sales and traffic at Ralph Lauren stores in the United States and Europe, particularly with local customers. Our past experiences suggests that the volatility in traffic has more to do with sentiment than it does with our ability -- customers' ability to spend. Having said that, the near-term outlook for the global economy historically has been a good indicator for discretionary sales trends but has slowed. And while we are raising our sales and profit outlook for the year, it's important to remember in the context of geopolitical uncertainty, the critical holiday selling period is still ahead of us. We believe we are well positioned for holiday, and that we've invested in the right merchandise strategies to leverage our brand strength as a go-to resource for gifts and self-purchase. 
Macroeconomic dynamics are clearly out of our control, but we are an agile organization, and we believe we are prepared to navigate through them as we've successfully done in the past. We are armed with the strongest, most desirable brand in the world, one that has managed to outperform in good times and bad. And we have been thoughtful to invest in high-return strategic initiatives that allow us to deliver both near-term and long-term results. 
Our sustained focus on our growth initiatives is validated by the resilience and consistency of our performance over the last several years. But despite the near-term headwinds, we believe we are well positioned to generate substantial shareholder value over the long term, and we continue to believe the best is yet to come. 
Now I'll ask Jacki to comment on the product and merchandising highlights for the quarter."

The second quarter was yet another period of strong global expansion for us as evidenced by our multi-channel revenue growth. Our products are certainly an important driver of that success as are the thoughtful planning and merchandising strategies that are both supporting market share gains and helping to mitigate the impact of cost of goods inflation. 
As Ralph commented in this morning's press release, we continue to pursue exciting new avenues of growth by leveraging the desirability of our brand across the growing range of merchandise categories. Our unwavering commitment to product innovation is supporting the momentum in both core and emerging classification. This morning, I'd like to take you through some key second quarter product highlights, as well as update you on milestones for our denim and accessories initiatives. 
First and foremost, the growth in our Men's business worldwide continues to be spectacular. Season after season, Ralph and the design teams create distinctive new products that further distinguish us in the marketplace and drive incremental market share gain. The iconic vernacular of the Ralph Lauren brand enables us to address the more traditional aesthetic with Purple Label and Polo and the more contemporary ones of Black Label and RLX. 
We're now addressing a younger, more casual and more eclectic male customer with our Denim & Supply line but more on that exciting introduction in a moment. The momentum in Childrenswear is a similar story to Men's, and Childrenswear merchandise was an important driver of our revenue growth across channels and regions during the second quarter. The investments we've made in developing our assortment from layette and babies to boys and girls has fueled the appetite for our product worldwide. 
We are uniquely positioned to address the child's complete wardrobe requirement from school and play to special occasion, and we continue to enjoy preference as the go-to brand for gifting, which is a testament to the quality of the product and the prestige of the brand. Innovative marketing initiatives such as the RL Gang interactive and shoppable digital storybook and the first ever online fashion show for girls 7 to 14, solidify our position as the leader in premium Childrenswear. 
We believe there is much more category growth for us, especially in international markets, and Childrenswear is expected to be an important part of our overall Asian growth strategy. For the critical holiday season, we continue to leverage the gift-giving appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand across every product territory. We know that the aspirational nature of our brand and the quality of our product are a powerful combination when the consumer is selecting the right gifts for everyone on the list. 
Where appropriate, we carry a design theme and product story across multiple categories to create a more unified world of Ralph Lauren presentation at this time of year. And our in-store digital and print marketing emphasize the timeless appeal of a gift from Ralph Lauren. In terms of newer initiatives, one of the most exciting milestones of the second quarter was the global launch of our newest brand, Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply. Consumer interest and acceptance is very encouraging across both men's and women's, particularly for more fashion-oriented novelty pieces that are unique to our portfolio. 
The combination of the brand's positioning, the product content and the in-store and online presentation is resonating with the consumer. The sensibility of the Denim & Supply product and the power of the Ralph Lauren brand allows us to secure a significant incremental floor space to present this newest offering to the consumer. Our investment in the wholesale shop environment is a powerful demonstration of our long-term commitment to the category and reinforces our belief in the ability of the unique and strongly branded in-store environment to both attract attention on the selling floor and bring the merchandise to life. 
Our online marketing and social media efforts were extremely effective at creating awareness with the Denim & Supply brands, and we'll continue to invest in that messaging to drive awareness. We believe that our lifestyle approach to this category makes Denim & Supply both distinctive in the marketplace and represents a meaningful global opportunity for us. 
As you've heard in previous calls, developing a large, dynamic accessories offering has been one of our key strategic initiatives. And while it's still a new business for us, we are experiencing great acceptance of our accessory merchandise. In September, we hosted 300 fashion editors and buyers from around the world for a special preview of the spring 2012 Ralph Lauren accessories collection at our women flagship store at 888 Madison. The reaction was spectacular. 
We effectively communicated the substantial evolution of the breadth of our handbags, footwear, belts and scarf offerings and the importance of these categories was underscored by their positioning in the store. Editors and buyers alike were particularly impressed by our new shape, materials, colors and the range of price points for our handbags. We are confident that with the additional distribution, we will grow Ralph Lauren Accessories into a large-scale international business. 
Our Lauren handbags and small leather goods have also gained momentum. With the benefit of reading first couple of seasons of market response, we've been able to calibrate our assortments to have the right balance of core offering and seasonal fashion. Our dual focus on design and function combined with the extraordinary relevance of consumer confidence in the Lauren brand will support additional distribution of Lauren accessories over the next several years. 
The opportunity in Men's is also evolving nicely to both the Ralph Lauren and Polo brands, and we'll look to expand distribution of men's accessories over the next few season. In order to grow awareness of our presence in the category and to showcase the product in the most aspirational way, we've continued to emphasize accessories in our global advertising campaign. We believe that the power of the Ralph Lauren brand and our unique lifestyle approach to design will be as successful for our Accessories business as it has been for apparel, and we see tremendous long-term opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey."
362220,141879705,188555,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2011",2011-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we reported excellent second quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.9 billion, 24% greater than the prior year period and better than the h",2132,"Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we reported excellent second quarter operating results. Consolidated net revenues were $1.9 billion, 24% greater than the prior year period and better than the high-teens to low-20% growth expectation we outlined for you in August. The increase in net revenues reflects double-digit gains at our wholesale and retail segments with higher sales of our core apparel products, particularly Men's and Childrenswear supporting our top line momentum across all channels worldwide. 
The combination of both the incremental revenues from the South Korea license transition and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation affected our total reported revenue growth by approximately 6%. The second quarter gross profit margin of 56.6% was 140 basis points below the prior year period and was in line with our expectations as we experienced the full impact of higher cost of goods inflation, which outweighed the combined offsetting effect of our selective price increases, a higher retail segment penetration and the beneficial margin impact of international sales growth penetration. 
Operating expenses of $728 million were 25% greater than the prior year period. We deleveraged operating expenses by 30 basis points, was considerably below the approximately 150 basis points of deleverage we anticipated in the quarter. The upside to our expectations was mostly due to our ability to leverage expenses on the higher sales level we achieved. The modest deleverage reflects a higher retail channel mix, including the transition of our formally licensed South Korea operations, which is entirely retail distribution. 
Our operating income of $351 million was 14% greater than the prior year period, and our operating margin was 18.4%, which was 170 basis points below the record 20.1% level achieved in the prior year period. The decline in our operating margin was primarily a function of the gross margin impact of the unprecedented cost of goods inflation we experienced during the quarter, in addition to shifts in our overall channel mix. 
The growth in operating income drove the 14% increase in the second quarter net income to $233 million, and net income per diluted share rose 18% to $2.46. Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter, our Wholesale segment sales increased 20% to $996 million, and constant dollars sales increase 17%. Global sales of our core merchandise, particularly Men's and Childrenswear, in addition to new merchandise categories such as Denim & Supply in the U.S. and the expansion of footwear distribution in Europe, all contributed to our growth. 
In the U.S. we continue to see broad-based strength across multiple men's labels in both department stores, as well as specialty stores. Polo Sportswear trends have been particularly good, especially for novelty and exclusive items, and men's Black Label continues to gain momentum as its merchandise offering expands. Women's sportswear trends remain challenging in the U.S., although our dresses and accessories benefited from expanded assortments and incremental distribution. 
In Europe, menswear sales to department stores were strong as we continue to improve productivity and capture additional floor space for existing and new merchandise categories. European wholesale shipments also benefited from expanded distribution for Lauren sportswear and the introduction of Polo footwear. However, shipments to independent specialty stores throughout Europe and in Italy, in particular, were more challenging as they have been for us and many others over the last several quarters. 
Total operating income for the second quarter rose 4% to $247 million, although the wholesale operating margin declined 400 basis points to 24.8%. The decline in wholesale operating margin was primarily due to cost of goods inflation and incremental expenses associated with the investment in new product expansion such as home textiles, Denim & Supply and Club Monaco in Europe. 
Our continued success in expanding our direct-to-consumer reach is evidenced in the 31% growth in Retail segment sales to $861 million during the quarter. We achieved comparable store sales growth across most retail concepts, and the contribution from newly opened stores and incremental sales from the newly assumed South Korean operations were other important drivers of growth. 
Overall comp store sales increased 13%, reflecting 5% growth at Ralph Lauren stores and 14% increase at factory stores and 24% growth at Club Monaco stores. RalphLauren.com sales continue to expand at a double-digit rate, increasing comp sales 25% in the second quarter. Overall comp gains were primarily a combined result of both transaction growth and an increase in average dollars sales per transaction, with the latter mostly due to higher average unit retail prices resulting from the price increases taken due to the cost of goods inflation. 
However, traffic trends were mixed across our global retail formats during the quarter. At our Ralph Lauren stores, we did experience lower traffic in the U.S. and Europe during the extreme stock market volatility in August and September although generally speaking, our flagship stores globally continue to outperform in the quarter. Sales trends at our stores and concession shops throughout Asia were very strong in the quarter, and the recovery in Japan remains on track. 
Momentum at our factory stores worldwide continue to be exceptional in the quarter. In addition to increased traffic to our factory stores, the strength of our brand combined with our compelling assortment this season across Men's, Women's and Childrenswear is driving a higher conversion. Online, men's, Childrenswear and accessories were particularly strong during the quarter as was the introduction of our new Denim & Supply line. 
Club Monaco's robust sale gains are continuing to be driven primarily by trend-right women's merchandise. We opened 12 directly-operated freestanding stores and closed 9 stores during the second quarter, 5 of which were in the Greater China region. In conjunction with our Greater China repositioning effort, we also closed 23 shop locations and 5 franchise stores during the quarter. We ended the period with 374 company-operated stores and 522 concession shop locations globally. 
Retail operating income grew 39% to $146 million in the second quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 100 basis points to 17%. The improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate are primarily due to comparable store sales growth and improved profit trends in Asia, both in Greater China, as well as in Japan. These improvements offset the substantial pressure we had from cost of goods inflation, expenses related to the transition of the South Korea operation and continued investment in international e-commerce development. 
Licensing royalties were $48 million in the second quarter, 3% greater than the prior year period, primarily due to increased domestic apparel product royalties. Growth was partially offset by lower fragrance and international licensing royalties, as we were anniversary-ing both last year's big Pony fragrance launch and the transition of formally licensed South Korea operations. 
Operating income for our licensing segment also rose 8% to $30 million, a result of higher royalty revenues and lower net costs. We ended the quarter with $979 million in cash and investments and $606 million in net cash. Consolidated inventory was up 35% at the end of the second quarter on a reported basis. 
The components of the 35% increase are as follows: Non-comp items included in our inventory this year are new merchandise categories like Denim & Supply and home textile, newly transitioned operations such as South Korea and new channels of distribution such as our international e-commerce site and new retail stores. These all combined to represent 14% of the 35% total growth. 
Another 14% of the increase is to support the comp anticipated sales growth and changes in shipment cadence across previously existing product categories, geographies and channels. The remaining 7% of the 35% increase is primarily attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency impacts. We continue to expect inventory growth to become progressively more aligned with sales trends throughout fiscal 2012, as we cycle through changes in year-over-year shipment cadence and anniversary the transition of formally licensed operations. 
We spent approximately $53 million on CapEx during the second quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We also repurchased 773,000 shares of stock utilizing $92 million of our current authorization, and we had approximately $579 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program at the end of the second quarter. We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results, which demonstrate continued momentum in our core and emerging businesses around the world. We've once again achieved double-digit profit expansion in the quarter even as we continue to make important incremental investments in each of our key growth initiatives in order to support continued future growth of our business. 
As you are all acutely aware, the extraordinary volatility in global equity and credit markets that began in early August and intensified in the last 2 months. Political and macroeconomic uncertainties are weighing on business and consumer confidence, and we have seen increased weekly sales volatility in our U.S. and European stores. And so while we are raising our sales and profit outlook for the year on the strength of our first half performance, we do continue to monitor trends across all channels and regions in order to proactively address any material changes that could affect our plans and outlook, which I'd like to review with you now. 
For the third quarter, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a low-teens rate. Our expectations are based on a mid-single digit increase in global wholesale sales and a high-teens increase in Retail segment sales, including high single-digit comparable store sales growth. In addition to a more challenging environment, particularly in Europe, wholesale revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2012 is expected to be additionally suppressed by the continued channel shift in Japan, where we have transitioned certain wholesale distribution to directly operated concession shops, and the closure of some of our shops in Greater China as part of our repositioning efforts. 
For our Retail segment, we will anniversary the acquisition of the South Korea license in the fourth quarter of this year. So incremental non-comp revenue growth we have experienced from South Korea in the first half of this year will be reduced in the second half. Our Retail segment sales and profit in the second half of the year will also begin to reflect a more pronounced impact from our Greater China repositioning efforts, many of which were planned to transition at the end of the second quarter as I mentioned earlier and during the fourth quarter. 
Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points below that achieved in the comparable prior year, with the decline split evenly between gross margin pressure and expense deleverage. Indeed, we expect as we have experienced gross margin to also be down for the balance of fiscal 2012, including for our spring shipments as costing remains above the prior year levels. 
Operating expenses are also expected to continue to deleverage compared to last year due to the higher retail channel mix shift this year, driven primarily by both South Korea and new stores and the investment in infrastructure related to international e-commerce distribution. We have also incurred additional investment for the launch of new product categories in the U.S. and Europe. 
For the full fiscal 2012 period, we now expect revenues to increase at a high-teens to low-20% range, which compares to our prior year expectations of mid- to high-teens growth. Our full year operating margin outlook is now expected to be down 50 basis points from the prior year period, which is an improvement relative to our prior expectation of a 50 to 100 basis point decline. 
We have also revised our expectations of the restructuring charges associated with our Greater China shop network repositioning program to approximately $5 million for the full year, $4 million of which is expected to come in the second half of the year and mostly concentrated in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs have consistently been segregated and excluded from our operating margin guidance. The substantial reduction in anticipated restructuring costs from our original $10 million to $20 million estimate reflects our active management to successfully repurpose or transfer leases and redeploy staff to other parts of the company. 
Our organization is focused on navigating through global economic uncertainty, while continuing to prudently invest in our long-term strategies of international expansion, direct-to-consumer expansion and merchandise innovation. We are extremely proud of our year-to-date accomplishments. And barring any significant economic jolts in the U.S. or Europe, we are comfortable in our ability to once again deliver double-digit profit growth resulting from our strategies as reflected in our full year guidance. 
And at this point, we're going to open up the call and take any questions that you may have. Operator, can you assist us with that?"

But discounting that for a moment, as we push out around the world and as you've been a regular follower, following to the story, I think we just continue to see the global acceptance for Ralph Lauren product as we pushed out in Europe or as we're about to make a bigger push in Asia. And I think all of that, we've framed in the past and we've framed in terms of aspirations about what we thought we could do and quite frankly, we're doing that and then some. One of the real surprises in the revenue story is the very strong domestic growth. A lot of prior conversations that we've modeled with all of you talk about our ambition to do 1/3 of our business in Europe and 1/3 in Asia and 1/3 in the United States, and that was somewhat predicated on a slow growth U.S. scenario given the scale of what we did, the distribution we had and our belief that the international markets would grow faster. But lo and behold, as we just reported, the U.S. in this quarter had a high-teens growth rate and yes, Europe was double that. But given the scale of the U.S. business, that's made a meaningful difference to our top line performance. And as you know, sometimes size can fight against strong revenue growth without meaningful acquisition, and that's not our story. So as we look to continue to push out around the world, I don't think it dims any of our enthusiasm for the upside there. I think we've just surprised ourselves on the both domestic and wholesale fronts, as well as the direct-to-customer fronts here in the United States."

Maybe share with us given that this past quarter was the first quarter you saw the full effect of pricing. Share with us what you learned in terms of elasticity of demand as you basically hit your margin targets. And then a follow-on to that, given some near-term volatility in terms of traffic and sales since you've been leveraging better because of those better sales in the second quarter, how should we think about maybe anything you're thinking about contingency plans that relates to expenses if, in fact, sales continues to be this volatile."

Let's talk about the cost of goods and the way it's sort of playing out through the movie here. We knew from the beginning that during the course of late summer, into fall and then through the back half of this season, costs were rising really in their most spectacular fashion with this holiday season being sort of the apex of that. A lot of the suppliers in the early part of price escalation were still blending the prices with inventory on hand that had not experienced quite as big ramp up. As that inventory was depleted and you were now bearing the full brunt of the extraordinary run-up in prices, that's really a big part of what's pressuring the third quarter cost of goods in a greater degree than other quarters. Of course, as that begins to come back in line as it plays out over the next 9 months, they'll take that high cost of raw materials, and they'll begin to blend it in with lower cost materials. And then it should begin to plane down towards next fall. So there's definitely sort of a peak of the cost of goods that we'll be experiencing through the next 3 or 4 months. We chose to pass along in many cases, but not all cases, the full impact of the cost of goods, and that was the decision that was made by merchandise category and by region. The combination of that for us was the thought process about margin rates, as well as sales opportunity. And I think to Omar's question, part of our -- the story at sales, the results through the first 6 months, I think reflect the proper balance we struck between the margin rate and sales dollar. And we'll continue to do that as we work our way through this volatile cost of goods period. The customer, which I think is embedded in one of your questions, actually has responded very well in most cases to fashion first. So if it's new product and they're excited, they buy it. And the relative pricing of that is immaterial. I think when there's something that catches their attention, that's new and different, that's been a nonissue. In terms of products that are more perennials or basics, I think there was some deceleration in unit sales for a period, and that's been climbing back. The actual results are difficult to draw final conclusions given that you're seeing the results of our July, August, September, which were extraordinary. October was a bit of a softer month. And then the businesses come back stronger in November to date. So I think we're going to need to get through the back end of the holiday selling season to get sort of a final read on customer reaction to all this volatility."

Clearly, as we have in the past, if we see a significant slowdown in business, we will look at discretionary expenditures and make determination on how much of that we can pull back on, whether it's more purely discretionary expenditures or even some of our investment initiatives that we're pursuing. One of things I would just remind you of is, as we shift our business more and more into retail, that mix impact does have a fairly significant impact on both our SG&A rate because retail obviously comes with higher SG&A expenses, as well as our inventory levels. So versus -- the more we shift mix from wholesale to retail. Clearly, higher gross profit margins, higher SG&A and higher inventory levels."

It's a great fashion story for both Men's and Women's, and we have very high hopes for a very significant denim business worldwide. We began here in the United States where at one point, we had a Polo Jeans Co. business, which was much more commoditized and very different than what we're presenting in Denim & Supply. We felt that this content of product would play extremely well worldwide. So in the U.S., in Europe, where we've converted from Polo Jeans to Denim & Supply, which is exactly what we've done in Asia as well, has played out very well at this point worldwide.

The headline I would identify in terms of the performance is really not distinguished by geography, but it's probably distinguished by markets that have important tourist components, whether they are in the United States or in Europe or even in Asia are the ones that outperformed any of the total numbers. So there is still a meaningful tourist component to gateway cities or tourist cities in Europe, the United States or Asia. Quite frankly, South Korea is a tourist destination for Chinese. So you really have to know that holistically. I would say the second piece of it is, the local domestic customer whether that's Europe or the United States was actually slower. So footfalls, shopping patterns in markets that are not considered gateway cities or supplemented by tourists was softer than average. So it's been a combination of those 2 factors really worldwide that make up the mix. And so as we look out over the holiday shopping period, really over the next 6 weeks, one of the interesting things is despite the macroeconomic issues and all the other issues we could rattle up together, one thing that retailers don't like to talk about but it's true is the weather. And as the weather has cooled off in Europe and the United States, we've actually seen pretty healthy returns of shopping patterns. So I don't think it's as much Europe versus the United States or Asia. I think it's more sort of global headline issues."

Well, I'll start with the north versus south, where I'll probably say what a lot of others have said. The north is stronger. So our performance in England or France or Germany or the Scandinavian markets is quite strong. But the southern part of Europe, we don't have that much distribution in Greece, but certainly Italy or Spain have been more difficult. I think it's also for us a particularly difficult quarter fall, where we're delivering a lot of heavyweight products. So whether it's the economic realities of Southern Europe compounded by this particular quarter is always more difficult for us. Those markets have underperformed. The northern markets have overperformed. The other thing that I guess we could debate whether it's Europe or not. But our business in territories like the Middle East, our territories like Russia have been very strong through this period. But while we can call them for us emerging markets, we can call them anything we want, the fact is our product and our elevated product in those markets is quite strong. I think the other subject that Tracey touched on was the more challenging specialty store, multi-brand specialty store business has been difficult in the southern parts of Europe for several seasons now. So our business and the strength of our business is really coming out of Mono brand stores, whether they're owned or joint venture or license and/or our department store business. So kind of a country issue and it's also a channel issue. In terms of new product categories relative to the total growth of Europe, I think what's been surprising to us and this somewhat comes back to Omar's question is when we went into this year, we went in with an investment point of view about new markets, new brands, new product distribution and those are all playing out. The strength of the year-to-date has actually been the core product, the core distribution outperforming. But the bulk of Europe's growth is not in the new businesses yet. I think those are flags or seeds we're planting for the future that will ultimately give us a lot of growth in the years to come. It's the core businesses that continue to outperform that are driving the top line."
