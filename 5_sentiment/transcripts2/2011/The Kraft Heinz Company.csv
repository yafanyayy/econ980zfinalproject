Art and Ed for our usual Q3 process are going to discuss the company's strong third quarter results and then take your questions. The first, I'm pleased to announce a significant transaction that will greatly accelerate our growth in Emerging Markets, and in Latin America, in particular.
Heinz as you all have noted in our press release this morning has agreed to acquire an 80% stake in Brazilian food processor, element, and it's Quero brand. Quero is a strong, rapidly growing brand with the number one, and the number two positions in numerous tomato-based categories in Brazil and the leading position in vegetables.
The brand aligns perfectly with our global portfolio and our core categories, and is already a leader in small, independent stores and shops throughout Brazil.  But annual sales of approximately $325 million, Carol will provide Heinz with a tremendous growth platform in Brazil, the fifth most populous country with 200 million consumers. 
We've established a short-term goal of around $500 million in sales through organic growth in the complementary launch of Heinz branded products, which we'll be speaking more about in May.
Heinz has been assessing potential opportunities in Brazil for sometime, and we are very pleased with the process that resulted in our tie-up with Quero. We expect to build on Quero's already impressive results by leveraging our experience, with the modern trade will also cover the innovation and marketing to improve the brand sales and distribution.
We're also planning to leverage our technical expertise in tomato processing in our Global Supply Chain to achieve synergies. The business will provide an excellent platform to expand sales and distribution of Heinz-branded product across Brazil, some of which will be produced locally for the South American market.
Importantly, this pending acquisition gives us instant infrastructure in Central Brazil with a modern factory, you fully-automated distribution center, and nearly 1,800 employees.
Brazil, as I said, has been our priority list for sometime because of it's size, attractive economic growth, large number of middle class consumers and strong growth prospects. As a reminder, Brazil generates almost 45% of Latin America's GDP.
The transaction makes Heinz one of the select few CPG companies with meaningful businesses in the BRIC markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as Indonesia and probably, the only one of our size. The addition of Quero puts our Emerging Markets on track to generate more than 20% of total company sales in fiscal 2010, up from 110% just a few years ago, and well ahead of the schedule I outlined at CAGNY last year.
We expect to close this acquisition within the next few months. We also expect it to be modestly diluted in fiscal 2012 from an earnings standpoint, reflecting our plan to invest in marketing and improved capabilities, but also expected to be accretive to earnings starting in fiscal 2013. 
The acquisition will be essentially flooded with cash on hand. I also want to point out that consistent with our strategy, this transaction resulted from a relationship endeavor and was not part of an auction process.
Overall, this transaction was a major growth step under our Emerging Markets strategy. It is also another great example of our successful buy and built approach, which delivered great results and dynamic growth in India, Indonesia and Russia.
So with that brief overview of Quero until Q&A, I'll turn the call over to Art."
278212,126854956,108005,"HJ Heinz Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2011",2011-03-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, just like to add how excited we all are to be establishing a strong deal in a strategically important country like Brazil. We're very pleased to have the deals signed.Now let's turn",2023,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, just like to add how excited we all are to be establishing a strong deal in a strategically important country like Brazil. We're very pleased to have the deals signed.
Now let's turn two or third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered continued strong organic sales from our trio of key growth vehicles, the Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Expanded gross margins, off a very strong base last year, delivered solid profit growth with EPS of $0.84 and continued our great momentum in driving cash flow.
Now many of you will recall that last year's third quarter was a high watermark in several respects, and included terrific results from the launch of the It Has To Be Heinz campaign in the U.K. and the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S.
Despite this tough comparison, we performed very well, with constant currency sales up nearly 3%, operating income of 2%, and EPS almost up 4%. Our organic sales increase of 1.7%, was again, powered by Emerging Markets which posted 14% organic growth in Q3. And if you tack on the impact of our recent Foodstar acquisition in China, constant currency sales in Emerging Markets were up 22% for the quarter.
Organic sales in Developed Markets were relatively flat, with solid increases in North American Consumer Products and Global Ketchup, being offset by decreased soup sales in Europe, trade issues in Australia, and a modest decrease in U.S. Foodservice.
Looking at the trend line, and please report that we have now posted 23 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, a testament to our sales strong sales brands and Emerging Markets strategy. Speaking of strong brands, our Top 15 brands represent about 70% of sales in the third quarter and again, led our organic growth up nearly 4%.
Importantly, as we look forward, we fully expect the Master brand from Foodstar in China and the Quero brand in Brazil to join this Top 15 list in the near term.
Turning to our core categories on a constant-currency basis, infant nutrition sets the standard for growth in the quarter, up nearly 9% driven by strong performances in the India, Latin America and China.
Ketchup and Sauces, sales grew more than 6%, driven by a solid ketchup growth in many parts of the globe. Growth in this category was also driven by Classico pasta sauce in North America and several new Asian sauces in Indonesia. Additionally, the Foodstar acquisition contributed 2.7 points to this growth.
Neils and snacks posted growth in frozen entrées and potatoes, as well as in Beanz but was offset by lower European soup sales. But keep in mind that U.K. soup sales grew organically almost 8% last year, powered by cold weather and the launch of ""It Has to Be Heinz"" campaign.
As expected, and in line with our corporate strategy, Emerging Markets have been the single biggest driver of sales growth this year, as they have over our recent history. With this growth, Emerging Markets represent about 16% of our year-to-date sales despite the devaluation in Venezuela near the end of last fiscal year.
And again, we expect this mix to increase significantly as a result of our recent acquisitions. With Quero and Foodstar next year, Emerging Markets should push past 20% of total sales.
Obviously, our focus today is on Quero but let's not forget our other recent acquisition, Foodstar in China. Foodstar is a leading manufacturer of premium soy sauce from be incurred in southern China. And now just in case coverage in the South doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that Quingong and Fujian have more than 125 million people. For perspective, that's nearly twice the number of people in the U.K, and as we push into Quingong, we will be making our great products available to another 50 million people.
We closed the Foodstar deal on November 2, and have begun investing in marketing, manufacturing and new capabilities to drive growth. And the great news is that Foodstar is off to a strong start.
In fact, we're off to such a strong start that capacity is an issue. And as a result, we've accelerated the completion of Foodstar Shanghai factory of ketchup with demand, and as I mentioned extend our reach into the neighboring Fujian province.
Importantly, Foodstar joins a very fast growth category of businesses that we already have in China. The combination of all our existing Chinese businesses posted nearly 30% organic growth in Q3. And moving south from China, our business in India posted great growth for the quarter as well, also up nearly 30% on an organic basis. This performance was driven by a rapidly growing nutrition beverages, including the extension of our Complan brand into milk for very young children.
Now going back north, Russia posted 16% organic sales growth, as our ketchup and baby food businesses continued to outpace their categories, and expand their already market-leading shares.
Finally, Indonesia generated another strong quarter in Q3 with organic growth of 13%. ABC has delivered a good year of new product development and sound performance for the paste sauce and beverage businesses.
Now let's shift gears to our flagship, the Global Ketchup business. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 3%, and is nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. Remember that in the third quarter, we lapped the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S. last year, so it's a bit of a tougher comp this quarter. As we look forward, we will continue working to increase penetration and by rates to further expand sales of the World's Favorite Ketchup.
And for those of you who missed the Mead Johnson announcement last week, we're launching a new, more sustainable Heinz Ketchup bottle, using proprietary plant bottle packaging developed by Coca-Cola. It's a great innovation that will both appeal to consumers and help to improve the environment. 
The plant bottle is made from 30% plant-based materials, is fully recyclable and will enable us to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Starting this spring, we plan to ship 120 million ketchup battles annually using this technology. And we look forward to exploring other areas of potential collaboration with Coca-Cola.
Last week, we also announced that Chick Fillets, the first national chain to offer different squeeze has its more than 1,500 locations. We're very excited about partnering with this leader in quality and customer service and early customer feedback has been terrific. 
Tomorrow is free Friday, and so FRY Day , at Chick Fillet restaurants for those of you who asked for Dip & Squeeze from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. We encourage you to check it out.
And stay tuned for more news on Dip & Squeeze including a retail launch coming this summer. Now let's take a quick spin around our geographic cycles.
We'll start with North American Consumer Products. Constant currency sales growth of 2% is driven by nearly 4% volume increase, reflecting a strong growth across our fight core U.S. brands, which was only partially offset by lower sales across the market. 
Importantly, the sales growth resulted in strong market share performance across the most of our categories. Net pricing declined by 1.7%, which was driven by our Consumer Value Program. This program included this shift from marketing funds to trade and consumer promotions during the quarter. But remember, we'll be lapping the full CBP implementation in the fourth quarter.
NACP profit results were excellent, as higher volume, better mix and productivity improvements more than offset current commodity costs. 
Volume growth was supplemented by the launch of a number of innovations and product improvements in North America during the quarter. This included new smart wins in T.G.I. Friday's fries and more improvements and enhanced taste, variety, value and convenience.
Now let's turn to the U.S. Foodservice. As we discussed last quarter, we'd expected the industry and with it, our sales to recovery a bit faster pace. As it is, Foodservice at its best quarterly sales change in five quarters but was still down about 0.5%. 
Sales gains in branded ketchup and condiments were offset by weakness in frozen soups and desserts and non-branded sauces. We continue to be very pleased with the bottom line in this business, improved capabilities and streamlined processes enabled us to grow operating income by nearly 13% in the quarter and 19% year-to-date.
One of the ways we're driving brand condiment sales is by expanding their availability of Dip & Squeeze, and launching our new all-natural Simply Heinz condiments, which are packaged in more environmentally friendly material. 
Now jumping to Todd. We've posted solid performance in Europe well let me very strong quarter with lots of ""It Has To Be Heinz"" in the U.K. For the quarter, constant currency sales were flat, as net pricing of 2.5%, primarily coming from the U.K. and Italy, was offset by lower soup volume in the U.K. and in Germany.
U.K. business posted positive organic sales growth against a 7% increase last year, and while lapping our records soup month in January. Brush sales have posted a strong quarter and notably, the Italian baby food category returned to growth. 
Constant currency operating income increased to the double-digit rate, driven by strong gross margin gains which provided the fuel to invest in higher marketing and in Keystone.
From an innovation standpoint, we launched several very promising new products in the U.K. that have tested well with consumers. We're particularly enthused about the new Fridge Pack beans that Bill highlighted at CAGNY last week. 
In our Asia/Pacific market, constant currency sales grew 10% driven by strong results in India, China and Indonesia. Overall, volume increased 4.5%, and Foodstar contributed nearly six points growth. The Australian business continues to face a difficult trade in a competitive environment. We've appointed Nigel Colmer, who have successfully led our Wattie's business in New Zealand for many years, to head up our Australian, New Zealand and Japanese businesses.  The drop in constant currency operating income in the segment primarily relates to lower profitability in Australia and higher marketing spending across the region.
The additional investments in marketing spending is supporting some exciting new products being launched across the Asia/Pacific, including the new drink Udaman drink from LOL in Australia, expenses of green rice cereal in China, and new black gold and hot chili soy sauces in Indonesia. 
A portion of our higher marketing investment this year has been in support of our infant formula launch in China. Overall, we're pleased with our progress to date, and we're very excited about the halo effect the advertising have in our base baby food portfolio, including jar foods, cereals and nutritional supplements, with our total organic sales up 35% year-to-date.
In our Rest of World segment, we deliver constant currency sales growth of 10.5%, driven by net pricing in Latin America, which only partially upset the high inflation there. Volume was down 4%, primarily reflecting economic difficulties in Venezuela and the beginning of a labor strike at our factory late in the quarter. We expect to continue decrease in volume and operating income in Venezuela during the fourth quarter, reflecting the economic and labor challenges in that country.
Turning to cash, we delivered $438 million of operating free cash flow, representing 160% of net income. This excellent performance was driven by strong profitability, working capital management and continuing financial discipline. We're also pleased to tell you that during the quarter, we completed a $500 million multi-year private bond placements which we'll fund in May. The proceeds of which will be used to help retire a $750 million bond that comes due in July.
Now as you would expect, we're continuing to focus the team on strong operating discipline. With this in mind, we have reduced trade spending to below year-ago levels, kicking price increases where necessary to help offset commodity inflation, and are continuing to drive down our cash conversion cycle. This discipline is helping us post strong results in a difficult environment.
Now I'll hand it over to Ed McMenamin to cover our financial scorecards. Ed?"

I'll take you through some of the details that underpinned another solid quarter for Heinz. Looking at EPS, I'll give you a 3% of some of the company's results that reflect the impact of currencies and last year's divestitures have had in our comparisons, what was our strongest quarter in fiscal '10.
First, looking at the results of a constant-currency basis, EPS was $0.86, up 3.6% versus prior year. Our current period results were impacted by about $0.02 from unfavorable currency movements. More details on that in a few minutes.
Reported EPS from continuing operations was $0.84, up 1.2% from prior year and finally, including the $0.11 unfavorable impact from discontinued operations last year, total company reported EPS was up $0.12, or almost 17%.
Now turning to our P&L scorecard. Net sales grew almost 3% on a constant-currency basis, and 1.5% after the impact of currency movements. Organic sales growth of 1.7% benefited from both volume and pricing, while the acquisition of Foodstar added another 1.2% of growth.
Our gross margin at 37.8% is continuing to benefit from our Global Supply Chain efforts, with an improvement of 30 basis points from our highest margin quarter of last year.
Productivity improvements were the main driver, primarily in the U.S., the U.K. and continental Europe. Marketing was lower $2 million this year as investments in our Emerging Markets, the U.K. and U.S. Foodservice were offset by shift in North America from traditional advertising to trade promotions.  As a reminder, last year's marketing was more back-end weighted while this year is more evenly distributed throughout the year.
Operating income increased 2.1% on a constant-currency basis, as our improvements in gross margin more than offset investments in Project Keystone.
Given the impact of foreign exchange has had on us this year, let's take a quick look at currency trends. These chart shows a 15-month time horizon on a few of our key currencies. The pound and the euro are well up from last summer's levels, but still down 2% and 8% respectively from Q3 of last year.
The Bolivar was devalued by 50% last year, and remains at $4.30 to the dollar. While Australia has represented many of the Asia Pac currencies, showing strength versus the dollar.
This chart lays out the effects those currency movements have had on our P&L. The largest impact continues to be on our revenue line. The majority of which is the devaluation of Venezuelan Bolivar, which we've now lapped in Q3.
The euro and pound continued to be the largest drivers of currency impact to EPS, given the relative size and profitability of our European businesses. Currency movements in Asia/Pacific continue to be favorable but in a smaller profit based. Adjusting for currency translation, EPS would've been $0.02 better.
We now have the major currencies locked for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current earnings outlook for FY '11.
Turning to the P&L. I'll focus on the peer to line items that were not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up almost 4% on a constant-currency basis, benefiting from improved margins, favorable volume and the Foodstar acquisition. 
SG&A was up 7% on a constant-currency basis and up 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. This reflects our investment in Project Keystone, as well as the Foodstar acquisition. I'll go deeper on the drivers of operating income growth on the next few slides, but I'll have covered it to be below operating income here.
Net interest and other expenses are favorable $6 million, driven by reduced net debt. The company's 26.1% effective tax rate for the quarter was down 110 basis points, were a little over $0.01 of EPS.  The improvement was primarily due to increased income and lower tax rate jurisdictions, along with foreign tax planning partially offset by higher repatriation costs this year.
We're now estimating our full-year tax rate to be around 27%, reflecting the recent restatement of the R&D tax credit, as well as favorable foreign tax settlement.
And finally, offsetting the benefits from the tax line, shares outstanding reflect a 2% increase versus last year, an impact of around $0.02 on EPS, resulting in the delivery of $0.84 for Q3. 
Now let's take a little deeper look at sales.  The third quarter delivered constant currency sales growth of nearly 3%, while organic sales grew almost 2%. Volume increased 0.5%, driven by the Emerging Markets and North American Consumer Products, partially offset by soup in Europe, along with declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Net pricing increased sales by 1.2%, as price increases in the Emerging Markets, primarily Latin America, combined with U.S. Foodservice and the U.K. These were partially upset by increased trade promotions and North American Consumer Products and the Australian business.
The 1.2% benefit from the Foodstar acquisition in China was more than offset by the 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
As I mentioned earlier, our gross margin increased 30 basis points to 37.8% on both the reported and constant-currency basis. Productivity improvements, along with higher pricing and favorable mix in our U.S. Consumer Products business, have more than offset higher commodity costs, and about a 20 basis points headwind from Venezuela. 
We also realize a slight gain on the sale of specialty channel distribution rates from one of our smaller European product lines.
As you've been reading in the press and hearing from all of our peers, commodity costs in general have shown an abrupt increase recently. Overall, there are a bit more of an headwind than we excited last quarter but they are incorporated in our revised EPS of it. 
At this point, we expect our market basket of commodities to show increase of over 4% this fiscal year, while our procurement teams has developed plans to hold our input costs increases below 2%. Having covered the key components of the P&L, let's turn to the cash flow.
As you can see, another strong performance in operating free cash flow at $438 million this quarter. Driving this performance were further improvements in working capital management. Capital expenditures 2.7% of sales, in line with our plans to increase investment in Project Keystone. The $135 million this year for acquisitions relates to the purchase of Foodstar, and dividends reflect a 7.1% increase we announced in June.
Now let's briefly review our results for the first nine months of the year. Looking at our P&L scorecard, all of our key measures compare favorably to last year on both a reported and constant-currency basis. Focusing on the constant currency growth, net sales grew 2.5%, driven by our Top 15 brands, which outpaced the company average, growing 4.2% organically.
Our gross profit margin was up around 80 basis points, as higher net pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs. Consumer marketing was up 2.3% to just over $300 million.
Operating income increased 6.1%, while increasing in investment in both marketing and Keystone. At $2.37, EPS was almost up almost 8% on a constant-currency basis, while the dilution from higher shares updating was roughly offset by a 110 basis points decline in our effective tax rate which came in at 26%.
Updating the slide I'd showed you for the quarter to reflect year-to-date impact of currency, indicates an $0.08 unfavorable impact as the effects headwinds in the first half were more substantial than recent trends.
On a year-to-date basis, organic sales growth improved 2.1%, with the balance of support from volume and price. In the same is true for the Emerging Markets, which grew over 15%.
The volume increase reflects growth in the Emerging Markets, as well as improvements in North American Consumer Products and the U.K. businesses. These were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Pricing was favorable 1%, largely due to Latin America and U.S. Foodservice, while NACP reduced net price as a result of increased trade spending for the Consumer Value Program which began late last year.  The Foodstar acquisition added about 0.5 a point of sales growth, while currency cost us nearly 2% at the sales line.
Looking at the year-to-date balance sheet scorecard, capital expenditures of $195 million were 2.5% of sales, up 60 basis points from last year but still favorable to our 3% full-year estimate.
Cash conversion cycle was 44 days, down six days, driven by improvements in all three measures. Operating free cash flow was up almost $100 million from last year, approaching $1 billion through nine months. This performance supports the increase in our full-year estimate to $1.2 billion.
Net debt to EBITDA was 0.5x better, driven by new lower net debt and higher earnings. ROIC was 19.3%, up 1.1% from this time last year. This excludes the impact of losses from discontinued operations in the prior year of about 80 basis points.
And finally, looking at the year-to-date cash flow, the increase versus prior year was due to higher earnings and reduced pension contributions, as well as improvements in payables and income taxes. These increases were partially offset by declines in receivables, largely due to the cash received last year in connection with the accounts receivable securitization program.
In addition, last year, we received $75 million from closing our swap contracts and the maturity of foreign currency contracts. In summary, an overall solid performance for sales, cash and earnings. With that, I'll now turn it back to Art, to update you on our full-year outlook."

Now with three quarters done this year, and I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 mill",448,"Thanks, Ed. Now with three quarters done this year, and I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. 
As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 million to  $310 million. This reflects better-than-expected currency dynamics for the year and improved operating performance. That's important to note that these reductions but not include any one time cost associated with closing the Quero deal in Brazil. To the extent that the deal closes in this fiscal year, we could incur about $0.03 of transaction-related costs.
Bill also announced that we expect to deliver $1.2 billion in operating free cash flow for the year. This would be up $200 million from our original target and an all-time record for Heinz. 
And turning to revenue, we've mentioned through the year that we thought our sales was the most challenging part of our outlook, and expect it to come in at the low end of the range. We now believe that constant currency sales growth for the year will be between 2% and 3% due the impact of a month-long labor stoppage in our main plants in Venezuela, and a slower than expected recovery in U.S. Foodservice industry. 
The good news is that unit employees are now back on the job in Venezuela, and we are back at the bargaining table to work toward a mutually beneficial agreement there.
Looking at Q4, we expect to make a number of investments to continue to fuel future growth. The first is the launch of nine SKUs of T.G.I. Friday's single-serve melas that we previewed at CAGNY. As Bill noted, our retail partners are excited about the coming launch, and believe that the new products could help jump start the category.
The second is the launch and ongoing expansion of Dip & Squeeze in Foodservice. The third is our continuing investment in Project Keystone as we drive stronger process, consistent capabilities across the company; and the fourth, is our investments in our new acquisitions. We're already moving quickly to improve capabilities and enhanced marketing in our Foodservice business, our Foodstar business.
In summary, the business is continuing to perform well in challenging times. Our top line performance is driven by our trio of growth engines, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Our bottom line continues to benefit from our culture of strict operational discipline, and we are on track to deliver our full-year earnings and cash flow targets. And we're continuing to build a runway for further growth as we invest for the future.
With that, now we'll open it up for your questions."

So you go back and look, I mean gross margin was up 30 basis points, could've been up 50 basis points, and SG&A was up 50 basis points year-on-year. And so I think from that perspective, I think SG&A is line that you'll continue to see move up until we get Keystone fully implemented and rolled up, and the big expenses will come as we said this year, in the third and fourth quarter in particular, and then moving through next year as we get North America brought in, as I said in CAGNY last week."

One, this business is virtually half of its business in tomato processing, and tomato products, which is something obviously, we bring great global capability and expertise in. And so from that standpoint, it's right down to our lane. The second big piece of it are vegetables, jarred, canned vegetables, which we do in New Zealand, which we do in Australia, which we do in Poland, which we do in a number of markets. And we think there's substantial cost opportunities. The market itself, GDP growth has been 10% to 15% over the last, say, five or six years on average for the exception of the one bad year for all of us. We expected it to be about 7% to 10% going forward. Now the infrastructure is not where we would like it to be in Brazil. It is actually better than some of the other Emerging Markets we're in, and we have a lot of experience in Venezuela that we find very applicable to Brazil. What we do like, is it's got great, growing areas. It's also got significant opportunities in up the trade for us, because the business we're buying is predominantly down the trade. We're going to push into up the trade. The emerging trade there between Carrefour and Wal-Mart is becoming a much bigger piece. The middle class is growing rapidly among the 200 million people. This business that has been around 25 or 26 years, and has been going in a compounding average rate between 10% and 15%, despite very little marketing and despite no up the trade presence. so from our standpoint, we find Brazil to the market, we've spent a lot of time learning about, we understand the infrastructure. This company is in a world class distribution base, which was very important to us in the new warehouse and distribution center they've built. They've got actually a state-of-the-art funds for wastewater removal, and so it is a really fantastic fit. And we find that the environment, particularly given the size of some of the cities like São Paulo and Rio and so forth, in some ways, better for us and more conducive. But I want to be clear, we have spent a lot of time looking at Brazil, studying Brazil, understanding Brazil before we made a move like this. But I think Brazil, in some ways, because of the stability of their economic system and the government they have in place even with the recent presidential change, is a market that we feel very confident and comfortable going into. And as you know, the currency has strengthened precipitously, as had most of the Emerging Market currencies like the rupee and the renminbi. And the reality has strengthened just even in the last several weeks, and is now $1.65, $1.66. So market, we're very coupled with infrastructure-wise and talent-wise."

Foodstar",434,"Well, I think in response, there's a couple of things to note. One, as I've said at CAGNY last week, we have never seen more opportunities than we're seeing now, and we've been very selective, as I've also indicated last week, about our choices. Foodstar is a business that fits right in a bit of our heartland core category of condiments and sauces. Quero is virtually the same thing, meals and snacks and condiments and sauces, particularly with it's strong ketchup business, it's strong pasta sauce business, and its tomato sauce businesses. And so I think you will continue to see us focus on those areas and in those core categories. I do think that there are a number of lessons. And frankly, we probably don't have enough time to articulate them. But the key things, buy a good brand. And in Brazil, by the way, the Quero brand is virtually 100% of the sales that I mentioned at the outset, which means it will move into our Top 15 brands next year. Foodstar has two brands, and Master. And so as the look, we're trying to buy concentrated bands, buying good management. The second thing we're trying to do is not by businesses that have been growing simply through SKU proliferation. Interestingly enough, the Quero business which is $325 million right now, has about 100 SKUs. The Foodstar business has less than 40 SKUs, so we're trying to find really focused businesses with strong growth prospects, with good manufacturing capabilities. The things we've learned, you have to put management immediately so that they can learn the business. Because ultimately, the owners that sell these businesses decide that they'd rather go do other things, or they loose interest, so you need to get management in quickly. You need to bring financial processes and discipline in, and as the biggest lesson we've learned and it's what we probably should've known but really learned a lot of it through China this year, is you have to get your investments upfront. not only in capital but in marketing. And in some of our businesses, we probably waited to long in our zeal to try to sort of balance the profit hit from these businesses from a dilution accretion standpoint, rather than investing aggressively upfront like we're doing in Foodstar, which is, as Art said, we're running difficult on capacity, although the new factory will be up in a couple of months and we'll do the same thing here. So the biggest lesson, good management, focused portfolios, strong brands, good infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and invest upfront, don't wait."

And this is the positives include the launch of TGIF which will have a positive benefit on the company next year, the launch of Dip & Squeeze, which will be fully distributed by this time next year across a number of accounts. The innovation activity we're seeing in Europe and across the company, the continued performance of growth in the Emerging Markets, which we expect to be every bit as good next year as this year. And the reality is that, while you see Brazil and China in terms of Foodstar and Quero as may be negative, we see them as incredible positives, not only in terms of the creation of the top line but the creation of long-term profit and top line growth. I mean, put in perspective, that next year, and I said this in the script, so I don't mind talking about it, next year, we expect emerging market sales short of something else happening, to be north of 20% of the total sales of the company. If we continue to drive the growth in those markets that we've given in the past, I think you can start to get a sense of the top line impact if both Foodstar and Quero can have in terms of engaging that number. We've got a lot of activity planned and we'll take you through in May, and there's a lot of good stuff going on, Eric. I just want to point out, and you guys wrestle with quarters, I wrestle with the help of the company and the long-term prospects, Quero and Foodstar very positive moves. But Keystone will bring huge benefits once we get it in place. Unfortunately, it's lengthy and it's time-consuming and it's difficult, it's very complicated. We've got a number of opportunities for investment next year, which we'll talk to you about in May. So I mean, I see overall, the health of the company, next year being pretty extraordinary. I do think there are some things that we need to continue to be open about, and one is the investment in Keystone, two is the dilution impact from Foodstar and Quero, and the reason we're not breaking that out now, is because we're still working on the plans, and we'll take you through those in May in specifics. But we talk about the negatives because we try to be open and transparent. We don't see them as negatives, we see them as investments, necessary investments for the long-term health and growth of this company. They can be interpreted as negatives, they're certainly not meant to be negatives, they're meant to be the reality, of hey, we're investing to continue drive the performance of this company you've seen over the last six or seven years and continue to distinguish ourselves from our peer group."

The second thing we're doing is obviously, they've been buying Heinz seeds but we're going to bring them up-to-date with the Heinz seeds that are proprietary to us to help the crop improve the yields and obviously, improve the ultimate output of their products. They are a strong company. The brands we bought, the brand we bought, is number one and number two in virtually, every category from a volume standpoint, and two category falls below that from a dollar sales standpoint curve, the value standpoint. So I think the reality is that management, investment, processing capability, technical health and then the launch of some businesses, either the import of those businesses, the local production of those businesses, or the export of some of the businesses. I want to make one comment about their business that's going to be very interesting to watch in our company. They have uniquely developed a tetra pack package of Beanz and they've got about a three or four varieties in tetra pack of beans, something we have trouble to do as a company over the last decade or so. And so we can take some of that knowledge and that know how, particularly with TETRA, they are way ahead of us in terms of working with TETRA as a company, and we can apply that knowledge elsewhere in our organization. So this is another example of a two-way street between an Emerging Market business that's actually got factual basis to help us improve in other areas of our company, but we help them."

Secondly, if you look at two of our major cores, I mean you talk about the core but our Top 15 brands have been growing very robustly at around 4% organically year-to-date, and Ketchup is around 5% organically year-to-date. So those two businesses, the Top 15 brands which were 70% of the sales of the company and generally, a lot better mix items, and Ketchup, which is not generally our better mix item but is really among the best in the company, all continuing to do well. And clearly, we've got an issue this quarter with soup in Europe between Germany and the U.K. and I just pointed it out that the softness in Australia and New Zealand in the quarter. And I think fundamentally, you back out Venezuela in Foodservice and we show better results. But the areas we focus on note, the Top 15 brands, Emerging Markets and Ketchup are all doing vary well, and that's really where the focus is. And so I would expect over time, the Top 15, or the Top 16, or 17 brands, that 70% number could grow and increase in its level of importance, which is good for the shareholders and good for us. And so that's really where the focus is.

Heinz as you all have noted in our press release this morning, has agreed to acquire an 80% stake in Brazilian food processor, Coniexpress S.A. Industrias Alimenticias and it's Quero brand. Quero is a strong, rapidly growing brand with number one, and the number two positions in numerous tomato-based categories in Brazil and the leading position in vegetables.
The brand aligns perfectly with our global portfolio and our core categories, and is already a leader in small, independent stores and shops throughout Brazil. With annual sales of approximately $325 million, Quero will provide Heinz with a tremendous growth platform in Brazil, the world's fifth most populous country with 200 million consumers. 
We have established a short-term goal of around $500 million in sales through organic growth in the complementary launch of Heinz branded products, which we'll be speaking more about in May.
Heinz has been assessing potential opportunities in Brazil for sometime, and we are very pleased with the process that resulted in our tie-up with Quero. We expect to build on Quero's already impressive results by leveraging our experience with the modern trade will also accelerate in innovation and marketing to improve the brand sales and distribution.
We're also planning to leverage our technical expertise in tomato processing in our Global Supply Chain to achieve synergies. The business will provide an excellent platform to expand sales and distribution of Heinz-branded product across Brazil, some of which will be produced locally for the South American market.
Importantly, this pending acquisition gives us instant infrastructure in Central Brazil with a modern factory, a fully-automated distribution center, and nearly 1,800 employees.
Brazil, as I said, has been on our priority list for sometime because of it's size, attractive economic growth, large number of middle class consumers and strong growth prospects. As a reminder, Brazil generates almost 45% of Latin America's GDP.
The transaction makes Heinz one of the select few CPG companies with meaningful businesses in the BRIC markets in Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as Indonesia and probably, the only one of our size. The addition of Quero puts our Emerging Markets on track to generate more than 20% of total company sales in fiscal 2010, up from under 10% just a few years ago, and well ahead of the schedule I outlined at CAGNY last year.
We expect to close this acquisition within the next few months. We also expect it to be modestly diluted in fiscal 2012 from an earnings standpoint, reflecting our plan to invest in marketing and improve capabilities, but also expect it to be accretive to earnings starting in fiscal 2013. 
The acquisition will be essentially funded with cash on hand. I also want to point out that consistent with our strategy, this transaction resulted from a relationship endeavor and was not part of an auction process.
Overall, this transaction is a major growth step under our Emerging Markets strategy. It is also another great example of our successful buy and built approach, which has delivered great results and dynamic growth in India, Indonesia and Russia.
So with that brief overview of Quero until Q&A, I'll turn the call over to Art."

Before getting started, I'd just like to add how excited we all are to be establishing a strong beachhead in a strategically important country like Brazil.

Before getting started, I'd just like to add how excited we all are to be establishing a strong beachhead in a strategically important country like Brazil. We're very pleased to have the deal signed.
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered continued strong organic sales from our trio of key growth vehicles: The Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Expanded gross margins, off a very strong base last year, delivered solid profit growth with EPS of $0.84 and continued our great momentum in driving cash flow.
Now many of you will recall that last year's third quarter was a high watermark in several respects, and included terrific results from the launch of the It Has To Be Heinz campaign in the U.K. and the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S.
Despite this tough comparison, we performed very well, with constant currency sales up nearly 3%, operating income up 2%, and EPS up almost 4%. Our organic sales increase of 1.7%, was again, powered by Emerging Markets which posted 14% organic growth in Q3. And if you tack on the impact of our recent Foodstar acquisition in China, constant currency sales in Emerging Markets were up 22% for the quarter.
Organic sales in Developed Markets were relatively flat, with solid increases in North American Consumer Products and Global Ketchup, being offset by decreased soup sales in Europe, trade issues in Australia, and a modest decrease in U.S. Foodservice.
Looking at the trend line, I'm pleased to report that we have now posted 23 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, a testament to our strong sales brands and Emerging Markets strategy. Speaking of strong brands, our Top 15 brands represent about 70% of sales in the third quarter and again, led our organic growth up nearly 4%.
Importantly, as we look forward, we fully expect the Master brand from Foodstar in China and the Quero brand in Brazil to join this Top 15 list in the near term.
Turning to our core categories on a constant-currency basis, Infant/Nutrition set the standard for growth in the quarter, up nearly 9% driven by strong performances in the India, Latin America and China.
Ketchup and Sauces, sales grew more than 6%, driven by a solid ketchup growth in many parts of the globe. Growth in this category was also driven by Classico pasta sauce in North America and several new Asian sauces in Indonesia. Additionally, the Foodstar acquisition contributed 2.7 points to this growth.
Meals and Snacks posted growth in frozen entrées and potatoes, as well as in Beanz but was offset by lower European soup sales. But keep in mind that U.K. soup sales grew organically almost 8% last year, powered by cold weather and the launch of ""It Has to Be Heinz"" campaign.
As expected, and in line with our corporate strategy, Emerging Markets has been the single biggest driver of sales growth this year, as they have over our recent history. With this growth, Emerging Markets represent about 16% of our year-to-date sales despite the devaluation in Venezuela near the end of last fiscal year.
And again, we expect this mix to increase significantly as a result of our recent acquisitions. With Quero and Foodstar next year, Emerging Markets should push past 20% of total sales.
Obviously, our focus today is on Quero but let's not forget our other recent acquisition, Foodstar in China. Foodstar is a leading manufacturer of premium soy sauce from bean curd in southern China. And now just in case coverage in the South doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that Guangdong and Fujian have more than 125 million people. For perspective, that's nearly twice the number of people in U.K, and as we push into Zhejiang, we will be making our great products available to another 50 million people.
We closed the Foodstar deal on November 2, and have begun investing in marketing, manufacturing and new capabilities to drive growth. And the great news is that Foodstar is off to a strong start.
In fact, we're off to such a strong start that capacity is an issue. As a result, we've accelerated the completion of Foodstar Shanghai factory of ketchup with demand, and as I mentioned, extend our reach into the neighboring Zhejiang province.
Importantly, Foodstar joins a very fast growth category of businesses that we already have in China. The combination of all our existing Chinese businesses posted nearly 30% organic growth in Q3. And moving south from China, our business in India posted great growth for the quarter as well, also up nearly 30% on an organic basis. This performance was driven by our rapidly growing nutrition beverages, including the extension of our Complan brand into milks for very young children.
Now going back north, Russia posted 16% organic sales growth, as our Ketchup and Baby Food businesses continued to outpace their categories, and expand their already market-leading shares.
Finally, Indonesia generated another strong quarter in Q3 with organic growth of 13%. ABC has delivered a good year of new product development and sound performance for the Pedas sauce and Beverage businesses.
Now let's shift gears to our flagship, the Global Ketchup business. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 3%, and is nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. Remember that in the third quarter, we lapped the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S. last year, so it's a bit of a tougher comp this quarter. As we look forward, we will continue working to increase penetration and buy rate to further expand sales of the world's favorite ketchup.
And for those of you who missed the Bill Johnson and Muhtar Kent announcement last week, we're launching a new, more sustainable Heinz Ketchup bottle, using proprietary plant bottle packaging developed by Coca-Cola. It's a great innovation that will both appeal to consumers and help improve the environment. 
The plant bottle is made from 30% plant-based materials, is fully recyclable and will enable us to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Starting this spring, we plan to ship 120 million ketchup bottles annually using this technology. And we look forward to exploring other areas of potential collaboration with Coca-Cola.
Last week, we also announced that Chick-fil-A is the first national chain to offer different squeeze at its more than 1,500 locations. We're very excited about partnering with this leader in quality and customer service and early customer feedback has been terrific. 
Tomorrow is fry Friday, that's spelled F-R-Y day, at Chick-fil-A  restaurants for those of you who asked for Dip & Squeeze from 2 to 4 p.m. We encourage you to check it out.
And stay tuned for more news on Dip & Squeeze including a retail launch coming this summer. Now let's take a quick spin around our geographic cycles.
We'll start with North American Consumer Products. Constant currency sales growth to 2% is driven by nearly 4% volume increase, reflecting strong growth across our five core U.S. brands, which was only partially offset by lower sales across the market. 
Importantly, the sales growth resulted in strong market share performance across most of our categories. Net pricing declined by 1.7%, which was driven by our Consumer Value Program. This program included the shift to marketing funds to trade and consumer promotions during the quarter. But remember, we'll be lapping the full CVP implementation in the fourth quarter.
NACP profit results were excellent, as higher volume, better mix and productivity improvements more than offset current commodity cost. 
Volume growth was supplemented by the launch of a number of innovations and product improvements in North America during the quarter. These included new smart wins in T.G.I. Friday's fries and more improvements in enhanced taste, variety, value and convenience.
Now let's turn to the U.S. Foodservice. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the industry and with it, our sales to recover at a bit faster pace. As it is, Foodservice had its best quarterly sales change in five quarters but was still down about 0.5%. 
Sales gains in branded ketchup and condiments were offset by weakness in frozen soups and desserts and non-branded sauces. We continue to be very pleased with the bottom line in this business, improved capabilities and streamlined processes enabled us to grow operating income by nearly 13% in the quarter and 19% year-to-date.
One of the ways we're driving brand condiment sales is by expanding their availability of Dip & Squeeze, and launching our new all-natural Simply Heinz condiments, which are packaged in more environmentally friendly material. 
Now jumping the pond, we've posted solid performance in Europe while lapping a very strong quarter with the launch of ""It Has To Be Heinz"" in the U.K. For the quarter, constant currency sales were flat, as net pricing of 2.5%, primarily coming from the U.K. and Italy, was offset by lower soup volume in the U.K. and in Germany.
U.K. business posted positive organic sales growth against a 7% increase last year, and while lapping a record soup month in January. Russia also posted a strong quarter and notably, the Italian baby food category returned its growth. 
Constant currency operating income increased to the double-digit rate, driven by strong gross margin gains which provided the fuel to invest in higher marketing and in Keystone.
From an innovation standpoint, we launched several very promising new products in the U.K. that have tested well with consumers. We're particularly enthused about the new Fridge Pack Beanz that Bill highlighted at CAGNY last week. 
In our Asia/Pacific market, constant currency sales grew 10% driven by strong results in India, China and Indonesia. Overall, volume increased 4.5%, and Foodstar contributed nearly six points of growth. The Australian business continues to face a difficult trade in a competitive environment. We've appointed Nigel Comer, who has successfully led our Wattie's business in New Zealand for many years, to head up our Australian, New Zealand and Japanese businesses. The drop in constant currency operating income in the segment primarily relates to lower profitability in Australia and higher marketing spending across the region.
The additional investments in marketing spending is supporting some exciting new products being launched across the Asia/Pacific, including the new U Da Man drink from LOL in Australia, expenses of Green Rice Cereal in China, and new Black Gold and hot chili soy sauces in Indonesia. 
A portion of our higher marketing investment this year has been in support of our infant formula launch in China. Overall, we're pleased with our progress to date, and we're very excited about the halo effect the advertising is having on our base baby food portfolio, including jar foods, cereals and nutritional supplements, with our total organic sales up 35% year-to-date.
In our Rest of World segment, we delivered constant currency sales growth of 10.5%, driven by net pricing in Latin America, which only partially offset the high inflation there. Volume was down 4%, primarily reflecting economic difficulties in Venezuela and the beginning of a labor strike at our factory late in the quarter. We expect to continue decrease in volume and operating income in Venezuela during the fourth quarter, reflecting the economic and labor challenges in that country.
Turning to cash, we delivered $438 million of operating free cash flow, representing 160% of net income. This excellent performance was driven by strong profitability, working capital management and continuing financial discipline. We're also pleased to tell you that during the quarter, we completed a $500 million multi-year private bond placement which we'll fund in May. The proceeds of which will be used to help retire a $750 million bond that comes due in July.
As you would expect, we're continuing to focus the team on strong operating discipline. With this in mind, we have reduced trade spending to below year-ago levels, kicking price increases where necessary to help offset commodity inflation, and are continuing to drive down our cash conversion cycle. This discipline is helping us post strong results in a difficult environment.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Ed McMenamin to cover our financial scorecards. Ed?"

I'll take you through some of the details that underpinned another solid quarter for Heinz. Looking at EPS, I'll give you three perspectives on the company's results that reflect the impact of currencies and last year's divestitures have had on our comparisons against what was our strongest quarter in fiscal '10.
First, looking at the results on a constant-currency basis, EPS was $0.86, up 3.6% versus prior year. Our current period results were impacted by about $0.02 from unfavorable currency movements. More details on that in a few minutes.
Reported EPS from continuing operations was $0.84, up 1.2% from prior year and finally, including the $0.11 unfavorable impact from discontinued operations last year, total company reported EPS was up $0.12, or almost 17%.
Now turning to our P&L scorecard. Net sales grew almost 3% on a constant-currency basis, and 1.5% after the impact of currency movements. Organic sales growth of 1.7% benefited from both volume and pricing, while the acquisition of Foodstar added another 1.2% of growth.
Our gross margin at 37.8% is continuing to benefit from our Global Supply Chain efforts, with an improvement of 30 basis points from our highest margin quarter of last year.
Productivity improvements were the main driver, primarily in the U.S., the U.K. and continental Europe. Marketing was lower $2 million this year as investments in our Emerging Markets, the U.K. and U.S. Foodservice were offset by shift in North America from traditional advertising to trade promotions. As a reminder, last year's marketing was more back-end weighted while this year is more evenly distributed throughout the year.
Operating income increased 2.1% on a constant-currency basis, as our improvements in gross margin more than offset investments in Project Keystone.
Given the impact foreign exchange has had on it this year, let's take a quick look at currency trends. These chart show a 15-month time horizon on a few of our key currencies. The pound and the euro are well up from last summer's levels, but still down 2% and 8% respectively from Q3 of last year.
The bolivar was devalued by 50% last year, and remains at $4.30 to the dollar. While Australia is representative of the Asia Pac currencies, showing strength versus the dollar.
This chart lays out the effects those currency movements have had on our P&L. The largest impact continues to be on our revenue line. The majority of which is the devaluation of Venezuelan bolivar, which we've now lapped in Q3.
The euro and pound continued to be the largest drivers of currency impact to EPS, given the relative size and profitability of our European businesses. Currency movements in Asia/Pacific continues to be favorable but on a smaller profit base. Adjusting for currency translation, EPS would have been $0.02 better.
We now have the major currencies locked for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current earnings outlook for FY '11.
Turning to the P&L. I'll focus on a few of the line items that were not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up almost 4% on a constant-currency basis, benefiting from improved margin, favorable volume and the Foodstar acquisition. 
SG&A was up 7% on a constant-currency basis and up 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. This reflects our investment in Project Keystone, as well as the Foodstar acquisition. I'll go deeper on the drivers of operating income growth on the next few slides, but I'll have cover the activity below operating income here.
Net interest in other expenses are favorable $6 million, driven by reduced net debt. The company's 26.1% effective tax rate for the quarter was down 110 basis points, or a little over $0.01 of EPS. The improvement was primarily due to increased income and lower tax rate jurisdictions, along with foreign tax planning partially offset by higher repatriation costs this year.
We're now estimating our full-year tax rate to be around 27%, reflecting the recent restatement of the R&D tax credit, as well as favorable foreign tax settlement.
And finally, offsetting the benefits from the tax line, shares outstanding reflect a 2% increase versus last year, an impact of around $0.02 on EPS, resulting in the delivery of $0.84 for Q3. 
Now let's take a deeper look at sales. The third quarter delivered constant currency sales growth of nearly 3%, while organic sales grew almost 2%. Volume increased 0.5%, driven by the Emerging Markets and North American Consumer Products, partially offset by soup in Europe, along with declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Net pricing increased sales by 1.2%, as price increases in the Emerging Markets, primarily Latin America, combined with U.S. Foodservice and the U.K. These were partially upset by increased trade promotions and North American Consumer Products and the Australian business.
The 1.2% benefit from the Foodstar acquisition in China was more than offset by the 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
As I mentioned earlier, our gross margin increased 30 basis points to 37.8% on both the reported and constant-currency basis. Productivity improvements, along with higher pricing and favorable mix in our U.S. Consumer Products business, have more than offset higher commodity costs, and about a 20 basis points headwind from Venezuela. 
We also realize a slight gain on the sale specialty channel distribution rights from one of our smaller European product lines.
As you've been reading in the press and hearing from all of our peers, commodity costs in general have shown an abrupt increase recently. Overall, there are a bit more of an headwind than we expected last quarter but they are incorporated in our revised EPS outlook. 
At this point, we'd expect our market basket of commodities to show increase of over 4% this fiscal year, while our procurement teams has developed plans to hold our input costs increases below 2%. Having covered the key components of the P&L, let's turn to the cash flow.
As you can see, another strong performance in operating free cash flow at $438 million this quarter. Driving this performance were further improvements in working capital management. Capital expenditures are 2.7% of sales, in line with our plans to increase investments in Project Keystone. The $135 million this year for acquisitions relates to the purchase of Foodstar, and dividends reflect a 7.1% increase we announced in June.
Now let's briefly review our results for the first nine months of the year. Looking at our P&L scorecard, all of our key measures compare favorably to last year on both a reported and constant-currency basis. Focusing on the constant currency growth, net sales grew 2.5%, driven by our Top 15 brands, which outpaced the company average, growing 4.2% organically.
Our gross profit margin was up around 80 basis points, as higher net pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs. Consumer marketing was up 2.3% to just over $300 million.
Operating income increased 6.1%, while increasing in investments in both marketing and Keystone. At $2.37, EPS was up almost 8% on a constant-currency basis, while the dilution from higher shares outstanding was roughly offset by a 110 basis points decline in our effective tax rate which came in at 26%.
Updating the slide I showed you for the quarter to reflect year-to-date impact of currency, indicates an $0.08 unfavorable impact as the effects headwinds in the first half were more substantial than recent trends.
On a year-to-date basis, organic sales improved 2.1%, with balance support from volume and price. And the same is true for the Emerging Markets, which grew over 15%.
The volume increase reflects growth in the Emerging Markets, as well as improvements in North American Consumer Products and the U.K. businesses. These were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Pricing was favorable 1%, largely due to Latin America and U.S. Foodservice, while NACP reduced net price as a result of increased trade spending for the Consumer Value Program which began late last year. The Foodstar acquisition added about 0.5 a point of sales growth, while currency cost us nearly 2% at the sales line.
Looking at the year-to-date balance sheet scorecard, capital expenditures of $195 million were 2.5% of sales, up 60 basis points from last year but still favorable to our 3% full-year estimate.
Cash conversion cycle was 44 days, down six days, driven by improvements in all three measures. Operating free cash flow was up almost $100 million from last year, approaching $1 billion through nine months. This performance supports the increase in our full-year estimate to $1.2 billion.
Net debt to EBITDA was 0.5x better, driven by lower net debt and higher earnings. ROIC was 19.3%, up 1.1% from this time last year. This excludes the impact of losses from discontinued operations in the prior year of about 80 basis points.
And finally, looking at the year-to-date cash flow, the increase versus prior year was due to higher earnings and reduced pension contributions, as well as improvements in payables and income taxes. These increases were partially offset by declines in receivables, largely due to the cash received last year in connection with an accounts receivable securitization program.
In addition, last year, we received $75 million from closing out swap contracts and the maturity of foreign currency contracts. In summary, an overall solid performance for sales, cash and earnings. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Art, to update you on our full-year outlook."

Now with three quarters done this year, and I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 mill",446,"Thanks, Ed. Now with three quarters done this year, and I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. 
As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 million to  $310 million. This reflects better-than-expected currency dynamics for the year and improved operating performance. That's important to note that these projections do not include any one time cost associated with closing the Quero deal in Brazil. To the extent that the deal closes in this fiscal year, we could incur about $0.03 of transaction-related costs.
Bill also announced that we expect to deliver $1.2 billion in operating free cash flow for the year. This would be up $200 million from our original target and an all-time record for Heinz. 
And turning to revenue, we've mentioned through the year, that we thought our sales goal was the most challenging part of our outlook, and expect it to come in at the low end of the range. We now believe that constant currency sales growth for the year will be between 2% and 3% due to the impact of a month-long labor stoppage in our main plants in Venezuela, and slower than expected recovery in U.S. Foodservice industry. 
The good news is that union employees are now back on the job in Venezuela, and we are back at the bargaining table to work toward a mutually beneficial agreement there.
Looking at Q4, we expect to make a number of investments to continue to fuel future growth. The first is the launch of nine SKUs of T.G.I. Friday's single-serve meals that we previewed at CAGNY. As Bill noted, our retail partners are excited about the coming launch, and believe that the new products could help jump start the category.
The second is the launch and ongoing expansion of Dip & Squeeze in Foodservice. The third is our continuing investment in Project Keystone as we drive stronger process, consistent capabilities across the company; and the fourth, is investment in our new acquisitions. We are already moving quickly to improve capabilities and enhanced marketing in our Foodstar business.
In summary, the business is continuing to perform well in challenging times. Our top line performance is driven by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Our bottom line continues to benefit from our culture of strict operational discipline, and we are on track to deliver our full-year earnings and cash flow targets. And we're continuing to build a runway for further growth as we invest for the future.
With that, now we'll open it up for your questions."

That's the benefit of markets that are growing, as opposed to markets that are static with high levels of unemployment. So thus far, it has not been an issue. Now the UN tries to make an issue out of some of this stuff by talking in a macro business about staple products and in some cases like wheat, flour, sugar, rice.

One, this business is virtually half of its business in tomato processing, and tomato products, which is something obviously, we bring great global capability and expertise in. So from that standpoint, it's right down our lane. The second big piece of it are vegetables, jarred, canned vegetables, which we do in New Zealand, which we do in Australia, which we do in Poland, which we do in a number of markets. And we think there's substantial cross opportunities. The market itself, GDP growth has been 10% to 15% over the last, say, five or six years on average for the exception, obviously, of the one bad year for all of us. We expect it to be about 7% to 10% going forward. While the infrastructure is not where we would like it to be in Brazil, it is actually better than some of the other Emerging Markets we're in, and we have a lot of experience in Venezuela that we find very applicable to Brazil. What we do like, it's got great growing areas. It's also got significant opportunities in up the trade for us, because the business we're buying is predominantly down the trade. We're going to push into up the trade. The emerging trade there between Carrefour and Wal-Mart is becoming a much bigger piece. The middle class is growing rapidly among the 200 million people. This business has been around 25 or 26 years, and has been growing at a compound average rate between 10% and 15%, despite very little marketing and despite no up the trade presence. So from our standpoint, we find Brazil to be a market we've spent a lot of time learning about, we understand the infrastructure, this company has a world-class distribution base, which was very important to us in the new warehouse and distribution center they've built. They've got actually state-of-the-art funds in front for wastewater removal. And so it is a really fantastic fit. And we find that the environment, particularly given the size of some of the cities like São Paulo and Rio and so forth, in some ways, better for us and more conducive. But I want to be clear, we have spent a lot of time looking at Brazil, studying Brazil, understanding Brazil before we made a move like this. But I think Brazil, in some ways, because of the stability of their economic system and the government they have in place even with the recent presidential change, is a market that we feel very confident and comfortable going into. And as you know, the currency has strengthened precipitously, as had most of the Emerging Market currencies like the rupee and the renminbi. But the real has strengthened, is consistent even in the last several weeks, and is now $1.65, $1.66. So market, we're very comfortable with infrastructure-wise and talent-wise."

One, as I said at CAGNY last week, we have never seen more opportunities than we're seeing now, and we've been very selective, as I've also indicated last week, about our choices. Foodstar is a business that fits right in the middle of our heartland core category of condiments and sauces. Quero is virtually the same thing, Meals & Snacks and condiments and sauces, particularly with it's strong Ketchup business, it's strong Pasta Sauce business, and its Tomato Sauce businesses. And so I think you'll continue to see us focus on those areas and in those core categories. I do think that there are a number of lessons. And frankly, we probably don't have enough time to articulate them. But the key thing is buy a good brand. And in Brazil, by the way, the Quero brand is virtually 100% of the sales that I mentioned at the outset, which means it will move into our Top 15 brands next year. Foodstar has two brands, and Master. And so as the look, we're trying to buy concentrated bands, buying good management. The second thing we're trying to do is not buy businesses that have been grown simply through SKU proliferation. Interestingly enough, the Quero business which is $325 million right now, has about 100 SKUs. The Foodstar business has less than 40 SKUs, so we're trying to find really focused businesses with strong growth prospects, with good manufacturing capabilities. The things we've learned are you have to put management in immediately so that they can learn the business. Because ultimately, the owners that sell these businesses decide that they'd rather go do other things, or they loose interest. So you need to get management in quickly. You need to bring financial processes and discipline in. And the biggest lesson we've learned and it's one we probably should have known but we really learned a lot of it through China this year, is you have to get your investments upfront. Not only in capital but in marketing. And in some of our businesses, we probably waited too long in our zeal to try to sort of balance the profit hit from these businesses from a dilution accretion standpoint, rather than investing aggressively upfront like we're doing in Foodstar, which is, Art said, we're running difficultly on capacity, although the new factory will be up in a couple of months and we'll do the same thing here. So the biggest lesson: Good management, focused portfolios, strong brands, good infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and invest upfront, don't wait."

I'll be glad to give you a positive. I have a slum billion full of positives. And this is the positives include the launch of TGIF which have a positive benefit on the company next year; the launch of Dip & Squeeze, which will be fully distributed by this time next year across a number of accounts. The innovation activity we're seeing in Europe and across the company, the continued performance of growth in the Emerging Markets, which we expect to be every bit as good next year as this year. And the reality is that, while you see Brazil and China in terms of Foodstar and Quero as may be negative, we see them as incredible positives, not only in terms of the creation of the top line but the creation of long-term profit and top line growth. I mean, put in perspective that next year, and I said this in the script, so I don't mind talking about it, next year, we expect emerging market sales short of something else happening to be north of 20% of the total sales of the company. If we continue to drive the growth in those markets that we've given in the past, I think you can start to get a sense of the top line impact that both Foodstar and Quero can have in terms of engaging that number. We've got a lot of activity planned that we'll take you through in May. There's a lot of good stuff going on, Eric. I just want to point out, and you guys wrestle with quarters, I wrestle with the help of the company and the long-term prospects, Quero and Foodstar very positive moves. But Keystone will bring huge benefits once we get it in place. Unfortunately, it's lengthy and it's time-consuming and it's difficult, it's very complicated. We've got a number of opportunities for investment next year, which we'll talk to you about in May. So I mean, I see overall, the health of the company next year being pretty extraordinary. I do think there are some things that we need to continue to be open about, and one is the investment in Keystone, two is the dilution impacts from Foodstar and Quero. And the reason we're not breaking those out now, is because we're still working on the plans, and we'll take you through those in May in specifics. But we talk about the negatives because we try to be open and transparent. We don't see them as negatives, we see them as investments, necessary investments for the long-term health and growth of this company. They can be interpreted as negatives, they're certainly not meant to be negatives, they're meant to be the reality, of hey, we're investing to continue to drive the performance this company has seen over the last six or seven years and to continue to distinguish ourselves from our peer group."

The second thing we're doing is obviously, they've been buying Heinz seeds but we're going to bring them up-to-date with the Heinz seeds that are proprietary to us to help the crop improve the yields and obviously, improve the ultimate output of their products. I mean, They are a strong company. The brands we bought, the brand we bought, is number one and number two in virtually, every category from a volume standpoint, and only two categories falls below that from a dollar sales standpoint curve, I mean, the value standpoint. So I think the reality is that management, investment, processing capability, technical health and then the launch of some businesses, is either the import of those businesses, the local production of those businesses, or the export of some of the businesses. I want to make one comment about their business that's going to be very interesting to watch in our company. They have uniquely developed a tetra pack package of Beanz and they've got about three or four varieties in tetra pack beans, something we've struggled to do as a company over the last decade or so. And so we can take some of that knowledge and that know how, particularly with tetra, they are way ahead of us in terms of working with tetra as a company, and we can apply that knowledge elsewhere in our organization. So this is another example of a two-way street between an Emerging Market business that's actually got factual basis to help us improve in other areas of our company, but we help them."

Secondly, if you look at two of our major cores, I mean, you talk about the core but our top 15 brands have been growing very robustly at around 4% organically year-to-date, and Ketchup is up around 5% organically year-to-date. So those two businesses, the top 15 brands which were 70% of the sales of the company and generally, a lot better mix items, and Ketchup, which is not generally our better mix item but is really among the best in the company, are all continuing to do well. And clearly, we've got an issue this quarter with soup in Europe between Germany and the U.K. and I just pointed out that the softness in Australia and New Zealand in the quarter. And I think fundamentally, you back out Venezuela in Foodservice and we show better results. But the areas we focus on most, the top 15 brands, Emerging Markets and Ketchup are all doing very well, and that's really where the focus is. And so I would expect over time, the top 15, or the top 16, or 17 brands, that 70% number could grow and increase in its level of importance, which is good for the shareholders and good for us. And so that's really where the focus is. So while I'm not obviously, ecstatic about the performance in the developed markets, the slide did point emerging versus developed, it did not point out emerging versus top 15 brands and versus Ketchup, which as I said, is doing vary well."

Art and Ed, per our usual Q3 process, are going to discuss the company's strong third quarter results and then take your questions. But first, I'm pleased to announce a significant transaction that will greatly accelerate our growth in Emerging Markets and in Latin America, in particular.
Heinz, as you all have noted in our press release this morning, has agreed to acquire an 80% stake in Brazilian food processor, Coniexpress S.A. Industrias Alimenticias and it's Quero brand. Quero is a strong, rapidly growing brand with number one, and the number two positions in numerous tomato-based categories in Brazil and the leading position in vegetables.
The brand aligns perfectly with our global portfolio and our core categories, and is already a leader in small, independent stores and shops throughout Brazil. With annual sales of approximately $325 million, Quero will provide Heinz with a tremendous growth platform in Brazil, the world's fifth most populous country with 200 million consumers. 
We have established a short-term goal of around $500 million in sales through organic growth in the complementary launch of Heinz branded products, which we'll be speaking more about in May.
Heinz has been assessing potential opportunities in Brazil for some time, and we are very pleased with the process that resulted in our tie-up with Quero. We expect to build on Quero's already impressive results by leveraging our experience with the modern trade, while also accelerating innovation and marketing to improve the brand sales and distribution.
We're also planning to leverage our technical expertise in tomato processing in our Global Supply Chain to achieve synergies. The business will provide an excellent platform to expand sales and distribution of Heinz-branded product across Brazil, some of which will be produced locally for the South American market.
Importantly, this pending acquisition gives us instant infrastructure in Central Brazil with a modern factory, a fully automated distribution center, and nearly 1,800 employees.
Brazil, as I said, has been on our priority list for some time because of it's size, attractive economic growth, large number of middle class consumers and strong growth prospects. As a reminder, Brazil generates almost 45% of Latin America's GDP.
The transaction makes Heinz one of a select few CPG companies with meaningful businesses in the BRIC markets in Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as Indonesia and probably, the only one of our size. The addition of Quero puts our Emerging Markets on track to generate more than 20% of total company sales in fiscal 2010, up from under 10% just a few years ago, and well ahead of the schedule I outlined at CAGNY last year.
We expect to close this acquisition within the next few months. We also expect it to be modestly diluted in fiscal 2012 from an earnings standpoint, reflecting our plan to invest in marketing and improve capabilities, but also expect it to be accretive to earnings starting in fiscal 2013. 
The acquisition will be essentially funded with cash on hand. I also want to point out that consistent with our strategy, this transaction resulted from a relationship endeavor and was not part of an auction process.
Overall, this transaction is a major growth step under our Emerging Markets strategy. It is also another great example of our successful buy and built approach, which has delivered great results and dynamic growth in India, Indonesia and Russia.
So with that brief overview of Quero until Q&A, I'll turn the call over to Art."

Before getting started, I'd just like to add how excited we all are to be establishing a strong beachhead in a strategically important country like Brazil. We're very pleased to have the deal signed.
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered continued strong organic sales from our trio of key growth vehicles: The Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Expanded gross margins, off a very strong base last year, delivered solid profit growth with EPS of $0.84 and continued our great momentum in driving cash flow.
Now many of you will recall that last year's third quarter was a high watermark in several respects, and included terrific results from the launch of the It Has To Be Heinz campaign in the U.K. and the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S.
Despite this tough comparison, we performed very well with constant currency sales up nearly 3%, operating income up 2%, and EPS up almost 4%. Our organic sales increase of 1.7% was again powered by Emerging Markets, which posted 14% organic growth in Q3. And if you tack on the impact of our recent Foodstar acquisition in China, constant currency sales in Emerging Markets were up 22% for the quarter.
Organic sales in Developed Markets were relatively flat, with solid increases in North American Consumer Products and Global Ketchup, being offset by decreased soup sales in Europe, trade issues in Australia, and a modest decrease in U.S. Foodservice.
Looking at the trend line, I'm pleased to report that we have now posted 23 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, a testament to our strong sales brands and Emerging Markets strategy. Speaking of strong brands, our Top 15 brands represent about 70% of sales in the third quarter and again, led our organic growth up nearly 4%.
Importantly, as we look forward, we fully expect the Master brand from Foodstar in China and the Quero brand in Brazil to join this Top 15 list in the near term.
Turning to our core categories on a constant-currency basis, Infant/Nutrition set the standard for growth in the quarter, up nearly 9% driven by strong performances in India, Latin America and China.
Ketchup and Sauces, sales grew more than 6%, driven by a solid ketchup growth in many parts of the globe. Growth in this category was also driven by Classico pasta sauce in North America and several new Asian sauces in Indonesia. Additionally, the Foodstar acquisition contributed 2.7 points to this growth.
Meals and Snacks posted growth in frozen entrées and potatoes, as well as in Beanz, but was offset by lower European soup sales. But keep in mind that U.K. soup sales grew organically almost 8% last year, powered by cold weather and the launch of ""It Has to Be Heinz"" campaign.
As expected, and in line with our corporate strategy, Emerging Markets has been the single biggest driver of sales growth this year, as they have over our recent history. With this growth, Emerging Markets represent about 16% of our year-to-date sales, despite the devaluation in Venezuela near the end of last fiscal year.
And again, we expect this mix to increase significantly as a result of our recent acquisitions. With Quero and Foodstar next year, Emerging Markets should push past 20% of total sales.
Obviously, our focus today is on Quero but let's not forget our other recent acquisition, Foodstar in China. Foodstar is a leading manufacturer of premium soy sauce from bean curd in southern China. And now just in case coverage in the South doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that Guandong and Fujian have more than 125 million people. For perspective, that's nearly twice the number of people in U.K., and as we push into Zhejiang, we will be making our great products available to another 50 million people.
We closed the Foodstar deal on November 2, and have begun investing in marketing, manufacturing and new capabilities to drive growth. And the great news is that Foodstar is off to a strong start.
In fact, we're off to such a strong start that capacity is an issue. As a result, we've accelerated the completion of Foodstar's Shanghai factory to catch up with demand, and as I mentioned, extend our reach into the neighboring Zhejiang province.
Importantly, Foodstar joins a very fast growth category of businesses that we already have in China. The combination of all our existing Chinese businesses posted nearly 30% organic growth in Q3. And moving south from China, our business in India posted great growth for the quarter as well, also up nearly 30% on an organic basis. This performance was driven by our rapidly growing nutritional beverages, including the extension of our Complan brand into milks for very young children.
Now going back north, Russia posted 16% organic sales growth, as our Ketchup and Baby Food businesses continued to outpace their categories, and expand their already market-leading shares.
Finally, Indonesia generated another strong quarter in Q3 with organic growth of 13%. ABC has delivered a good year of new product development and sound performance with the base sauce and Beverage businesses.
Now let's shift gears to our flagship, the Global Ketchup business. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 3%, and is nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. Remember that in the third quarter, we lapped the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S. last year, so it's a bit of a tougher comp this quarter. As we look forward, we will continue working to increase penetration and buy rate to further expand sales of the world's favorite ketchup.
And for those of you who missed the Bill Johnson and Muhtar Kent's announcement last week, we're launching a new, more sustainable Heinz Ketchup bottle, using proprietary plant bottle packaging developed by Coca-Cola. It's a great innovation that will both appeal to consumers and help improve the environment. 
The plant bottle is made from 30% plant-based materials, is fully recyclable and will enable us to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Starting this spring, we plan to ship 120 million ketchup bottles annually using this technology. And we look forward to exploring other areas of potential collaboration with Coca-Cola.
Last week, we also announced that Chick-fil-A is the first national chain to offer Dip & Squeeze at its more than 1,500 locations. We're very excited about partnering with this leader in quality and customer service and early consumer feedback has been terrific. 
Tomorrow is free FryDay, that's spelled F-R-Y-Day at Chick-fil-A  restaurants for those of you who asked for Dip & Squeeze from 2 to 4 p.m. We encourage you to check it out.
And stay tuned for more news on Dip & Squeeze, including a retail launch coming this summer. Now let's take a quick spin around our geographic cycles.
We'll start with North American Consumer Products. Constant currency sales growth to 2% is driven by nearly 4% volume increase, reflecting strong growth across our five core U.S. brands, which was only partially offset by lower sales across the market. 
Importantly, the sales growth resulted in strong market share performance across most of our categories. Net pricing declined by 1.7%, which was driven by our Consumer Value Program. This program included the shift to marketing funds to trade and consumer promotions during the quarter. But remember, we'll be lapping the full CVP implementation in the fourth quarter.
NACP profit results were excellent, as higher volume, better mix and productivity improvements more than offset current commodity costs. 
Volume growth was supplemented by the launch of a number of innovations and product improvements in North America during the quarter. These included new smart wins in T.G.I. Friday's fries and more improvements in enhanced taste, variety, value and convenience.
Now let's turn to the U.S. Foodservice. As we discussed last quarter, we had expected the industry and with it our sales, to recover at a bit faster pace. As it is, Foodservice had its best quarterly sales change in five quarters, but was still down about 0.5%. 
Sales gains in branded ketchup and condiments were offset by weakness in frozen soups and desserts and non-branded sauces. We continue to be very pleased with the bottom line in this business. Improved capabilities and streamlined processes enabled us to grow operating income by nearly 13% in the quarter and 19% year-to-date.
One of the ways we're driving brand condiment sales is by expanding the availability of Dip & Squeeze, and launching our new all-natural Simply Heinz condiments, which are packaged in more environmentally friendly material. 
Now jumping the pond, we've posted solid performance in Europe while lapping a very strong quarter with the launch of ""It Has To Be Heinz"" in the U.K. For the quarter, constant currency sales were flat, as net pricing of 2.5%, primarily coming from the U.K. and Italy, was offset by lower soup volume in the U.K. and in Germany.
U.K. business posted positive organic sales growth against a 7% increase last year, and while lapping a record soup month in January. Russia also posted a strong quarter and notably, the Italian baby food category returned its growth. 
Constant currency operating income increased to the double-digit rate, driven by strong gross margin gains, which provided the fuel to invest in higher marketing and in Keystone.
From an innovation standpoint, we launched several very promising new products in the U.K. that have tested well with consumers. We're particularly enthused about the new Fridge Pack Beanz that Bill highlighted at CAGNY last week. 
In our Asia/Pacific market, constant currency sales grew 10% driven by strong results in India, China and Indonesia. Overall, volume increased 4.5%, and Foodstar contributed nearly six points of growth. The Australian business continues to face a difficult trade in a competitive environment. We've appointed Nigel Comer, who has successfully led our Wattie's business in New Zealand for many years, to head up our Australian, New Zealand and Japanese businesses. The drop in constant currency operating income in the segment primarily relates to lower profitability in Australia and higher marketing spending across the region.
The additional investments in marketing spending is supporting some exciting new products being launched across the Asia/Pacific, including the new U Da Man drink from LOL in Australia, extensions of Green Rice Cereal in China, and new Black Gold and hot chili soy sauces in Indonesia. 
A portion of our higher marketing investment this year has been in support of our infant formula launch in China. Overall, we're pleased with our progress to date, and we're very excited about the halo effect the advertising is having on our base baby food portfolio, including jar foods, cereals and nutritional supplements, with our total organic sales up 35% year-to-date.
In our Rest of World segment, we delivered constant currency sales growth of 10.5%, driven by net pricing in Latin America, which only partially offset the high inflation there. Volume was down 4%, primarily reflecting economic difficulties in Venezuela and the beginning of a labor strike at our factory late in the quarter. We expect to continue decrease in volume and operating income in Venezuela during the fourth quarter, reflecting the economic and labor challenges in that country.
Turning to cash, we delivered $438 million of operating free cash flow, representing 160% of net income. This excellent performance was driven by strong profitability, working capital management and continuing financial discipline. We're also pleased to tell you that during the quarter, we completed a $500 million multi-year private bond placement which we'll fund in May, the proceeds of which will be used to help retire a $750 million bond that comes due in July.
As you would expect, we're continuing to focus the team on strong operating discipline. With this in mind, we have reduced trade spending to below year-ago levels, kicking price increases where necessary to help offset commodity inflation, and are continuing to drive down our cash conversion cycle. This discipline is helping us post strong results in a difficult environment.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Ed McMenamin to cover our financial scorecards. Ed?"
278212,126854956,108183,"HJ Heinz Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2011",2011-03-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone.

I'll take you through some of the details that underpinned another solid quarter for Heinz. Looking at EPS, I'll give you three perspectives on the company's results that reflect the impact that currencies and last year's divestitures have had on our comparisons against what was our strongest quarter in fiscal '10.
First, looking at the results on a constant-currency basis, EPS was $0.86, up 3.6% versus prior year. Our current period results were impacted by about $0.02 from unfavorable currency movements. More details on that in a few minutes.
Reported EPS from continuing operations was $0.84, up 1.2% from prior year and finally, including the $0.11 unfavorable impact from discontinued operations last year, total company reported EPS was up $0.12, or almost 17%.
Now turning to our P&L scorecard. Net sales grew almost 3% on a constant-currency basis, and 1.5% after the impact of currency movements. Organic sales growth of 1.7% benefited from both volume and pricing, while the acquisition of Foodstar added another 1.2% of growth.
Our gross margin at 37.8% is continuing to benefit from our Global Supply Chain efforts, with an improvement of 30 basis points from our highest margin quarter of last year.
Productivity improvements were the main driver, primarily in the U.S., the U.K. and continental Europe. Marketing was lower $2 million this year as investments in our Emerging Markets, the U.K. and U.S. Foodservice were offset by a shift in North America from traditional advertising to trade promotions. As a reminder, last year's marketing was more back-end weighted while this year is more evenly distributed throughout the year.
Operating income increased 2.1% on a constant-currency basis, as our improvements in gross margin more than offset investments in Project Keystone.
Given the impact foreign exchange has had on it this year, let's take a quick look at currency trends. These charts show a 15-month time horizon on a few of our key currencies. The pound and the euro are well up from last summer's levels, but still down 2% and 8% respectively from Q3 of last year.
The bolivar was devalued by 50% last year, and remains at $4.30 to the dollar. While Australia is representative of the Asia Pac currencies, showing strength versus the dollar.
This chart lays out the effects those currency movements have had on our P&L. The largest impact continues to be on our revenue line. The majority of which is the devaluation of Venezuelan bolivar, which we've now lapped in Q3.
The euro and the pound continued to be the largest drivers of currency impact to EPS, given the relative size and profitability of our European businesses. Currency movements in Asia/Pacific continued to be favorable, but on a smaller profit base. Adjusting for currency translation, EPS would have been $0.02 better.
We now have the major currencies locked for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current earnings outlook for FY '11.
Turning to the P&L. I'll focus on a few of the line items that were not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up almost 4% on a constant-currency basis, benefiting from improved margin, favorable volume and the Foodstar acquisition. 
SG&A was up 7% on a constant-currency basis and up 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. This reflects our investments in Project Keystone, as well as the Foodstar acquisition. I'll go deeper on the drivers of operating income growth on the next few slides, but I'll cover the activity below operating income here.
Net interest in other expenses are favorable $6 million, driven by reduced net debt. The company's 26.1% effective tax rate for the quarter was down 110 basis points, or a little over $0.01 of EPS. The improvement was primarily due to increased income and lower tax rate jurisdictions, along with foreign tax planning partially offset by higher repatriation costs this year.
We're now estimating our full-year tax rate to be around 27%, reflecting the recent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, as well as favorable foreign tax settlement.
And finally, offsetting the benefits from the tax line, shares outstanding reflect a 2% increase versus last year, an impact of around $0.02 on EPS, resulting in the delivery of $0.84 for Q3. 
Now let's take a deeper look at sales. The third quarter delivered constant currency sales growth of nearly 3%, while organic sales grew almost 2%. Volume increased 0.5%, driven by the Emerging Markets and North American Consumer Products, partially offset by soup in Europe, along with declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Net pricing increased sales by 1.2%, as price increases in the Emerging Markets, primarily Latin America, combined with U.S. Foodservice and the U.K. These were partially upset by increased trade promotions and North American Consumer Products and the Australian business.
The 1.2% benefit from the Foodstar acquisition in China was more than offset by the 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
As I mentioned earlier, our gross margin increased 30 basis points to 37.8% on both the reported and constant-currency basis. Productivity improvements, along with higher pricing and favorable mix in our U.S. Consumer Products business, have more than offset higher commodity costs, and about a 20 basis points headwind from Venezuela. 
We also realized a slight gain on the sale specialty channel distribution rights from one of our smaller European product lines.
As you've been reading in the press and hearing from all of our peers, commodity costs in general have shown an abrupt increase recently. Overall, they are a bit more of an headwind than we expected last quarter, but they are incorporated in our revised EPS outlook. 
At this point, we'd expect our market basket of commodities to show increase of over 4% this fiscal year, while our procurement teams has developed plans to hold our input costs increases below 2%. Having covered the key components of the P&L, let's turn to the cash flow.
As you can see, another strong performance in operating free cash flow at $438 million this quarter. Driving this performance were further improvements in working capital management. Capital expenditures are 2.7% of sales, in line with our plans to increase investments in Project Keystone. The $135 million this year for acquisitions relates to the purchase of Foodstar, and dividends reflect a 7.1% increase we announced in June.
Now let's briefly review our results for the first nine months of the year. Looking at our P&L scorecard, all of our key measures compare favorably to last year on both a reported and constant-currency basis. Focusing on the constant currency growth, net sales grew 2.5%, driven by our Top 15 brands which outpaced the company average, growing 4.2% organically.
Our gross profit margin was up around 80 basis points, as higher net pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs. Consumer marketing was up 2.3% to just over $300 million.
Operating income increased 6.1%, while increasing investments in both marketing and Keystone. At $2.37, EPS was up almost 8% on a constant-currency basis, while the dilution from higher shares outstanding was roughly offset by a 110 basis point decline in our effective tax rate, which came in at 26%.
Updating the slide I showed you for the quarter to reflect year-to-date impact of currency indicates an $0.08 unfavorable impact as the effects headwinds in the first half were more substantial than recent trends.
On a year-to-date basis, organic sales improved 2.1%, with balance support from volume and price. And the same is true for the Emerging Markets, which grew over 15%.
The volume increase reflects growth in the Emerging Markets, as well as improvements in North American Consumer Products and the U.K. businesses. These were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Pricing was favorable 1%, largely due to Latin America and U.S. Foodservice, while NACP reduced net price as a result of increased trade spending for the Consumer Value Program which began late last year. The Foodstar acquisition added about 0.5 a point to sales growth, while currency cost us nearly 2% at the sales line.
Looking at the year-to-date balance sheet scorecard, capital expenditures of $195 million were 2.5% of sales, up 60 basis points from last year, but still favorable to our 3% full-year estimate.
Cash conversion cycle was 44 days, down six days, driven by improvements in all three measures. Operating free cash flow was up almost $100 million from last year, approaching $1 billion through nine months. This performance supports the increase in our full-year estimate to $1.2 billion.
Net debt to EBITDA was 0.5x better, driven by lower net debt and higher earnings. ROIC was 19.3%, up 1.1% from this time last year. This excludes the impact of losses from discontinued operations in the prior year of about 80 basis points.
And finally, looking at the year-to-date cash flow, the increase versus prior year was due to higher earnings and reduced pension contributions, as well as improvements in payables and income taxes. These increases were partially offset by declines in receivables, largely due to the cash received last year in connection with an accounts receivable securitization program.
In addition, last year we received $75 million from closing out swap contracts and the maturity of foreign currency contracts. In summary, an overall solid performance for sales, cash and earnings. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full-year outlook."
278212,126854956,108183,"HJ Heinz Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2011",2011-03-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Ed. Now with three quarters done this year, I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 million",446,"Thanks, Ed. Now with three quarters done this year, I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. 
As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 million to  $310 million. This reflects better-than-expected currency dynamics for the year and improved operating performance. Now it's important to note that these projections do not include any one-time costs associated with closing the Quero deal in Brazil. To the extent that the deal closes in this fiscal year, we could incur about $0.03 of transaction-related costs.
Bill also announced that we expect to deliver $1.2 billion in operating free cash flow for the year. This would be up $200 million from our original target and an all-time record for Heinz. 
And turning to revenue, we've mentioned through the year that we thought our sales goal was the most challenging part of our outlook, and expect it to come in at the low end of the range. We now believe that constant currency sales growth for the year will be between 2% and 3% due to the impact of a month-long labor stoppage at our main plants in Venezuela, and slower than expected recovery in U.S. Foodservice industry. 
The good news is that union employees are now back on the job in Venezuela, and we are back at the bargaining table to work toward a mutually beneficial agreement there.
Looking at Q4, we expect to make a number of investments to continue to fuel future growth. The first is the launch of nine SKUs of T.G.I. Friday's single-serve meals that we previewed at CAGNY. As Bill noted, our retail partners are excited about the coming launch, and believe that the new products could help jump start the category.
The second is to launch an ongoing expansion of Dip & Squeeze in Foodservice. The third is our continuing investment in Project Keystone as we drive stronger processes, consistent with capabilities across the company; and the fourth is investment in our new acquisitions. We are already moving quickly to improve capabilities and enhanced marketing in our Foodstar business.
In summary, the business is continuing to perform well in challenging times. Our top line performance is driven by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Our bottom line continues to benefit from our culture of strict operational discipline, and we are on track to deliver our full-year earnings and cash flow targets. And we're continuing to build a runway for further growth as we invest for the future.
With that, now we'll open it up for your questions."

And right now, they're really difficult to predict going forward, even with some of the turmoil in the world. So you'll continue to see, I think, us independent of what anybody else does as I continue to say, price against these commodity costs.

And we've been able to push price through. I think the other thing you have to keep in context is, that in those markets, unlike the Developed Markets, you're also seeing wages and salaries lifted in concert with the increased impact of inflation. That's the benefit of markets that are growing, as opposed to markets that are static with high levels of unemployment. So thus far, it has not been an issue. Now the UN tries to make an issue out of some of this stuff by talking at a macro business about staple products in some cases like wheat, flour, sugar, rice. But from our standpoint and the targets we reach predominantly, the middle-class and up, it has not been an issue thus far.

One, this business is virtually half of its business in tomato processing, and tomato products, which is something obviously, we bring great global capability and expertise in. So from that standpoint, it's right down our lane. The second big piece of it are vegetables, jarred, canned vegetables, which we do in New Zealand, which we do in Australia, which we do in Poland, which we do in a number of markets. And we think there's substantial cross opportunities. The market itself, GDP growth has been 10% to 15% over the last, say, five or six years on average with the exception, obviously, of the one bad year for all of us. We expect it to be about 7% to 10% going forward. While the infrastructure is not where we would like it to be in Brazil, it is actually better than some of the other Emerging Markets we're in, and we have a lot of experience in Venezuela that we find very applicable to Brazil. What we do like, it's got great growing areas. It's also got significant opportunities and upped the trade for us, because the business we're buying is predominantly down the trade and we're going to push into up the trade. The emerging trade there between Carrefour and Wal-Mart is becoming a much bigger piece. The middle class is growing rapidly among the 200 million people. This business has been around 25 or 26 years, and has been growing at a compound average rate between 10% and 15%, despite very little marketing and despite no up the trade presence. So from our standpoint, we find Brazil to be a market we've spent a lot of time learning about, we understand the infrastructure. This company has a world-class distribution base, which was very important to us in the new warehouse and distribution center they've built. They've got actually state-of-the-art ponds in front for wastewater removal. And so it is a really fantastic fit. And we find that the environment, particularly given the size of some of the cities like São Paulo and Rio and so forth, in some ways, better for us and more conducive. But I want to be clear, we have spent a lot of time looking at Brazil, studying Brazil, understanding Brazil before we made a move like this. But I think Brazil, in some ways because of the stability of their economic system and the government they have in place even with the recent presidential change, is a market that we feel very confident and comfortable going into. And as you know, the currency has strengthened precipitously, as have most of the Emerging Market currencies like the rupee and the renminbi. But the real has strengthened, even in the last several weeks, and is now BRL 1.65, BRL 1.66. So market, we're very comfortable with infrastructure-wise and talent-wise."

One, as I said at CAGNY last week, we have never seen more opportunities than we're seeing now, and we've been very selective, as I've also indicated last week, about our choices. Foodstar is a business that fits right in the middle of our heartland core category of condiments and sauces. Quero is virtually the same thing, Meals & Snacks and condiments and sauces, particularly with its strong Ketchup business, its strong Pasta Sauce business, and its Tomato Sauce businesses. And so I think you'll continue to see us focus on those areas and in those core categories. I do think that there are a number of lessons. And frankly, we probably don't have enough time to articulate them. But the key thing is buy a good brand. And in Brazil, by the way, the Quero brand is virtually 100% of the sales that I mentioned at the outset, which means it will move into our Top 15 brands next year. Foodstar has two brands in Guanghe and Master. And so as you look, we're trying to buy concentrated brands, buying good management. The second thing we're trying to do is not buy businesses that have been grown simply through SKU proliferation. Interestingly enough, the Quero business, which is $325 million right now, has about 100 SKUs. The Foodstar business has less than 40 SKUs, so we're trying to find really focused businesses with strong growth prospects with good manufacturing capabilities. The things we've learned are you have to put management in immediately so that they can learn the business. Because ultimately, the owners that sell these businesses decide that they'd rather go do other things, or they loose interest. So you need to get management in quickly. You need to bring financial processes and discipline in. And the biggest lesson we've learned and it's one we probably should have known but we really learned a lot of it through China this year, is you have to get your investments upfront. Not only in capital but in marketing. And in some of our businesses, we probably waited too long in our zeal to try to sort of balance the profit hit from these businesses from a dilution accretion standpoint, rather than investing aggressively upfront like we're doing in Foodstar which, as Art said, we're running difficultly on capacity, although the new factory will be up in a couple of months and we'll do the same thing here. So the biggest lesson: Good management, focused portfolios, strong brands, good infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and invest upfront, don't wait."

The brands we bought, the brand we bought, is number one and number two in virtually every category from a volume standpoint, and only two categories falls below that from a dollar sales standpoint curve, I mean, the value standpoint. So I think the reality is that management, investment, processing capability, technical health and then the launch of some businesses, either the import of those businesses or local production of those businesses or the export of some of the businesses. I want to make one comment about their business that's going to be very interesting to watch in our company. They have uniquely developed a tetra pack package of Beanz and they've got about three or four varieties in tetra pack beans, something we've struggled to do as a company over the last decade or so. And so we can take some of that knowledge and that know how, particularly with tetra, they are way ahead of us in terms of working with tetra as a company, and we can apply that knowledge elsewhere in our organization. So this is another example of a two-way street between an Emerging Market business that's actually got factual basis to help us improve in other areas of our company, while we help them."

Secondly, if you look at two of our major cores, I mean, you talk about the core, but our top 15 brands have been growing very robustly at around 4% organically year-to-date, and Ketchup is up around 5% organically year-to-date. So those two businesses, the top 15 brands which were 70% of the sales of the company and generally are our better mix items and Ketchup, which is not generally our better mix item, but is really among the best in the company, are all continuing to do well. And clearly, we've got an issue this quarter with soup in Europe between Germany and the U.K. and I just pointed out that the softness in Australia and New Zealand in the quarter. And I think fundamentally, you back out Venezuela in Foodservice and we show better results. But the areas we focus on most, the top 15 brands, Emerging Markets and Ketchup are all doing very well, and that's really where the focus is. And so I would expect over time, the top 15, or the top 16, or 17 brands, that 70% number could grow and increase in its level of importance, which is good for the shareholders and good for us. And so that's really where the focus is. So while I'm not obviously ecstatic about the performance in the developed markets, the slide did point emerging versus developed, it did not point out emerging versus top 15 brands and versus Ketchup, which as I said, is doing vary well."

Art and Ed, per our usual Q3 process, are going to discuss the company's strong third quarter results and then take your questions. But first, I'm pleased to announce a significant transaction that will greatly accelerate our growth in Emerging Markets and in Latin America, in particular.
Heinz, as you all have noted in our press release this morning, has agreed to acquire an 80% stake in Brazilian food processor, Coniexpress S.A. Industrias Alimenticias and its Quero brand. Quero is a strong, rapidly growing brand with number one, and the number two positions in numerous tomato-based categories in Brazil and the leading position in vegetables.
The brand aligns perfectly with our global portfolio and our core categories, and is already a leader in small, independent stores and shops throughout Brazil. With annual sales of approximately $325 million, Quero will provide Heinz with a tremendous growth platform in Brazil, the world's fifth most populous country with 200 million consumers. 
We have established a short-term goal of around $500 million in sales through organic growth in the complementary launch of Heinz branded products, which we'll be speaking more about in May.
Heinz has been assessing potential opportunities in Brazil for some time, and we are very pleased with the process that resulted in our tie-up with Quero. We expect to build on Quero's already impressive results by leveraging our experience with the modern trade, while also accelerating innovation and marketing to improve the brand sales and distribution.
We're also planning to leverage our technical expertise in tomato processing in our Global Supply Chain to achieve synergies. The business will provide an excellent platform to expand sales and distribution of Heinz-branded product across Brazil, some of which will be produced locally for the South American market.
Importantly, this pending acquisition gives us instant infrastructure in Central Brazil with a modern factory, a fully automated distribution center, and nearly 1,800 employees.
Brazil, as I said, has been on our priority list for some time because of its size, attractive economic growth, large number of middle class consumers and strong growth prospects. As a reminder, Brazil generates almost 45% of Latin America's GDP.
The transaction makes Heinz one of a select few CPG companies with meaningful businesses in the BRIC markets in Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as Indonesia and probably, the only one of our size. The addition of Quero puts our Emerging Markets on track to generate more than 20% of total company sales in fiscal 2010, up from under 10% just a few years ago, and well ahead of the schedule I outlined at CAGNY last year.
We expect to close this acquisition within the next few months. We also expect it to be modestly diluted in fiscal 2012 from an earnings standpoint, reflecting our plan to invest in marketing and improve capabilities, but also expect it to be accretive to earnings starting in fiscal 2013. 
The acquisition will be essentially funded with cash on hand. I also want to point out that consistent with our strategy, this transaction resulted from a relationship endeavor and was not part of an auction process.
Overall, this transaction is a major growth step under our Emerging Markets strategy. It is also another great example of our successful buy and built approach, which has delivered great results and dynamic growth in India, Indonesia and Russia.
So with that brief overview of Quero until Q&A, I'll turn the call over to Art."
278212,126854956,108300,"HJ Heinz Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2011",2011-03-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

Before getting started, I'd just like to add how excited we all are to be establishing a strong beachhead in a strategically important country like Brazil. We're very pleased to have the deal signed.
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered continued strong organic sales from our trio of key growth vehicles: The Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Expanded gross margins, off a very strong base last year, delivered solid profit growth with EPS of $0.84 and continued our great momentum in driving cash flow.
Now many of you will recall that last year's third quarter was a high watermark in several respects, and included terrific results from the launch of the It Has To Be Heinz campaign in the U.K. and the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S.
Despite this tough comparison, we performed very well with constant currency sales up nearly 3%, operating income up 2%, and EPS up almost 4%. Our organic sales increase of 1.7% was again powered by Emerging Markets, which posted 14% organic growth in Q3. And if you tack on the impact of our recent Foodstar acquisition in China, constant currency sales in Emerging Markets were up 22% for the quarter.
Organic sales in Developed Markets were relatively flat, with solid increases in North American Consumer Products and Global Ketchup, being offset by decreased soup sales in Europe, trade issues in Australia, and a modest decrease in U.S. Foodservice.
Looking at the trend line, I'm pleased to report that we have now posted 23 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, a testament to our strong sales brands and Emerging Markets strategy. Speaking of strong brands, our Top 15 brands represent about 70% of sales in the third quarter and again, led our organic growth up nearly 4%.
Importantly, as we look forward, we fully expect the Master brand from Foodstar in China and the Quero brand in Brazil to join this Top 15 list in the near term.
Turning to our core categories on a constant-currency basis, Infant/Nutrition set the standard for growth in the quarter, up nearly 9% driven by strong performances in India, Latin America and China.
Ketchup and Sauces, sales grew more than 6%, driven by a solid ketchup growth in many parts of the globe. Growth in this category was also driven by Classico pasta sauce in North America and several new Asian sauces in Indonesia. Additionally, the Foodstar acquisition contributed 2.7 points to this growth.
Meals and Snacks posted growth in frozen entrées and potatoes, as well as in Beanz, but was offset by lower European soup sales. But keep in mind that U.K. soup sales grew organically almost 8% last year, powered by cold weather and the launch of ""It Has to Be Heinz"" campaign.
As expected, and in line with our corporate strategy, Emerging Markets has been the single biggest driver of sales growth this year, as they have over our recent history. With this growth, Emerging Markets represent about 16% of our year-to-date sales, despite the devaluation in Venezuela near the end of last fiscal year.
And again, we expect this mix to increase significantly as a result of our recent acquisitions. With Quero and Foodstar next year, Emerging Markets should push past 20% of total sales.
Obviously, our focus today is on Quero but let's not forget our other recent acquisition, Foodstar in China. Foodstar is a leading manufacturer of premium soy sauce from bean curd in southern China. And now just in case coverage in the South doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that Guandong and Fujian have more than 125 million people. For perspective, that's nearly twice the number of people in U.K., and as we push into Zhejiang, we will be making our great products available to another 50 million people.
We closed the Foodstar deal on November 2, and have begun investing in marketing, manufacturing and new capabilities to drive growth. And the great news is that Foodstar is off to a strong start.
In fact, we're off to such a strong start that capacity is an issue. As a result, we've accelerated the completion of Foodstar's Shanghai factory to catch up with demand, and as I mentioned, extend our reach into the neighboring Zhejiang province.
Importantly, Foodstar joins a very fast growth category of businesses that we already have in China. The combination of all our existing Chinese businesses posted nearly 30% organic growth in Q3. And moving south from China, our business in India posted great growth for the quarter as well, also up nearly 30% on an organic basis. This performance was driven by our rapidly growing nutritional beverages, including the extension of our Complan brand into milks for very young children.
Now going back north, Russia posted 16% organic sales growth, as our Ketchup and Baby Food businesses continued to outpace their categories, and expand their already market-leading shares.
Finally, Indonesia generated another strong quarter in Q3 with organic growth of 13%. ABC has delivered a good year of new product development and sound performance with the base sauce and Beverage businesses.
Now let's shift gears to our flagship, the Global Ketchup business. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 3%, and is nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. Remember that in the third quarter, we lapped the return of ketchup promotions in the U.S. last year, so it's a bit of a tougher comp this quarter. As we look forward, we will continue working to increase penetration and buy rate to further expand sales of the world's favorite ketchup.
And for those of you who missed the Bill Johnson and Muhtar Kent's announcement last week, we're launching a new, more sustainable Heinz Ketchup bottle, using proprietary plant bottle packaging developed by Coca-Cola. It's a great innovation that will both appeal to consumers and help improve the environment. 
The plant bottle is made from 30% plant-based materials, is fully recyclable and will enable us to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Starting this spring, we plan to ship 120 million ketchup bottles annually using this technology. And we look forward to exploring other areas of potential collaboration with Coca-Cola.
Last week, we also announced that Chick-fil-A is the first national chain to offer Dip & Squeeze at its more than 1,500 locations. We're very excited about partnering with this leader in quality and customer service and early consumer feedback has been terrific. 
Tomorrow is Free FryDay, that's spelled F-R-Y-Day at Chick-fil-A  restaurants for those of you who asked for Dip & Squeeze from 2 to 4 p.m. We encourage you to check it out.
And stay tuned for more news on Dip & Squeeze, including a retail launch coming this summer. Now let's take a quick spin around our geographic cycles.
We'll start with North American Consumer Products. Constant currency sales growth to 2% is driven by nearly 4% volume increase, reflecting strong growth across our five core U.S. brands, which was only partially offset by lower sales across the market. 
Importantly, the sales growth resulted in strong market share performance across most of our categories. Net pricing declined by 1.7%, which was driven by our Consumer Value Program. This program included the shift to marketing funds to trade and consumer promotions during the quarter. But remember, we'll be lapping the full CVP implementation in the fourth quarter.
NACP profit results were excellent, as higher volume, better mix and productivity improvements more than offset current commodity costs. 
Volume growth was supplemented by the launch of a number of innovations and product improvements in North America during the quarter. These included new smart wins in T.G.I. Friday's fries and more improvements in enhanced taste, variety, value and convenience.
Now let's turn to the U.S. Foodservice. As we discussed last quarter, we had expected the industry and with it our sales, to recover at a bit faster pace. As it is, Foodservice had its best quarterly sales change in five quarters, but was still down about 0.5%. 
Sales gains in branded ketchup and condiments were offset by weakness in frozen soups and desserts and non-branded sauces. We continue to be very pleased with the bottom line in this business. Improved capabilities and streamlined processes enabled us to grow operating income by nearly 13% in the quarter and 19% year-to-date.
One of the ways we're driving brand condiment sales is by expanding the availability of Dip & Squeeze, and launching our new all-natural Simply Heinz condiments, which are packaged in more environmentally friendly material. 
Now jumping the pond, we've posted solid performance in Europe while lapping a very strong quarter with the launch of ""It Has To Be Heinz"" in the U.K. For the quarter, constant currency sales were flat, as net pricing of 2.5%, primarily coming from the U.K. and Italy, was offset by lower soup volume in the U.K. and in Germany.
U.K. business posted positive organic sales growth against a 7% increase last year, and while lapping a record soup month in January. Russia also posted a strong quarter and notably, the Italian baby food category returned its growth. 
Constant currency operating income increased to the double-digit rate, driven by strong gross margin gains, which provided the fuel to invest in higher marketing and in Keystone.
From an innovation standpoint, we launched several very promising new products in the U.K. that have tested well with consumers. We're particularly enthused about the new Fridge Pack Beanz that Bill highlighted at CAGNY last week. 
In our Asia/Pacific market, constant currency sales grew 10% driven by strong results in India, China and Indonesia. Overall, volume increased 4.5%, and Foodstar contributed nearly six points of growth. The Australian business continues to face a difficult trade in a competitive environment. We've appointed Nigel Comer, who has successfully led our Wattie's business in New Zealand for many years, to head up our Australian, New Zealand and Japanese businesses. The drop in constant currency operating income in the segment primarily relates to lower profitability in Australia and higher marketing spending across the region.
The additional investments in marketing spending is supporting some exciting new products being launched across the Asia/Pacific, including the new U Da Man drink from LOL in Australia, extensions of Green Rice Cereal in China, and new Black Gold and hot chili soy sauces in Indonesia. 
A portion of our higher marketing investment this year has been in support of our infant formula launch in China. Overall, we're pleased with our progress to date, and we're very excited about the halo effect the advertising is having on our base baby food portfolio, including jar foods, cereals and nutritional supplements, with our total organic sales up 35% year-to-date.
In our Rest of World segment, we delivered constant currency sales growth of 10.5%, driven by net pricing in Latin America, which only partially offset the high inflation there. Volume was down 4%, primarily reflecting economic difficulties in Venezuela and the beginning of a labor strike at our factory late in the quarter. We expect to continue decrease in volume and operating income in Venezuela during the fourth quarter, reflecting the economic and labor challenges in that country.
Turning to cash, we delivered $438 million of operating free cash flow, representing 160% of net income. This excellent performance was driven by strong profitability, working capital management and continuing financial discipline. We're also pleased to tell you that during the quarter, we completed a $500 million multi-year private bond placement which we'll fund in May, the proceeds of which will be used to help retire a $750 million bond that comes due in July.
As you would expect, we're continuing to focus the team on strong operating discipline. With this in mind, we have reduced trade spending to below year-ago levels, kicking price increases where necessary to help offset commodity inflation, and are continuing to drive down our cash conversion cycle. This discipline is helping us post strong results in a difficult environment.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Ed McMenamin to cover our financial scorecards. Ed?"
278212,126854956,108300,"HJ Heinz Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2011",2011-03-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some of the details that underpinned another solid quarter for Heinz. Looking at EPS, I'll give you three perspectives on the company's results that reflect the impact that currencies and last",1571,"Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some of the details that underpinned another solid quarter for Heinz. Looking at EPS, I'll give you three perspectives on the company's results that reflect the impact that currencies and last year's divestitures have had on our comparisons against what was our strongest quarter in fiscal '10.
First, looking at the results on a constant-currency basis, EPS was $0.86, up 3.6% versus prior year. Our current period results were impacted by about $0.02 from unfavorable currency movements. More details on that in a few minutes.
Reported EPS from continuing operations was $0.84, up 1.2% from prior year and finally, including the $0.11 unfavorable impact from discontinued operations last year, total company reported EPS was up $0.12, or almost 17%.
Now turning to our P&L scorecard. Net sales grew almost 3% on a constant-currency basis, and 1.5% after the impact of currency movements. Organic sales growth of 1.7% benefited from both volume and pricing, while the acquisition of Foodstar added another 1.2% of growth.
Our gross margin at 37.8% is continuing to benefit from our Global Supply Chain efforts, with an improvement of 30 basis points from our highest margin quarter of last year.
Productivity improvements were the main driver, primarily in the U.S., the U.K. and continental Europe. Marketing was lower $2 million this year as investments in our Emerging Markets, the U.K. and U.S. Foodservice were offset by a shift in North America from traditional advertising to trade promotions. As a reminder, last year's marketing was more back-end weighted while this year is more evenly distributed throughout the year.
Operating income increased 2.1% on a constant-currency basis, as our improvements in gross margin more than offset investments in Project Keystone.
Given the impact foreign exchange has had on it this year, let's take a quick look at currency trends. These charts show a 15-month time horizon on a few of our key currencies. The pound and the euro are well up from last summer's levels, but still down 2% and 8% respectively from Q3 of last year.
The bolivar was devalued by 50% last year, and remains at $4.30 to the dollar. While Australia is representative of the Asia Pac currencies, showing strength versus the dollar.
This chart lays out the effects those currency movements have had on our P&L. The largest impact continues to be on our revenue line. The majority of which is the devaluation of Venezuelan bolivar, which we've now lapped in Q3.
The euro and the pound continued to be the largest drivers of currency impact to EPS, given the relative size and profitability of our European businesses. Currency movements in Asia/Pacific continued to be favorable, but on a smaller profit base. Adjusting for currency translation, EPS would have been $0.02 better.
We now have the major currencies locked for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current earnings outlook for FY '11.
Turning to the P&L. I'll focus on a few of the line items that were not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up almost 4% on a constant-currency basis, benefiting from improved margin, favorable volume and the Foodstar acquisition. 
SG&A was up 7% on a constant-currency basis and up 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. This reflects our investments in Project Keystone, as well as the Foodstar acquisition. I'll go deeper on the drivers of operating income growth on the next few slides, but I'll cover the activity below operating income here.
Net interest in other expenses are favorable $6 million, driven by reduced net debt. The company's 26.1% effective tax rate for the quarter was down 110 basis points, or a little over $0.01 of EPS. The improvement was primarily due to increased income and lower tax rate jurisdictions, along with foreign tax planning partially offset by higher repatriation costs this year.
We're now estimating our full-year tax rate to be around 27%, reflecting the recent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, as well as favorable foreign tax settlement.
And finally, offsetting the benefits from the tax line, shares outstanding reflect a 2% increase versus last year, an impact of around $0.02 on EPS, resulting in the delivery of $0.84 for Q3. 
Now let's take a deeper look at sales. The third quarter delivered constant currency sales growth of nearly 3%, while organic sales grew almost 2%. Volume increased 0.5%, driven by the Emerging Markets and North American Consumer Products, partially offset by soup in Europe, along with declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Net pricing increased sales by 1.2%, as price increases in the Emerging Markets, primarily Latin America, combined with U.S. Foodservice and the U.K. These were partially upset by increased trade promotions and North American Consumer Products and the Australian business.
The 1.2% benefit from the Foodstar acquisition in China was more than offset by the 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
As I mentioned earlier, our gross margin increased 30 basis points to 37.8% on both the reported and constant-currency basis. Productivity improvements, along with higher pricing and favorable mix in our U.S. Consumer Products business, have more than offset higher commodity costs, and about a 20 basis points headwind from Venezuela. 
We also realized a slight gain on the sale specialty channel distribution rights from one of our smaller European product lines.
As you've been reading in the press and hearing from all of our peers, commodity costs in general have shown an abrupt increase recently. Overall, they are a bit more of an headwind than we expected last quarter, but they are incorporated in our revised EPS outlook. 
At this point, we'd expect our market basket of commodities to show increase of over 4% this fiscal year, while our procurement teams has developed plans to hold our input costs increases below 2%. Having covered the key components of the P&L, let's turn to the cash flow.
As you can see, another strong performance in operating free cash flow at $438 million this quarter. Driving this performance were further improvements in working capital management. Capital expenditures are 2.7% of sales, in line with our plans to increase investments in Project Keystone. The $135 million this year for acquisitions relates to the purchase of Foodstar, and dividends reflect a 7.1% increase we announced in June.
Now let's briefly review our results for the first nine months of the year. Looking at our P&L scorecard, all of our key measures compare favorably to last year on both a reported and constant-currency basis. Focusing on the constant currency growth, net sales grew 2.5%, driven by our Top 15 brands which outpaced the company average, growing 4.2% organically.
Our gross profit margin was up around 80 basis points, as higher net pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs. Consumer marketing was up 2.3% to just over $300 million.
Operating income increased 6.1%, while increasing investments in both marketing and Keystone. At $2.37, EPS was up almost 8% on a constant-currency basis, while the dilution from higher shares outstanding was roughly offset by a 110 basis point decline in our effective tax rate, which came in at 26%.
Updating the slide I showed you for the quarter to reflect year-to-date impact of currency indicates an $0.08 unfavorable impact as the effects headwinds in the first half were more substantial than recent trends.
On a year-to-date basis, organic sales improved 2.1%, with balance support from volume and price. And the same is true for the Emerging Markets, which grew over 15%.
The volume increase reflects growth in the Emerging Markets, as well as improvements in North American Consumer Products and the U.K. businesses. These were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice and Australia.
Pricing was favorable 1%, largely due to Latin America and U.S. Foodservice, while NACP reduced net price as a result of increased trade spending for the Consumer Value Program which began late last year. The Foodstar acquisition added about 0.5 a point to sales growth, while currency cost us nearly 2% at the sales line.
Looking at the year-to-date balance sheet scorecard, capital expenditures of $195 million were 2.5% of sales, up 60 basis points from last year, but still favorable to our 3% full-year estimate.
Cash conversion cycle was 44 days, down six days, driven by improvements in all three measures. Operating free cash flow was up almost $100 million from last year, approaching $1 billion through nine months. This performance supports the increase in our full-year estimate to $1.2 billion.
Net debt to EBITDA was 0.5x better, driven by lower net debt and higher earnings. ROIC was 19.3%, up 1.1% from this time last year. This excludes the impact of losses from discontinued operations in the prior year of about 80 basis points.
And finally, looking at the year-to-date cash flow, the increase versus prior year was due to higher earnings and reduced pension contributions, as well as improvements in payables and income taxes. These increases were partially offset by declines in receivables, largely due to the cash received last year in connection with an accounts receivable securitization program.
In addition, last year we received $75 million from closing out swap contracts and the maturity of foreign currency contracts. In summary, an overall solid performance for sales, cash and earnings. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full-year outlook."

Now with three quarters done this year, I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 million",446,"Thanks, Ed. Now with three quarters done this year, I'd like to update our outlook for the full year. 
As Bill discussed at CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year, from $295 million to $305 million, to now $304 million to  $310 million. This reflects better-than-expected currency dynamics for the year and improved operating performance. Now it's important to note that these projections do not include any one-time costs associated with closing the Quero deal in Brazil. To the extent that the deal closes in this fiscal year, we could incur about $0.03 of transaction-related costs.
Bill also announced that we expect to deliver $1.2 billion in operating free cash flow for the year. This would be up $200 million from our original target and an all-time record for Heinz. 
And turning to revenue, we've mentioned through the year that we thought our sales goal was the most challenging part of our outlook, and expect it to come in at the low end of the range. We now believe that constant currency sales growth for the year will be between 2% and 3% due to the impact of a month-long labor stoppage at our main plants in Venezuela, and slower than expected recovery in U.S. Foodservice industry. 
The good news is that union employees are now back on the job in Venezuela, and we are back at the bargaining table to work toward a mutually beneficial agreement there.
Looking at Q4, we expect to make a number of investments to continue to fuel future growth. The first is the launch of nine SKUs of T.G.I. Friday's single-serve meals that we previewed at CAGNY. As Bill noted, our retail partners are excited about the coming launch, and believe that the new products could help jump start the category.
The second is to launch an ongoing expansion of Dip & Squeeze in Foodservice. The third is our continuing investment in Project Keystone as we drive stronger processes, consistent with capabilities across the company; and the fourth is investment in our new acquisitions. We are already moving quickly to improve capabilities and enhanced marketing in our Foodstar business.
In summary, the business is continuing to perform well in challenging times. Our top line performance is driven by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. Our bottom line continues to benefit from our culture of strict operational discipline, and we are on track to deliver our full-year earnings and cash flow targets. And we're continuing to build a runway for further growth as we invest for the future.
With that, now we'll open it up for your questions."

And so I think from that perspective, I think SG&A is a line that you will continue to see move up until we get Keystone fully implemented and rolled out.

I think the other thing you have to keep in context is, that in those markets, unlike the Developed Markets, you're also seeing wages and salaries lifted in concert with the increased impact of inflation. That's the benefit of markets that are growing, as opposed to markets that are static with high levels of unemployment. So thus far, it has not been an issue. Now the UN tries to make an issue out of some of this stuff by talking at a macro business about staple products in some cases like wheat, flour, sugar, rice. But from our standpoint and the targets we reach predominantly, the middle-class and up, it has not been an issue thus far. I'm not saying it won't be, I'm just telling you thus far, we have not seen it."

One, this business is virtually half of its business in tomato processing, and tomato products, which is something obviously, we bring great global capability and expertise in. So from that standpoint, it's right down our lane. The second big piece of it are vegetables, jarred, canned vegetables, which we do in New Zealand, which we do in Australia, which we do in Poland, which we do in a number of markets. And we think there's substantial cross opportunities. The market itself, GDP growth has been 10% to 15% over the last, say, five or six years on average with the exception, obviously, of the one bad year for all of us. We expect it to be about 7% to 10% going forward. While the infrastructure is not where we would like it to be in Brazil, it is actually better than some of the other Emerging Markets we're in, and we have a lot of experience in Venezuela that we find very applicable to Brazil. What we do like, it's got great growing areas. It's also got significant opportunities and upped the trade for us, because the business we're buying is predominantly down the trade and we're going to push into up the trade. The emerging trade there between Carrefour and Wal-Mart is becoming a much bigger piece. The middle class is growing rapidly among the 200 million people. This business has been around 25 or 26 years, and has been growing at a compound average rate between 10% and 15%, despite very little marketing and despite no up the trade presence. So from our standpoint, we find Brazil to be a market we've spent a lot of time learning about, we understand the infrastructure. This company has a world-class distribution base, which was very important to us in the new warehouse and distribution center they've built. They've got actually state-of-the-art ponds in front for wastewater removal. And so it is a really fantastic fit. And we find that the environment, particularly given the size of some of the cities like São Paulo and Rio and so forth, in some ways, better for us and more conducive. But I want to be clear, we have spent a lot of time looking at Brazil, studying Brazil, understanding Brazil before we made a move like this. But I think Brazil, in some ways because of the stability of their economic system and the government they have in place even with the recent presidential change, is a market that we feel very confident and comfortable going into. And as you know, the currency has strengthened precipitously, as have most of the Emerging Market currencies like the rupee and the renminbi. But the real has strengthened, even in the last several weeks, and is now BRL 1.65, BRL 1.66. So market, we're very comfortable with infrastructure-wise and talent-wise."

One, as I said at CAGNY last week, we have never seen more opportunities than we're seeing now, and we've been very selective, as I've also indicated last week, about our choices. Foodstar is a business that fits right in the middle of our heartland core category of condiments and sauces. Quero is virtually the same thing, Meals & Snacks and condiments and sauces, particularly with its strong Ketchup business, its strong Pasta Sauce business, and its Tomato Sauce businesses. And so I think you'll continue to see us focus on those areas and in those core categories. I do think that there are a number of lessons. And frankly, we probably don't have enough time to articulate them. But the key thing is buy a good brand. And in Brazil, by the way, the Quero brand is virtually 100% of the sales that I mentioned at the outset, which means it will move into our Top 15 brands next year. Foodstar has two brands in Guanghe and Master. And so as you look, we're trying to buy concentrated brands, buying good management. The second thing we're trying to do is not buy businesses that have been grown simply through SKU proliferation. Interestingly enough, the Quero business, which is $325 million right now, has about 100 SKUs. The Foodstar business has less than 40 SKUs, so we're trying to find really focused businesses with strong growth prospects with good manufacturing capabilities. The things we've learned are you have to put management in immediately so that they can learn the business. Because ultimately, the owners that sell these businesses decide that they'd rather go do other things, or they lose interest. So you need to get management in quickly. You need to bring financial processes and discipline in. And the biggest lesson we've learned and it's one we probably should have known but we really learned a lot of it through China this year, is you have to get your investments upfront. Not only in capital but in marketing. And in some of our businesses, we probably waited too long in our zeal to try to sort of balance the profit hit from these businesses from a dilution accretion standpoint, rather than investing aggressively upfront like we're doing in Foodstar which, as Art said, we're running difficultly on capacity, although the new factory will be up in a couple of months and we'll do the same thing here. So the biggest lesson: Good management, focused portfolios, strong brands, good infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and invest upfront, don't wait."

The innovation activity we're seeing in Europe and across the company, the continued performance of growth in the Emerging Markets, which we expect to be every bit as good next year as this year.

I mean, they are a strong company. The brands we bought, the brand we bought, is number one and number two in virtually every category from a volume standpoint, and only two categories falls below that from a dollar sales standpoint curve, I mean, the value standpoint. So I think the reality is that management, investment, processing capability, technical health and then the launch of some businesses, either the import of those businesses or local production of those businesses or the export of some of the businesses. I want to make one comment about their business that's going to be very interesting to watch in our company. They have uniquely developed a tetra pack package of Beanz and they've got about three or four varieties in tetra pack beans, something we've struggled to do as a company over the last decade or so. And so we can take some of that knowledge and that know how, particularly with tetra, they are way ahead of us in terms of working with tetra as a company, and we can apply that knowledge elsewhere in our organization. So this is another example of a two-way street between an Emerging Market business that's actually got factual basis to help us improve in other areas of our company, while we help them."

Secondly, if you look at two of our major cores, I mean, you talk about the core, but our top 15 brands have been growing very robustly at around 4% organically year-to-date, and Ketchup is up around 5% organically year-to-date. So those two businesses, the top 15 brands which were 70% of the sales of the company and generally are our better mix items and Ketchup, which is not generally our better mix item, but is really among the best in the company, are all continuing to do well. And clearly, we've got an issue this quarter with soup in Europe between Germany and the U.K. and I just pointed out that the softness in Australia and New Zealand in the quarter. And I think fundamentally, you back out Venezuela in Foodservice and we show better results. But the areas we focus on most, the top 15 brands, Emerging Markets and Ketchup are all doing very well, and that's really where the focus is. And so I would expect over time, the top 15, or the top 16, or 17 brands, that 70% number could grow and increase in its level of importance, which is good for the shareholders and good for us. And so that's really where the focus is. So while I'm not obviously ecstatic about the performance in the developed markets, the slide did point emerging versus developed, it did not point out emerging versus top 15 brands and versus Ketchup, which as I said, is doing very well."

We're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance where we posted solid results in a very difficult environment.

We're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance where we posted solid results in a very difficult environment. This morning, we will be presenting our P&L, excluding special items which you recall from our Analyst Day the one-time charges for productivity initiatives, planned for this fiscal year. Overall, the quarter slightly exceeded our expectations despite the tough economy in Developed Markets and more challenged U.S. consumer, all of which has been headline news in July and August. 
For the quarter, we grew revenue at a double-digit pace, posted solid organic sales growth driven by our trio of growth engines, the top 15 brands, Emerging Markets and global ketchup. We achieved excellent growth from our new acquisitions Foodstar in China and China and Brazil. Increased marketing and stepped-up investment in the business, including Project Keystone, our European supply chain hub and other capability-building initiatives and we weathered a very tough commodity cost comparison. In short, we're off to a solid start for the year while continuing to adapt our strategies and tactics to meet the changing consumer dynamic. 
In terms of key P&L metrics, sales grew nearly 15%. Operating income increased by a point and EPS rose 4%. We'll take you through the detail behind the numbers but these results included solid base business performance, the benefit of favorable currency and the impact of the acquisitions we made late last fiscal year, which are off to a very strong start. 
But before getting into the specifics, I want to profile some of the key themes running through the first quarter results. These include strong top-line growth from Emerging Markets, global ketchup, top 15 brand, acquisitions and currency. Price increases across our portfolio, which still lag very high commodity inflation. Increased SG&A, reflecting our aggressive investments in marketing and business-building capabilities, a slightly lower tax rate driven by a decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate, approximately 3 million more shares outstanding and a foreign currency tailwind in our key markets, all of these combined to generate solid EPS growth on an x items basis. 
Turning to organic sales, our Emerging Markets once again drove the majority of the organic sales increase, posting 13% growth for the quarter. And on a constant currency basis, sales in Emerging Markets were up nearly 4%, including recent acquisitions. 
Developed Markets generated organic growth as well, led by Europe, Japan and Canada. Europe delivered positive volume and net price growth, with organic sales up almost 5% led by the U.K. and Continental Europe. 
Australia continues to be a difficult market for us. And in the U.S. Foodservice business, we saw a weakening trend in restaurant traffic, particularly in July. Excluding these 2 businesses, organic sales growth in Developed Markets was a healthy 3% and total company organic growth would have been nearly 5%. 
Importantly, this quarter marks our 25th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, which speaks to the strength of our brands and the adaptability of our business in these challenging times. 
And speaking of our brands, you'll notice the Quero our recent acquisition in Brazil and Master, which is part of the Foodstar acquisition in China are now included in our Top 15 Brands, collectively our top 15 now make up nearly 3/4 of our portfolio and posted what we are calling internal growth of 6.5% for the quarter. For comparability, this metric includes an estimate of prior year sales for the acquired businesses from the time before we owned them. Note also that 5 of our Top 15 Brands are now emerging market brands. 
Turning to our 3 core categories on a constant currency basis, ketchup and sauces set the pace in the quarter with nearly 14% growth, driven by global ketchup and boosted by the addition of Foodstar and Quero. The category also delivered strong growth in Asian sauces in Indonesia and pasta sauces in North America. Organically, sales for our ketchup and sauces category were up 7%. 
Meals and snacks grew by more than 3% driven by the Quero acquisition and strong growth in soup and beans in the U.K. This was partially offset by weakness in our U.S. frozen potato business, reflecting the impact of recent pricing actions. And infant nutrition grew by 5% virtually all in Emerging Markets which grew at a rate of 15% in the quarter. This growth was led by Venezuela, China, India and Russia. 
Our Emerging Markets continue to grow in importance to Heinz, both organically and propositions and accounted for around 23% of sales in this quarter. We are delighted with our newest acquisitions Quero and Foodstar, which together accounted for about 4% of total company sales. 
Quero had a big impact on our rest of world region, hoping to double sales in that segment. Since we close the Quero acquisition on April 1, we've been busy integrating the business and positioning it for growth. Previously, top-line growth had been limited by production capacity, which prevented geographic expansion in a greater portion of the modern trade. We've made some progress against these opportunities, while also implementing a small company version of SAP. This month, we began distributing Heinz products through Quero sales and distribution network and are planning on producing these products locally over time though the team in Brazil has been very busy. 
As you know, this is the first quarter in which Quero has been included in our results and although new acquisitions are not part of organic growth, using our internal sales growth metric, the team drove 8% sales growth, including more than 20% growth in our core tomato product business. While doing all the integration activities and implementing SAP. So we are very pleased with that start. 
We are also delighted with Foodstar, which we expect to help us reach almost 350 million in sales in China this year. We've owned Foodstar for 9 months now and it's grown more than 20% versus the comparable period in the prior year. We've added more soy manufacturing capacity and are expanding the Master brand into a third province. As a result, Master now serves a total market population of 175 million people, leaving only another billion or so consumers in China to go. 
We are also launching Foodstar's first new products in more than 2 years, giving us a premium presence in all 3 of the largest soy sauce segments in China. Those are lights, dark and soy sauce. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, the growth in our infant nutrition category has been driven by Emerging Markets. We've been winning in these markets with trusted brands, functional innovations like shampoo in China and in India, increased marketing investment and a relentless focus on quality and taste. 
Turning now to Global Ketchup, we are very pleased with 8% organic growth in ketchup for the quarter while lapping the well-known dollar ketchup promotion that ran at our largest customer in the U.S. throughout most of the first quarter last year. Growth was driven around the globe led like Venezuela, U.S. Foodservice, North American consumer products and Europe, with a notable contribution from China as well. 
Now let's take a quick spin around the world of Heinz. We'll start with North American consumer products. Q1 brought fresh economic uncertainty and more challenges for the U.S. consumer. Debt ceiling debates, the downgrade of U.S. Treasury obligations, weak employment and housing markets and wild volatility in the stock market also to make consumers here very nervous. This context, constant currency sales were flat for the quarter, as favorable pricing offset an equal volume loss. This also reflects the lapping of last year's dollar ketchup promotion and the phaseout of Boston Market in the quarter, which on a combined basis, reduces sales growth rate by about 2 points. 
During the quarter, we completed our planned price increases and reduced promotional spending across the U.S. business. These actions in addition, to our aggressive productivity initiatives, helped us cover the dollar impact of very high commodity inflation and kept gross margin nearly flat. 
Operating income was down slightly for the quarter, reflecting the increased commodity costs and also higher fuel costs for the delivery of our products. 
U.S. consumer confidence hit a new low in August. This result was even lower than the depths of the great recession of the first quarter of 2009, and in fact the lowest level since 1980. As a result, U.S. consumers are reacting by cutting back on discretionary spending, shoppers are using coupons more often, cutting back on waste and paying more on closer attention to what they buy. We are closely monitoring our pricing and product mix to optimize volume and profitability in this environment and working to reach both sides of today's bifurcated Consumer Group. 
As you know, we built a track record of successful innovation in North America. We've introduced products that have expanded our sales and market share while building and bringing interest to our categories. We are continuing to build on this foundation and are driving for even greater efficiency in the production of these products, some of which are now being produced in our new state-of-the-art frozen product factory in Florence, South Carolina, which opened earlier this month. 
In FY '12 we had another strong pipeline of innovation. We are moving into nutritional dinner day part with our Smart Ones bagged meals and extending the T.G.I. Friday's brand in the restaurant quality singleserve entrees. Both of these launches are going as planned, with new TGIF commercial on air, as of July. 
In Ketchup, the 10-pack of dip and squeeze with you start a show up on retail shelves this month and we've launched the more sustainable land bottle, partnership with the Coca-Cola Company. We're also expanding our classical line with Mexican and Italian inspired white sauces, as well as a new pizza sauce. And we're launching 2 new versions of our very successful category-leading sweet potato fries. 
Turning to Foodservice in the U.S. sales in the quarter tracked underlying environment where 1% sales decrease is favorable pricing did not quite offset the impact of lower volume. With the recent economic news and higher gas prices, we saw restaurant traffic trends change in the quarter from flat to down within our existing customer base. 
During the quarter, we implemented a second set of price increases to offset commodity inflation. But due to the timing of national account contrast, these price increases will take effect gradually over the coming months. As a result, pricing is not yet caught up with significant commodity inflation and gross margin was down by 50 basis points. Higher fuel costs and S&D also impacted operating income for the quarter. 
Importantly, Ketchup sales were up 5% in the U.S. Foodservice this quarter despite the declines in customer traffic. Here, our innovation is working to offset the environment, attracting customers to buy and consumers to use more of our ketchup. 
Dip and squeeze has been a key element in this equation in to date has replaced about 10% of our sachet volume. We continue to build this distribution of product in Foodservice. And as mentioned providing more usage opportunities for dip and squeeze through U.S. retail and are now introducing the product into Canada. The plant bottle is also been a couple there item with restaurants and now are present about 70% of our restaurant tabletop Ketchup business. We've had over 1 million visits to our website, much of it is driven by mobile marketing from our tabletop bottle in the 4 short weeks since its introduction. 
Now crossing the pond, we posted strong sales and traffic growth in Europe despite a tough environment there which includes sovereign debt concerns, as 30 programs, civil unrest and very high unemployment in some countries. Organic sales were almost 5% including volume growth of more than 2% and pricing of almost 3%. These results were led by outstanding performance in U.K. where the team is selling more products off the shelf at both price. 
Our meals and value shares are growing across most of our U.K. business, showing that premium brands can still thrive in a difficult economy. We're also pleased with the results across much of Continental Europe and Russia, reflecting increased pricing innovation and impact of additional marketing investment.
Also driving a very aggressive change of agenda in Europe where we're investing in significant capabilities to drive further growth and efficiency, most notably Project Keystone and the European supply chain hub. Both implementations continue to progress and are going well. In sum, we're very pleased with our performance in Europe for the quarter. 
There's no shortage of innovation in Europe these days either, we recently launched an exciting better tasting new line of aseptic baby food in Italy and continue to extend our pack line of in the U.K. 
Also in the U.K., we are just launching 2 new great tasting unique innovations, squeeze and stir, which combines with hot water to make soup in a cup and Heinz Pasta Pouches, premium pasta meal that's portable, certain base will keep you posted on this exciting new products. 
Moving to Asia/Pacific, we have a tale of 2 cities. Results in the Asia and Emerging Markets were very strong, but results from developed specific markets were unfavorably impacted by poor performance in Australia. 
For the segment, constant currency sales grew 7% largely driven by the Foodstar acquisition and modest increase in overall organic sales. Operating income before the benefits of foreign exchange was down about 20%, reflecting a 2010 basis point decline in gross margin and increased investments in marketing and talent in Emerging Markets. For perspective, much of the decline in gross margin came from Australia, where we have appointed a new managing director and are attacking the cost structure to stabilize performance in what has become an inhospitable grocery market. 
For additional perspective on constant currency sales performance in the segment, you can see that Emerging Markets drove better than 20% growth driven primarily by infant nutrition in China,
In India, sweet soy and choice sauces in Indonesia and our acquisition of Foodstar. And the developed markets of New Zealand, Japan and Singapore posted solid aggregate growth, up 4% on a combined basis, led primarily by Japan. 
But Australia is the clear challenge for us in this segment, with constant currency sales down 8% for the quarter, again we're taking strong action to address our issues there. Within the Emerging Markets we continue to drive a strong results through an aggressive innovation agenda. Most recently, we just launched the pouch baby food in China, where we are the first company in that market with a pouch package and our infant formula business continues to build sharing key retailers, to methodically progress the rollout and supported of strong marketing investment to drive awareness and trial across our entire infant nutrition product line. In India, our.  Brand gained share this quarter driven the new product innovation including.
Memory, as well as.  Nutri Gro, our line of toddler meals which is now being sold nationally and a new be stab at that flavor of that recently entered lead markets, building on the success of the damper culture. 
Turning to the rest of the world, the addition of Quero and the return to labor stability and strong growth in Venezuela enabled this segment to double in size this quarter. In fact, operating income in the rest of the world caught up with the U.S. Foodservice in the quarter as we continue to push the mix of our business to high-growth markets. We're also pleased to see double-digit organic sales and operating income growth in the Middle East and in South Africa. 
Given the worsening economic uncertainty in Developed Markets, we continue to focus on maintaining strong operating discipline. We're taking the price increases necessary to offset inflation, cutting out on profitable trade promotions, increasing advertising support for our brands, cutting costs and carefully allocating capital. These choices will likely continue to have an effect on short-term volume, but are intended to preserve and expand margins for sustainable profit growth. 
Before I turn it over to Ed, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made in Project Keystone since we last met in May. Most recently, we completed the baseline work in the Netherlands and the Nordics, very successfully implemented the global solution in Belgium which is our first platform for transaction processing through the important European supply chain hub and implemented globally sourcing solution through SAP to help drive savings across the company. 
Looking forward, we are continuing the European rollout, moving in to North America starting with Canada, evaluating our options for accelerating progress in Asia/Pacific and developing an SAP solution for smaller markets. Overall, we are pleased with our progress and are on track with our plan for fiscal '12. With that, let me turn it over to Ed. Ed?"
278212,137465635,161441,"HJ Heinz Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2011",2011-08-23,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our Q1 results which reflects strong top-line performance and incremental investments to sustain that growth. Let's look first at the EPS.

I'll take you through our Q1 results which reflects strong top-line performance and incremental investments to sustain that growth. Let's look first at the EPS. 
As we announced in May, we're investing in productivity initiatives this year which we expect will make the company stronger and accelerating productivity on a global scale. We anticipate that for fiscal 2012, we will invest at least $116 million of pretax income, or $0.35 a share on these initiatives. As a result, we will be reporting our results in fiscal 2012 adjusting for these special charges. 
To summarize for Q1, EPS excluding these charges were $0.78, up 4%. This includes almost $0.02 of incremental costs for Project Keystone. As a reminder, we expect $0.08 of incremental cost from Project Keystone this fiscal year, which is not treated as a special item. 
Stripping out the $0.05 favorable impact from foreign currency this quarter, EPS excluding special items is $0.73, down $0.02 from last year. Finally, reported EPS was $0.70, which includes the charge of approximately $0.09 due to productivity initiatives we incurred in Q1. 
Here you can see the makeup of productivity charges we incurred so far and we are reflected in the P&L. Included in reported operating income is $15 million for severance and employee benefit costs relating to the reduction of the global workforce. $17 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of four factories. We're expecting to exit at least one more factory this year and evaluating several additional opportunities to reduce cost. $9 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees and relocation costs related to the establishment of the European supply chain hub. Overall, we reported charges of $41 million pretax, $31 million of which was recorded in Cost Of Goods Sold and $9 million in SG&A. The after-tax impact of these charges was $28 million, or $0.09 per share and the entire amount was reported in the nonoperating segment. 
We believe that our results, excluding these special charges provide the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance and we will use this benchmark for the rest of the financial discussion. 
Now let me focus on our P&L scorecard. With the benefit of a tailwind from currency, we were able to increase our investment in the long-term health of our business, while delivering operating income and EPS growth, despite a challenging global economy. 
Net sales grew by almost 15%, aided by the recent acquisitions, as well as currency. Organically, sales grew 3.1%, driven by pricing. Gross margin was 35.7%, with higher pricing and our productivity improvements, offsetting much of the commodity inflation. 
As we progressed through the year, we expect pricing and productivity to offset commodity cost increases, but this will build throughout the year and primarily in our second half. 
We continue to increase our investment in consumer marketing, particularly in our Emerging Markets and the U.K. Overall, marketing increased by almost 15% and 8%  on a constant currency basis. 
Operating income was up 1%, but on a constant currency basis, down 4.5%. Our incremental investments in marketing and Project Keystone alone, were the equivalent of over 6 points of potential profit growth that we chose to invest for the future. At $0.78, EPS was up 4%, but down 2.7% on a constant currency basis, as a result of our incremental investments. 
As you can see, both the pound and the euro are up substantially versus last year, which has a significant benefit to our European operations, which account for nearly 30% of global sales. To varying degrees, most of the markets we compete in have shown similar trends. 
Here you can see what those currency movements have meant to our P&L. With the currencies of almost all the countries we operate in showing substantial strength versus the U.S. dollar, both revenue and EPS show around a 7% lift from the exchange. Since our foreign operations that lower gross margins than our domestic businesses, the translation benefit to overall P&L does cause a 20 basis points reduction in average gross margin. 
Continuing with a more detailed look at the P&L, I'll touch on some of the items not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up 12% and 6% on a constant currency basis, with about 2/3 of the growth from acquisitions. Although these acquisitions contributed to gross profit dollars, they did reduce company-wide gross margins by 40 basis points. 
SG&A was up 15% on a constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, investments in Project Keystone, as well as higher distribution costs due to fuel prices. Other SG&A costs in our Developed Markets were virtually flat, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls, while we continue to add resources in our Emerging Markets. 
Operating income was up slightly from last year, while investing nearly $25 million in incremental marketing and Keystone spending to drive growth. Net interest and other expense improved by $10 million primarily due to decreased currency losses, while we continue to benefit from low interest rates. 
The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 24% compared to 25.3% last year, primarily due to a statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K. This year will likely show quarter-to-quarter volatility in the tax rate. We currently anticipate a rate in the low 20s for Q2 and an overall rate for the year roughly in line with last year's tax rate. 
Finally, shares outstanding are up in the first quarter by about 1%, but we expect the full year impact of shares outstanding to be neutral. 
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as I mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 3.1%. Price improvements, particularly in Venezuela, the U.S. and the U.K. drove overall price by 3.8%, while volume declined 0.7% as increased volume in the Emerging Markets, as well as the U.K., Continental Europe, Canada and Japan, were more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Australia. Overall, the Emerging Markets led to sales growth, driving 13% organically and representing 23% of total company sales. The acquisitions of Foodstar and Quero contributed 4.6% to overall sales growth and finally, foreign exchange added 7.2% to our top line. As noted earlier, our gross margin declined 90 basis points to 35.7%. In isolation, market prices for commodities would have cost us over 350 basis points for the quarter, but strong contributions from pricing and productivity, offset much of this inflation. The impact of the acquisitions accounted for about 1/2 of the gross margin decline versus last year. 
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in almost all of our significant inputs, particularly sweeteners, oils, dairy and resin. The overall result has been a market inflation for the quarter of around 8%. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 2.6% of sales, up 40 basis points from the prior year, with a higher spending rate expected for the balance of this year. 
Operating free cash flow of $97 million was down $120 million from last year, largely due to the timing of payables. Net debt to EBITDA improved 2.1x driven by lower net debt and I'm pleased to say that S&P recently raised the company's debt rating to a BBB+. 
ROIC was 18.8%, down 20 basis points from this time last year. However, the base business continues to improve, as the recent Brazilian acquisition reduced the company's overall ROIC by 60 basis points. We should recover over time as profits in Quero continue to build. 
As I mentioned earlier, operating free cash flow was down $120 million versus last year. This reflects lower earnings as a result of the productivity initiatives and increased GWC requirements, particularly in payables. Included in our results was $10 million of outflow for the productivity initiatives. 
I touched on the $75 million of capital expenditures earlier and dividends reflect the 6.7% increase we announced in May. 
Finally, net treasury stock purchase is up $44 million reflect the acquisition of 1.6 million shares of stock at a total cost of $87 million. 
In summary, our performance for this quarter is slightly better than our expectations and reflects the planned incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full year outlook."

And just a couple of remarks before opening it up to your question.  Importantly, we are reaffirming our FY '12 outlook. This reflects our confidence in a number of actions we've taken and planning to take to yield a stronger second half. These actions include more flow-through of pricing, continuing innovation, productivity initiatives, cost containment actions and tax planning, all of these are expected to allow us to continue our aggressive investment programs while delivering our bottom line target. 
While currency is tracking positively on a year-over-year basis, it's too early to adjust our full year ForEx outlook. And just a quick comment on the shape of the profit curve for the year. Expected to be a bit atypical with stronger second half benefited by the timing of pricing and prior year ketchup promotions in the U.S., improving productivity and less owner commodity cost comparisons. And for Q2, we expect EPS to be in line with or just slightly higher than prior year, due to the timing of pricing, the phaseout of Boston market, difficult commodity cost overlap and continued tough conditions in U.S. Foodservice in Australia, offset by a favorable tax rate. Beyond the second quarter, EPS is expected to build sequentially. 
So to sum up, our Q1 reflects continued solid performance in a challenging environment. Our key growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 Brands and Global Ketchup are producing strong and consistent growth. We have strong operating discipline, which will keep us focused on making the right volume, profit trade-offs and to address our challenges in Australia. Overall, it's still early in what's shaping up to be another interesting year, but we're confident in our brand, people, skills and ability to respond to the consumer as she reacts to world events.

What we are seeing is there's a portion of the population that has a very limited amount of funds and we estimate somewhere between $40 and $50 a week to feed a family of 4, which is really stark when you go to the grocery store and you realize how tight that is. Value to that particular consumer is something completely different than mainstream or affluent and value to that consumer is a price point. It doesn't matter what the cost of per ounce in the matter is I if I can afford to buy even a portion of that this week and having small sizes, convenient sizes, convenient channels, convenience stores, pharmacies, dollar stores, quick small trips that are close to home as opposed to going out for the big loads at the supercenter. So there is a very different behavior that's occurring in fact we are almost saying it's almost a trifurcation, if you will, because we are seeing a consumer that is truly struggling and value means something different. Our core portfolio in the U.S. tends to skew towards the more affluent. So you see Heinz products doing very well across mainstream, across the affluent and the club stores, et cetera. There is a huge opportunity for us and we see it. We originally anticipated more of a recovery scenario. Now that we're seeing things get tightening again, we are looking very hard. We had a lot of plans we're looking at it for, a lot of ideas so these are things close and ready to go that we want to execute quickly, but we're going to make sure we hit it right by getting into the right channels, getting into the right size and format for a different consumer, and we want to make sure we are appealing abroad. In Europe, across our other Developed Markets, are very similar stories and so our brands across Europe are very strong and particularly in the U.K. and it's something we've been working on a Master-branded campaign across the U.K. to let  the consumer note that we are therefore them and have worked very hard to go to shore up brand equity, but to make sure that we've got right serving sizes.

We're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance where we posted solid results in a very difficult environment. This morning, we will be presenting our P&L, excluding special items which you'll recall from our Analyst Day, are the onetime charges for productivity initiatives, planned for this fiscal year. Overall, the quarter slightly exceeded our expectations despite the tough economy in Developed Markets and a more challenged U.S. consumer, all of which has been headline news in July and August. 
For the quarter, we grew revenue at a double-digit pace. Posted solid organic sales growth driven by our trio of growth engines, the Top 15 brands, Emerging Markets and Global Ketchup. We achieved excellent growth from our newest acquisitions Foodstar in China and Quero in Brazil. Increased marketing and stepped-up investment in the business, including Project Keystone, our European supply chain hub and other capability building initiatives, and we weathered a very tough commodity cost comparison. In short, we're off to a solid start to the year while continuing to adapt our strategies and tactics to meet the changing consumer dynamic. 
In terms of key P&L metrics, sales grew nearly 15%. Operating income increased by 1 point and EPS rose 4%. We'll take you through the detail behind the numbers, but these results included solid base business performance, the benefit of favorable currency and the impact of the acquisitions we made late last fiscal year, which are off to a very strong start. 
But before getting into the specifics, I want to profile some of the key themes running through the first quarter results. These include strong top line growth from Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup, Top 15 brand, acquisitions and currency. Price increases across our portfolio, which still lag very high commodity inflation. Increased SG&A, reflecting our aggressive investments in marketing and business-building capabilities. A slightly lower tax rate, driven by a decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate. Approximately 3 million more shares outstanding and a foreign currency tailwind in our key markets. All of these combined to generate solid EPS growth on an X-items basis. 
Turning to organic sales, our Emerging Markets once again drove the majority of the organic sales increase, posting 13% growth for the quarter. And on a constant currency basis, sales in Emerging Markets were up nearly 40%, including recent acquisitions. 
Developed Markets generated organic growth as well, led by Europe, Japan and Canada. Europe delivered positive volume and net price growth, with organic sales up almost 5% led by the U.K. and Continental Europe. 
Australia continues to be a difficult market for us. And in the U.S. Foodservice business, we saw a weakening trend in restaurant traffic, particularly in July. Excluding these 2 businesses, organic sales growth in Developed Markets was a healthy 3% and total company organic growth would have been nearly 5%.
Importantly, this quarter marks our 25th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, which speaks to the strength of our brands and the adaptability of our business in these challenging times. 
And speaking of our brands, you'll notice that Quero our recent acquisition in Brazil, and Master, which is part of the Foodstar acquisition in China, are now included in our Top 15 Brands. Collectively our top 15 now make up nearly 3/4 of our portfolio and posted what we are calling internal growth of 6.5% for the quarter. For comparability, this metric includes an estimate of prior year sales for the acquired businesses from the time before we owned them. Note also that 5 of our Top 15 Brands are now emerging market brands. 
Turning to our 3 core categories on a constant currency basis, Ketchup and Sauces set the pace in the quarter with nearly 14% growth, driven by Global Ketchup and boosted by the addition of Foodstar and Quero. The category also delivered strong growth in Asian sauces in Indonesia and in pasta sauce in North America. Organically, sales for our Ketchup and Sauces category were up 7%. 
Meals and Snacks grew by more than 3% driven by the Quero acquisition and strong growth in soup and beans in the U.K. This was partially offset by weakness in our U.S. frozen potato business, reflecting the impact of recent pricing actions. And Infant/Nutrition grew by 5% virtually all in Emerging Markets, which grew at a rate of 15% in the quarter. This growth was led by Venezuela, China, India and Russia. 
Our Emerging Markets continue to grow in importance to Heinz, both organically and through acquisitions propositions, and accounted for around 23% of sales in this quarter. We're delighted with our newest acquisitions Quero and Foodstar, which together accounted for about 4% of total company sales. 
Quero had a big impact on our Rest of World region, hoping to double sales in that segment. Since we closed the Quero acquisition on April 1, we've been busy integrating the business and positioning it for growth. Previously, top line growth had been limited by production capacity, which prevented geographic expansion in a greater portion of the modern trade. We've made some real progress against these opportunities, while also implementing a small company version of SAP. This month, we began distributing Heinz products through Quero's sales and distribution network, and are planning on producing these products locally over time, through the team in Brazil has been very busy. 
As you know, this is the first quarter in which Quero has been included in our results, and although new acquisitions are not part of organic growth, using our internal sales growth metric, the team drove 8% sales growth, including more than 20% growth in our core tomato product business. While doing all the integration activities and implementing SAP, so we're very pleased with that start. 
We are also delighted with Foodstar, which we expect to help us reach almost 350 million in sales in China this year. We've owned Foodstar for 9 months now, and it's grown more than 20% versus the comparable period in the prior year. We've added more soy manufacturing capacity and are expanding the Master brand into a third province. As a result, Master now serves a total market population of 175 million people, leaving only another billion-or-so consumers in China to go. 
We're also launching Foodstar's first new products in more than 2 years, giving us a premium presence in all 3 of the largest soy sauce segments in China. Those are light, dark and Weijixian soy sauce. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, the growth in our infant nutrition category has been driven by Emerging Markets. We've been winning in these markets with trusted brands; functional innovations like Qingdao [ph] in China and Complan Memory in India; increased marketing investments; and a relentless focus on quality and taste. 
Turning now to Global Ketchup, we're very pleased with 8% organic growth in ketchup for the quarter while lapping the well-known dollar ketchup promotion that ran at our largest customer in the U.S. throughout most of the first quarter last year. Growth was driven around the globe led like Venezuela, U.S. Foodservice, North American consumer products and Europe, with a notable contribution from China as well.
Now let's take a quick spin around the world of Heinz. We'll start with North American consumer products. Q1 brought fresh economic uncertainty and more challenges for the U.S. consumer. Debt ceiling debates, the downgrade of U.S. Treasury obligations, weak employment and housing markets and wild volatility in the stock market also serve to make consumers here very nervous. In this context, constant currency sales were flat for the quarter, as favorable pricing offset an equal volume loss. This also reflects the lapping of last year's dollar ketchup promotion and the phaseout of Boston Market in the quarter, which on a combined basis, reduced the sales growth rate by about 2 points. 
During the quarter, we completed our planned price increases and reduced promotional spending across the U.S. business. These actions, in addition to our aggressive productivity initiatives, helped us cover the dollar impact of very high commodity inflation and kept gross margin nearly flat. 
Operating income was down slightly for the quarter, reflecting the increased commodity costs and also higher fuel costs for the delivery of our products. 
U.S. consumer confidence hit a new low in August. This result was even lower than in the depths of the great recession of the first quarter of 2009, and in fact, is at the lowest level since 1980. As a result, U.S. consumers are reacting by cutting back on discretionary spending, shoppers are using coupons more often, cutting back on waste and paying more on closer attention to what they buy. We're closely monitoring our pricing and product mix to optimize volume and profitability in this environment and working to reach both sides of today's bifurcated consumer group. 
As you know, we built a track record of successful innovation in North America. We've introduced products that have expanded our sales and market share while building and bringing interest to our categories. We are continuing to build on this foundation and are driving for even greater efficiency in the production of these products, some of which are now being produced in our new state-of-the-art frozen product factory in Florence, South Carolina, which opened earlier this month. 
In FY '12, we had another strong pipeline of innovation. We're moving further into the nutritional dinner day part with our Smart Ones bagged meals and extending the T.G.I. Friday's brand in the restaurant quality Single-Serve entrees. Both of these launches are going as planned, with new T.G.I.F. commercials on air, as of mid-July. 
In Ketchup, the 10-pack of Dip & Squeeze is starting to show up on retail shelves this month, and we've launched the more sustainable PlantBottle, part of our partnership with the Coca-Cola Company. We're also expanding our Classico line with Mexican and Italian inspired white sauces, as well as a new pizza sauce. And we're launching 2 new versions of our very successful category leading Sweet Potato fries. 
Turning to Foodservice in the U.S., sales in the quarter tracked to the underlying environment, where 1% sales decreases, favorable pricing did not quite offset the impact of lower volume. With the recent economic news and higher gas prices, we saw restaurant traffic trends change in the quarter from flat to down within our existing customer base. 
During the quarter, we implemented a second set of price increases to offset commodity inflation. But due to the timing of national account contracts, these price increases will take effect gradually over the coming months. As a result, pricing has not yet caught up with significant commodity inflation and gross margin was down by 50 basis points. Higher fuel costs and S&D also impacted operating income for the quarter. 
Importantly, Ketchup sales were up 5% in U.S. Foodservice this quarter, despite the declines in customer traffic. Here, our innovation is working to offset the environment, attracting customers to buy and consumers to use more of our ketchup. Dip & Squeeze has been a key element in this equation, and to date has replaced about 10% of our sachet volume. 
We continue to build this distribution of the product in Foodservice. And as mentioned, we're providing more usage opportunities for Dip & Squeeze through U.S. retail and are now introducing the product into Canada. The PlantBottle has also been a popular item with restaurants and now are represents about 70% of our restaurant tabletop Ketchup business. We've had over 1 million visits to our website, much of it is driven by mobile marketing from our tabletop bottle in the 4 short weeks since introduction. 
Now crossing the pond. We posted strong sales and traffic growth in Europe despite a tough environment there which includes sovereign debt concerns, austerity programs, civil unrest and very high unemployment in some countries. Organic sales were almost 5%, including volume growth of more than 2% and pricing of almost 3%. These results were led by an outstanding performance in U.K., where the team is selling more products off the shelf at full price. 
Our meals and value shares are growing across most of our U.K. business, showing that premium brands can still thrive in a difficult economy. We're also pleased with the sales results across much of Continental Europe and Russia, reflecting increased pricing, innovation and impact of additional marketing investment.
Also driving a very aggressive change agenda in Europe, where we're investing in significant capabilities to drive further growth and efficiency, most notably Project Keystone and the European supply chain hub. Both implementations continue to progress and are going well. In sum, we're very pleased with our performance in Europe for the quarter. 
There's no shortage of innovation in Europe these days either, we recently launched an exciting, better tasting new line of aseptic baby food in Italy and continue to extend our Fridge Pack line of Beanz in the U.K. 
Also in the U.K., we're just launching 2 new great tasting unique innovations, Squeeze & Stir, which combines with hot water to make soup in a cup, and Heinz Pasta Pouches, a premium pasta meal that is portable. It's early days, but we'll keep you posted on these exciting new products. 
Moving to Asia Pacific, we have a tale of 2 cities. Results in the Asia and Emerging Markets were very strong, but results from developed Pacific markets were unfavorably impacted by poor performance in Australia. 
For the segment, constant currency sales grew 7% largely driven by the Foodstar acquisition and a modest increase in overall organic sales. Operating income before the benefits of foreign exchange was down about 20%, reflecting a 210-basis point decline in gross margin and increased investments in marketing and talent in Emerging Markets. For perspective, much of the decline in gross margin came from Australia, where we have appointed a new managing director, and are attacking the cost structure to stabilize performance in what has become an inhospitable grocery market. 
For additional perspective on constant currency sales performance in the segment, you can see that Emerging Markets drove better than 20% growth driven primarily by Infant/Nutrition in China, Complan in India, sweet soy and chili sauces in Indonesia, and our acquisition of Foodstar. And the developed markets of New Zealand, Japan and Singapore posted solid aggregate growth, up 4% on a combined basis, led primarily by Japan.
But Australia is the clear challenge for us in this segment, with constant currency sales down 8% for the quarter, again we're taking strong action to address our issues there. Within the Emerging Markets we continue to drive strong results through an aggressive innovation agenda. Most recently, we just launched the pouch baby food in China, where we are the first company in that market with a pouch package. And our infant formula business continues to build share in key retailers, as we methodically progress the rollout and support it with strong marketing investments and drive awareness and trial across our entire Infant/Nutrition product line. In India, our Complan brand gained share this quarter, driven the new product innovation including Complan Memory, as well as Complan Nutri-Gro, our line of toddler meals which is now being sold nationally and a new Pista Badam flavor of Complan that recently entered lead markets, building on the success of Kesar Badam. 
Turning to the rest of the world, the addition of Quero and the return to labor stability and strong growth in Venezuela enabled this segment to double in size this quarter. In fact, operating income in the rest of the world caught up with U.S. Foodservice in the quarter as we continue to push the mix of our business to high-growth markets. We're also pleased to see double-digit organic sales and operating income growth in the Middle East and in South Africa. 
Given the worsening economic uncertainty in Developed Markets, we continue to focus on maintaining strong operating discipline. We're taking the price increases necessary to offset inflation, cutting out on profitable trade promotions, increasing advertising support for our brands, cutting costs and carefully allocating capital. These choices will likely continue to have an effect on short-term volume, but are intended to preserve and expand margins for sustainable profit growth.
Before I turn it over to Ed, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made on Project Keystone since we last met in May. Most recently, we completed the baseline work in the Netherlands and the Nordics. Very successfully implemented the global solution in Belgium, which is our first platform for transaction processing through the important European supply chain hub, and implemented globally sourcing solution through SAP to help drive savings across the company. 
Looking forward, we are continuing the European rollout, moving in to North America, starting with Canada, evaluating our options for accelerating progress in Asia Pacific and developing an SAP solution for smaller markets. Overall, we're pleased with our progress and are on-track with our plans for fiscal '12. With that, let me turn it over to Ed. Ed?"
278212,137465635,161592,"HJ Heinz Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2011",2011-08-23,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our Q1 results, which reflects strong top line performance and incremental investments to sustain that growth. Let's look first at the EPS. As we announced in May, we're investing in product",1393,"Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our Q1 results, which reflects strong top line performance and incremental investments to sustain that growth. Let's look first at the EPS. 
As we announced in May, we're investing in productivity initiatives this year which we expect will make the company stronger and accelerating productivity on a global scale. We anticipate that for fiscal 2012, we will invest at least $160 million of pretax income, or $0.35 a share on these initiatives. As a result, we will be reporting our results in fiscal 2012 adjusting for these special charges. 
To summarize for Q1, EPS excluding these charges was $0.78, up 4%. This includes almost $0.02 of incremental costs for Project Keystone. As a reminder, we expect $0.08 of incremental cost from Project Keystone this fiscal year, which is not treated as a special item.
Stripping out the $0.05 favorable impact from foreign currency this quarter, EPS excluding special items is $0.73, down $0.02 from last year. Finally, reported EPS was $0.70, which includes the charge of approximately $0.09 due to productivity initiatives we incurred in Q1.
Here you can see the makeup of the productivity charges we incurred so far, and where they're reflected in the P&L. Included in reported operating income is $15 million for severance and employee benefit costs relating to the reduction of the global workforce. $17 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of 4 factories. We're expecting to exit at least one more factory this year, and are evaluating several additional opportunities to reduce costs. $9 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees and relocation costs related to the establishment of the European supply chain hub.
Overall, we recorded charges of $41 million pretax, $31 million of which was recorded in cost of goods sold and $9 million in SG&A. The after-tax impact of these charges was $28 million, or $0.09 per share, and the entire amount was reported in the nonoperating segment.
We believe that our results, excluding these special charges provide the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance, and we will use this benchmark for the rest of the financial discussion. 
Now let me focus on our P&L scorecard. With the benefit of a tailwind from currency, we were able to increase our investment in the long-term health of our business, while delivering operating income and EPS growth, despite a challenging global economy.
Net sales grew by almost 15%, aided by the recent acquisitions, as well as currency. Organically, sales grew 3.1%, driven by pricing. Gross margin was 35.7%, with higher pricing and our productivity improvements, offsetting much of the commodity inflation.
As we progress through the year, we expect pricing and productivity to offset commodity cost increases, but this will build throughout the year, and primarily in our second half. 
We continue to increase our investment in consumer marketing, particularly in our Emerging Markets and the U.K. Overall, marketing increased by almost 15% and 8% on a constant currency basis.
Operating income was up 1%, but on a constant currency basis, down 4.5%. Our incremental investments in marketing and Project Keystone alone, were the equivalent of over 6 points of potential profit growth that we chose to invest for the future. At $0.78, EPS was up 4%, but down 2.7% on a constant currency basis, as a result of our incremental investments. 
As you can see, both the pound and the euro are up substantially versus last year, which has a significant benefit to our European operations, which account for nearly 30% of global sales. To varying degrees, most of the markets we compete in have shown similar trends.
Here you can see what those currency movements have meant to our P&L. With the currencies of almost all the countries we operate in showing substantial strength versus the U.S. dollar, both revenue and EPS show around a 7% lift from the exchange. Since our foreign operations tend to have a lower gross margins than our domestic businesses, the translation benefit to the overall P&L does cause a 20-basis point reduction in average gross margin.
Continuing with a more detailed look at the P&L, I'll touch on some of the items not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up 12% and 6% on a constant currency basis, with about 2/3 of the growth from acquisitions. Although these acquisitions contributed to gross profit dollars, they did reduce company-wide gross margins by 40 basis points.
SG&A was up 15% on a constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, investments in Project Keystone, as well as higher distribution costs due to fuel prices. Other SG&A costs in our Developed Markets were virtually flat, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls, while we continue to add resources in our Emerging Markets.
Operating income was up slightly from last year, while investing nearly $25 million in incremental marketing and Keystone spending to drive growth. Net interest and other expense improved by $10 million, primarily due to decreased currency losses, while we continue to benefit from low interest rates. 
The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 24% compared to 25.3% last year, primarily due to a statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K. This year will likely a show quarter-to-quarter volatility in the tax rate. We currently anticipate a rate in the low 20s for Q2 and an overall rate for the year, roughly in line with last year's tax rate. 
Finally, shares outstanding are up in the first quarter by about 1%, but we expect the full year impact of shares outstanding to be neutral. 
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as I mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 3.1%. Price improvements, particularly in Venezuela, the U.S. and the U.K. drove overall price by 3.8%, while volume declined 0.7% as increased volume in the Emerging Markets, as well as the U.K., Continental Europe, Canada and Japan, were more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Australia. 
Overall, the Emerging Markets led to sales growth, driving 13% organically, and representing 23% of total company sales. The acquisitions of Foodstar and Quero contributed 4.6% to overall sales growth. And finally, foreign exchange added 7.2% to our top line. As I noted earlier, our gross margin declined 90 basis points to 35.7%. In isolation, market prices for commodities would have cost us over 350 basis points for the quarter, but strong contributions from pricing and productivity, offset much of this inflation. The impact of the acquisitions accounted for about 1/2 of the gross margin decline versus last year.
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in almost all of our significant inputs, particularly sweeteners, oils, dairy and resin. The overall result has been a market inflation for the quarter of around 8%.
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 2.6% of sales, up 40 basis points from the prior year, with a higher spending rate expected for the balance of this year.
Operating free cash flow of $97 million was down $120 million from last year, largely due to the timing of payables. Net debt to EBITDA improved 0.1x driven by lower net debt and I'm pleased to say that S&P recently raised the company's debt rating to a BBB+.
ROIC was 18.8%, down 20 basis points from this time last year. However, the base business continues to improve, as the recent Brazilian acquisition reduced the company's overall ROIC by 60 basis points. We should recover over time as profits in Quero continue to build.
As I mentioned earlier, operating free cash flow was down $120 million versus last year. This reflects lower earnings as a result of the productivity initiatives and increased QOWC requirements, particularly in payables. Included in our results was $10 million of outflow for the productivity initiatives.
I touched on the $75 million of capital expenditures earlier, and dividends reflect the 6.7% increase we announced in May.
Finally, net treasury stock purchases up $44 million, reflect the acquisition of 1.6 million shares of stock at a total cost of $87 million.
In summary, our performance for this quarter is slightly better than our expectations, and reflects the planned incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full year outlook."

And just a couple of remarks before opening it up to your questions. Importantly, we are reaffirming our FY '12 outlook. This reflects our confidence in a number of actions that we've taken and are planning to take to yield a stronger second half. These actions include more flow-through of pricing, continuing innovation, productivity initiatives, cost containment actions and tax planning, all of these are expected to allow us to continue our aggressive investment programs while delivering our bottom line target.
While currency is tracking positively on a year-over-year basis, it's too early to adjust our full year ForEx outlook. And just a quick comment on the shape of the profit curve for the year. We're expected to be a bit atypical with a stronger second half, benefited by the timing of pricing and prior year ketchup promotions in the U.S., improving productivity and less onerous commodity cost comparisons.
And for Q2, we expect the EPS to be in line with or just slightly higher than prior year, due to the timing of pricing, the phaseout of Boston Market, a difficult commodity cost overlap and continued tough conditions in U.S. Foodservice in Australia, offset by a favorable tax rate. Beyond the second quarter, EPS is expected to build sequentially. 
So to sum up, our Q1 reflects continued solid performance in a challenging environment. Our key growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 Brands and Global Ketchup, are producing strong and consistent growth. We have strong operating discipline, which will keep us focused on making the right volume, profit trade-offs and to address our challenges in Australia.
Overall, it's still early in what's shaping up to be another interesting year, but we're confident in our brands, people, skills and ability to respond to the consumer as she reacts to world events. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Meg for Q&A. Meg?"

So everything we're seeing there makes us much more bullish, even than we were before, and we've had positive expectations coming in. And from a profit standpoint, they're doing well.

And it's a -- with it being such difficult market, we're going to take the measures that we need to do to address that. And so we've seen our margins squeezed as the pressure comes on, and not so what that means is we're continuing to upgrade talent. As I mentioned, we've just now appointed a new managing director there. We've done a lot to strengthen the talent in that organization. We're taking some very aggressive actions in terms of structuring the business and in terms of the cost structure. Because in an environment where the 2 customers are going to squeeze it that hard, I think being very, very cost competitive is going to be critical.

And we estimate somewhere between $40 and $50 a week to feed a family of 4, which is really stark, when you go to the grocery store and realize how tight that is. Value to that particular consumer is something completely different than mainstream or affluent. And value to that consumer is a price point. It doesn't matter what the cost per ounce is, it matters, ""Can I afford to buy even a portion of that this week?"" And having small sizes, convenient sizes, convenient channels, convenience stores, pharmacies, dollar stores, quick small trips that are close to home as opposed to going out for the big loads at the supercenters. So there's very different behavior that's occurring, in fact, we are almost saying it's almost a trifurcation, if you will. Because we're seeing a consumer that is truly struggling, and value means something different. Our core portfolio in the U.S. tends to skew towards the more affluent. So you see Heinz products doing very well across mainstream, across the affluent and the club stores, et cetera. There is a huge opportunity for us and we see it. We originally anticipated more of a recovery scenario. Now that we're seeing things get tightening again, we're looking very hard. We had a lot of plans that we're looking at it for, a lot of ideas, so these are things that are very close and ready to go, that we want to execute quickly, but we're going to make sure we hit it right. By getting into the right channels, getting into the right size and format for a different consumer. And we want to make sure that we are appealing abroad. In Europe, across our other Developed Markets, a very similar story. And so our brands across Europe are very strong, and particularly in the U.K. And it's something we've been working on a Master-branded campaign across the U.K. to let  the consumer know, that we're there for them and have worked very hard though to shore up brand equity, but to make sure that we've got right serving sizes. We've gone more towards value sizes, larger sizes there. But of course, we have smaller sizes. We've got more tiered approach across Europe."

Now on today's call. Art will review our category and regional segment performance, and Ed will review our first quarter financial results and scorecards. We've got about 30 minutes of prepared remarks and we'll use the remainder of that hour to take your questions. We'd like to request you limit your questions during the Q&A session to one single-part question in order to ensure adequate time for all who wish to participate and to ensure we end the call on a timely basis. 
So with the formalities out of the way, let me now turn the call over to Art Winkleblack. Art?"
278212,137465635,161785,"HJ Heinz Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2011",2011-08-23,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance where we posted solid results in a very difficult environment. This morning, we will be presenting our P&L excluding special items, which you'll recal",2837,"Thanks, Meg. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance where we posted solid results in a very difficult environment. This morning, we will be presenting our P&L excluding special items, which you'll recall from our Analyst Day are the onetime charges for productivity initiatives planned for this fiscal year. Overall, the quarter slightly exceeded our expectations despite the tough economy in Developed Markets and a more challenged U.S. consumer, all of which has been headline news in July and August. 
For the quarter, we grew revenue at a double-digit pace. Posted solid organic sales growth driven by our trio of growth engines, the Top 15 brands, Emerging Markets and Global Ketchup. We achieved excellent growth from our newest acquisitions, Foodstar in China and Quero in Brazil. Increased marketing and stepped-up investment in the business, including Project Keystone, our European supply chain hub and other capability building initiatives, and we weathered a very tough commodity cost comparison. In short, we're off to a solid start to the year while continuing to adapt our strategies and tactics to meet the changing consumer dynamic. 
In terms of key P&L metrics, sales grew nearly 15%. Operating income increased by 1 point and EPS rose 4%. We'll take you through the detail behind the numbers, but these results included solid base business performance, the benefit of favorable currency and the impact of the acquisitions we made late last fiscal year, which are off to a very strong start. 
But before getting into the specifics, I want to profile some of the key themes running through the first quarter results. These include strong top line growth from Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup, Top 15 brand, acquisitions and currency. Price increases across our portfolio, which still lag very high commodity inflation. Increased SG&A, reflecting our aggressive investments in marketing and business-building capabilities. A slightly lower tax rate, driven by a decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate. Approximately 3 million more shares outstanding, and a foreign currency tailwind in our key markets. All of this combined to generate solid EPS growth on an X-items basis. 
Turning to organic sales, our Emerging Markets once again drove the majority of the organic sales increase, posting 13% growth for the quarter. And on a constant currency basis, sales in Emerging Markets were up nearly 40%, including recent acquisitions. 
Developed Markets generated organic growth as well, led by Europe, Japan and Canada. Europe delivered positive volume and net price growth, with organic sales up almost 5% led by the U.K. and Continental Europe. 
Australia continues to be a difficult market for us. And in the U.S. Foodservice business, we saw a weakening trend in restaurant traffic, particularly in July. Excluding these 2 businesses, organic sales growth in Developed Markets was a healthy 3% and total company organic growth would have been nearly 5%.
Importantly, this quarter marks our 25th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, which speaks to the strength of our brands and the adaptability of our business in these challenging times. 
And speaking of our brands, you'll notice that Quero, our recent acquisition in Brazil, and Master which is part of the Foodstar acquisition in China, are now included in our Top 15 Brands. Collectively, our top 15 now make up nearly 3/4 of our portfolio and posted what we are calling internal growth of 6.5% for the quarter. For comparability, this metric includes an estimate of prior year sales for the acquired businesses from the time before we owned them. Note also that 5 of our Top 15 Brands are now emerging market brands. 
Turning to our 3 core categories on a constant currency basis, Ketchup and Sauces set the pace in the quarter with nearly 14% growth, driven by Global Ketchup and boosted by the addition of Foodstar and Quero. The category also delivered strong growth in Asian sauces in Indonesia and in pasta sauce in North America. Organically, sales for our Ketchup and Sauces category were up 7%. 
Meals and Snacks grew by more than 3% driven by the Quero acquisition and strong growth in soup and beans in the U.K. This was partially offset by weakness in our U.S. frozen potato business, reflecting the impact of recent pricing actions. And Infant/Nutrition grew by 5% virtually all in Emerging Markets, which grew at a rate of 15% in the quarter. This growth was led by Venezuela, China, India and Russia. 
Our Emerging Markets continue to grow in importance to Heinz, both organically and through acquisitions propositions, and accounted for around 23% of sales in this quarter. We're delighted with our newest acquisitions, Quero and Foodstar, which together accounted for about 4% of total company sales. 
Quero had a big impact on our Rest of World region, helping to double sales in that segment. Since we closed the Quero acquisition on April 1, we've been busy integrating the business and positioning it for growth. Previously, top line growth had been limited by production capacity, which prevented geographic expansion in a greater portion of the modern trade. We've made some real progress against these opportunities, while also implementing a small company version of SAP. This month, we began distributing Heinz products through Quero's sales and distribution network, and are planning on producing these products locally over time, so the team in Brazil has been very busy. 
As you know, this is the first quarter in which Quero has been included in our results. And although new acquisitions are not part of organic growth, using our internal sales growth metric, the team drove 8% sales growth, including more than 20% growth in our core tomato product business while doing all the integration activities and implementing SAP, so we're very pleased with that start. 
We are also delighted with Foodstar, which we expect to help us reach almost 350 million in sales in China this year. We've owned Foodstar for 9 months now, and it's grown more than 20% versus the comparable period in the prior year. We've added more soy manufacturing capacity and are expanding the Master brand into a third province. As a result, Master now serves a total market population of 175 million people, leaving only another billion-or-so consumers in China to go. 
We're also launching Foodstar's first new products in more than 2 years, giving us a premium presence in all 3 of the largest soy sauce segments in China. Those are light, dark and Weijixian soy sauce. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, the growth in our infant nutrition category has been driven by Emerging Markets. We've been winning in these markets with trusted brands; functional innovations like Qingdao [ph] in China and Complan Memory in India; increased marketing investments; and a relentless focus on quality and taste. 
Turning now to Global Ketchup, we're very pleased with 8% organic growth in ketchup for the quarter while lapping the well-known dollar ketchup promotion that ran at our largest customer in the U.S. throughout most of the first quarter last year. Growth was driven around the globe, led like Venezuela, U.S. Foodservice, North American consumer products and Europe, with a notable contribution from China as well.
Now let's take a quick spin around the world of Heinz. We'll start with North American consumer products. Q1 brought fresh economic uncertainty and more challenges for the U.S. consumer. Debt ceiling debates, the downgrade of U.S. Treasury obligations, weak employment and housing markets and wild volatility in the stock market also serve to make consumers here very nervous. In this context, constant currency sales were flat for the quarter, as favorable pricing offset an equal volume loss. This also reflects the lapping of last year's dollar ketchup promotion and the phaseout of Boston Market in the quarter, which on a combined basis, reduced the sales growth rate by about 2 points. 
During the quarter, we completed our planned price increases and reduced promotional spending across the U.S. business. These actions, in addition to our aggressive productivity initiatives, helped us cover the dollar impact of very high commodity inflation and kept gross margin nearly flat. 
Operating income was down slightly for the quarter, reflecting the increased commodity costs, and also higher fuel costs for the delivery of our products. 
U.S. consumer confidence hit a new low in August. This result was even lower than in the depths of the great recession of the first quarter of 2009, and in fact, is at the lowest level since 1980. As a result, U.S. consumers are reacting by cutting back on discretionary spending, shoppers are using coupons more often, cutting back on waste, and paying more and closer attention to what they buy. We're closely monitoring our pricing and product mix to optimize volume and profitability in this environment and working to reach both sides of today's bifurcated consumer group. 
As you know, we built a track record of successful innovation in North America. We've introduced products that have expanded our sales and market share while building and bringing interest to our categories. We are continuing to build on this foundation and are driving for even greater efficiency in the production of these products, some of which are now being produced in our new state-of-the-art frozen product factory in Florence, South Carolina, which opened earlier this month. 
In FY '12, we had another strong pipeline of innovation. We're moving further into the nutritional dinner day part with our Smart Ones bagged meals, and extending the T.G.I. Friday's brand in the restaurant quality Single-Serve entrees. Both of these launches are going as planned, with new T.G.I.F. commercials on air, as of mid-July. 
In Ketchup, the 10-pack of Dip & Squeeze is starting to show up on retail shelves this month, and we've launched the more sustainable PlantBottle, part of our partnership with the Coca-Cola Company. We're also expanding our Classico line with Mexican and Italian inspired white sauces, as well as a new pizza sauce. And we're launching 2 new versions of our very successful category leading Sweet Potato fries. 
Turning to Foodservice in the U.S. Sales in the quarter tracked to the underlying environment, where 1% sales decreased as favorable pricing did not quite offset the impact of lower volume. With the recent economic news and higher gas prices, we saw restaurant traffic trends change in the quarter from flat to down within our existing customer base. 
During the quarter, we implemented a second set of price increases to offset commodity inflation. But due to the timing of national account contracts, these price increases will take effect gradually over the coming months. As a result, pricing has not yet caught up with significant commodity inflation and gross margin was down by 50 basis points. Higher fuel costs and S&D also impacted operating income for the quarter. 
Importantly, Ketchup sales were up 5% in U.S. Foodservice this quarter, despite the declines in customer traffic. Here, our innovation is working to offset the environment, attracting customers to buy and consumers to use more of our ketchup. Dip & Squeeze has been a key element in this equation, and to date has replaced about 10% of our sachet volume. 
We continue to build distribution of the product and Foodservice. And as mentioned, we're providing more usage opportunities for Dip & Squeeze through U.S. retail, and are now introducing the product into Canada. The PlantBottle has also been a popular item with restaurants and now are represents about 70% of our restaurant tabletop Ketchup business. We've had over 1 million visits to our website, much of it driven by mobile marketing from our tabletop bottle in the 4 short weeks since introduction. 
Now crossing the pond. We posted strong sales and traffic growth in Europe despite a tough environment there, which includes sovereign debt concerns, austerity programs, civil unrest and very high unemployment in some countries. Organic sales were almost 5%, including volume growth of more than 2% and pricing of almost 3%. These results were led by an outstanding performance in U.K., where the team is selling more products off the shelf at full price. 
Our meals and value shares are growing across most of our U.K. business, showing that premium brands can still thrive in a difficult economy. We're also pleased with the sales results across much of Continental Europe and Russia, reflecting increased pricing, innovation and impact of additional marketing investment.
Also driving a very aggressive change agenda in Europe, where we're investing in significant capabilities to drive further growth and efficiency, most notably Project Keystone and the European supply chain hub, both implementations continue to progress and are going well. In sum, we're very pleased with our performance in Europe for the quarter. 
There's no shortage of innovation in Europe these days either. We recently launched an exciting, better tasting new line of aseptic baby food in Italy, and continue to extend our Fridge Pack line of Beanz in the U.K. 
Also in the U.K., we're just launching 2 new great tasting unique innovations: Squeeze & Stir, which combines with hot water to make soup in a cup; and Heinz Pasta Pouches, a premium pasta meal that is portable. It's early days, but we'll keep you posted on these exciting new products. 
Moving to Asia Pacific, we have a tale of 2 cities. Results in the Asia and Emerging Markets were very strong, but results from developed Pacific markets were unfavorably impacted by poor performance in Australia. 
For the segment, constant currency sales grew 7% largely driven by the Foodstar acquisition and a modest increase in overall organic sales. Operating income before the benefits of foreign exchange was down about 20%, reflecting a 210-basis point decline in gross margin and increased investments in marketing and talent in Emerging Markets. For perspective, much of the decline in gross margin came from Australia, where we have appointed a new managing director, and are attacking the cost structure to stabilize performance in what has become an inhospitable grocery market. 
For additional perspective on constant currency sales performance in the segment, you can see that Emerging Markets drove better than 20% growth driven primarily by Infant/Nutrition in China, Complan in India, sweet soy and chili sauces in Indonesia, and our acquisition of Foodstar. And the developed markets of New Zealand, Japan and Singapore posted solid aggregate growth, up 4% on a combined basis, led primarily by Japan.
But Australia is the clear challenge for us in this segment, with constant currency sales down 8% for the quarter. Again, we're taking strong action to address our issues there. Within the Emerging Markets we continue to drive strong results through an aggressive innovation agenda. Most recently, we just launched the pouch baby food in China, where we are the first company in that market with a pouch package. And our infant formula business continues to build share in key retailers, as we methodically progress the rollout and support it with strong marketing investments and drive awareness and trial across our entire Infant/Nutrition product line. 
In India, our Complan brand gained share this quarter, driven the new product innovation including Complan Memory, as well as Complan Nutri-Gro, our line of toddler meals which is now being sold nationally, and a new Pista Badam flavor of Complan that recently entered lead markets, building on the success of Kesar Badam. 
Turning to the rest of the world. The addition of Quero and the return to labor stability and strong growth in Venezuela enabled this segment to double in size this quarter. In fact, operating income in the rest of the world caught up with U.S. Foodservice in the quarter as we continue to push the mix of our business to high-growth markets. We're also pleased to see double-digit organic sales and operating income growth in the Middle East and in South Africa. 
Given the worsening economic uncertainty in Developed Markets, we continue to focus on maintaining strong operating discipline. We're taking the price increases necessary to offset inflation, cutting out on profitable trade promotions, increasing advertising support for our brands, cutting costs and carefully allocating capital. These choices will likely continue to have an effect on short-term volume, but are intended to preserve and expand margins for sustainable profit growth.
Before I turn it over to Ed, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made on Project Keystone since we last met in May. Most recently, we completed the baseline work in the Netherlands and the Nordics; very successfully implemented the global solution in Belgium, which is our first platform for transaction processing through the important European supply chain hub; and implemented globally sourcing solution through SAP to help drive savings across the company. 
Looking forward, we are continuing the European rollout, moving in to North America, starting with Canada, evaluating our options for accelerating progress in Asia Pacific and developing an SAP solution for smaller markets. 
Overall, we're pleased with our progress and are on-track with our plans for fiscal '12. With that, let me turn it over to Ed. Ed?"
278212,137465635,161785,"HJ Heinz Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2011",2011-08-23,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Art. And good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our Q1 results, which reflects strong top line performance and incremental investments to sustain that growth. Let's look first at the EPS. As we announced in May, we're investing in product",1393,"Thanks, Art. And good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our Q1 results, which reflects strong top line performance and incremental investments to sustain that growth. Let's look first at the EPS. 
As we announced in May, we're investing in productivity initiatives this year which we expect will make the company stronger and accelerating productivity on a global scale. We anticipate that for fiscal 2012, we will invest at least $160 million of pretax income, or $0.35 a share on these initiatives. As a result, we will be reporting our results in fiscal 2012 adjusting for these special charges. 
To summarize for Q1, EPS excluding these charges was $0.78, up 4%. This includes almost $0.02 of incremental costs for Project Keystone. As a reminder, we expect $0.08 of incremental cost from Project Keystone this fiscal year, which is not treated as a special item.
Stripping out the $0.05 favorable impact from foreign currency this quarter, EPS excluding special items is $0.73, down $0.02 from last year. Finally, reported EPS was $0.70, which includes the charge of approximately $0.09 due to productivity initiatives we incurred in Q1.
Here you can see the makeup of the productivity charges we incurred so far, and where they're reflected in the P&L. Included in reported operating income is $15 million for severance and employee benefit costs relating to the reduction of the global workforce. $17 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of 4 factories. We're expecting to exit at least one more factory this year, and are evaluating several additional opportunities to reduce costs. $9 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees and relocation costs related to the establishment of the European supply chain hub.
Overall, we recorded charges of $41 million pretax, $31 million of which was recorded in cost of goods sold and $9 million in SG&A. The after-tax impact of these charges was $28 million, or $0.09 per share, and the entire amount was reported in the nonoperating segment.
We believe that our results excluding these special charges, provide the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance, and we will use this benchmark for the rest of the financial discussion. 
Now let me focus on our P&L scorecard. With the benefit of a tailwind from currency, we were able to increase our investment in the long-term health of our business while delivering operating income and EPS growth, despite a challenging global economy.
Net sales grew by almost 15%, aided by the recent acquisitions, as well as currency. Organically, sales grew 3.1%, driven by pricing. Gross margin was 35.7%, with higher pricing and our productivity improvements offsetting much of the commodity inflation.
As we progress through the year, we expect pricing and productivity to offset commodity cost increases, but this will build throughout the year and, primarily, in our second half. 
We continue to increase our investment in consumer marketing, particularly in our Emerging Markets and the U.K. Overall, marketing increased by almost 15% and 8% on a constant currency basis.
Operating income was up 1%, but on a constant currency basis, down 4.5%. Our incremental investments in marketing and Project Keystone alone, were the equivalent of over 6 points of potential profit growth that we chose to invest for the future. At $0.78, EPS was up 4%, but down 2.7% on a constant currency basis, as a result of our incremental investments. 
As you can see, both the pound and the euro are up substantially versus last year, which has a significant benefit to our European operations, which account for nearly 30% of global sales. To varying degrees, most of the markets we compete in have shown similar trends.
Here you can see what those currency movements have meant to our P&L. With the currencies of almost all the countries we operate in showing substantial strength versus the U.S. dollar, both revenue and EPS show around a 7% lift from the exchange. Since our foreign operations tend to have a lower gross margins than our domestic businesses, the translation benefit to the overall P&L does cause a 20-basis point reduction in average gross margin.
Continuing with a more detailed look at the P&L, I'll touch on some of the items not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up 12% and 6% on a constant currency basis, with about 2/3 of the growth from acquisitions. Although these acquisitions contributed to gross profit dollars, they did reduce company-wide gross margins by 40 basis points.
SG&A was up 15% on a constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, investments in Project Keystone, as well as higher distribution costs due to fuel prices. Other SG&A costs in our Developed Markets were virtually flat, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls, while we continue to add resources in our Emerging Markets.
Operating income was up slightly from last year, while investing nearly $25 million in incremental marketing and Keystone spending to drive growth. Net interest and other expense improved by $10 million, primarily due to decreased currency losses, while we continue to benefit from low interest rates. 
The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 24% compared to 25.3% last year, primarily due to a statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K. This year will likely a show quarter-to-quarter volatility in the tax rate. We currently anticipate a rate in the low 20s for Q2 and an overall rate for the year, roughly in line with last year's tax rate. 
Finally, shares outstanding are up in the first quarter by about 1%, but we expect the full year impact of shares outstanding to be neutral. 
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as I mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 3.1%. Price improvements, particularly in Venezuela, the U.S. and the U.K., drove overall price by 3.8%, while volume declined 0.7% as increased volume in the Emerging Markets, as well as the U.K., Continental Europe, Canada and Japan, were more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Australia. 
Overall, the Emerging Markets led to sales growth, driving 13% organically, and representing 23% of total company sales. The acquisitions of Foodstar and Quero contributed 4.6% to overall sales growth. And finally, foreign exchange added 7.2% to our top line. As I noted earlier, our gross margin declined 90 basis points to 35.7%. In isolation, market prices for commodities would have cost us over 350 basis points for the quarter, but strong contributions from pricing and productivity offset much of this inflation. The impact of the acquisitions accounted for about 1/2 of the gross margin decline versus last year.
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in almost all of our significant inputs, particularly sweeteners, oils, dairy and resin. The overall result has been a market inflation for the quarter of around 8%.
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 2.6% of sales, up 40 basis points from the prior year, with a higher spending rate expected for the balance of this year.
Operating free cash flow of $97 million was down $120 million from last year, largely due to the timing of payables. Net debt to EBITDA improved 0.1x driven by lower net debt, and I'm pleased to say that S&P recently raised the company's debt rating to a BBB+.
ROIC was 18.8%, down 20 basis points from this time last year. However, the base business continues to improve, as the recent Brazilian acquisition reduced the company's overall ROIC by 60 basis points. We should recover over time as profits in Quero continue to build.
As I mentioned earlier, operating free cash flow was down $120 million versus last year. This reflects lower earnings as a result of the productivity initiatives and increased QOWC requirements, particularly in payables. Included in our results was $10 million of outflow for the productivity initiatives.
I touched on the $75 million of capital expenditures earlier, and dividends reflect the 6.7% increase we announced in May.
Finally, net treasury stock purchases up $44 million, reflect the acquisition of 1.6 million shares of stock at a total cost of $87 million.
In summary, our performance for this quarter is slightly better than our expectations, and reflects the planned incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full year outlook."
278212,137465635,161785,"HJ Heinz Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2011",2011-08-23,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Ed.

And just a couple of remarks before opening it up to your questions. Importantly, we are reaffirming our FY '12 outlook. This reflects our confidence in a number of actions that we've taken and are planning to take to yield a stronger second half. These actions include more flow-through of pricing, continuing innovation, productivity initiatives, cost containment actions and tax planning. All of these are expected to allow us to continue our aggressive investment programs while delivering our bottom line target.
While currency is tracking positively on a year-over-year basis, it's too early to adjust our full year ForEx outlook. And just a quick comment on the shape of the profit curve for the year. We're expected to be a bit atypical with a stronger second half, benefited by the timing of pricing and prior year ketchup promotions in the U.S., improving productivity and less onerous commodity cost comparisons.
And for Q2, we expect the EPS to be in line with or just slightly higher than prior year, due to the timing of pricing, the phaseout of Boston Market, a difficult commodity cost overlap and continued tough conditions in U.S. Foodservice in Australia, offset by a favorable tax rate. Beyond the second quarter, EPS is expected to build sequentially. 
So to sum up, our Q1 reflects continued solid performance in a challenging environment. Our key growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 Brands and Global Ketchup, are producing strong and consistent growth. We have strong operating discipline, which will keep us focused on making the right volume, profit trade-offs and to address our challenges in Australia.
Overall, it's still early in what's shaping up to be another interesting year, but we're confident in our brands, people, skills and ability to respond to the consumer as she reacts to world events.

And so it's a -- with it being such difficult market, we're going to take the measures that we need to do to address that. And so we've seen our margins squeezed as the pressure comes on. And so what that means is we're continuing to upgrade talent, as I mentioned, we've just now appointed a new managing director there. We've done a lot to strengthen the talent in that organization. We're taking some very aggressive actions in terms of structuring the business and in terms of the cost structure. Because in an environment where the 2 customers are going to squeeze it that hard, I think being very, very cost competitive is going to be critical. And so that is going to be forcing our hand to do the right things from that angle. But we've got good plans in place. We expect much stronger back half than first half. But it will take us some time, and we're continuing to bang our way out of it."

We're continuing to ramp up the innovation in that market, I mentioned a bunch of the innovations there. U.K. had a particularly stellar quarter, and clearly a tough market there. So that will continue to be a challenge, but the guys are doing all the right things. We're very pleased with the team there and what they're doing. And in the continent, we're seeing some pretty good results as well. Some of the things, local jewels as the guys would call it, Sprinkles in Continental Europe, some of the soup products all going well. And the, really, the thing that is going so well across the entire company, but particularly in Europe, is ketchup. Roel van Neerbos has been driving, not only that -- the Global Ketchup initiative across the globe, but obviously there in Europe. And we're seeing some great results there and we continue to think that we've got great opportunity to drive the Ketchup business. And as you know, that has very nice margins to it. So that has value to our benefits, both to the top line and bottom line. The team's banging away at it, also we've got a very busy agenda there. And as you know, we are putting in the supply chain hub, we're driving Keystone. We're building out the new innovation center, which will ramp up innovation even further in that business over the coming years. So a lot's going on. We're pleased with the results.

Where I think this changing economic environment will really impact is, potentially, in the gross margin area, where it will be tougher from a net price standpoint. Commodities are suddenly as high as we expected, or maybe even a little higher. And so as we look forward, I think the real where it will impact is more in the gross margins. So if you think about it, the way we're looking at the fuller projection, we are not changing anything official yet.

And we estimate somewhere between $40 and $50 a week to feed a family of 4, which is really stark, when you go to the grocery store and realize how tight that is. Value to that particular consumer is something completely different than mainstream or affluent. And value to that consumer is a price point. It doesn't matter what the cost per ounce is, it matters, ""Can I afford to buy even a small portion of that this week?"" And having small sizes, convenient sizes, convenient channels, convenient stores, pharmacies, dollar stores, quick small trips that are close to home as opposed to going out for the big loads at the supercenters. So there's very different behavior that's occurring. In fact, we are almost saying it's almost a trifurcation, if you will. Because we're seeing a consumer that is truly struggling, and value means something different. Our core portfolio in the U.S. tends to skew towards the more affluent. So you see Heinz products doing very well across mainstream, across the affluent, in the club stores, et cetera. There is a huge opportunity for us and we see it. We originally anticipated more of a recovery scenario. Now that we're seeing things get tightening again, we're looking very hard.

Before I take you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will also",2144,"Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Before I take you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will also discuss our expectations for sequentially stronger results in the second half of the year, especially in developed markets where pricing in commodity costs should finally equilibrate. Overall, we are still on track to achieve our full year sales and EPS outlook. 
Turning to the second quarter, I would characterize our results as strong in Emerging Markets and mixed in developed markets. Reported sales grew 8.3% and we delivered EPS of $0.81 a share before special items. Notably, we saw a combination of continued strength in Emerging Markets mixed with softness in some developed markets primarily Australia, and our Foodservice business in the U.S. where consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 30 years. 
Turning first to Emerging Markets, they continued to be our most powerful growth engine as they delivered 16% organic sales growth, which excludes any of our acquisitions. The growth was led by excellent results in Ketchup and Sauces in China, Latin America and Indonesia as well as very strong performance in Complan and Infant/Nutrition. We have significant innovation still to come and I want to be clear that I expect our emerging market growth rates to actually accelerate in the second half of the year. Importantly, our recent acquisitions, Quero in Brazil and in China, also performed well and continued to exceed our expectations in this 2 critically important Emerging Markets. Quero sales grew 8.5% in the first half despite capacity constraints and without the benefit of any marketing investment which we commenced in early November. Sales of food start faster soy sauce brand grew around 30% and I now expect would start to deliver somewhere between $140 million and $150 million sin ales this year, well above our plan. In both cases, we are focused on driving top and bottom line growth through innovation, marketing investment, channel expansion and improved capabilities. Overall, Emerging Markets generated the vast majority of the company's organic sales growth well representing over 20% of total Heinz in sales. 
The second growth driver was the performance of our Top 15 brands which now include Quero and Master. Reported sales in our Top 15 brands including Quero and Master grew more than 12% and accounted for around 71% of our total sales. Excluding Quero and Master, the remaining Top 15 brands delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter. 
The third growth engine was Global Ketchup. Vested by higher pricing, strong sales results in Europe and higher volume in Latin America, Ketchup delivered excellent organic growth of 6.5% in the quarter and is up 7.4% organically year-to-date as we continued to successfully focus on innovation, new distribution and penetration opportunities. Not bad for a 135-year-old brand. 
We are keeping our flagship product healthy and growing with innovations like PlantBottle, balsamic Ketchup and then squeezes was recently recognized the 2 major industry awards for innovation. Dip and squeeze continues to build strong momentum in food service. Wendy's is the latest customer to accept dip in squeeze and the product is performing very well at Chick-fil-A, Dairy Queen and other quick serve chains. Importantly, we'll shortly represent 25% of our singleserve Ketchup business and we are essentially at full capacity. 
Separately, sales of our new retail 10 packs of dip and squeeze have just commenced. This is the first time Heinz Ketchup innovation developed primarily for restaurants is achieved broad distribution in our retail store sales. Finally, Heinz Ketchup of balsamic vinegar will reach U.S. store shelves next month after making a splash in the U.K. earlier this year and after a very successful Facebook campaign commenced in the U.S. this week. This launch exemplifies the progress we have made in sharing best practices in new product innovation globally to grow our business. 
In summary, our trio of growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, helped Heinz deliver our 26th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. 
Turning you to developed markets, they were a tale of 2 cities with many of our mature market business units posted solid results despite the tough of environment, led by another outstanding performance in the U.K. On the other hand, Australia and U.S. Foodservice continued to be very challenged as Art described last quarter. In Australia, we are confronting of weak categories, relentless promotional pressure and growing private label, as well as executional issues. We have significantly upgraded the management team and are aggressively working to simplify the business and reduce costs. Overall, we are taking action on many fronts to improve our margins. We are eliminating hundreds of SKUs, closing the sauces production facility in Gary, downsizing 2 other factories, reducing overheads and are working with suppliers and retailers to improve overall efficiency in terms of logistics and promotions. 
Turning to U.S. Foodservice. After 2 years of favorable profit trends, this year is clearly proving difficult. We are being challenged by significant increases in commodity costs, promotional price pressure and nonbranded back of house products and the lag in price realization at national accounts, as well as a downturn in traffic at key customers. The industry poses structural challenges to growth, and consequently, we are carefully reviewing the makeup of the Foodservice portfolio to determine where we are competitively advantaged. Our branded K C&S business for example, is performing much better than our brand in a more commodity oriented lines. We will share more on this during future updates but for now, we're close in several factories and streamlining back-office activities to further reduce costs and eliminate what has become redundant capacity. We expect substantial improvement in Foodservice profit over the balance of the fiscal year as we lapped the onset of higher commodity costs last year and benefit from the rollover of our pricing initiatives. Together, these 2 actions alone should be worth approximately $20 million to $25 million in incremental operating profit in the second half of the year versus our first half performance. 
We anticipate substantial improvement in both Foodservice in Australia during the second half in response to our recent actions. 
Stepping back and viewing North America in aggregate, the combination of steep unemployment and historically low consumer confidence dampened consumer grocery spending in August and September, especially in the frozen food aisle. Importantly, we saw improvement in October which is continuing into November. North American sales results reflect category weakness across the frozen aisle as well as price related volume softness on our item. Overall, our Ambien product line performed far better consequently organic sales in North America consequently are getting sales and North American Consumer Products would've been up almost 2%, excluding. I am encouraged by the continued growth in small share behind the launch of bag Nielsen several breakfast line and such is although frozen nutrition category does remain soft in line with consumer confidence. We are launching a number of innovative new frozen ambient products in the third quarter that have been tailored specifically to meet the needs of U.S. consumers with tight grocery budgets. Our launch included several items with compelling price points of $0.99 and $1.99. These products of and develop to deliver the same great taste that we always do and value and affordable sizes while maintaining and in some cases, building on historical margins. The initiative will feature a new 10-ounce version of Heinz Ketchup and stand of house packaging with a spout at a suggested retail price of $0.99. Many other products will also be priced around $1, including new retail sizes of Heinz mustard, Heinz worceistershire and Heinz 57 sauce. Additionally, we have just launched Heinz Home Style Beans by slightly higher than $1 after encouraging results in the number of tests stores. Over the years, U.S. consumers are requested we bring back Heinz beans and we believe this is the right ever the return of this convenient, nutritious and value-oriented classic. Consumers have been turning to comfort foods during the recession and the recent consumer opinion poll ranked baked beans as the number 2 comfort food. 
In frozen, we are launching a 1 pound bag of our idea of french fries late in the quarter at a suggested retail price of $1.99 to address consumer requests for increased affordability. Data shows that 1/3 to 1/2 of unit purchases in many U.S. product categories are now have small size SKUs as many consumers are shopping from week to week to stretch their food dollars. Importantly, these are products will enhance our ability to serve the rapidly growing number of U.S. households with incomes below $50,000. As you can see, this income bracket has grown 3x faster than households with income above that threshold. Overall, U.S. consumers remain loyal to Heinz and are extremely satisfied over the quality and value of our products. That factor has reinforced this week when were notified than Heinz ranked first in overall customer satisfaction among all of the 225 companies across 47 industries in the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all companies with an overall customer satisfaction score of 89 which measures performance in quality, value, consumer loyalty and consumer expectations. The Heinz brand tops all brands ranging from Apple and Cadillac to Google and Lexus. Heinz also at our food manufacturers for the 12th year in a row with a score of 8 points higher than the industry average. 
Outside North America, we are responding to consumers desires to economize on a price per ounce basis by introducing Extra Free packs of beans and soup in the U.K. and a 1.5-liter variety of Heinz Ketchup across continental Europe. 
In Europe where the economic climate remains volatile, Heinz will also launch a number of products priced around EUR 1, including entry-priced varieties of plasmon, the leading brand of baby food in Italy. 
In addition to innovation, marketing is a key to unlocking growth in our core portfolio. Marketing spend is up strongly year-to-date and I expect it to increase at a high single-digit rate for the year to help drive stronger organic growth across the second half. In addition to continued marketing investment we had our leading brands, we remain committed to our sizable investment in Keystone. Our global initiative to upgrade and standardize processes and systems. We continued to take a long-term view of the company and these investments will position us well in the future. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we expect our second half results to benefit from improved results in U.S. Foodservice in Australia, rollover pricing and a relative easing of commodity inflation, stronger volumes, as well as even greater growth in Emerging Markets than we experienced in Q1 and Q2. We are making progress in our value engineering and productivity initiatives and I am pleased with our results in this area, and as always, we will not sacrifice quality and safety in the name of savings. 
SG&A comparisons in the second half should be easier as well than they were in the first half. As you will recall, in the back half of last fiscal year, we were affected by some nonrecurring expenses such as the closing cost of the acquisition, increased investments to drive innovation and fund expansion in Emerging Markets and we significant we stepped up our investment in Keystone. Our investment in Keystone is a critically important component of our productivity initiatives. But it does represent a substantial headwind. Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, we remain on track to achieve our previously announced constant currency EPS outlook of $3.24 to $3.32 for the full year, excluding special charges for a one-time productivity initiatives. Heinz continues to expect constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8% for the full year excluding the special charges. We also expect strong operating free cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion for the year excluding charges of more than $1 billion on a reported basis. 
Overall, Heinz continues to drive strong growth in Emerging Markets, our Top 15 Brands in Global Ketchup. We are taking decisive but prudent actions to reduce cost and develop markets and we are continuously analyzing additional programs to drive increased shareholder value. Furthermore, we are evaluating numerous M&A opportunities in the emerging world to build on our already strong momentum. With our continuing focus on operating discipline and productivity investments, we believe we are well-positioned to continue driving solid organic growth, led by our trio growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 Branson Global Ketchup which by the way continues to support our troops via the wanted warrior programs which is working very well for us. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."
278212,142646516,194019,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2011",2011-11-18,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Today I'll take you through our Q2 results with brief update on the first half and the shape and facing of the P&L as we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year. Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong t",2156,"Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Today I'll take you through our Q2 results with brief update on the first half and the shape and facing of the P&L as we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong top line performance, continuing investments to drive future growth and productivity and significant challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice. In short, we are largely in line with our expectations and driving growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Let's first ground you on our EPS performance on a reported constant currency and x items basis. To summarize for Q2, reported EPS was $0.73 which reflects $0.08 of charges for one-time productivity investments announced back in May. Stripping out special items in a favorable impact of foreign currency this quarter, EPS was $0.78, flat to prior year. Note, however, that this includes the higher cost for Project Keystone that we discussed back in May. And finally, EPS, excluding special charges, was $0.81, up 4%. Now before going through the P&L x items, let's quickly review the special charges for the quarter. They included $14 million of several severance and employee benefit costs for reducing the global workforce, $12 million of asset write-offs associated with the closure of 5 factories, and $11 million of other implementation expenses primarily related to the supply-chain hub in Europe. Overall, we recorded a pretax charges of $37 million or $0.08 per share. The entire amount was reported in the non-operating segment of our financial statements. 
Now turning to the P&L scorecard x items. Revenue growth was driven by recent acquisitions, foreign currency and organic sales growth. Gross margin was down 180 basis points, reflecting the results in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, as well as what we expect as the toughest commodity overlap of the year. We continued to invest in marketing, up about 9.5% and operating income was down, more than all of which was due to Australia and U.S. Foodservice, align for the rest of the company was up by more than 5%. In terms of currency movements, we benefited by $0.03 from foreign exchange, driven by the pound and the euro which have exhibited surprising strength in the face of sovereign debt concerns on the continent. These currency movements offset a portion of the very high inflation we experienced in the quarter. 
Taking a look at the P&L, let's focus on a few lines that haven't yet reviewed. We increased G&A reflects the impact of acquisitions, increased capabilities in Emerging Markets and investments in Project Keystone, partially offset by aggressive cost management in developed markets. Below operating income, higher net interest expense was more than offset by currency gains share. And as we projected on last quarter's earnings call, our effective tax rate was very favorable for the quarter, benefiting from effective international tax planning and positive international audit settlements. 
Looking at the key components of revenue growth. Organic sales grew by 1.5% and constant currency sales grew almost 6%. The volume was down due to Australia with declines in the restaurant traffic in the U.S. Foodservice, and as a result of price increases and promotional timing in the U.K. and the U.S. Price improvements are about 4.5% were driven by the U.K., the U.S., Latin America and China. Our recent acquisitions are performing very well and increased company sales by 5%. This was partially offset by the exit of the Boston Market license in the U.S. and foreign exchange budgeted almost 2.5 points to sales growth. As I noted earlier, gross margin decline 180 basis points, half of which related to Australia and U.S. Foodservice. Overall, Mark inflation on commodities was about 10% this quarter. This double-digit inflation represents more than 400 basis points of margin in Q2 and we expect this inflation rate to be the high watermark for the year. While we delivered solid pricing and productivity gains, they only partially offset this very significant inflation. Market inflation on commodities was driven primarily by sweeteners, resin for plastic models, beans and dairy products. While we continue to expect moderating cost comparisons in the second half, full year market inflation is not expected to be about 7.5% or 50 basis points higher than our projections back in May. This represents an additional hurdle of about $0.05 of EPS. 
As high as our inflation rate was in Q2, the CRB commodity inflation index increased in even higher rate. It was up 15% in our second quarter, 5 points higher than the market rate of increase on our commodities. It is important to note this sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year. This is what gives us confidence that our cost comparisons will become progressively easier through the remainder of our fiscal year. 
Now let's take a quick look at the top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted relatively flat results from a very difficult market. Organic sales were up slightly and at 0.3% offset by a 2% impact from the exit of the Boston Market license. Operating income was down about 1 point. We generated solid sales growth in frozen entrées, ketchup and another sauces, offset by lower sales are frozen potatoes in Classico pasta sauce. Driven Mike Shea Gates is the category was down, reflecting exceptionally low consumer confidence in the U.S. Gross margin was impacted by commodity inflation, which outpaced pricing and productivity gains. Given the tough economy, we aggressively manage discretionary spending and are adapting to the changing environment. As Bill discussed, we are addressing our value equation and launching new products with more compelling price points. U.S. Foodservice business had a difficult quarter and a very tough environment. Overall, sales were down almost 3% and Ore-Ida declined 33%. As Bill said, Q2 sales were impacted by declines in customer traffic and promotional timing. Compounding the weak traffic trends, commodity inflation in the U.S. Foodservice impacted gross margin by more than 500 basis points. We expect better performance in Foodservice over the back half of the year with improved price realization, moderating commodity inflation, increased productivity and a better overlap in SG&A. Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz posted a very solid results in Europe with constant currency sales up almost 3% and operating income up about 3.5%. The U.K., Germany, Nordics, Eastern Europe and Russia set the pace for sales growth in the region. Organic sales growth and gross margins were up based on pricing and increased marketing. We continued to deliver strong growth on our flagship ketchup product in Europe. For the quarter, organic sales of ketchup were up about 6%. The growth across much of the region was partially offset by reduced organic sales in Italy where the key baby food categories declined during that quarter. Importantly, we continued to drive our aggressive change agenda across Europe. As part of this, we move forward in Project Keystone with the rollout of new processes and initiation of the project in Germany, brought the Netherlands and the Nordic supply-chain how model and broke ground on the new European innovation center which should be a key catalyst for faster and more effective new product development in Europe. Overall, we delivered very solid results in a tough year market and continued to invest for the future. 
Asia-Pacific region posted mid-single-digit constant currency sales growth but incurred a sizable reduction in profitability during the quarter. Emerging Markets continued to drive strong growth, driven by Complan in India, ABC sauces in Indonesia and both my baby food and Western sauce in China. Additionally, we're seeing great growth in Foodstar. Lower profit reflects the performance in Australia. As Bill mentioned, we are taking very aggressive action in this market. With the new managing Director in place, we're improving commercial capabilities, dramatically simple to find the business, reducing the cost structure and focusing on better day-to-day execution. 
Underscoring that dichotomy in sales growth trends in this segment, constant currency sales from Emerging Markets grew 31% in the quarter while Australia's top line was down and the double-digit rate in the other developed markets in the region were basically flat. August and September were particularly difficult in Australia following a price increase with better trends in October and early November. 
Turning to the rest of world segment. Constant currency sales more than doubled while operating income grew more than 150%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in Latin America reflecting price, volume and share growth. The strong start with claret in Brazil, largely related to good growth in the sauces category. Importantly, we just recently launched the first TV advertising in the company's history. And finally, we are launching new baby food pouches in Mexico and Central America. 
Moving to cash flow. Our operating free cash flow was $131 million for the quarter. This is down versus last year but in line with our planned expectations. The reduction versus fiscal 2011 largely reflects the impact of higher inventories and one-time productivity charges. Capital expenditures of 3.6% of sales were higher than last year but again, in line with expectations for the year. 
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at the total cost of $73 million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year. 
Now let's take a very brief for look at the results for the first half. Year-to-date P&L show sales up 11.5% and EPS up almost 4%. These are in line with our expectations, but the shape of the P&L is different from the plan. Gross margin is lower which is offset by a lower tax rate, strong performance in the U.K. and Emerging Markets. In terms of the balance sheet, the year-to-date cash flow of $228 million is below prior year due to inventory, cash taxes, capital spending and special items. We expect accelerate cash flow in the back half, consistent with our typical annual phasing. Net debt to EBITDA is up slightly, reflecting our emerging market acquisitions late last fiscal year but remains low at 2.1x. ROIC is down, also due to the acquisition, but excluding the Quero deal, ROIC would be up 10 basis points. 
Now I'd like to make a couple of comments on the full year outlook. As Bill said earlier, we remain on track for the full year sales and EPS outlook that we discussed back in May. On a constant currency x items basis, we expect sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8%. And we continued to expect operating free cash flow of $1.15 billion before one-time productivity charges. Now clearly, given the economic headwinds we are facing and the difficulties we are encountering U.S. Foodservice and Australia, we expect to get to our full year EPS target in a different way. Specifically, versus the original plan we discussed in May, we expect a lower gross margin, driven by higher commodity inflation and challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, offset by stronger results in Emerging Markets in the U.K., reduced SG&A costs through tight management of discretionary spending, lower net interest expense from lower market rates, and strong treasury management and lower taxes with a global effective tax rate in the mid-20s related to a very effective foreign tax planning and favorable international audit settlements. 
And I want to reiterate what I said last quarter. We expect Q3 EPS to be higher than Q2 and Q4 EPS to be higher than Q3. 
Before summarizing, I want to update you special items for the year. As you'll call back in May, we discussed productivity initiatives that would have an impact of $160 million of operating income, $0.35 of EPS and $130 million of cash flow. We believe we are on track for these projects in terms of timing, costs and benefits. And in order to even more drastically address the difficult environment in which we are operating, we continued to look for additional opportunities to simplify the business and drive shareholder value. As a result of this effort, we've identified additional projects in FY '12 that will cost $55 million of OI, $0.15 of EPS and $20 million of cash flow. These projects are expected to result in the closure of another 3 factories worldwide. We'll talk more about these projects in the coming months. 
So in summary, we are posting solid sales and EPS results in a very challenging environment, driving top line growth in Emerging Markets, of Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment and expecting stronger organic growth easing commodity headwinds and more favorable cost comparisons in the second half. And with that, I will turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg?"

I think, David, the thing to keep in mind on Ore-Ida is the private label has always been a big piece of this category and it's probably one of the more price sensitive brands we have in the company given the gap that has increased. We took significant pricing on Ore-Ida, nobody else moved at all on Ore-Ida. That is being corrected now as we are seeing private label prices move up and our own price are being addressed through DNA and through discussions with customers regarding what's better for the category. The second is, I think our plans were a bit feckless and . I don't think they work very well. I think they were pretty boring and we've got a lot of things in place. First, we are adding some additional DNA into the business to bring price points back down. Second, we're adding some marketing money back into the business to restore some advertising in the second half of the year, which we small package coming. We started producing this month. It will start shipping in January at $1.99 price point or probably lower and some accounts depending on what they want to do with it and that 1 pound, it offers a family of 4 a terrific value and we know that that will drive solid business while helping us in maintaining our margins. Fourth, we have a lot of new product activity coming much of which we'll talk about in our next call because a lot of it doesn't occur until Q4. We just launched 2 new sweet potato fry items in Crinkle Cut since rate cuts they've gone to the market now. We've got Ore-Ida cash flows coming probably in January. So there's a lot of activity on Ore-Ida. The issue on Ore-Ida for me was that we moved too slowly and I just did not feel that our marketing teams move quickly and aggressively enough but I can tell you in the last 2 or 3 weeks since we've taken a number of these actions, our shares in the accounts where we've done a lot of things have moved up upwards of 250 to 350 basis points, 2.5, 3.5 share points so I'm not concerning about getting it fixed. I'm just a little annoyed that it took us as long as it did."

Partly, it's a function of price point management the consumer shopping week to week, partly it's a function just a general economic malaise that we get back of our consumers and focus group research. But ultimately, we are seeing a lot of the categories downsize. Historically, what you would have seen it's priced per ounce management of the price of the consumer got a larger value sizes but we are seeing a dramatic shift to smaller sizes which is the reason we are launching the 10-ounce pouch catsup which really we've been doing in the rest of the world for quite a period of time. We brought to the country. We are doing a lot of stuff on sauces, bringing in some of the Foodservice items, rebranding them and putting them in the retail side which allow us lower price points a very good margins. But compelling price points seemed to be key as people are shopping week to week or paycheck to paycheck. And so our research clearly points out that consumers want smaller entry sizes and they want more compelling price points. And so we can give them both while protecting our margin to really driving the businesses forward."

Having said that, I think our U.K. performance which is fundamentally defied gravity's being driven by number of things. One, we'll probably have the best sales organization in the U.K. We have great insights and great leadership. We have a lot of innovation coming. We've got the Squeeze & Stir suits which just launched in July and are doing really well. We've got the pouch pasta products at a lower price point which are doing really well in the U.K. powerful brand and the Heinz brand in the U.K. so we're doing very well. But I knew aunt Bessie slightly up November, December the looks very strong in the U.K. and I know you'll all be in a hurry to try the new dock fat roast, delicious product, can't get me to try it but I'd be glad to share it with you the next time we're altogether. In the continent itself, we grew volume in Germany, France, Spain, the Nordics, I mean Poland, Russia, literally across the board. And the third thing is, that ketchup continues to grow very quickly across most of the European market. I also indicated we're introducing different pack sizes in the U.K. We're introducing pack sized sizes with free units across the rest of the continent we are looking at areas priced around EUR 1 and Italy we've got a lot of new product activity coming. They've got the newest Aseptic line just now shipping which is a big breakthrough from a product standpoint for the consumer. We're going back to individual packs and plasma so that we can price down against a consumer basically telling us they're buying fewer of everything and they what a lower price point. And so we can protect both margins and our consumers and allow them to continue to buy. But I just don't see the downside in Europe for our business. Now the other thing we've done, remember with projects core, we are consolidating our supply chain in a central location in Europe which will make us far more efficient and a lot of that efficiency is going to spent back in support of these businesses and we have a great deal of new product activity coming. We are also growing very rapidly in the Eastern markets, Poland has come back quite strongly. our Russian catsup shares this quarter hit all-time highs, the Heinz brand itself hit a 39 share in catsup in Russia which is an all-time high, our total collective Russian business hit a 57 share in catsup in the key accounts so we are continuing to drive volume in areas where we think we have competitive advantage. And if we have a recession area environment in Europe, for most of the Europeans, it's not going to be any worse from a consumer standpoint than they already perceive these to be because the things we hear back and focus groups in our research in Europe is that the Europeans don't believe they ever came out of recession. And in fact, if look at the latest Nielsen data, their online surveys where they do a lot of consumption and consumer work, consumer confidence declined in virtually every market we operate in the developed world last quarter. It went up in the developing world where we are focusing a lot of our efforts. But I feel actually pretty good about Europe. For the company itself, our second half organic sales are going to be considerably stronger than they were in the first document driven by a lot of innovation, a lot of targeted promotion and we have terrific leadership in Europe. And so if any of our businesses can withstand the recession, I think the European guys are well-positioned."

Quero first half it's up over 10% in October, it will be up over 11% in the Q3. You've got to remember in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent marketing. I believ",722,"Well, I think, and let's talk about Quero first. Quero first half it's up over 10% in October, it will be up over 11% in the Q3. You've got to remember in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent marketing. I believe we spent about $400,000 in total marketing in the first half of the year on Quero. We were short of capacity particularly in corn processing. And so we are now in the process we just turned television on for the first time ever, the first second week in November, we are just taking the Heinz brand into Quero. We've added capacity. Our supply chain came global supply chain team just came back from the visit to the factory outside of São Paulo and are raving about the opportunities, particularly on passion on tetra Pak  where we can run tetra packs faster than we can run in many parts of our business. So I think in Quero, you will see a substantial increase in second half sales as a function of the marketing investment and a lot of the new items we are putting in place. On Foodstar, my concern on Foodstar is not growth. My concern is how we're going to stay up with it. We grew 30% on the Master brand and Guanghe brand in the first half of the year. October sales were up 69%. November sales are running at about that level, north of 50%. The Shanghai factories come online but it is nowhere near ready yet to handle the kind of growth we are seeing in Foodstar. Foodstar is a function of a lot of things, a lot of new product activity, significant levels of advertising again which we haven't started yet in Quero. We've gone into our third province so in Guangdong, we are in Fujian and we've gone to Zhang. so i think Foodstar we have other thing Foodstar really helped us is also the brand which is the white bean curd market, the bread bean marketing spend and grow this and we're now launching into the red bead current market. We have a lot of new product activity to take us in together 3 segments on soy sauce. It mean, Foodstar is a business, frankly, that every time we have an update with the Chinese team, we take the number up and ask ourselves how we're going to continue to supply and then that I don't mean to be flip on that. That is a concern we have. This business is just growing so rapidly and we are only in 3 provinces. We're hitting on some 200 million people in a country of 1.2 billion. But Quero itself in the second half will grow substantially fast as we infuse marketing. Foodstar will continue its growth in the second half. And as I said at the outset, our emerging market businesses of the second quarter were up 60% organically. They're between 14% to 15% for the first half. I expect our emerging market businesses organically to be up somewhere between 10% and 20% minimally on that growth rate in the second half of the year as we lap the purchase of Foodstar, as we continued to drive significant growth in China, we have a lot of innovation coming in China, a lot of innovation coming in Poland. We have launched cheese sauce and Russia which is doing spectacularly well. This is a product that actually has out used versus ketchup and McDonald's and Russia which we supply. And so there's just a lot of activity in the Emerging Markets and while obviously we do have some concerns about the economies in those markets, if anything I think our growth rate in the second half of the year will be dramatically better on these businesses. This just a lot of activity. The other thing in Quero we've done is we've infused new management capabilities to the business Odie we do not have before, and in fact, interestingly enough, the Brazilian team has been on the phone with the U.S. team giving them insights on how to drive Dipak catch up on how to drive other businesses like they do in Brazil. So I mean I think of those 2 options, we feel pretty sanguine about where we're going."

And it's been so bad, and I will tell you in the second quarter, the bigger hit to the company, in my view, from an unexpected standpoint was in Foodservice. We actually were anticipating the Australian and issues we experienced. As Art Mentioned, we changed the management team in Australia. We are doing an aggressive job of looking at cost, we've shut down the Gary factory which is a processing plant we've had in a Australia for a number of years. We downsized 2 other facilities and reducing the number of SKUs. We have greatly improved our relationship with the 2 retailers there. That's attribute to Nigel Comer who came over from New Zealand to sort of dress up the business in terms of trying to get it fixed. We lap at the end of the third quarter, the discontinuance of tuna by 1 of the 2 major customers last year so we don't have to deal with that after the month of January. So we get a big pickup going forward from that. We've got a lot of innovation coming just a lot more clarity in terms of the focus. I mean the reality on Australia's it almost come to the point fairly material to us going forward because it has taken such a hit. A lot of activity in Australian and I feel much better about the prospects for Australia going forward than I have in several years but the key thing is the improved relationships with the retailers and our ability to start working with them on more efficient and effective promotion activity and the focus on the right brands. We are really renewing our focus in Australia in Infant/Nutrition where we think there's a significant opportunity in the category is doing well. A lot of activity in new packaging, in opportunities to reduce price points, in beans and in soup. And then just a lot of activity across the business. And so I think with the new leadership we just I said to them on a call the other day, I've seen a bounce in her step that I haven't seen the last couple of years. So I think from that standpoint, the second half of the fiscal year in Australia will perform on a relative basis dramatically better and the good news is that our expectations that you've see that we've shared with you in terms of where we think the year will end are not really expecting a lot out of our Australia in the second half."

The concerns I have relate to the productivity initiatives we are doing and will they become a distraction? The concerns I have always relate to the retention of our management team, in the businesses where we're doing well like Europe and Emerging Markets and those kinds of businesses, I worry about complacency and people taking it for granted. Yes, there are a lot of areas but I can tell you see low in the second half of the year, our organic sales are going to be up dramatically more than they were in the first half of the year. And the thing that I think people are forgetting in the second half of the year, we lapped 2 big labor situations last year, one in Latin America, one of the U.K. We've got a lot of new product activity coming that we didn't have in the second half of last year. We lap the SG&A where we really started commence spending on Keystone aggressively towards the end of Q3 and all through Q4. We had a lot of additional investments in other areas last year and as Art mentioned, we have obviously have the Brazilian close in the month of April so there's a lot of things going on in the second half of the year. But I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I am not at all sanguine about the prospects for the industry and about our business without a lot of work. We have a good leadership in place now. But I can tell you and you should recognize that with the additional productivity charges which are focus, you should assume I'm not going to detail yet where because employees haven't been talk to but you should assume their focus on our problem businesses. This is going to continue to be an ongoing struggle in an industry right now that's not being helped by the global economy, that is dealing with significant commodity inflation which lessons for us in a relative basis on the second half. I mean, I just give you some perspective. The Foodservice inflation in the second quarter was over 11% and the second half of the year it's about half that. And our pricing, we just took our third increase on Foodservice last week. We'll roll over into the next 6 months Poseidon want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I do feel very good about our emerging market prospects and I think 16% organic growth in the second quarter should not be taken for granted and I think we'll substantially improve on those numbers in the second half given hopefully the no repeat of our labor situation last year and a lot of new product activity and the fact we lap the Foodstar purchase. So there's just a lot of stuff going on. But as the people who work for me, I'm sure will be glad to tell you in a private moment, you should not think we go into these calls with our business units with the big smile on our face."

The bulk of the volume decline over the last couple of years has been related to Foodservice in Australia. I mean  Foodservice volume, this is not new news. It's been declining for 3 years. Our expectation for Foodservice where we would see a turnaround in the industry this year and that the structural dynamics that have worked against us so aggressively would reverse. They have not. And so the bulk of that volume decline in Q2 was Foodservice, and to a lesser degree, Australia from a volume perspective. But there is no doubt, Jonathan, that you're going to see a significant shift. I mean one of the things, again, I'm not trying to be Solomonic here and I'm the trying to express the wisdom of the ages, I think we need to all to keep in mind the reason we put so aggressively into these Emerging Markets is because of a recognition on the difficulty of being able to drive sustained growth in some of these businesses going forward. And again, in the second half, you'll see -- I mean the second half of our year is going to be interesting relative to the first half. What you're going to see in the second half for the year is dramatically improved organic sales versus the first half and a higher tax rate than you saw in the first half. So you're going to see almost opposite situation. But Foodservice in Australia but again in my view going forward, lesser on Australia, more in food service is really where the focus has got to be and if I break out Foodservice by the branded piece versus the nonbranded piece, the branded piece is essentially flat and where we are seeing the pressure in food services on proprietary brands that are made specifically for customers where we've lost price leverage because of the environment and the capacity available and in the categories where we don't bring branded leverage. Similar situation exists in Australia, and as I said U.K. volume was down significantly and it goes all over, I think in Q3, you'll be interested to see what U.K. volume is. I'm not going to tell you, but I think you'll get an interesting perspective as we come bank next quarter in the report. But again, there is no doubt that our shift into Emerging Markets was not done on an ad hoc opportunistic basis. It was done strategically and with intent because I will tell you my own view is that the developed world is going to get increasingly difficult in which to operate just because of the concentration of retailers on all these markets. The difficulty in categories, the pressure consumers are feeling, the ethnic and demographic shifts occurring on all these markets. And so going to see us push more aggressively and with greater alacrity into these Emerging Markets because we have to and that's why. So I think nothing we've seen this year other than I will say Foodservice has surprises. Foodservice has disappointed me because I expected the industry to turn, it has not."

In our case, one of the rules I outlined at the outset of this initiative was I was not simply picking up equipment and moving it from one edifice to another so, in other words, most of this, there are maybe 2 small exceptions. Most of this volume will shift from factories that were grossly underutilized into factories that were slightly underutilized without the need for a lot of CapEx in terms of new equipment. Now there are a few exceptions closing the Gary required us to do some things in New Zealand and moving some things out of a couple of the factories in Australia allowed us, forced us to put some capital in New Zealand which I did not like doing. But I can tell you and I'm sure Art and Meg will tell you in a private moment that this didn't come without a great deal of angst. I hate these kinds of initiatives. I don't like doing them.

We could not take the volume and move to a facility that was underutilized or had excess capacity. It was going to be very difficult to convince me to close some of these facilities. That is in, in essence what we have done. In a couple of cases, we that very low utilized factories where we have decided that our customer relationships coming out of those factories or cost to serve customers were not conducive to the kinds of margins and returns we wanted and so we've shifted away from products from a few of those customers from a few of those businesses. And as a result are not really being required to shift much of anything from utilization standpoint. Our CapEx for the first half of the year is up about $53 million to $55 million. Our inventory is up about $130 million and those are the big uses of cash in the first half of the year. Rest assured, that I'm not happy about that and I've made it abundantly clear to my team and the supply chain that this isn't just simply about, gee, I now have, I had 80 buildings, now I have 75 buildings. This is about getting a lot better and more efficient. And I think we'll be there. So the good news for us is while these things are always somewhat distracting, the reality is they have not required us to do anything above the norm to protect the safety and quality of our company and as a consequence, knock on wood, we have not suffered the same kinds of issues that others have."

We have a quality group that's headquartered in the U.K. but it's our global group that visits every single factory and also spends a lot of time in the new facilities. And I have to tell you I made a comment earlier, our people have just revisited the Carol factory and our coming back raving I mean Carol has something we don't have anything else in the world and that's a biomass generator which we're using excess sugarcane now to fire up in savings a ton of money. But if we can figure out a way to put cornhusker there, we can literally get free energy in our biggest factory. So there's a lot of activity. I will tell you, Rob, and people who have worked for me a longtime know safety and quality are the 2 single issues that I focus our team on all the time. I think employees have the right to expect to work in a safe environment and I think our brands are only as good as the quality of reputation we have and we sit with our board twice a year in the corporate social responsibilities committee and give them a detailed update on this and in my own personal goals, of which I have 4, 25% of my own personal goals are related to quality and safety, so you can be assured that we take this highly seriously. All of this reports under Mike Milone who in addition is operating responsibilities and brings an operating mindset to ensuring that these are areas of the great focus and detail and believe me, this is one of the things that goes through every one of a single productivity initiatives that we approve."

Before I take you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance, which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will als",2132,"Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Before I take you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance, which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will also discuss our expectations for sequentially stronger results in the second half of the year, especially in developed markets where pricing and commodity costs should finally equilibrate. Overall, we are still on track to achieve our full year sales and EPS outlook. 
Turning to the second quarter. I would characterize our results as strong in Emerging Markets and mixed in developed markets. Reported sales grew 8.3%, and we delivered EPS of $0.81 a share before special items. Notably, we saw a combination of continued strength in Emerging Markets mixed with softness in some developed markets, primarily Australia, and our Foodservice business in the U.S., where consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 30 years. 
Turning first to Emerging Markets. They continued to be our most powerful growth engine as they delivered 16% organic sales growth, which excludes any of our acquisitions. The growth was led by excellent results in Ketchup and Sauces in China, Latin America and Indonesia, as well as very strong performance in Complan and Infant/Nutrition. We have significant innovation still to come, and I want to be clear that I expect our Emerging Market growth rates to actually accelerate in the second half of the year. 
Importantly, our recent acquisitions, Quero in Brazil and Foodstar in China, also performed well and continued to exceed our expectations in these 2 critically important Emerging Markets. Quero sales grew 8.5% in the first half despite capacity constraints and without the benefit of any marketing investment which we commenced in early November. Sales of Foodstar's Master soy sauce brand grew around 30%, and I now expect Foodstar to deliver somewhere between $140 million and $150 million in sales this year, well above our plan. In both cases, we are focused on driving top and bottom line growth through innovation, marketing investment, channel expansion and improved capabilities. Overall, Emerging Markets generated the vast majority of the company's organic sales growth while representing over 20% of total Heinz in sales. 
The second growth driver was the performance of our Top 15 brands, which now include Quero and Master. Reported sales in our Top 15 brands, including Quero and Master, grew more than 12% and accounted for around 71% of our total sales. Excluding Quero and Master, the remaining Top 15 brands delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter. 
The third growth engine was Global Ketchup. Vested by higher pricing, strong sales results in Europe and higher volume in Latin America, Ketchup delivered excellent organic growth of 6.5% in the quarter and is up 7.4% organically year-to-date as we continued to successfully focus on innovation, new distribution and penetration opportunities. Not bad for a 135-year-old brand. 
We are keeping our flagship product healthy and growing with innovations like PlantBottle, Balsamic Ketchup and Dip & Squeeze, which was recently recognized with 2 major industry awards for innovation. Dip & Squeeze continues to build strong momentum in Foodservice. Wendy's is the latest customer to accept Dip & Squeeze, and the product is performing very well at Chick-fil-A, Dairy Queen and other quick-serve chains. Importantly, we'll shortly represent 25% of our single-serve Ketchup business, and we are essentially at full capacity. 
Separately, sales of our new retail of 10 packs of Dip & Squeeze have just commenced. This is the first time a Heinz Ketchup innovation developed primarily for restaurants has achieved broad distribution in retail store sales. 
Finally, Heinz Ketchup with balsamic vinegar will reach U.S. store shelves next month after making a splash in U.K. earlier this year and after a very successful Facebook campaign commenced in the U.S. this week. This launch exemplifies the progress we have made in sharing best practices in new product innovation globally to grow our business. 
In summary, our trio of growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, helped Heinz deliver our 26th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. 
Turning you to developed markets. They were a tale of 2 cities with many of our mature market business units posting solid results despite the tough environment, led by another outstanding performance in the U.K. On the other hand, Australia and U.S. Foodservice continued to be very challenged, as Art described last quarter. In Australia, we are confronting a combination of weak categories, relentless promotional pressure and growing private label, as well as executional issues. We have significantly upgraded the management team and are aggressively working to simplify the business and reduce costs. 
Overall, we are taking action on many fronts to improve our margins. We are eliminating hundreds of SKUs, closing the sauces production facility in Girgarre, downsizing 2 other factories, reducing overheads and are working with suppliers and retailers to improve overall efficiency in terms of logistics and promotions. 
Turning to U.S. Foodservice. After 2 years of favorable profit trends, this year is clearly proving difficult. We are being challenged by significant increases in commodity costs, promotional price pressure and nonbranded back-of-house products and the lag in price realization at national accounts, as well as a downturn in traffic at key customers. 
The industry poses structural challenges to growth, and consequently, we are carefully reviewing the makeup of the Foodservice portfolio to determine where we are competitively advantaged. Our branded KC&S business, for example, is performing much better than our brand in the more commodity-oriented lines. We will share more on this during future updates, but for now, we're close in several factories and streamlining back-office activities to further reduce costs and eliminate what has become redundant capacity. 
We expect substantial improvement in Foodservice profit over the balance of the fiscal year as we lapped the onset of higher commodity costs last year and benefit from the rollover of our pricing initiatives. Together, these 2 actions alone should be worth approximately $20 million to $25 million in incremental operating profit in the second half of the year versus our first half performance. We anticipate substantial improvement in both Foodservice in Australia during the second half in response to our recent actions. 
Stepping back and viewing North America in aggregate, the combination of steep unemployment and historically low consumer confidence dampened consumer grocery spending in August and September, especially in the frozen food aisle. Importantly, we saw improvement in October, which is continuing into November. North American sales results reflect category weakness across the frozen aisle, as well as price-related volume softness on our item. Overall, our Ambient product line performed far better. Consequently, organic sales in North American Consumer Products would have been up almost 2%, excluding Ore-Ida. I am encouraged by the continued growth in Smart Ones share behind the launch of bag meals and several breakfast line extensions, although the frozen nutritional category does remain soft, in line with consumer confidence. 
We are launching a number of innovative new frozen Ambient products in the third quarter that have been tailored specifically to meet the needs of U.S. consumers with tight grocery budgets. Our launch included several items with compelling price points of $0.99 and $1.99. These products have been developed to deliver the same great taste that we always do and value and affordable sizes while maintaining, and in some cases, building on historical margins. The initiative will feature a new 10-ounce version of Heinz Ketchup and standup pouch packaging with a spout and a suggested retail price of $0.99. 
Many other products will also be priced around $1, including new retail sizes of Heinz mustard, Heinz Worcestershire sauce and Heinz 57 sauce. Additionally, we have just launched Heinz Home Style Beans by slightly higher than $1 after encouraging results in the number of test stores. Over the years, countless U.S. consumers have requested that we bring back Heinz beans, and we believe this is the right time for the return of this convenient, nutritious and value-oriented classic. Consumers have been turning to comfort foods during the recession, and the recent consumer opinion poll ranked baked beans as the #2 comfort food. 
In frozen, we are launching a 1 pound bag of Ore-Ida French fries late in the quarter at the suggested retail price of $1.99 to address consumer requests for increased affordability. Data shows that 1/3 to 1/2 of unit purchases in many U.S. product categories are now have small-size SKUs as many consumers are shopping from week to week to stretch their food dollars. Importantly, these new products will enhance our ability to serve the rapidly growing number of U.S. households with incomes below $50,000. As you can see, this income bracket has grown 3x faster than households with income above that threshold. 
Overall, U.S. consumers remain loyal to Heinz and are extremely satisfied over the quality and value of our products. That fact was reinforced this week when were notified than Heinz ranked first in overall customer satisfaction among all of the 225 companies across 47 industries in the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all companies with an overall customer satisfaction score of 89, which measures performance in quality, value, consumer loyalty and consumer expectations. The Heinz brand topped all brands ranging from Apple and Cadillac to Google and Lexus. Heinz also led all food manufacturers for the 12th year in a row with a score 8 points higher than the industry average. 
Outside North America, we are responding to consumers' desires to economize on a price-per-ounce basis by introducing Extra Free packs of beans and soup in the U.K. and a 1.5-liter variety of Heinz Ketchup across continental Europe. 
In Europe where the economic climate remains volatile, Heinz will also launch a number of products priced around EUR 1, including entry-priced varieties of Plasmon, the leading brand of baby food in Italy. 
In addition to innovation, marketing is a key to unlocking growth in our core portfolio. Marketing spend is up strongly year-to-date, and I expect it to increase at a high single-digit rate for the year to help drive stronger organic growth across the second half. In addition to continued marketing investment behind our leading brands, we remain committed to our sizable investment in Keystone, our global initiative to upgrade and standardize processes and systems. We continue to take a long-term view of the company, and these investments will position us well in the future. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we expect our second half results to benefit from improved results in U.S. Foodservice in Australia, rollover pricing and a relative easing of commodity inflation, stronger volume, as well as even greater growth in Emerging Markets than we experienced in Q1 and Q2. We are making progress in our value engineering and productivity initiatives, and I am pleased with our results in this area. And as always, we will not sacrifice quality and safety in the name of savings. 
SG&A comparisons in the second half should be easier as well than they were in the first half. As you will recall, in the back half of last fiscal year, we were affected by some nonrecurring expenses such as the closing cost of the Quero acquisition, increased investment to drive innovation and fund expansion in Emerging Markets, and we significantly stepped up our investment in Keystone. Our investment in Keystone is a critically important component of our productivity initiative, but it does represent a substantial headwind. 
Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, we remain on track to achieve our previously announced constant currency EPS outlook of $3.24 to $3.32 for the full year, excluding special charges for our onetime productivity initiatives. Heinz continues to expect constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8% for the full year excluding the special charges. We also expect strong operating free cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion for the year excluding charges of more than $1 billion on a reported basis. 
Overall, Heinz continues to drive strong growth in Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. We are taking decisive but prudent actions to reduce cost and develop markets, and we are continuously analyzing additional programs to drive increased shareholder value. Furthermore, we are evaluating numerous M&A opportunities in the emerging world to build on our already strong momentum. With our continuing focus on operating discipline and productivity investments, we believe we are well positioned to continue driving solid organic growth, led by our trio growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, which, by the way, continues to support our troops via the Wounded Warrior program, which is working very well for us. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."

Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong",2163,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results with brief update on the first half and the shape and phasing in the P&L as we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong top line performance, continuing investments to drive future growth and productivity and significant challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice. In short, we are largely in line with our expectations and driving growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Let's first ground you on our EPS performance on a reported constant currency and x items basis. To summarize for Q2, reported EPS was $0.73, which reflects $0.08 of charges for onetime productivity investments announced back in May. Stripping out special items and the favorable impact of foreign currency this quarter, EPS was $0.78, flat to prior year. Note, however, that this includes the higher cost for Project Keystone that we discussed back in May. And finally, EPS, excluding special charges, was $0.81, up 4%. 
Now before going through the P&L x items, let's quickly review the special charges for the quarter. They included $14 million of severance and employee benefit costs for reducing the global workforce, $12 million of asset write-offs associated with the closure of 5 factories and $11 million of other implementation expenses primarily related to the supply-chain hub in Europe. Overall, we recorded pretax charges of $37 million or $0.08 per share. The entire amount was reported in the non-operating segment of our financial statements. 
And turning to the P&L scorecard x items. Revenue growth was driven by recent acquisitions, foreign currency and organic sales growth. Gross margin was down 180 basis points, reflecting the results in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, as well as what we expect as the toughest commodity overlap of the year. We continued to invest in marketing, up about 9.5%, and operating income was down, more than all of which was due to Australia and U.S. Foodservice. OI for the rest of the company was up by more than 5%. In terms of currency movements, we benefited by $0.03 from foreign exchange, driven by the pound and the euro, which have exhibited surprising strength in the face of sovereign debt concerns on the continent. These currency movements offset a portion of the very high inflation we experienced in the quarter. 
Taking a look at the P&L, let's focus on a few lines I haven't yet reviewed. Increased SG&A reflects the impact of acquisitions, increased capabilities in Emerging Markets and investments in Project Keystone, partially offset by aggressive cost management in developed markets. Below operating income, higher net interest expense was more than offset by currency gains this year. And as we projected on last quarter's earnings call, our effective tax rate was very favorable for the quarter, benefiting from effective international tax planning and positive international audit settlements. 
Looking at the key components of revenue growth. Organic sales grew by 1.5%, and constant currency sales grew almost 6%. Volume was down due to Australia with declines in the restaurant traffic in the U.S. Foodservice and as a result of price increases and promotional timing in the U.K. and the U.S. Price improvements of about 4.5% were driven by the U.K., the U.S., Latin America and China. Our recent acquisitions are performing very well and increased company sales by 5%. This was partially offset by the exit of the Boston Market license in the U.S., and foreign exchange contributed almost 2.5 points to sales growth. As I noted earlier, gross margin declined 180 basis points, half of which related to Australia and U.S. Foodservice. 
Overall, margin inflation on commodities was about 10% this quarter. This double-digit inflation represents more than 400 basis points of margin in Q2, and we expect this inflation rate to be the high watermark for the year. While we delivered solid pricing and productivity gains, they only partially offset this very significant inflation. Market inflation on commodities was driven primarily by sweeteners, resin for plastic bottles, beans and dairy products. While we continue to expect moderating cost comparisons in the second half, full year market inflation is now expected to be about 7.5% or 50 basis points higher than our projections back in May. This represents an additional hurdle of about $0.05 of EPS. 
As high as our inflation rate was in Q2, the CRB commodity inflation index increased in even higher rate. It was up 15% in our second quarter, 5 points higher than the market rate of increase on our commodities. It is important to note this sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year. This is what gives us confidence that our cost comparisons will become progressively easier through the remainder of our fiscal year. 
Now let's take a quick look at the top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted relatively flat results from a very difficult market. Organic sales were up slightly at 0.3%, offset by a 2% impact from the exit of the Boston Market license. Operating income was down about 1 point. We generated solid sales growth in frozen entrées, ketchup and another sauces, offset by lower sales of Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and Classico pasta sauce. Our growth in frozen entrées was driven by share gains since the category was down, reflecting exceptionally low consumer confidence in the U.S. 
Gross margin was impacted by commodity inflation, which outpaced pricing and productivity gains. Given the tough economy, we aggressively manage discretionary spending and are adapting to the changing environment. As Bill discussed, we are addressing our price-value equation and launching new products with more compelling price points. 
U.S. Foodservice business had a difficult quarter and a very tough environment. Overall, sales were down almost 3%, and OI declined 33%. As Bill said, Q2 sales were impacted by declines in customer traffic and promotional timing. Compounding the weak traffic trends, commodity inflation in the U.S. Foodservice impacted gross margin by more than 500 basis points. We expect better performance in Foodservice over the back half of the year with improved price realization, moderating commodity inflation, increased productivity and a better overlap in SG&A. 
Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz posted very solid results in Europe with constant currency sales up almost 3% and operating income up about 3.5%. The U.K., Germany, Nordics, Eastern Europe and Russia set the pace for sales growth in the region. Organic sales growth and gross margins were up based on pricing and increased marketing. We continued to deliver strong growth on our flagship Ketchup product in Europe. For the quarter, organic sales of Ketchup were up about 6%. The growth across much of the region was partially offset by reduced organic sales in Italy where the key baby food categories declined during the quarter. 
Importantly, we continued to drive our aggressive change agenda across Europe. As part of this, we move forward in Project Keystone with the rollout of new processes and initiation of the project in Germany, brought the Netherlands and the Nordic into the supply-chain hub model and broke ground on the new European innovation center, which should be a key catalyst for faster and more effective new product development in Europe. Overall, we delivered very solid results in the tough European market and continued to invest for the future. 
Asia Pacific region posted mid-single-digit constant currency sales growth but incurred a sizable reduction in profitability during the quarter. Emerging Markets continued to drive strong growth, driven by Complan in India, ABC sauces in Indonesia and by both baby food and Weijixian [ph] sauces in China. Additionally, we're seeing great growth in Foodstar. Lower profit reflects the performance in Australia. As Bill mentioned, we're taking very aggressive action in this market. With the new Managing Director in place, we're improving commercial capabilities, dramatically simplifying the business, reducing the cost structure and focusing on better day-to-day execution. 
Underscoring the dichotomy in sales growth trends in this segment. Constant currency sales from Emerging Markets grew 31% in the quarter, while Australia's top line was down on the double-digit rate. And the other developed markets in the region were basically flat. August and September were particularly difficult in Australia, following a price increase with better trends in October and early November. 
Turning to the Rest of World segment. Constant currency sales more than doubled, while operating income grew more than 150%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in Latin America, reflecting price, volume and share growth. The strong start with Quero in Brazil, largely related to good growth in the sauces category. And importantly, we just recently launched the first TV advertising in the company's history. And finally, we're launching new baby food pouches in Mexico and Central America. 
Moving to cash flow. Our operating free cash flow was $131 million for the quarter. This is down versus last year but in line with our plan and expectations. The reduction versus fiscal 2011 largely reflects the impact of higher inventories and onetime productivity charges. Capital expenditures of 3.6% of sales were higher than last year, but again, in line with expectations for the year.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at the total cost of $73 million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year. 
Now let's take a very brief for look at the results for the first half. Year-to-date P&L show sales up 11.5% and EPS up almost 4%. These are in line with our expectations, but the shape of the P&L is different from the plan. Gross margin is lower, which is offset by a lower tax rate and strong performance in the U.K. and Emerging Markets. In terms of the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow of $228 million is below prior year due to inventory, cash taxes, capital spending and special items. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back half, consistent with our typical annual phasing. Net debt to EBITDA was up slightly, reflecting our emerging market acquisitions late last fiscal year, but remains low at 2.1x. ROIC was down, also due to the acquisition. But excluding the Quero deal, ROIC would be up 10 basis points. 
Now I'd like to make a couple of comments on the full year outlook. As Bill said earlier, we remain on track for the full year sales and EPS outlook that we discussed back in May. On a constant currency x items basis, we expect sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8%. And we continued to expect operating free cash flow of $1.15 billion before onetime productivity charges. 
And clearly, given the economic headwinds we are facing and the difficulties we are encountering in U.S. Foodservice and Australia, we expect to get to our full year EPS target in a different way. Specifically, versus the original plan we discussed in May, we expect a lower gross margin, driven by higher commodity inflation and challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, offset by stronger results in Emerging Markets in the U.K., reduced SG&A costs through tight management of discretionary spending, lower net interest expense from lower market rates and strong treasury management and lower taxes with a global effective tax rate in the mid-20s related to a very effective foreign tax planning and favorable international audit settlements. 
And I want to reiterate what I said last quarter. We expect Q3 EPS to be higher than Q2 and Q4 EPS to be higher than Q3. 
And before summarizing, I want to update you on special items for the year. As you'll recall back in May, we discussed productivity initiatives that would have an impact of $160 million of operating income, $0.35 of EPS and $130 million of cash flow. We believe we are on track for these projects in terms of timing, costs and benefits. 
And in order to even more aggressively address the difficult environment in which we are operating, we have continued to look for additional opportunities to simplify the business and drive shareholder value. As a result of this effort, we've identified additional projects in FY '12 that will cost $55 million of OI, $0.15 of EPS and $20 million of cash flow. These projects are expected to result in the closure of another 3 factories worldwide. We'll talk more about these projects in the coming months. 
So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a very challenging environment, driving top line growth in Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment and expecting stronger organic growth, easing commodity headwinds and more favorable cost comparisons in the second half. 
With that, I will turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg?"

I think, David, the thing to keep in mind on Ore-Ida is the private label has always been a big piece of this category, and it's probably one of the more price-sensitive brands we have in the company given the gap that has increased. We took significant pricing on Ore-Ida. Nobody else moved at all on Ore-Ida. That is being corrected now as we're seeing private label prices move up, and our own price are being addressed through D&A and through discussions with customers regarding what's better for the category. The second is, I think our plans were a bit feckless and pallid. I don't think they work very well. I think they were pretty boring. And so we've got a lot of things in place. First, we are adding some additional D&A into the business to bring price points back down. Second, we're adding some marketing money back into the business to restore some advertising in the second half of the year, which we know drives this brand pretty well. Third, we have the small-size package coming. We started producing this month. It will start shipping in January at $1.99 price point or probably lower and some accounts, depending on what they want to do with it. And that 1 pound, it offers a family of 4 a terrific value, and we know that, that will drive solid business while helping us in maintaining our margins. Fourth, we have a lot of new product activity coming, much of which we'll talk about in our next call because a lot of it doesn't occur until Q4. We've just launched 2 new sweet potato fry items in Crinkle Cuts and Straight Cuts. They've just gone into the -- or just going into the market now. We've got Ore-Ida cash flows coming probably in January. So there's a lot of activity on Ore-Ida. The issue on Ore-Ida for me was that we moved too slowly. And I just did not feel that our marketing teams moved quickly and aggressively enough, but I can tell you, in the last 2 or 3 weeks since we've taken a number of these actions, our shares in the accounts where we've done a lot of things have moved up upwards of 250 to 350 basis points, 2.5, 3.5 share points. So I'm not concerning about getting it fixed. I'm just a little annoyed that it took us as long as it did."

The consumer data, and I mentioned in my comments, says that half of consumers now are buying smaller sizes with lower and more compelling price points in virtually every category in which we operate. We've seen it in Europe. It's now starting to come to the U.S. Partly, that's a function of the number of consumers shifting to dollar stores. Partly, it's a function of price point management with consumer shopping week to week. Partly, it's a function -- just a general economic malaise that we get back of our consumers and focus group research. But ultimately, we're seeing a lot of the categories downsize. Historically, what you would have seen it's price per ounce management on the part of the consumer where they would have gotten the larger value sizes, but we are seeing a dramatic shift to smaller sizes, which is the reason we're launching the 10-ounce pouch ketchup, Doy pack ketchup, which really, we've been doing in the Rest of the World for quite a period of time. We've brought beans into the country. We are doing a lot of stuff on sauces, bringing in some of the Foodservice items, rebranding them, putting them in the retail side, which allow us lower price points with very good margins. But compelling price points seemed to be key as people are shopping week to week or paycheck to paycheck. And so our research clearly points out that consumers want smaller entry sizes and they want more compelling price points. And so we can give them both while protecting our margin to really driving the businesses forward."

Having said that, I think our U.K. performance, which has fundamentally defied gravity, is being driven by a number of things. One, we probably have the best sales organization in the U.K. We have great insights and great leadership. We have a lot of innovation coming. We've got the Squeeze & Stir soups, which just launched in July and are doing really well. We've got the pouch pasta products at a lower price point, which are doing really well in the U.K. The U.K. team was courageous, took a lot of price. Therefore, their marketing spend is also up and orienting against a very powerful brand than the Heinz brand in the U.K. And so we're doing very well. We've got a new Aunt Bessie's lineup coming in December -- November, December that looks very strong in the U.K. And I know you'll all be in a hurry to try the new Duck Fat Roast. They're delicious product. They can't get me to try it, but I'd be glad to share it with you the next time we're all together. In the continent itself, I mean, we grew volume in Germany, France, Spain, the Nordics, I mean, Poland, Russia, literally across the board. And the third thing is that the ketchup continues to grow very quickly across most of the European market. I also indicated we're introducing different pack sizes in the U.K. We're introducing pack sizes with free units across the rest of the continent. We're looking at areas priced around EUR 1. In Italy, we've got a lot of new product activity coming. They've got the new Aseptic line just now shipping, which is a big breakthrough from a product standpoint for the consumer. We're going back to individual packs and Plasmon so that we can price down against a consumer who's basically telling us they're buying fewer of everything and they what a lower price point. And so we can protect both margins and our consumers and allow them to continue to buy. But I just don't see the downside in Europe for our business. Now the other thing we've done, remember with project score [ph], we are consolidating our supply chain in a central location in Europe, which will make us far more efficient. And a lot of that efficiency is going to spent back in support of these businesses. And we have a great deal of new product activity coming. We're also growing very rapidly in the Eastern markets. Poland has come back quite strongly. Our Russian Ketchup shares this quarter hit all-time highs. The Heinz brand itself hit a 39 share in Ketchup in Russia, which is an all-time high. Our total collective Russian business hit a 57 share in Ketchup in the key accounts. So we are continuing to drive volume in areas where we think we have competitive advantage. And if we have a recession area environment in Europe, for most of the Europeans, it's not going to be any worse from a consumer standpoint than they already perceive things to be because the things we hear back in focus groups in our research in Europe is that the Europeans don't believe they ever came out of recession. And in fact, if you look at the latest Nielsen data and their online surveys where they do a lot of consumption and consumer work, consumer confidence declined in virtually every market we operate in, in the developed world last quarter. It went up in the developing world where we are really focusing a lot of our efforts. But I feel actually pretty good about Europe. For the company itself, our second half organic sales are going to be considerably stronger than they were in the first document, driven by a lot of innovation, a lot of targeted promotion.

Quero grew 8.5% in the first half. It's up over 10% in October. It will be up over 11% into Q3. You've got to remember, in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent",751,"Well, I think -- and let's talk about Quero first. Quero grew 8.5% in the first half. It's up over 10% in October. It will be up over 11% into Q3. You've got to remember, in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent marketing. I believe we spent about $400,000 in total marketing in the first half of the year on Quero. We were short of capacity, particularly in corn processing. And so we are now in the process. We've just turned television on for the first time ever, the first second week in November. We are just taking the Heinz brand into Quero. We've added capacity. Our supply chain team, global supply chain team, just came back from the visit to the factory outside of São Paulo and are raving about the opportunities, particularly on passion on tetra pack where we can run tetra packs faster than we can run cans in many parts of our business. So I think in Quero, you will see a substantial increase in second half sales as a function of the marketing investment and a lot of the new items we're putting in place. On Foodstar, my concern on Foodstar is not growth. My concern is how we're going to stay up with it. We grew 30% on the Master brand and Guanghe brand in the first half of the year. October sales were up 69%. November sales are running at about that level, north of 50%. The Shanghai factories come online, but it is nowhere near ready yet to handle the kind of growth we are seeing in Foodstar. Foodstar is a function of a lot of things, a lot of new product activity, significant levels of advertising again, which we haven't started yet in Quero. We've gone into our third province. So we're in Guangdong. We're in Fujian. And we've gone to Zhejiang. And so I think, excuse me, Foodstar, I mean, we have a tiger by the tail. The other thing on Foodstar that really helped us is also the Guanghe brand, which is in the white bean curd market. The red bean curd market is where the growth is, and we are just now launching into the red bead current market. We have a lot of new product activity to take us into the other 3 segments on soy sauce. It mean, Foodstar is a business, frankly, that every time we have an update with the Chinese team, we take the number up and ask ourselves how we're going to continue to supply. And then that -- I don't mean to be flip on that. That is a concern we have. This business is just growing so rapidly. And we're still only in 3 provinces. We're hitting on some 200 million people in a country of 1.2 billion. But Quero itself in the second half will grow substantially faster as we infuse marketing. Foodstar will continue its growth in the second half. And as I said at the outset, our Emerging Market businesses in the second quarter were up 16% organically. They're between 14% to 15% for the first half. I expect our Emerging Market businesses organically to be up somewhere between 10% and 20% minimally on that growth rate in the second half of the year as we lap the purchase of Foodstar, as we continue to drive significant growth in China. We have a lot of innovation coming in China, a lot of innovation coming in Poland. We have launched cheese sauce in Russia, which is doing spectacularly well. This is a product that actually is out used by -- versus ketchup in McDonald's in Russia in which we supply. And so there's just a lot of activity in the Emerging Markets. And while, obviously, we do have some concerns about the economies in those markets, if anything, I think our growth rate in the second half of the year will be dramatically better on these businesses. It's just a lot of activity. The other thing in Quero we've done is we've infused new management-added capabilities to the business that we do not have before. And in fact, interestingly enough, the Brazilian team has been on the phone with the U.S. team, giving them insights on how to drive Doy pack ketchup up on how to drive other businesses like they do in Brazil. So I mean, I think from those 2 acquisitions, we feel pretty sanguine about where we're going."

I will tell you, in the second quarter, the bigger hit to the company, in my view from an unexpected standpoint, was in Foodservice. We actually were anticipating the Australian issues we experienced. As Art mentioned, we've changed the management team in Australia. We are doing an aggressive job of looking at cost. We've shut down the Girgarre factory, which is a tomato processing plant we've had in a Australia for a number of years. We downsized 2 other facilities. We're reducing the number of SKUs. We have greatly improved our relationship with the 2 retailers there. That's the tribute to Nigel Comer who came over from New Zealand to sort of dress up the business in terms of trying to get it fixed. We lap at the end of the third quarter, the discontinuance of tuna by 1 of the 2 major customers last year. So we don't have to deal with that after the month of January. So we got a big pickup going forward from that. We've got a lot of innovation coming and just a lot more clarity in terms of the focus. I mean, the reality on Australia, it's almost come to the point that it's become fairly immaterial to us going forward because it has taken such a hit. A lot of activity in Australian, and I feel much better about the prospects for Australia going forward than I have in several years, but the key thing is the improved relationships with the retailers and our ability to start working with them on more efficient and effective promotion activity and the focus on the right brands. We are really renewing our focus in Australia on Infant/Nutrition where we think the're significant opportunity and the category is doing well. A lot of activity in new packaging and opportunities to reduce price points in beans and in soup. And then just a lot of activity across the business. And so I think with the new leadership, we just -- we've seen -- I said to them on a call the other day, I've seen a bounce in their step that I haven't seen in the last couple of years. So I think from that standpoint, the second half of the fiscal year in Australia will perform on a relative basis versus first half dramatically better. And the good news is that our expectations that you've seen that we've shared with you in terms of where we think the year will end are not really expecting a lot out of Australia in the second half."

The concerns I have always relate to the retention of our management team, in the businesses where we're doing well like Europe, Emerging Markets and those kinds of businesses. I worry about complacency and people taking it for granted. Yes, there are a lot of areas. But I can tell you, Thilo, in the second half of the year, our organic sales are going to be up dramatically more than they were in the first half of the year. And the thing that I think people are forgetting in the second half of the year, we lapped 2 big labor situations last year, one in Latin America, one in the U.K. We've got a lot of new product activity coming that we didn't have in the second half of last year. We lapped the SG&A where we really started commence spending on Keystone aggressively towards the end of Q3 and all through Q4. We had a lot of additional investments in other areas last year. And as Art mentioned, we obviously had the Brazilian close in the month of April. So there's a lot of things going on in the second half of the year. But I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I am not at all sanguine about the prospects for the industry and about our business without a lot of work. We have good leadership in place now. But I can tell you and you should recognize that with the additional productivity charges, which are focus, you should assume, I'm not going to detail yet where because employees haven't been talked to, but you should assume their focus on our problem businesses. This is going to continue to be an ongoing struggle in an industry right now that's not being helped by the global economy that is dealing with significant commodity inflation which lessens for us on a relative basis in the second half. I mean, I just gave you some perspective. The Foodservice inflation in the second quarter was over 11%. In the second half of the year, it's about half that. And our pricing, we just took our third increase on Foodservice last week. We'll roll over into the next 6 months. So I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I do feel very good about our emerging market prospects, and I think 16% organic growth in the second quarter should not be taken for granted. And I think we'll substantially improve on those numbers in the second half given the, hopefully, no repeat of our labor situation last year and a lot of new product activity and the fact we lapped the Foodstar purchase. So there's just a lot of stuff going on. But as the people who work for me, I'm sure, will be glad to tell you in a private moment, you should not think we go into these calls with our business units with a big smile on our face."

In fact, you'll see it go the other way in the second half of this year as Emerging Markets become more and more important and as we plateau against some of the other businesses. The bulk of the volume decline over the last coup",564,"No. It goes the other way. In fact, you'll see it go the other way in the second half of this year as Emerging Markets become more and more important and as we plateau against some of the other businesses. The bulk of the volume decline over the last couple of years has been related to Foodservice in Australia. I mean, Foodservice volume, this is not new news. It's been declining for 3 years. Our expectations for Foodservice were that we would see a turnaround in the industry this year and that the structural dynamics that have worked against us so aggressively would reverse. They have not. And so the bulk of that volume decline in Q2 was Foodservice, and to a lesser degree, Australia from a volume perspective. But there is no doubt, Jonathan, that you're going to see a significant shift. I mean, one of the things, again, I'm not trying to be Solomonic here and I'm the trying to express the wisdom of the ages, but one the things that I think we need to all to keep in mind is the reason we have pushed so aggressively into these Emerging Markets is because of a recognition on the difficulty of being able to drive sustained growth in some of these businesses going forward. And again, in the second half, you'll see -- I mean, the second half of our year is going to be interesting relative to the first half. What you're going to see in the second half for the year is dramatically improved organic sales versus the first half and a higher tax rate than you saw in the first half. So you're going to see almost opposite situation. But Foodservice in Australia, but again, in my view going forward, lesser on Australia, more in Foodservice, is really where the focus has got to be. And if I break out Foodservice by the branded piece versus the nonbranded piece, the branded piece is essentially flat. And where we are seeing the pressure in food services on proprietary brands that are made specifically for customers where we've lost price leverage because of the environment and the capacity available and in the categories where we don't bring branded leverage. Similar situation exists in Australia. And as I said, U.K. volume was down significantly, and it goes all over. I think in Q3, you'll be interested to see what U.K. volume is. I'm not going to tell you, but I think you'll get an interesting perspective as we come back next quarter in the report. But again, there is no doubt that our shift into Emerging Markets was not done on an ad hoc opportunistic basis. It was done strategically and with intent because I will tell you, my own view is that the developed world is going to get increasingly difficult in which to operate just because of the concentration of retailers on all these markets, the difficulty in categories, the pressure consumers are feeling, the ethnic and demographic shifts occurring on all these markets. And so you're going to see us push more aggressively and with greater alacrity into these Emerging Markets because we have to, and that's why. So I think nothing we've seen this year other than I will say, Foodservice has surprises. Foodservice has disappointed me because I expected the industry to turn. It has not."

It's dollarized volume basically. It's dollarized volume. And the impact on the top line should be favorable providing that the sales are incrementally, that they're gap fillers in terms of places and people we are not reaching. And right now, our portfolio tends to skew more middle, upper income. We are very underdeveloped in the dollar stores. And so these are opportunities for us to reach a segment of the population that historically we have underserved. And so I think from that standpoint, this should represent some incremental upside for us going forward. I think the other thing is, I also said I want to be clear on this, that not all of the items. There are some exceptions to the margin enhancing and margin neutral. I won't get into specifics, but there are a few exceptions to those. But we should make up for that in terms of the incrementality. I mean, we haven't sold beans in this country, and I can't even remember the last time we sold beans here. And I've been here almost 30 years, and I think the last time we sold beans was maybe the '70s or early '80s beans in the U.S. And so we tested it. It is done very well. We have a whole line of products like that coming. And I think as we get into the third quarter call, we'll be able to specify and detail for you the items. But I think you'll find them very interesting. Frankly, some of them had me scratching my head as we looked at it, but the North American company and European companies in particular have gotten my messages regarding my concern over the top line in developed markets and the fact that we do serve this underserved population segments."

I think all of you know how I feel about CapEx in this industry. I think it's been abused over the years.

I think all of you know how I feel about CapEx in this industry. I think it's been abused over the years. I think it's been spent needlessly to add capacity and do other things that have not given consumers return or shareholders returns and haven't helped consumers. In our case, one of the rules I outlined at the outset of this initiative was I was not simply picking up equipment and moving it from one edifice to another. So in other words, most of this -- there are maybe 2 small exceptions. Most of this volume will shift from factories that were grossly underutilized into factories that were slightly underutilized without the need for a lot of CapEx in terms of new equipment. Now there are a few exceptions. Closing Girgarre required us to do some things in New Zealand, and moving some things out of a couple of the factories in Australia allowed us -- forced us to put some capital in New Zealand, which I did not like doing. But I can tell you, and I'm sure Art and Meg will tell you in a private moment, that this didn't come without a great deal of angst. I hate these kinds of initiatives. I don't like doing them. I think they're abused. I think we are a company that was criticized for that for a number of years. So one of the rules I outlined for everybody was I was not simply picking up or buying new equipment to put in another factory. We could not take the volume and move to a facility that was underutilized or had excess capacity. It was going to be very difficult to convince me to close some of these facilities. That is in, in essence, what we have done. In a couple of cases, we've had very low utilized factories where we have decided that our customer relationships coming out of those factories or the cost to serve a customer were not conducive to the kinds of margin and returns we wanted. And so we've shifted away products from a few of those customers and from a few of those businesses, and as a result, are not really being required to shift much of anything from the utilization standpoint. Our CapEx for the first half of the year is up about $53 million to $55 million. Our inventory is up about $130 million. And those are the big uses of cash in the first half of the year. Rest assured that I'm not happy about that, and I've made it abundantly clear to my team and the supply chain that this isn't just simply about, gee, I now have -- I had 80 buildings, now I have 75 buildings. This is about getting a lot better and more efficient. And I think we'll be there. So the good news for us is while these things are always somewhat distracting, the reality is they have not required us to do anything above the norm to protect the safety and quality of our company. And as a consequence, knock on wood, we have not suffered the same kinds of issues that others have."

We have a safety group as part of our risk management process. We have a quality group that's headquartered in the U.K. But it's our global group that visits every single factory and also spends a lot of time in the new facilities. And I have to tell you, I think I made a comment earlier, our people have just revisited the Quero factory and are coming back raving. I mean, Quero has something we don't have anything else in the world, and that's a biomass generator, which we're using excess sugarcane now to fire up and saving us a ton of money. But if we can figure out a way to put corn husks there, we can literally get free energy in our biggest factory. So there's a lot of activity. I will tell you, Rob, and people who have worked for me a long time know, safety and quality are the 2 single biggest issues that I focus our team on all the time. I think employees have the right to expect to work in a safe environment, and I think our brands are only as good as the quality of reputation we have. And we sit with our Board twice a year and the Corporate Social Responsibilities Committee and give them a detailed update on this. And in my own personal goals, of which I have 4, 25% of my own personal goals are related to quality and safety. So you can be assured that we take this highly seriously. All of this reports under Mike Milone who, in addition, is operating responsibilities and brings an operating mindset to ensuring that these are areas of great focus and detail. And believe me, this is one of the things that goes through every one of a single productivity initiatives that we approve."

278212,142646516,194402,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2011",2011-11-18,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Before Art takes you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance, which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will",2129,"Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Before Art takes you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance, which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will also discuss our expectations for sequentially stronger results in the second half of the year, especially in developed markets where pricing and commodity costs should finally equilibrate. Overall, we are still on track to achieve our full year sales and EPS outlook. 
Turning to the second quarter. I would characterize our results as strong in Emerging Markets and mixed in Developed Markets. Reported sales grew 8.3%, and we delivered EPS of $0.81 a share before special items. Notably, we saw a combination of continued strength in Emerging Markets mixed with softness in some Developed Markets, primarily Australia, and our Foodservice business in the U.S., where consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 30 years. 
Turning first to Emerging Markets. They continued to be our most powerful growth engine as they delivered 16% organic sales growth, which excludes any of our acquisitions. The growth was led by excellent results in Ketchup and Sauces in China, Latin America and Indonesia, as well as very strong performance in Complan and Infant/Nutrition. We have significant innovation still to come, and I want to be clear that I expect our Emerging Market growth rates to actually accelerate in the second half of the year. 
Importantly, our recent acquisitions, Quero in Brazil and Master in China, also performed well and continued to exceed our expectations in these 2 critically important Emerging Markets. Quero sales grew 8.5% in the first half despite capacity constraints and without the benefit of any marketing investment, which we commenced in early November. Sales of Foodstar's Master soy sauce brand grew around 30%, and I now expect Foodstar to deliver somewhere between $140 million and $150 million in sales this year, well above our plan. In both cases, we are focused on driving top and bottom line growth through innovation, marketing investment, channel expansion and improved capabilities. Overall, Emerging Markets generated the vast majority of the company's organic sales growth while representing over 20% of total Heinz sales. 
The second growth driver was the performance of our Top 15 brands, which now include Quero and Master. Reported sales in our Top 15 brands, including Quero and Master, grew more than 12% and accounted for around 71% of our total sales. Excluding Quero and Master, the remaining Top 15 brands delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter. 
The third growth engine was Global Ketchup. Lifted by higher pricing, strong sales results in Europe and higher volume in Latin America, Ketchup delivered excellent organic growth of 6.5% in the quarter and is up 7.4% organically year-to-date as we continue to successfully focus on innovation, new distribution and penetration opportunities. Not bad for a 135-year-old brand. 
We are keeping our flagship product healthy and growing with innovations like PlantBottle, Balsamic Ketchup and Dip & Squeeze, which was recently recognized with 2 major industry awards for innovation. Dip & Squeeze continues to build strong momentum in Foodservice. Wendy's is the latest customer to accept Dip & Squeeze, and the product is performing very well at Chick-fil-A, Dairy Queen and other quick-serve chains. Importantly, we'll shortly represent 25% of our single-serve Ketchup business, and we are essentially at full capacity. 
Separately, sales of our new retail 10 packs of Dip & Squeeze have just commenced. This is the first time a Heinz Ketchup innovation developed primarily for restaurants has achieved broad distribution in retail store sales. 
Finally, Heinz Ketchup with balsamic vinegar will reach U.S. store shelves next month after making a splash in U.K. earlier this year and after a very successful Facebook campaign commenced in the U.S. this week. This launch exemplifies the progress we have made in sharing best practices in new product innovation globally to grow our business. 
In summary, our trio of growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, helped Heinz deliver our 26th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. 
Turning you to Developed Markets. They were a tale of 2 cities with many of our mature market business units posting solid results despite the tough environment, led by another outstanding performance in the U.K. On the other hand, Australia and U.S. Foodservice continue to be very challenged, as Art described last quarter. In Australia, we are confronting a combination of weak categories, relentless promotional pressure and growing private label, as well as executional issues. We have significantly upgraded the management team and are aggressively working to simplify the business and reduce costs. 
Overall, we are taking action on many fronts to improve our margins. We are eliminating hundreds of SKUs, closing the sauces production facility in Girgarre, downsizing 2 other factories, reducing overheads and are working with suppliers and retailers to improve overall efficiency in terms of logistics and promotions. 
Turning to U.S. Foodservice. After 2 years of favorable profit trends, this year is clearly proving difficult. We are being challenged by significant increases in commodity costs, promotional price pressure and nonbranded back-of-house products and the lag in price realization at national accounts, as well as a downturn in traffic at key customers. 
The industry poses structural challenges to growth, and consequently, we are carefully reviewing the makeup of the Foodservice portfolio to determine where we are competitively advantaged. Our branded KC&S business, for example, is performing much better than our brand in the more commodity-oriented lines. We will share more on this during future updates, but for now, we're closing several factories and streamlining back-office activities to further reduce costs and eliminate what has become redundant capacity. 
We expect substantial improvement in Foodservice profit over the balance of the fiscal year as we lapped the onset of higher commodity costs last year and benefit from the rollover of our pricing initiatives. Together, these 2 actions alone should be worth approximately $20 million to $25 million in incremental operating profit in the second half of the year versus our first half performance. We anticipate substantial improvement in both Foodservice in Australia during the second half in response to our recent actions. 
Stepping back and viewing North America in aggregate, the combination of steep unemployment and historically low consumer confidence dampened consumer grocery spending in August and September, especially in the frozen food aisle. Importantly, we saw improvement in October, which is continuing into November. North American sales results reflect category weakness across the frozen aisle, as well as price-related volume softness on our item. Overall, our ambient product line performed far better. Consequently, organic sales in North America Consumer Products would have been up almost 2%, excluding Ore-Ida. I am encouraged by the continued growth in Smart Ones' share behind the launch of bag meals and several breakfast line extensions, although the frozen nutritional category does remain soft in line with consumer confidence. 
We are launching a number of innovative new frozen ambient products in the third quarter that have been tailored specifically to meet the needs of U.S. consumers with tight grocery budgets. Our launch includes several items with compelling price points of $0.99 and $1.99. These products have been developed to deliver the same great taste that we always do and value in affordable sizes while maintaining, and in some cases, building on historical margins. The initiative will feature a new 10-ounce version of Heinz Ketchup and standup pouch packaging with a spout and a suggested retail price of $0.99. 
Many other products will also be priced around $1, including new retail sizes of Heinz mustard, Heinz Worcestershire sauce and Heinz 57 sauce. Additionally, we have just launched Heinz Home Style Beans by slightly higher than $1 after encouraging results in a number of test stores. Over the years, countless U.S. consumers have requested that we bring back Heinz beans, and we believe this is the right time for the return of this convenient, nutritious and value-oriented classic. Consumers have been turning to comfort foods during the recession, and the recent consumer opinion poll ranked baked beans as the #2 comfort food. 
In frozen, we are launching a 1-pound bag of Ore-Ida French fries late in the quarter at the suggested retail price of $1.99 to address consumer requests for increased affordability. Data shows that 1/3 to 1/2 of unit purchases in many U.S. product categories are now of small-size SKUs as many consumers are shopping from week to week to stretch their food dollars. Importantly, these new products will enhance our ability to serve the rapidly growing number of U.S. households with incomes below $50,000. As you can see, this income bracket has grown 3x faster than households with income above that threshold. 
Overall, U.S. consumers remain loyal to Heinz and are extremely satisfied over the quality and value of our products. That fact was reinforced this week when were notified than Heinz ranked first in overall customer satisfaction among all of the 225 companies across 47 industries in the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all companies with an overall customer satisfaction score of 89, which measures performance in quality, value, consumer loyalty and consumer expectations. The Heinz brand topped all brands ranging from Apple and Cadillac to Google and Lexus. Heinz also led all food manufacturers for the 12th year in a row with a score 8 points higher than the industry average. 
Outside North America, we are responding to consumers' desires to economize on a price-per-ounce basis by introducing Extra Free packs of beans and soup in the U.K. and a 1.5-liter variety of Heinz Ketchup across continental Europe. 
In Europe, where the economic climate remains volatile, Heinz will also launch a number of products priced around EUR 1, including entry-priced varieties of Plasmon, the leading brand of baby food in Italy. 
In addition to innovation, marketing is a key to unlocking growth in our core portfolio. Marketing spend is up strongly year-to-date, and I expect it to increase at a high single-digit rate for the year to help drive stronger organic growth across the second half. In addition to continued marketing investment behind our leading brands, we remain committed to our sizable investment in Keystone, our global initiative to upgrade and standardize processes and systems. We continue to take a long-term view of the company, and these investments will position us well in the future. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we expect our second half results to benefit from improved results in U.S. Foodservice in Australia, rollover pricing and a relative easing of commodity inflation, stronger volume, as well as even greater growth in Emerging Markets than we experienced in Q1 and Q2. We are making progress in our value engineering and productivity initiatives, and I am pleased with our results in this area. And as always, we will not sacrifice quality and safety in the name of savings. 
SG&A comparisons in the second half should be easier as well than they were in the first half. As you will recall, in the back half of last fiscal year, we were affected by some nonrecurring expenses such as the closing cost of the Quero acquisition, increased investment to drive innovation and fund expansion in Emerging Markets, and we significantly stepped up our investment in Keystone. Our investment in Keystone is a critically important component of our productivity initiative, but it does represent a substantial headwind. 
Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, we remain on track to achieve our previously announced constant currency EPS outlook of $3.24 to $3.32 for the full year, excluding special charges for our onetime productivity initiatives. Heinz continues to expect constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8% for the full year, excluding the special charges. We also expect strong operating free cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion for the year excluding charges on more than $1 billion on a reported basis. 
Overall, Heinz continues to drive strong growth in Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. We are taking decisive but prudent actions to reduce cost and develop markets, and we are continuously analyzing additional programs to drive increased shareholder value. Furthermore, we are evaluating numerous M&A opportunities in the emerging world to build on our already strong momentum. With our continuing focus on operating discipline and productivity investments, we believe we are well positioned to continue driving solid organic growth, led by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, which, by the way, continues to support our troops via the Wounded Warrior program, which is working very well for us. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."

Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong",2153,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results with brief update on the first half and the shape and phasing in the P&L as we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong top line performance, continuing investments to drive future growth and productivity and significant challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice. In short, we are largely in line with our expectations and driving growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Let's first ground you on our EPS performance on a reported constant currency and ex-items basis. To summarize for Q2, reported EPS was $0.73, which reflects $0.08 of charges for onetime productivity investments announced back in May. Stripping out special items and the favorable impact of foreign currency this quarter, EPS was $0.78, flat to prior year. Note, however, that this includes the higher cost for Project Keystone that we discussed back in May. And finally, EPS, excluding special charges, was $0.81, up 4%. 
Now before going through the P&L ex items, let's quickly review the special charges for the quarter. They included $14 million of severance and employee benefit costs for reducing the global workforce, $12 million of asset write-offs associated with the closure of 5 factories and $11 million of other implementation expenses primarily related to the supply-chain hub in Europe. Overall, we recorded pretax charges of $37 million or $0.08 per share. The entire amount was reported in the non-operating segment of our financial statements. 
And turning to the P&L scorecard ex items. Revenue growth was driven by recent acquisitions, foreign currency and organic sales growth. Gross margin was down 180 basis points, reflecting the results in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, as well as what we expect is the toughest commodity overlap of the year. We continued to invest in marketing, up about 9.5%, and operating income was down, more than all of which was due to Australia and U.S. Foodservice. OI for the rest of the company was up by more than 5%. In terms of currency movements, we benefited by $0.03 from foreign exchange, driven by the pound and the euro, which have exhibited surprising strength in the face of sovereign debt concerns on the continent. These currency movements offset a portion of the very high inflation we experienced in the quarter. 
Taking a look at the P&L, let's focus on the few lines I haven't yet reviewed. Increased SG&A reflects the impact of acquisitions, increased capabilities in Emerging Markets and investments in Project Keystone, partially offset by aggressive cost management in developed markets. Below operating income, higher net interest expense was more than offset by currency gains this year. And as we projected on last quarter's earnings call, our effective tax rate was very favorable for the quarter, benefiting from effective international tax planning and positive international audit settlements. 
Looking at the key components of revenue growth. Organic sales grew by 1.5%, and constant currency sales grew almost 6%. Volume was down due to Australia with declines in restaurant traffic in U.S. Foodservice as a result of price increases and promotional timing in the U.K. and U.S. Price improvements of about 4.5% were driven by the U.K., the U.S., Latin America and China. Our recent acquisitions are performing very well and increased company sales by 5%. This was partially offset by the exit of the Boston Market license in the U.S., and foreign exchange contributed almost 2.5 points to sales growth. As I noted earlier, gross margin declined 180 basis points, half of which related to Australia and U.S. Foodservice. 
Overall, margin inflation on commodities was about 10% this quarter. This double-digit inflation represents more than 400 basis points of margin in Q2, and we expect this inflation rate to be the high watermark for the year. While we delivered solid pricing and productivity gains, they only partially offset this very significant inflation. Market inflation on commodities was driven primarily by sweeteners, resin for plastic bottles, beans and dairy products. While we continue to expect moderating cost comparisons in the second half, full year market inflation is now expected to be about 7.5% or 50 basis points higher than our projections back in May. This represents an additional hurdle of about $0.05 of EPS. 
As high as our inflation rate was in Q2, the CRB commodity inflation index increased at an even higher rate. It was up 15% in our second quarter, 5 points higher than the market rate of increase on our commodities. It is important to note this sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year. This is what gives us confidence that our cost comparisons will become progressively easier through the remainder of our fiscal year. 
Now let's take a quick look at the top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted relatively flat results from a very difficult market. Organic sales were up slightly at 0.3%, offset by a 2% impact from the exit of the Boston Market license. Operating income was down about 1 point. We generated solid sales growth in frozen entrées, ketchup and another sauces, offset by lower sales of Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and Classico pasta sauce. Our growth in frozen entrées was driven by share gains since the category was down, reflecting exceptionally low consumer confidence in the U.S. 
Gross margin was impacted by commodity inflation, which outpaced pricing and productivity gains. Given the tough economy, we aggressively manage discretionary spending and are adapting to the changing environment. As Bill discussed, we are addressing the Ore-Ida price/value equation and launching new products with more compelling price points. 
U.S. Foodservice business had a difficult quarter and a very tough environment. Overall, sales were down almost 3%, and OI declined 33%. As Bill said, Q2 sales were impacted by declines in customer traffic and promotional timing. Compounding the weak traffic trends, commodity inflation in U.S. Foodservice impacted gross margin by more than 500 basis points. We expect better performance in Foodservice over the back half of the year with improved price realization, moderating commodity inflation, increased productivity and a better overlap in SG&A. 
Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz posted very solid results in Europe with constant currency sales up almost 3% and operating income up about 3.5%. The U.K., Germany, Nordics, Eastern Europe and Russia set the pace for sales growth in the region. Organic sales growth and gross margins were up based on pricing and increased marketing. We continued to deliver strong growth on our flagship Ketchup product in Europe. For the quarter, organic sales of Ketchup were up about 6%. The growth across much of the region was partially offset by reduced organic sales in Italy where the key baby food categories declined during the quarter. 
Importantly, we continue to drive our aggressive change agenda across Europe. As part of this, we move forward on Project Keystone with the rollout of new processes and initiation of the project in Germany, brought the Netherlands and the Nordic into the supply-chain hub model and broke ground on the new European innovation center, which should be a key catalyst for faster and more effective new product development in Europe. Overall, we delivered very solid results in the tough European market and continued to invest for the future. 
The Asia Pacific region posted mid-single-digit constant currency sales growth but incurred sizable reduction in profitability during the quarter. Emerging Markets continue to drive strong growth, driven by Complan in India, ABC sauces in Indonesia and by both baby food and western sauces in China. Additionally, we're seeing great growth in Foodstar. Lower profit reflects the performance in Australia. As Bill mentioned, we're taking very aggressive action in this market. With the new Managing Director in place, we're improving commercial capabilities, dramatically simplifying the business, reducing the cost structure and focusing on better day-to-day execution. 
Underscoring the dichotomy in sales growth trends in this segment, constant currency sales from Emerging Markets grew 31% in the quarter, while Australia's top line was down on the double-digit rate. And the other developed markets in the region were basically flat. August and September were particularly difficult in Australia, following a price increase with better trends in October and early November. 
Turning to the Rest of World segment. Constant currency sales more than doubled, while operating income grew more than 150%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in Latin America, reflecting price, volume and share growth. The strong start with Quero in Brazil, largely related to good growth in the sauces category. And importantly, we just recently launched the first TV advertising in the company's history. And finally, we're launching new baby food pouches in Mexico and Central America. 
Moving to cash flow. Our operating free cash flow was $131 million for the quarter. This is down versus last year but in line with our plan expectations. The reduction versus fiscal 2011 largely reflects the impact of higher inventories and onetime productivity charges. Capital expenditures at 3.6% of sales were higher than last year, but again, in line with expectations for the year.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at the total cost of $73 million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year. 
Now let's take a very brief look at results for the first half. Year-to-date P&L show sales up 11.5% and EPS up almost 4%. These are in line with our expectations, but the shape of the P&L is different than planned. Gross margin is lower, which is offset by a lower tax rate and strong performance in the U.K. and Emerging Markets. In terms of the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow of $228 million is below prior year due to inventory, cash taxes, capital spending and special items. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back half, consistent with our typical annual phasing. Net debt to EBITDA is up slightly, reflecting our emerging market acquisitions late last fiscal year, but remains low at 2.1x. ROIC is down, also due to the acquisition. But excluding the Quero deal, ROIC would be up 10 basis points. 
Now I'd like to make a couple of comments on the full year outlook. As Bill said earlier, we remain on track for the full year sales and EPS outlook that we discussed back in May. On a constant currency ex-items basis, we expect sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8%. And we continue to expect operating free cash flow of $1.15 billion before onetime productivity charges. 
And clearly, given the economic headwinds we are facing and the difficulties we are encountering in U.S. Foodservice and Australia, we expect to get to our full year EPS target in a different way. Specifically, versus the original plan we discussed in May, we expect a lower gross margin, driven by higher commodity inflation and challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, offset by stronger results in Emerging Markets in the U.K., reduced SG&A costs through tight management of discretionary spending, lower net interest expense from lower market rates and strong treasury management and lower taxes with a global effective tax rate in the mid-20s related to a very effective foreign tax planning and favorable international audit settlements. 
And I want to reiterate what I said last quarter. We expect Q3 EPS to be higher than Q2 and Q4 EPS to be higher than Q3. 
And before summarizing, I want to update you on special items for the year. As you'll recall back in May, we discussed productivity initiatives that would have an impact of $160 million of operating income, $0.35 of EPS and $130 million of cash flow. We believe we are on track for these projects in terms of timing, costs and benefits. 
And in order to even more aggressively address the difficult environment in which we are operating, we have continued to look for additional opportunities to simplify the business and drive shareholder value. As a result of this effort, we've identified additional projects in FY '12 that will cost $55 million of OI, $0.15 of EPS and $20 million of cash flow. These projects are expected to result in the closure of another 3 factories worldwide. We'll talk more about these projects in the coming months. 
So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a very challenging environment; driving top line growth in Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup; continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment; and expecting stronger organic growth, easing commodity headwinds and more favorable cost comparisons in the second half. 
With that, I will turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg?"

I think, David, the thing to keep in mind on Ore-Ida is that private label has always been a big piece of this category, and it's probably one of the more price-sensitive brands we have in the company given the gap that has increased. We took significant pricing on Ore-Ida. Nobody else moved at all on Ore-Ida. That is being corrected now as we're seeing private label prices move up, and our own prices are being addressed through D&A and through discussions with customers regarding what's better for the category. The second is, I think our plans were a bit feckless and pallid. I don't think they worked very well. I think they were pretty boring. And so we've got a lot of things in place. First, we are adding some additional D&A into the business to bring price points back down. Second, we're adding some marketing money back into the business to restore some advertising in the second half of the year, which we know drives this brand pretty well. Third, we have the small-size package coming. We started producing this month. It will start shipping in January at $1.99 price point or probably lower in some accounts, depending on what they want to do with it. And at 1 pound, it offers a family of 4 terrific value, and we know that, that will drive solid business while helping us in maintaining our margins. Fourth, we have a lot of new product activity coming, much of which we'll talk about in our next call because a lot of it doesn't occur until Q4. We've just launched 2 new sweet potato fry items in Crinkle Cuts and Straight Cuts. They've just gone into the -- or just going into the market now. We've got Ore-Ida casseroles coming probably in January. So there's a lot of activity on Ore-Ida. The issue on Ore-Ida for me was that we moved too slowly. And I just did not feel that our marketing teams moved quickly and aggressively enough, but I can tell you, in the last 2 or 3 weeks since we've taken a number of these actions, our shares in the accounts where we've done a lot of things have moved up upwards of 250 to 350 basis points, 2.5, 3.5 share points. So I'm not concerned about getting it fixed. I'm just a little annoyed that it took us as long as it did."

The consumer data, and I mentioned in my comments, says that half of consumers now are buying smaller sizes with lower and more compelling price points in virtually every category in which we operate. We've seen it in Europe. It's now starting to come to the U.S. Partly, that's a function of a number of consumers shifting to dollar stores. Partly, it's a function of price point management with consumers shopping week to week. Partly, it's a function just of general economic malaise that we get back from our consumers and focus group research. But ultimately, we're seeing a lot of the categories downsize. Historically, what you would have seen is price per ounce management on the part of the consumer where they would have gotten the larger value sizes, but we are seeing a dramatic shift to smaller sizes, which is the reason we're launching the 10-ounce pouch ketchup, Doy pack ketchup, which really, we've been doing in the rest of the world for quite a period of time. We've brought beans into the country. We are doing a lot of stuff on sauces, bringing in some of the Foodservice items, rebranding them, putting them in the retail side, which allow us lower price points with very good margins. But compelling price points seem to be key as people are shopping week to week or paycheck to paycheck. And so our research clearly points out that consumers want smaller entry sizes and they want more compelling price points.

Having said that, I think our U.K. performance, which has fundamentally defied gravity, is being driven by a number of things. One, we probably have the best sales organization in the U.K. We have great insights and great leadership. We have a lot of innovation coming. We've got the Squeeze & Stir soups, which just launched in July and are doing really well. We've got the pouch pasta products at a lower price point, which are doing really well in the U.K. The U.K. team was courageous, took a lot of price. Therefore, their marketing spend is also up and oriented against a very powerful brand in the Heinz brand in the U.K. And so we're doing very well. We've got a new Aunt Bessie's lineup coming in December -- November, December that looks very strong in the U.K. And I know you'll all be in a hurry to try the new Duck Fat Roast. They're delicious product. They can't get me to try it, but I'd be glad to share it with you the next time we're all together. In the continent itself, I mean, we grew volume in Germany, France, Spain, the Nordics, I mean, Poland, Russia, literally across the board. And the third thing is that the ketchup continues to grow very quickly across most of the European market. I also indicated we're introducing different pack sizes in the U.K. We're introducing pack sizes with free units across the rest of the continent. We're looking at areas priced around EUR 1. In Italy, we've got a lot of new product activity coming. They've got the new Aseptic line just now shipping, which is a big breakthrough from a product standpoint for the consumer. We're going back to individual packs in Plasmon so that we can price down against a consumer who's basically telling us they're buying fewer of everything and they what a lower price point. And so we can protect both margins and our consumers and allow them to continue to buy. But I just don't see the downside in Europe for our business. Now the other thing we've done, remember with project score [ph], we are consolidating our supply chain in a central location in Europe, which will make us far more efficient. And a lot of that efficiency is going to be spent back in support of these businesses. And we have a great deal of new product activity coming. We're also growing very rapidly in the Eastern markets. Poland has come back quite strongly. Our Russian Ketchup shares this quarter hit all-time highs. The Heinz brand itself hit a 39 share in Ketchup in Russia, which is an all-time high. Our total collective Russian business hit a 57 share in Ketchup in the key accounts. So we are continuing to drive volume in areas where we think we have competitive advantage. And if we have a recession area environment in Europe, for most of the Europeans, it's not going to be any worse from a consumer standpoint than they already perceive things to be, because the things we hear back in focus groups in our research in Europe is that the Europeans don't believe they ever came out of recession. And in fact, if you look at the latest Nielsen data and their online surveys where they do a lot of consumption and consumer work, consumer confidence declined in virtually every market we operate in, in the developed world last quarter. It went up in the developing world where we are really focusing a lot of our efforts. But I feel actually pretty good about Europe. For the company itself, our second half organic sales are going to be considerably stronger than they were in the first half, driven by a lot of innovation, a lot of targeted promotion. And we have terrific leadership in Europe. And so if any of our businesses can withstand the recession, I think the European guys are well positioned."

Quero grew 8.5% in the first half. It's up over 10% in October. It will be up over 11% into Q3. You've got to remember, in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent",751,"Well, I think -- and let's talk about Quero first. Quero grew 8.5% in the first half. It's up over 10% in October. It will be up over 11% into Q3. You've got to remember, in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent marketing. I believe we spent about $400,000 in total marketing in the first half of the year on Quero. We were short of capacity, particularly in corn processing. And so we are now in the process. We've just turned television on for the first time ever, the first second week in November. We are just taking the Heinz brand into Quero. We've added capacity. Our supply chain team, global supply chain team, just came back from a visit to the factory outside of São Paulo and are raving about the opportunities, particularly on pouch and on tetra pack where we can run tetra pack faster than we can run cans in many parts of our business. So I think in Quero, you will see a substantial increase in second half sales as a function of the marketing investment and a lot of the new items we're putting in place. On Foodstar, my concern on Foodstar is not growth. My concern is how we're going to stay up with it. We grew 30% on the Master brand and Guanghe brand in the first half of the year. October sales were up 69%. November sales are running at about that level, north of 50%. The Shanghai factories come online, but it is nowhere near ready yet to handle the kind of growth we are seeing in Foodstar. Foodstar is a function of a lot of things, a lot of new product activity, significant levels of advertising again, which we haven't started yet in Quero. We've gone into our third province. So we're in Guangdong. We're in Fujian. And we've gone to Zhejiang. And so I think, excuse me, Foodstar, I mean, we have a tiger by the tail. The other thing on Foodstar that's really helped us is also the Guanghe brand, which is in the white bean curd market. The red bean curd market is where the growth is, and we are just now launching into the red bead curd market. We have a lot of new product activity to take us in the other 3 segments on soy sauce. It mean, Foodstar is a business, frankly, that every time we have an update with the Chinese team, we take the number up and ask ourselves how we're going to continue to supply it. And that -- I don't mean to be flip on that. That is a concern we have. This business is just growing so rapidly. And we're still only in 3 provinces. We're hitting less than 200 million people in a country of 1.2 billion. But Quero itself in the second half will grow substantially faster as we infuse marketing. Foodstar will continue its growth in the second half. And as I said at the outset, our Emerging Market businesses in the second quarter were up 16% organically. They're up between 14% to 15% for the first half. I expect our Emerging Market businesses organically to be up somewhere between 10% and 20% minimally on that growth rate in the second half of the year as we lap the purchase of Foodstar, as we continue to drive significant growth in China. We have a lot of innovation coming in China, a lot of innovation coming in Poland. We have launched cheese sauce in Russia, which is doing spectacularly well. This is a product that actually is out used by -- versus ketchup in McDonald's in Russia, which we supply. And so there's just a lot of activity in the Emerging Markets. And while, obviously, we do have some concerns about the economies in those markets, if anything, I think our growth rate in the second half of the year will be dramatically better on these businesses. It's just a lot of activity. The other thing in Quero we've done is we've infused new management-added capabilities to the business that we do not have before. And in fact, interestingly enough, the Brazilian team has been on the phone with the U.S. team, giving them insights on how to drive Doy pack ketchup and how to drive other businesses like they do in Brazil. So I mean, I think from those 2 acquisitions, we feel pretty sanguine about where we're going."

I will tell you, in the second quarter, the bigger hit to the company, in my view from an unexpected standpoint, was in Foodservice. We actually were anticipating the Australian issues we experienced. As Art mentioned, we've changed the management team in Australia. We are doing an aggressive job of looking at cost. We've shut down the Girgarre factory, which is a tomato processing plant we've had in a Australia for a number of years. We've downsized 2 other facilities. We're reducing the number of SKUs. We have greatly improved our relationships with the 2 retailers there. That's a tribute to Nigel Comer who came over from New Zealand to sort of dress up the business in terms of trying to get it fixed. We lap at the end of the third quarter, the discontinuance of tuna by 1 of the 2 major customers last year. So we don't have to deal with that after the month of January. So we get a big pickup going forward from that. We've got a lot of innovation coming and just a lot more clarity in terms of the focus. I mean, the reality on Australia, it's almost come to the point that it's become fairly immaterial to us going forward because it has taken such a hit. A lot of activity in Australia, and I feel much better about the prospects for Australia going forward than I have in several years, but the key thing is the improved relationships with the retailers and our ability to start working with them on more efficient and effective promotion activity and the focus on the right brands. We are really renewing our focus in Australia on Infant/Nutrition where we think there's significant opportunity and the category is doing well. A lot of activity in new packaging and opportunities to reduce price points in beans and in soup. And then just a lot of activity across the business. And so I think with the new leadership, we just -- we've seen -- I said to them on a call the other day, I've seen a bounce in their step that I haven't seen in the last couple of years. So I think from that standpoint, the second half of the fiscal year in Australia will perform on a relative basis versus first half dramatically better. And the good news is that our expectations that you've seen that we've shared with you in terms of where we think the year will end are not really expecting a lot out of Australia in the second half."

I worry about complacency and people taking it for granted. Yes, there are a lot of areas. But I can tell you, Thilo, in the second half of the year, our organic sales are going to be up dramatically more than they were in the first half of the year. And the thing that I think people are forgetting in the second half of the year, we lapped 2 big labor situations last year, one in Latin America, one in the U.K. We've got a lot of new product activity coming that we didn't have in the second half of last year. We lapped the SG&A where we really started commence spending on Keystone aggressively towards the end of Q3 and all through Q4. We had a lot of additional investments in other areas last year. And as Art mentioned, we obviously had the Brazilian close in the month of April. So there's a lot of things going on in the second half of the year. But I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I am not at all sanguine about the prospects for the industry and about our business without a lot of work. We have good leadership in place now. But I can tell you and you should recognize that with the additional productivity charges, which are focused, you should assume, I'm not going to detail yet where because employees haven't been talked to, but you should assume their focused on our problem businesses. This is going to continue to be an ongoing struggle in an industry right now that's not being helped by the global economy that is dealing with significant commodity inflation which lessens for us on a relative basis in the second half. I mean, and just gave you some perspective. The Foodservice inflation in the second quarter was over 11%. In the second half of the year, it's about half that. And our pricing, we just took our third increase on Foodservice last week. We'll roll over into the next 6 months. So I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I do feel very good about our emerging market prospects, and I think 16% organic growth in the second quarter should not be taken for granted. And I think we'll substantially improve on those numbers in the second half given the, hopefully, no repeat of our labor situation last year and a lot of new product activity and the fact we lapped the Foodstar purchase. So there's just a lot of stuff going on. But as the people who work for me, I'm sure, will be glad to tell you in a private moment, you should not think we go into these calls with our business units with a big smile on our face."

In fact, you'll see it go the other way in the second half of this year as Emerging Markets become more and more important and as we plateau against some of the other businesses. The bulk of the volume decline over the last couple of years has been related to Foodservice in Australia. I mean, Foodservice volume, this is not new news, has been declining for 3 years. Our expectations for Foodservice were that we would see a turnaround in the industry this year and that the structural dynamics that have worked against us so aggressively would reverse. They have not. And so the bulk of that volume decline in Q2 was Foodservice, and to a lesser degree, Australia from a volume perspective. But there is no doubt, Jonathan, that you're going to see a significant shift. I mean, one of the things, again, I'm not trying to be Solomonic here and I'm not trying to express the wisdom of the ages, but one the things that I think we need to all to keep in mind is the reason we have pushed so aggressively into these Emerging Markets is because of a recognition on the difficulty of being able to drive sustained growth in some of these businesses going forward. And again, in the second half, you'll see -- I mean, the second half of our year is going to be interesting relative to the first half. What you're going to see in the second half for the year is dramatically improved organic sales versus the first half and a higher tax rate than you saw in the first half. So you're going to see almost the opposite situation. But Foodservice in Australia, but again, in my view going forward, lesser on Australia, more in Foodservice, is really where the focus has got to be. And if I break out Foodservice by the branded piece versus the nonbranded piece, the branded piece is essentially flat. And where we are seeing the pressure in food services on proprietary brands that are made specifically for customers where we've lost price leverage because of the environment and the capacity available and in the categories where we don't bring branded leverage. Similar situation exists in Australia. And as I said, U.K. volume was down significantly, and it goes all over. I think in Q3, you'll be interested to see what U.K. volume is. I'm not going to tell you, but I think you'll get an interesting perspective as we come back next quarter in the report. But again, there is no doubt that our shift into Emerging Markets was not done on an ad hoc opportunistic basis. It was done strategically and with intent because I will tell you, my own view is that the developed world is going to get increasingly difficult in which to operate just because of the concentration of retailers in all these markets, the difficulty in categories, the pressure consumers are feeling, the ethnic and demographic shifts occurring in all these markets. And so you're going to see us push more aggressively and with greater alacrity into these Emerging Markets because we have to, and that's why.

It's dollarized volume basically. It's dollarized volume. And the impact on the top line should be favorable providing that the sales are incrementally, that they're gap fillers in terms of places and people we are not reaching. And right now, our portfolio tends to skew more middle, upper income. We are very underdeveloped in the dollar stores. And so these are opportunities for us to reach a segment of the population that historically we have underserved. And so I think from that standpoint, this should represent some incremental upside for us going forward. I think the other thing is, I also said I want to be clear on this, that not all of the items. There are some exceptions to the margin enhancing and margin neutral. I won't get into specifics, but there are a few exceptions to those. But we should make up for that in terms of the incrementality. I mean, we haven't sold beans in this country in -- I can't even remember the last time we sold beans here. And I've been here almost 30 years, and I think the last time we sold beans was maybe the '70s or early '80s  in the U.S. And so we tested it. It has done very well. We have a whole line of products like that coming. And I think as we get into the third quarter call, we'll be able to specify and detail for you the items. But I think you'll find them very interesting. Frankly, some of them had me scratching my head as we looked at it, but the North American company and European companies in particular have gotten my messages regarding my concern over the top line in developed markets and the fact that we do serve this underserved population segments."

I think all of you know how I feel about CapEx in this industry. I think it's been abused over the years. I think it's been spent needlessly to add capacity and do other things that have not given consumers return or shareholders returns and haven't helped consumers. In our case, one of the rules I outlined at the outset of this initiative was I was not simply picking up equipment and moving it from one edifice to another. So in other words, most of this -- there are maybe 2 small exceptions. Most of this volume will shift from factories that were grossly underutilized into factories that were slightly underutilized without the need for a lot of CapEx in terms of new equipment. Now there are a few exceptions. Closing Girgarre required us to do some things in New Zealand, and moving some things out of a couple of the factories in Australia allowed us -- forced us to put some capital in New Zealand, which I did not like doing. But I can tell you, and I'm sure Art and Meg will tell you in a private moment, that this didn't come without a great deal of angst. I hate these kinds of initiatives. I don't like doing them. I think they're abused. I think we are a company that was criticized for that for a number of years. So one of the rules I outlined for everybody was I was not simply picking up or buying new equipment to put in another factory. We could not take the volume and move to a facility that was underutilized or had excess capacity. It was going to be very difficult to convince me to close some of these facilities. That is in, in essence, what we have done. In a couple of cases, we've had very low utilized factories where we have decided that our customer relationships coming out of those factories or the cost to serve a customer were not conducive to the kinds of margin and returns we wanted. And so we've shifted away products from a few of those customers and from a few of those businesses, and as a result, are not really being required to shift much of anything from a utilization standpoint. Our CapEx for the first half of the year is up about $53 million to $55 million. Our inventory is up about $130 million. And those are the big uses of cash in the first half of the year. Rest assured that I'm not happy about that, and I've made it abundantly clear to my team and the supply chain that this isn't just simply about, gee, I now have -- I had 80 buildings, now I have 75 buildings. This is about getting a lot better and more efficient. And I think we'll be there. So the good news for us is while these things are always somewhat distracting, the reality is they have not required us to do anything above the norm to protect the safety and quality of our company. And as a consequence, knock on wood, we have not suffered the same kinds of issues that others have."

We have a safety group as part of our risk management process. We have a quality group that's headquartered in the U.K. But it's our global group that visits every single factory and also spends a lot of time in the new facilities. And I have to tell you, I think I made the comment earlier, our people have just revisited the Quero factory and are coming back raving. I mean, Quero has something we don't have anything else in the world, and that's a biomass generator, which we're using excess sugarcane now to fire up and saving us a ton of money. But if we can figure out a way to put corn husks through there, we can literally get free energy in our biggest factory. So there's a lot of activity. I will tell you, Rob, and people who have worked for me a long time know, safety and quality are the 2 single biggest issues that I focus our team on all the time. I think employees have the right to expect to work in a safe environment, and I think our brands are only as good as the quality of reputation we have. And we sit with our Board twice a year and the Corporate Social Responsibilities Committee and give them a detailed update on this. And in my own personal goals, of which I have 4, 25% of my own personal goals are related to quality and safety. So you can be assured that we take this highly seriously. All of this reports in to Mike Milone who, in addition his operating responsibilities, then brings an operating mindset to ensuring that these are areas of great focus and detail.

Before Art takes you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance, which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will",2129,"Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Before Art takes you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second quarter performance, which was led once again by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. I will also discuss our expectations for sequentially stronger results in the second half of the year, especially in developed markets where pricing and commodity costs should finally equilibrate. Overall, we are still on track to achieve our full year sales and EPS outlook. 
Turning to the second quarter. I would characterize our results as strong in Emerging Markets and mixed in Developed Markets. Reported sales grew 8.3%, and we delivered EPS of $0.81 a share before special items. Notably, we saw a combination of continued strength in Emerging Markets mixed with softness in some Developed Markets, primarily Australia, and our Foodservice business in the U.S., where consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 30 years. 
Turning first to Emerging Markets. They continued to be our most powerful growth engine as they delivered 16% organic sales growth, which excludes any of our acquisitions. The growth was led by excellent results in Ketchup and Sauces in China, Latin America and Indonesia, as well as very strong performance in Complan and Infant/Nutrition. We have significant innovation still to come, and I want to be clear that I expect our Emerging Market growth rates to actually accelerate in the second half of the year. 
Importantly, our recent acquisitions, Quero in Brazil and Master in China, also performed well and continued to exceed our expectations in these 2 critically important Emerging Markets. Quero sales grew 8.5% in the first half despite capacity constraints and without the benefit of any marketing investment, which we commenced in early November. Sales of Foodstar's Master soy sauce brand grew around 30%, and I now expect Foodstar to deliver somewhere between $140 million and $150 million in sales this year, well above our plan. In both cases, we are focused on driving top and bottom line growth through innovation, marketing investment, channel expansion and improved capabilities. Overall, Emerging Markets generated the vast majority of the company's organic sales growth while representing over 20% of total Heinz sales. 
The second growth driver was the performance of our Top 15 brands, which now include Quero and Master. Reported sales in our Top 15 brands, including Quero and Master, grew more than 12% and accounted for around 71% of our total sales. Excluding Quero and Master, the remaining Top 15 brands delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter. 
The third growth engine was Global Ketchup. Lifted by higher pricing, strong sales results in Europe and higher volume in Latin America, Ketchup delivered excellent organic growth of 6.5% in the quarter and is up 7.4% organically year-to-date as we continue to successfully focus on innovation, new distribution and penetration opportunities. Not bad for a 135-year-old brand. 
We are keeping our flagship product healthy and growing with innovations like PlantBottle, Balsamic Ketchup and Dip & Squeeze, which was recently recognized with 2 major industry awards for innovation. Dip & Squeeze continues to build strong momentum in Foodservice. Wendy's is the latest customer to accept Dip & Squeeze, and the product is performing very well at Chick-fil-A, Dairy Queen and other quick-serve chains. Importantly, we'll shortly represent 25% of our single-serve Ketchup business, and we are essentially at full capacity. 
Separately, sales of our new retail 10 packs of Dip & Squeeze have just commenced. This is the first time a Heinz Ketchup innovation developed primarily for restaurants has achieved broad distribution in retail store sales. 
Finally, Heinz Ketchup with balsamic vinegar will reach U.S. store shelves next month after making a splash in U.K. earlier this year and after a very successful Facebook campaign commenced in the U.S. this week. This launch exemplifies the progress we have made in sharing best practices in new product innovation globally to grow our business. 
In summary, our trio of growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, helped Heinz deliver our 26th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. 
Turning you to Developed Markets. They were a tale of 2 cities with many of our mature market business units posting solid results despite the tough environment, led by another outstanding performance in the U.K. On the other hand, Australia and U.S. Foodservice continue to be very challenged, as Art described last quarter. In Australia, we are confronting a combination of weak categories, relentless promotional pressure and growing private label, as well as executional issues. We have significantly upgraded the management team and are aggressively working to simplify the business and reduce costs. 
Overall, we are taking action on many fronts to improve our margins. We are eliminating hundreds of SKUs, closing the sauces production facility in Girgarre, downsizing 2 other factories, reducing overheads and are working with suppliers and retailers to improve overall efficiency in terms of logistics and promotions. 
Turning to U.S. Foodservice. After 2 years of favorable profit trends, this year is clearly proving difficult. We are being challenged by significant increases in commodity costs, promotional price pressure and nonbranded back-of-house products and the lag in price realization at national accounts, as well as a downturn in traffic at key customers. 
The industry poses structural challenges to growth, and consequently, we are carefully reviewing the makeup of the Foodservice portfolio to determine where we are competitively advantaged. Our branded KC&S business, for example, is performing much better than our brand in the more commodity-oriented lines. We will share more on this during future updates, but for now, we're closing several factories and streamlining back-office activities to further reduce costs and eliminate what has become redundant capacity. 
We expect substantial improvement in Foodservice profit over the balance of the fiscal year as we lapped the onset of higher commodity costs last year and benefit from the rollover of our pricing initiatives. Together, these 2 actions alone should be worth approximately $20 million to $25 million in incremental operating profit in the second half of the year versus our first half performance. We anticipate substantial improvement in both Foodservice in Australia during the second half in response to our recent actions. 
Stepping back and viewing North America in aggregate, the combination of steep unemployment and historically low consumer confidence dampened consumer grocery spending in August and September, especially in the frozen food aisle. Importantly, we saw improvement in October, which is continuing into November. North American sales results reflect category weakness across the frozen aisle, as well as price-related volume softness on our item. Overall, our ambient product line performed far better. Consequently, organic sales in North America Consumer Products would have been up almost 2%, excluding Ore-Ida. I am encouraged by the continued growth in Smart Ones' share behind the launch of bag meals and several breakfast line extensions, although the frozen nutritional category does remain soft in line with consumer confidence. 
We are launching a number of innovative new frozen ambient products in the third quarter that have been tailored specifically to meet the needs of U.S. consumers with tight grocery budgets. Our launch includes several items with compelling price points of $0.99 and $1.99. These products have been developed to deliver the same great taste that we always do and value in affordable sizes while maintaining, and in some cases, building on historical margins. The initiative will feature a new 10-ounce version of Heinz Ketchup and standup pouch packaging with a spout and a suggested retail price of $0.99. 
Many other products will also be priced around $1, including new retail sizes of Heinz mustard, Heinz Worcestershire sauce and Heinz 57 sauce. Additionally, we have just launched Heinz Home Style Beans by slightly higher than $1 after encouraging results in a number of test stores. Over the years, countless U.S. consumers have requested that we bring back Heinz beans, and we believe this is the right time for the return of this convenient, nutritious and value-oriented classic. Consumers have been turning to comfort foods during the recession, and the recent consumer opinion poll ranked baked beans as the #2 comfort food. 
In frozen, we are launching a 1-pound bag of Ore-Ida French fries late in the quarter at the suggested retail price of $1.99 to address consumer requests for increased affordability. Data shows that 1/3 to 1/2 of unit purchases in many U.S. product categories are now of small-size SKUs as many consumers are shopping from week to week to stretch their food dollars. Importantly, these new products will enhance our ability to serve the rapidly growing number of U.S. households with incomes below $50,000. As you can see, this income bracket has grown 3x faster than households with income above that threshold. 
Overall, U.S. consumers remain loyal to Heinz and are extremely satisfied over the quality and value of our products. That fact was reinforced this week when were notified than Heinz ranked first in overall customer satisfaction among all of the 225 companies across 47 industries in the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all companies with an overall customer satisfaction score of 89, which measures performance in quality, value, consumer loyalty and consumer expectations. The Heinz brand topped all brands ranging from Apple and Cadillac to Google and Lexus. Heinz also led all food manufacturers for the 12th year in a row with a score 8 points higher than the industry average. 
Outside North America, we are responding to consumers' desires to economize on a price-per-ounce basis by introducing Extra Free packs of beans and soup in the U.K. and a 1.5-liter variety of Heinz Ketchup across continental Europe. 
In Europe, where the economic climate remains volatile, Heinz will also launch a number of products priced around EUR 1, including entry-priced varieties of Plasmon, the leading brand of baby food in Italy. 
In addition to innovation, marketing is a key to unlocking growth in our core portfolio. Marketing spend is up strongly year-to-date, and I expect it to increase at a high single-digit rate for the year to help drive stronger organic growth across the second half. In addition to continued marketing investment behind our leading brands, we remain committed to our sizable investment in Keystone, our global initiative to upgrade and standardize processes and systems. We continue to take a long-term view of the company, and these investments will position us well in the future. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we expect our second half results to benefit from improved results in U.S. Foodservice in Australia, rollover pricing and a relative easing of commodity inflation, stronger volume, as well as even greater growth in Emerging Markets than we experienced in Q1 and Q2. We are making progress in our value engineering and productivity initiatives, and I am pleased with our results in this area. And as always, we will not sacrifice quality and safety in the name of savings. 
SG&A comparisons in the second half should be easier as well than they were in the first half. As you will recall, in the back half of last fiscal year, we were affected by some nonrecurring expenses such as the closing cost of the Quero acquisition, increased investment to drive innovation and fund expansion in Emerging Markets, and we significantly stepped up our investment in Keystone. Our investment in Keystone is a critically important component of our productivity initiative, but it does represent a substantial headwind. 
Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, we remain on track to achieve our previously announced constant currency EPS outlook of $3.24 to $3.32 for the full year, excluding special charges for our onetime productivity initiatives. Heinz continues to expect constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8% for the full year, excluding the special charges. We also expect strong operating free cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion for the year excluding charges on more than $1 billion on a reported basis. 
Overall, Heinz continues to drive strong growth in Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup. We are taking decisive but prudent actions to reduce cost and develop markets, and we are continuously analyzing additional programs to drive increased shareholder value. Furthermore, we are evaluating numerous M&A opportunities in the emerging world to build on our already strong momentum. With our continuing focus on operating discipline and productivity investments, we believe we are well positioned to continue driving solid organic growth, led by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, which, by the way, continues to support our troops via the Wounded Warrior program, which is working very well for us. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."

Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong",2153,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results with brief update on the first half and the shape and phasing in the P&L as we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Overall, Q2 results reflect the strong top line performance, continuing investments to drive future growth and productivity and significant challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice. In short, we are largely in line with our expectations and driving growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Let's first ground you on our EPS performance on a reported constant currency and x-items basis. To summarize for Q2, reported EPS was $0.73, which reflects $0.08 of charges for onetime productivity investments announced back in May. Stripping out special items and the favorable impact of foreign currency this quarter, EPS was $0.78, flat to prior year. Note, however, that this includes the higher cost for Project Keystone that we discussed back in May. And finally, EPS, excluding special charges, was $0.81, up 4%. 
Now before going through the P&L x items, let's quickly review the special charges for the quarter. They included $14 million of severance and employee benefit costs for reducing the global workforce, $12 million of asset write-offs associated with the closure of 5 factories and $11 million of other implementation expenses primarily related to the supply-chain hub in Europe. Overall, we recorded pretax charges of $37 million or $0.08 per share. The entire amount was reported in the non-operating segment of our financial statements. 
And turning to the P&L scorecard x items. Revenue growth was driven by recent acquisitions, foreign currency and organic sales growth. Gross margin was down 180 basis points, reflecting the results in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, as well as what we expect is the toughest commodity overlap of the year. We continued to invest in marketing, up about 9.5%, and operating income was down, more than all of which was due to Australia and U.S. Foodservice. OI for the rest of the company was up by more than 5%. In terms of currency movements, we benefited by $0.03 from foreign exchange, driven by the pound and the euro, which have exhibited surprising strength in the face of sovereign debt concerns on the continent. These currency movements offset a portion of the very high inflation we experienced in the quarter. 
Taking a look at the P&L, let's focus on the few lines I haven't yet reviewed. Increased SG&A reflects the impact of acquisitions, increased capabilities in Emerging Markets and investments in Project Keystone, partially offset by aggressive cost management in developed markets. Below operating income, higher net interest expense was more than offset by currency gains this year. And as we projected on last quarter's earnings call, our effective tax rate was very favorable for the quarter, benefiting from effective international tax planning and positive international audit settlements. 
Looking at the key components of revenue growth. Organic sales grew by 1.5%, and constant currency sales grew almost 6%. Volume was down due to Australia with declines in restaurant traffic in U.S. Foodservice as a result of price increases and promotional timing in the U.K. and U.S. Price improvements of about 4.5% were driven by the U.K., the U.S., Latin America and China. Our recent acquisitions are performing very well and increased company sales by 5%. This was partially offset by the exit of the Boston Market license in the U.S., and foreign exchange contributed almost 2.5 points to sales growth. As I noted earlier, gross margin declined 180 basis points, half of which related to Australia and U.S. Foodservice. 
Overall, margin inflation on commodities was about 10% this quarter. This double-digit inflation represents more than 400 basis points of margin in Q2, and we expect this inflation rate to be the high watermark for the year. While we delivered solid pricing and productivity gains, they only partially offset this very significant inflation. Market inflation on commodities was driven primarily by sweeteners, resin for plastic bottles, beans and dairy products. While we continue to expect moderating cost comparisons in the second half, full year market inflation is now expected to be about 7.5% or 50 basis points higher than our projections back in May. This represents an additional hurdle of about $0.05 of EPS. 
As high as our inflation rate was in Q2, the CRB commodity inflation index increased at an even higher rate. It was up 15% in our second quarter, 5 points higher than the market rate of increase on our commodities. It is important to note this sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year. This is what gives us confidence that our cost comparisons will become progressively easier through the remainder of our fiscal year. 
Now let's take a quick look at the top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted relatively flat results from a very difficult market. Organic sales were up slightly at 0.3%, offset by a 2% impact from the exit of the Boston Market license. Operating income was down about 1 point. We generated solid sales growth in frozen entrées, ketchup and another sauces, offset by lower sales of Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and Classico pasta sauce. Our growth in frozen entrées was driven by share gains since the category was down, reflecting exceptionally low consumer confidence in the U.S. 
Gross margin was impacted by commodity inflation, which outpaced pricing and productivity gains. Given the tough economy, we aggressively manage discretionary spending and are adapting to the changing environment. As Bill discussed, we are addressing the Ore-Ida price/value equation and launching new products with more compelling price points. 
U.S. Foodservice business had a difficult quarter and a very tough environment. Overall, sales were down almost 3%, and OI declined 33%. As Bill said, Q2 sales were impacted by declines in customer traffic and promotional timing. Compounding the weak traffic trends, commodity inflation in U.S. Foodservice impacted gross margin by more than 500 basis points. We expect better performance in Foodservice over the back half of the year with improved price realization, moderating commodity inflation, increased productivity and a better overlap in SG&A. 
Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz posted very solid results in Europe with constant currency sales up almost 3% and operating income up about 3.5%. The U.K., Germany, Nordics, Eastern Europe and Russia set the pace for sales growth in the region. Organic sales growth and gross margins were up based on pricing and increased marketing. We continued to deliver strong growth on our flagship Ketchup product in Europe. For the quarter, organic sales of Ketchup were up about 6%. The growth across much of the region was partially offset by reduced organic sales in Italy where the key baby food categories declined during the quarter. 
Importantly, we continue to drive our aggressive change agenda across Europe. As part of this, we move forward on Project Keystone with the rollout of new processes and initiation of the project in Germany, brought the Netherlands and the Nordic into the supply-chain hub model and broke ground on the new European innovation center, which should be a key catalyst for faster and more effective new product development in Europe. Overall, we delivered very solid results in the tough European market and continued to invest for the future. 
The Asia Pacific region posted mid-single-digit constant currency sales growth but incurred sizable reduction in profitability during the quarter. Emerging Markets continue to drive strong growth, driven by Complan in India, ABC sauces in Indonesia and by both baby food and western sauces in China. Additionally, we're seeing great growth in Foodstar. Lower profit reflects the performance in Australia. As Bill mentioned, we're taking very aggressive action in this market. With the new Managing Director in place, we're improving commercial capabilities, dramatically simplifying the business, reducing the cost structure and focusing on better day-to-day execution. 
Underscoring the dichotomy in sales growth trends in this segment, constant currency sales from Emerging Markets grew 31% in the quarter, while Australia's top line was down on the double-digit rate. And the other developed markets in the region were basically flat. August and September were particularly difficult in Australia, following a price increase with better trends in October and early November. 
Turning to the Rest of World segment. Constant currency sales more than doubled, while operating income grew more than 150%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in Latin America, reflecting price, volume and share growth. The strong start with Quero in Brazil, largely related to good growth in the sauces category. And importantly, we just recently launched the first TV advertising in the company's history. And finally, we're launching new baby food pouches in Mexico and Central America. 
Moving to cash flow. Our operating free cash flow was $131 million for the quarter. This is down versus last year but in line with our plan expectations. The reduction versus fiscal 2011 largely reflects the impact of higher inventories and onetime productivity charges. Capital expenditures at 3.6% of sales were higher than last year, but again, in line with expectations for the year.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at the total cost of $73 million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year. 
Now let's take a very brief look at results for the first half. Year-to-date P&L show sales up 11.5% and EPS up almost 4%. These are in line with our expectations, but the shape of the P&L is different than planned. Gross margin is lower, which is offset by a lower tax rate and strong performance in the U.K. and Emerging Markets. In terms of the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow of $228 million is below prior year due to inventory, cash taxes, capital spending and special items. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back half, consistent with our typical annual phasing. Net debt to EBITDA is up slightly, reflecting our emerging market acquisitions late last fiscal year, but remains low at 2.1x. ROIC is down, also due to the acquisition. But excluding the Quero deal, ROIC would be up 10 basis points. 
Now I'd like to make a couple of comments on the full year outlook. As Bill said earlier, we remain on track for the full year sales and EPS outlook that we discussed back in May. On a constant currency x-items basis, we expect sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8%. And we continue to expect operating free cash flow of $1.15 billion before onetime productivity charges. 
And clearly, given the economic headwinds we are facing and the difficulties we are encountering in U.S. Foodservice and Australia, we expect to get to our full year EPS target in a different way. Specifically, versus the original plan we discussed in May, we expect a lower gross margin, driven by higher commodity inflation and challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice, offset by stronger results in Emerging Markets in the U.K., reduced SG&A costs through tight management of discretionary spending, lower net interest expense from lower market rates and strong treasury management and lower taxes with a global effective tax rate in the mid-20s related to a very effective foreign tax planning and favorable international audit settlements. 
And I want to reiterate what I said last quarter. We expect Q3 EPS to be higher than Q2 and Q4 EPS to be higher than Q3. 
And before summarizing, I want to update you on special items for the year. As you'll recall back in May, we discussed productivity initiatives that would have an impact of $160 million of operating income, $0.35 of EPS and $130 million of cash flow. We believe we are on track for these projects in terms of timing, costs and benefits. 
And in order to even more aggressively address the difficult environment in which we are operating, we have continued to look for additional opportunities to simplify the business and drive shareholder value. As a result of this effort, we've identified additional projects in FY '12 that will cost $55 million of OI, $0.15 of EPS and $20 million of cash flow. These projects are expected to result in the closure of another 3 factories worldwide. We'll talk more about these projects in the coming months. 
So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a very challenging environment; driving top line growth in Emerging Markets, our Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup; continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment; and expecting stronger organic growth, easing commodity headwinds and more favorable cost comparisons in the second half. 
With that, I will turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg?"

I think, David, the thing to keep in mind on Ore-Ida is that private label has always been a big piece of this category, and it's probably one of the more price-sensitive brands we have in the company given the gap that has increased. We took significant pricing on Ore-Ida. Nobody else moved at all on Ore-Ida. That is being corrected now as we're seeing private label prices move up, and our own prices are being addressed through D&A and through discussions with customers regarding what's better for the category. The second is, I think our plans were a bit feckless and pallid. I don't think they worked very well. I think they were pretty boring. And so we've got a lot of things in place. First, we are adding some additional D&A into the business to bring price points back down. Second, we're adding some marketing money back into the business to restore some advertising in the second half of the year, which we know drives this brand pretty well. Third, we have the small-size package coming. We started producing this month. It will start shipping in January at $1.99 price point or probably lower in some accounts, depending on what they want to do with it. And at 1 pound, it offers a family of 4 terrific value, and we know that, that will drive solid business while helping us in maintaining our margins. Fourth, we have a lot of new product activity coming, much of which we'll talk about in our next call because a lot of it doesn't occur until Q4. We've just launched 2 new sweet potato fry items in Crinkle Cuts and Straight Cuts. They've just gone into the -- or just going into the market now. We've got Ore-Ida casseroles coming probably in January. So there's a lot of activity on Ore-Ida. The issue on Ore-Ida for me was that we moved too slowly. And I just did not feel that our marketing teams moved quickly and aggressively enough, but I can tell you, in the last 2 or 3 weeks since we've taken a number of these actions, our shares in the accounts where we've done a lot of things have moved up upwards of 250 to 350 basis points, 2.5, 3.5 share points. So I'm not concerned about getting it fixed. I'm just a little annoyed that it took us as long as it did."

The consumer data, and I mentioned in my comments, says that half of consumers now are buying smaller sizes with lower and more compelling price points in virtually every category in which we operate. We've seen it in Europe. It's now starting to come to the U.S. Partly, that's a function of a number of consumers shifting to dollar stores. Partly, it's a function of price point management with consumers shopping week to week. Partly, it's a function just of general economic malaise that we get back from our consumers and focus group research. But ultimately, we're seeing a lot of the categories downsize. Historically, what you would have seen is price per ounce management on the part of the consumer where they would have gotten the larger value sizes, but we are seeing a dramatic shift to smaller sizes, which is the reason we're launching the 10-ounce pouch ketchup, Doy pack ketchup, which really, we've been doing in the rest of the world for quite a period of time. We've brought beans into the country. We are doing a lot of stuff on sauces, bringing in some of the Foodservice items, rebranding them, putting them in the retail side, which allow us lower price points with very good margins. But compelling price points seem to be key as people are shopping week to week or paycheck to paycheck. And so our research clearly points out that consumers want smaller entry sizes and they want more compelling price points. And so we can give them both while protecting our margins and really driving the businesses forward."

Having said that, I think our U.K. performance, which has fundamentally defied gravity, is being driven by a number of things. One, we probably have the best sales organization in the U.K. We have great insights and great leadership. We have a lot of innovation coming. We've got the Squeeze & Stir soups, which just launched in July and are doing really well. We've got the pouch pasta products at a lower price point, which are doing really well in the U.K. The U.K. team was courageous, took a lot of price. Therefore, their marketing spend is also up and oriented against a very powerful brand in the Heinz brand in the U.K. And so we're doing very well. We've got a new Aunt Bessie's lineup coming in December -- November, December that looks very strong in the U.K. And I know you'll all be in a hurry to try the new Duck Fat Roast. They're delicious product. They can't get me to try it, but I'd be glad to share it with you the next time we're all together. In the continent itself, I mean, we grew volume in Germany, France, Spain, the Nordics, I mean, Poland, Russia, literally across the board. And the third thing is that the ketchup continues to grow very quickly across most of the European market. I also indicated we're introducing different pack sizes in the U.K. We're introducing pack sizes with free units across the rest of the continent. We're looking at areas priced around EUR 1. In Italy, we've got a lot of new product activity coming. They've got the new Aseptic line just now shipping, which is a big breakthrough from a product standpoint for the consumer. We're going back to individual packs in Plasmon so that we can price down against a consumer who's basically telling us they're buying fewer of everything and they what a lower price point. And so we can protect both margins and our consumers and allow them to continue to buy. But I just don't see the downside in Europe for our business. Now the other thing we've done, remember with project score [ph], we are consolidating our supply chain in a central location in Europe, which will make us far more efficient. And a lot of that efficiency is going to be spent back in support of these businesses. And we have a great deal of new product activity coming. We're also growing very rapidly in the Eastern markets. Poland has come back quite strongly. Our Russian Ketchup shares this quarter hit all-time highs. The Heinz brand itself hit a 39 share in Ketchup in Russia, which is an all-time high. Our total collective Russian business hit a 57 share in Ketchup in the key accounts. So we are continuing to drive volume in areas where we think we have competitive advantage. And if we have a recession area environment in Europe, for most of the Europeans, it's not going to be any worse from a consumer standpoint than they already perceive things to be, because the things we hear back in focus groups in our research in Europe is that the Europeans don't believe they ever came out of recession. And in fact, if you look at the latest Nielsen data and their online surveys where they do a lot of consumption and consumer work, consumer confidence declined in virtually every market we operate in, in the developed world last quarter. It went up in the developing world where we are really focusing a lot of our efforts. But I feel actually pretty good about Europe. For the company itself, our second half organic sales are going to be considerably stronger than they were in the first half, driven by a lot of innovation, a lot of targeted promotion. And we have terrific leadership in Europe. And so if any of our businesses can withstand the recession, I think the European guys are well positioned."

Quero grew 8.5% in the first half. It's up over 10% in October. It will be up over 11% into Q3. You've got to remember, in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent",751,"Well, I think -- and let's talk about Quero first. Quero grew 8.5% in the first half. It's up over 10% in October. It will be up over 11% into Q3. You've got to remember, in Quero, we spent the first 3.5 months integrating the business. We have not spent marketing. I believe we spent about $400,000 in total marketing in the first half of the year on Quero. We were short of capacity, particularly in corn processing. And so we are now in the process. We've just turned television on for the first time ever, the first second week in November. We are just taking the Heinz brand into Quero. We've added capacity. Our supply chain team, global supply chain team, just came back from a visit to the factory outside of São Paulo and are raving about the opportunities, particularly on pouch and on tetra pack where we can run tetra pack faster than we can run cans in many parts of our business. So I think in Quero, you will see a substantial increase in second half sales as a function of the marketing investment and a lot of the new items we're putting in place. On Foodstar, my concern on Foodstar is not growth. My concern is how we're going to stay up with it. We grew 30% on the Master brand and Guanghe brand in the first half of the year. October sales were up 69%. November sales are running at about that level, north of 50%. The Shanghai factories come online, but it is nowhere near ready yet to handle the kind of growth we are seeing in Foodstar. Foodstar is a function of a lot of things, a lot of new product activity, significant levels of advertising again, which we haven't started yet in Quero. We've gone into our third province. So we're in Guangdong. We're in Fujian. And we've gone to Zhejiang. And so I think, excuse me, Foodstar, I mean, we have a tiger by the tail. The other thing on Foodstar that's really helped us is also the Guanghe brand, which is in the white bean curd market. The red bean curd market is where the growth is, and we are just now launching into the red bead curd market. We have a lot of new product activity to take us in the other 3 segments on soy sauce. It mean, Foodstar is a business, frankly, that every time we have an update with the Chinese team, we take the number up and ask ourselves how we're going to continue to supply it. And that -- I don't mean to be flip on that. That is a concern we have. This business is just growing so rapidly. And we're still only in 3 provinces. We're hitting less than 200 million people in a country of 1.2 billion. But Quero itself in the second half will grow substantially faster as we infuse marketing. Foodstar will continue its growth in the second half. And as I said at the outset, our Emerging Market businesses in the second quarter were up 16% organically. They're up between 14% to 15% for the first half. I expect our Emerging Market businesses organically to be up somewhere between 10% and 20% minimally on that growth rate in the second half of the year as we lap the purchase of Foodstar, as we continue to drive significant growth in China. We have a lot of innovation coming in China, a lot of innovation coming in Poland. We have launched cheese sauce in Russia, which is doing spectacularly well. This is a product that actually is out used by -- versus ketchup in McDonald's in Russia, which we supply. And so there's just a lot of activity in the Emerging Markets. And while, obviously, we do have some concerns about the economies in those markets, if anything, I think our growth rate in the second half of the year will be dramatically better on these businesses. It's just a lot of activity. The other thing in Quero we've done is we've infused new management-added capabilities to the business that we do not have before. And in fact, interestingly enough, the Brazilian team has been on the phone with the U.S. team, giving them insights on how to drive Doy pack ketchup and how to drive other businesses like they do in Brazil. So I mean, I think from those 2 acquisitions, we feel pretty sanguine about where we're going."

I will tell you, in the second quarter, the bigger hit to the company, in my view from an unexpected standpoint, was in Foodservice. We actually were anticipating the Australian issues we experienced. As Art mentioned, we've changed the management team in Australia. We are doing an aggressive job of looking at cost. We've shut down the Girgarre factory, which is a tomato processing plant we've had in a Australia for a number of years. We've downsized 2 other facilities. We're reducing the number of SKUs. We have greatly improved our relationships with the 2 retailers there. That's a tribute to Nigel Comer who came over from New Zealand to sort of dress up the business in terms of trying to get it fixed. We lap at the end of the third quarter, the discontinuance of tuna by 1 of the 2 major customers last year. So we don't have to deal with that after the month of January. So we get a big pickup going forward from that. We've got a lot of innovation coming and just a lot more clarity in terms of the focus. I mean, the reality on Australia, it's almost come to the point that it's become fairly immaterial to us going forward because it has taken such a hit. A lot of activity in Australia, and I feel much better about the prospects for Australia going forward than I have in several years, but the key thing is the improved relationships with the retailers and our ability to start working with them on more efficient and effective promotion activity and the focus on the right brands. We are really renewing our focus in Australia on Infant/Nutrition where we think there's significant opportunity and the category is doing well. A lot of activity in new packaging and opportunities to reduce price points in beans and in soup. And then just a lot of activity across the business. And so I think with the new leadership, we just -- we've seen -- I said to them on a call the other day, I've seen a bounce in their step that I haven't seen in the last couple of years. So I think from that standpoint, the second half of the fiscal year in Australia will perform on a relative basis versus first half dramatically better. And the good news is that our expectations that you've seen that we've shared with you in terms of where we think the year will end are not really expecting a lot out of Australia in the second half."

I worry about complacency and people taking it for granted. Yes, there are a lot of areas. But I can tell you, Thilo, in the second half of the year, our organic sales are going to be up dramatically more than they were in the first half of the year. And the thing that I think people are forgetting in the second half of the year, we lapped 2 big labor situations last year, one in Latin America, one in the U.K. We've got a lot of new product activity coming that we didn't have in the second half of last year. We lapped the SG&A where we really started commence spending on Keystone aggressively towards the end of Q3 and all through Q4. We had a lot of additional investments in other areas last year. And as Art mentioned, we obviously had the Brazilian close in the month of April. So there's a lot of things going on in the second half of the year. But I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I am not at all sanguine about the prospects for the industry and about our business without a lot of work. We have good leadership in place now. But I can tell you and you should recognize that with the additional productivity charges, which are focused, you should assume, I'm not going to detail yet where because employees haven't been talked to, but you should assume their focused on our problem businesses. This is going to continue to be an ongoing struggle in an industry right now that's not being helped by the global economy that is dealing with significant commodity inflation which lessens for us on a relative basis in the second half. I mean, and just gave you some perspective. The Foodservice inflation in the second quarter was over 11%. In the second half of the year, it's about half that. And our pricing, we just took our third increase on Foodservice last week. We'll roll over into the next 6 months. So I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I do feel very good about our emerging market prospects, and I think 16% organic growth in the second quarter should not be taken for granted. And I think we'll substantially improve on those numbers in the second half given the, hopefully, no repeat of our labor situation last year and a lot of new product activity and the fact we lapped the Foodstar purchase. So there's just a lot of stuff going on. But as the people who work for me, I'm sure, will be glad to tell you in a private moment, you should not think we go into these calls with our business units with a big smile on our face."

In fact, you'll see it go the other way in the second half of this year as Emerging Markets become more and more important and as we plateau against some of the other businesses. The bulk of the volume decline over the last couple of years has been related to Foodservice in Australia. I mean, Foodservice volume, this is not new news, has been declining for 3 years. Our expectations for Foodservice were that we would see a turnaround in the industry this year and that the structural dynamics that have worked against us so aggressively would reverse. They have not. And so the bulk of that volume decline in Q2 was Foodservice, and to a lesser degree, Australia from a volume perspective. But there is no doubt, Jonathan, that you're going to see a significant shift. I mean, one of the things, again, I'm not trying to be Solomonic here and I'm not trying to express the wisdom of the ages, but one the things that I think we need to all to keep in mind is the reason we have pushed so aggressively into these Emerging Markets is because of a recognition on the difficulty of being able to drive sustained growth in some of these businesses going forward. And again, in the second half, you'll see -- I mean, the second half of our year is going to be interesting relative to the first half. What you're going to see in the second half for the year is dramatically improved organic sales versus the first half and a higher tax rate than you saw in the first half. So you're going to see almost the opposite situation. But Foodservice in Australia, but again, in my view going forward, lesser on Australia, more in Foodservice, is really where the focus has got to be. And if I break out Foodservice by the branded piece versus the nonbranded piece, the branded piece is essentially flat. And where we are seeing the pressure in food services on proprietary brands that are made specifically for customers where we've lost price leverage because of the environment and the capacity available and in the categories where we don't bring branded leverage. Similar situation exists in Australia. And as I said, U.K. volume was down significantly, and it goes all over. I think in Q3, you'll be interested to see what U.K. volume is. I'm not going to tell you, but I think you'll get an interesting perspective as we come back next quarter in the report. But again, there is no doubt that our shift into Emerging Markets was not done on an ad hoc opportunistic basis. It was done strategically and with intent because I will tell you, my own view is that the developed world is going to get increasingly difficult in which to operate just because of the concentration of retailers in all these markets, the difficulty in categories, the pressure consumers are feeling, the ethnic and demographic shifts occurring in all these markets. And so you're going to see us push more aggressively and with greater alacrity into these Emerging Markets because we have to, and that's why. So I think nothing we've seen this year, other than I will say Foodservice, has surprised us. Foodservice has disappointed me because I expected the industry to turn. It has not."

It's dollarized volume basically. It's dollarized volume. And the impact on the top line should be favorable providing that the sales are incrementally, that they're gap fillers in terms of places and people we are not reaching. And right now, our portfolio tends to skew more middle, upper income. We are very underdeveloped in the dollar stores. And so these are opportunities for us to reach a segment of the population that historically we have underserved. And so I think from that standpoint, this should represent some incremental upside for us going forward. I think the other thing is, I also said I want to be clear on this, that not all of the items. There are some exceptions to the margin enhancing and margin neutral. I won't get into specifics, but there are a few exceptions to those. But we should make up for that in terms of the incrementality. I mean, we haven't sold beans in this country in -- I can't even remember the last time we sold beans here. And I've been here almost 30 years, and I think the last time we sold beans was maybe the '70s or early '80s  in the U.S. And so we tested it. It has done very well. We have a whole line of products like that coming. And I think as we get into the third quarter call, we'll be able to specify and detail for you the items. But I think you'll find them very interesting. Frankly, some of them had me scratching my head as we looked at it, but the North American company and European companies in particular have gotten my messages regarding my concern over the top line in developed markets and the fact that we do serve this underserved population segments."

I think all of you know how I feel about CapEx in this industry. I think it's been abused over the years. I think it's been spent needlessly to add capacity and do other things that have not given consumers return or shareholders returns and haven't helped consumers. In our case, one of the rules I outlined at the outset of this initiative was I was not simply picking up equipment and moving it from one edifice to another. So in other words, most of this -- there are maybe 2 small exceptions. Most of this volume will shift from factories that were grossly underutilized into factories that were slightly underutilized without the need for a lot of CapEx in terms of new equipment. Now there are a few exceptions. Closing Girgarre required us to do some things in New Zealand, and moving some things out of a couple of the factories in Australia allowed us -- forced us to put some capital in New Zealand, which I did not like doing. But I can tell you, and I'm sure Art and Meg will tell you in a private moment, that this didn't come without a great deal of angst. I hate these kinds of initiatives. I don't like doing them. I think they're abused. I think we are a company that was criticized for that for a number of years. So one of the rules I outlined for everybody was I was not simply picking up or buying new equipment to put in another factory. We could not take the volume and move to a facility that was underutilized or had excess capacity. It was going to be very difficult to convince me to close some of these facilities. That is in, in essence, what we have done. In a couple of cases, we've had very low utilized factories where we have decided that our customer relationships coming out of those factories or the cost to serve a customer were not conducive to the kinds of margin and returns we wanted. And so we've shifted away products from a few of those customers and from a few of those businesses, and as a result, are not really being required to shift much of anything from a utilization standpoint. Our CapEx for the first half of the year is up about $53 million to $55 million. Our inventory is up about $130 million. And those are the big uses of cash in the first half of the year. Rest assured that I'm not happy about that, and I've made it abundantly clear to my team and the supply chain that this isn't just simply about, gee, I now have -- I had 80 buildings, now I have 75 buildings. This is about getting a lot better and more efficient. And I think we'll be there. So the good news for us is while these things are always somewhat distracting, the reality is they have not required us to do anything above the norm to protect the safety and quality of our company. And as a consequence, knock on wood, we have not suffered the same kinds of issues that others have."

And I have to tell you, I think I made the comment earlier, our people have just revisited the Quero factory and are coming back raving. I mean, Quero has something we don't have anything else in the world, and that's a biomass generator, which we're using excess sugarcane now to fire up and saving us a ton of money. But if we can figure out a way to put corn husks through there, we can literally get free energy in our biggest factory. So there's a lot of activity. I will tell you, Rob, and people who have worked for me a long time know, safety and quality are the 2 single biggest issues that I focus our team on all the time. I think employees have the right to expect to work in a safe environment, and I think our brands are only as good as the quality of reputation we have.

So right now, I think you should assume that we're holding to that number until I tell you something else. But we're not going to give you guidance until May. And we never do, Eric, and you know that. I get pressed at CAGNY. I get pressed in the Q3 call. And it is a volatile world, and things are changing. And so in May, we'll give you updated guidance. But right now, I just don't see any reason to move off that guidance. But I want to be clear that, that doesn't mean we will or we won't. I'm just saying that right now, it's just way too early. And our second half is going to be pretty good, I think. And so I hope I'm not proven wrong. But certainly, based on where I expect us to be from the earnings standpoint, sequentially better in Q3 and Q4, and where I expect us to be from a sales standpoint, sequentially better and good organic sales in the second half and where I expect uss to be in Emerging Markets and the U.K. perspective. I just think right now, it's just too early to make any changes to it."
