Additionally, a webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. With me today as always Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include his reflections on the company’s performance in the first quarter and the full fiscal year, some context around our outlook for fiscal 2011, and a preview of our investor conference on December 8. And then Ted will provide more details around the fourth quarter results and our guidance for fiscal 2010. We’ll take questions at the end of Ted’s remarks. And we want to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. We expect the call today to take about an hour. 
As is always the case on these calls, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.
But before I turn it over to Keith I have to say that we have a pretty unique situation here at Rockwell. As you may or may not know, Keith is from Wisconsin but Ted is from Pittsburgh and they both play college football. So football definitely in their blood. So I'd Rockwell to the Super Bowl. So we'll try not to get too distracted about that and summary, Ted, but I think you're outnumbered. So with that, Keith I'll turn the call over to you."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today, I certainly appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. We had a great start for the fiscal year. The 28% revenue growth in Q1 was broad based with all regions and both segments exceeding our expectations. We believe the key points of this growth came from year end budget consumption by our customers, similar to last year but even if we strip that out it was a great quarter. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of operating earnings improvement and topped 16% consecutive operating margin, and we almost doubled earnings per share from a year ago. After cash return on invested capital at the end of December was 25.6%, which is now well above our long-term goal of 20% and is approaching the 26% peak that we saw in the last cycle. 
I'm sure by now you have all seen the reported financial results but let me highlight some other indications of progress in Q1. EMEA had year-over-year sales growth of over 30%, not quite back to 2008 levels, but after lighting the rest of the world into recovery it looks like our business in the EMEA region has turned the corner. Our sales growth in emerging markets was well above the company average in Q1. This was our third consecutive quarter of 40% or higher year-over-year growth in China. Account share will get tougher from here on out but we are confident China will deliver more than 20% growth in fiscal 2011. India grew over 30% and Latin America with 42% growth, had its third consecutive quarter of robust growth. 
Our OEM business was strong again this quarter, over 50% growth in our Machine Safety business. This is an indicator that our OEM strategy is working, and we are seeing more penetration of safety content on machines. And Logix grew 38% in the quarter, establishing a new high for quarterly revenue, exceeding the previous high in Q4 of 2008. All of this is evidence that our global sales and marketing organization is doing a great job of executing our targeted initiatives. 
Lastly we announced the acquisition of Highfront a system integrator based in South Africa that is focused on the mining and mineral processing industries. This is right in the sweet spot of our acquisition strategy, and each acquisition that supports process in emerging markets that will be catalytic to organic growth. We expect to close this transaction around the end of February. 
Overall, a great quarter for us and an excellent start to the fiscal year.
Let's shift gears and talk about 2011. Our performance in Q1 along with positive macroeconomic trends and forecasts make us optimistic that the recovery will continue in fiscal 2011. The tone from our customers regarding their CapEx spending is improving, but the timing of larger project spending in mature markets remain somewhat uncertain. Though recovery is linear, and our quarterly results will oscillate around the trend line but the good news is that the trend line is heading in the right direction. We expect our year-over-year moderate in the remainder of the year as a comparison to last year begin to get more difficult. 
Taking all of that into consideration, we are revising our guidance for fiscal 2011. We are now projecting revenue growth of 12% to 16%, excluding currency. Based on this revenue outlook, we are revising fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance to $4.30 to $4.60. This is about an 11% increase in EPS at the midpoint, and if we end the year anywhere in this range, that will represent record earnings per share for the company.
Let me close by saying that I'm very proud of the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. Through their dedication and expertise they have proven that they can execute in the tough times and capitalize on growth opportunities as this recovery has progressed. The members of our global organization, both those that touch the customer and those behind the scenes know how to be flexible and responsive to customer needs and that is what it takes to succeed. And that is why I'm confident that we will continue to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders.
I will now turn it over to him to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2011. Ted?"

As you can imagine, this is a somewhat difficult time to be a Steelers fan in Wisconsin and since I am surrounded by Packers fans at the moment including my boss I guess what I can safely say is I'm looking forward to a good game.",1328,"Good morning, everyone. As you can imagine, this is a somewhat difficult time to be a Steelers fan in Wisconsin and since I am surrounded by Packers fans at the moment including my boss I guess what I can safely say is I'm looking forward to a good game. At any rate, as Rondi mentioned, we posted charts our website and my comments will reference those charts. As Keith noted the Q1 results reflect a continuing global economic recovery, good execution across our businesses and regions and another very strong quarter for financial performance.
So starting with Chart 1, the Q1 results summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1.366 billion. That's up 28% compared to Q1 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation was less than $2 million, so a negligible impact. Segment operating earnings were $222 million, an increase of 62% compared to $137 million in Q1 last year. General corporate net was $15.7 million down from $19.5 million a year ago. We indicated about $86 million in general corporate net expense for the full year in our November guidance, so Q1 was well below that run rate. The lower level was due primarily to a gain on the sale of an investment. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.6%. That's slightly below the low end of our full-year guidance range. We benefited in the quarter from the retroactive impact of the R&D tax credit extension. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.04 almost double last year's $0.54. 
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 144.5 million. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in Q1 at a cost of about $49 million. Despite share repurchases over the past year, the average diluted share count is up about 800,000 shares year-over-year, that increases primarily due to the effect of a higher share price on the dilution calculation.
Moving to Chart 2, the Q1 results for Rockwell Automation. As I noted previously, sales for quarter 1 increased 28% year-over-year but also increased about 1% sequentially. Q1 is our third consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth over 25%. Regarding the sequential sales increase of 1%, we typically experienced a modest decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1. So this was a better-than-expected start to the fiscal year. We suspect Q1 may have benefited from some customers using up calendar year capital and operating expense budgets. And in Asia it appears that some project business may have been pooled in from Q2 due to the timing of the lunar new year this year but clearly Q1 also saw continued growth in fundamental demand.
Moving to the earnings side of the Chart. You can observe the steady improvement over the course of last year, and I would also point out the sequential step up in earnings from Q4 to Q1 on a relatively modest sales increase. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, up 3.5 points from 12.8% in Q1 last year. That margin improvement reflects some good volume leverage offset by both higher compensation costs and growth spending.
Q1 last year was the last quarter to benefit from the salary reductions and the suspension of the 401(k) match that we implemented during the downturn. It was also the last quarter before increased compensation expense associated with the global salary and wage increase. You might also remember that we began to accelerate growth spending in the second half of last year. So in Q1 volume leverage had overcome both of these items to deliver the improved operating margins.
On a different note, although it's not displayed on the chart. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 25.7%. That's up from 9.5% in Q1 last year, largely due to the increased earnings. As Keith noted ROIC is almost back to the peak of 26% that we experienced in the second quarter of fiscal year '08.
Now please turn to Chart 3 which summarizes the Q1 results in the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart we now experienced seven consecutive quarters of sequential sales growth in the Architecture & Software segment. You can see for those quarter were reflected year, year-over-year growth in Q1 was 31%, currency had a slight negative impact on sales on a year-over-year basis. Architecture & Software sales in Q1 were up 7% sequentially and operating margin for the quarter was 24.9%, up 3.8 points from Q1 last year and up 2.6 points sequentially.
Chart 4 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q1 were up 26% compared to last year with a very minor positive impact from currency. Sales were down 4% sequentially. In the product portion of Control Products & Solutions, sales were up 4% sequentially but that was offset by a 9% sequential decline in Solutions and Services, and that's a typical Q4 to Q1 pattern in the portion of the Control Products & Solutions segment. Segment operating earnings increased 82% year-over-year with the related 2.9 point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were down 10% and operating margin contracted by less than a point. In both cases consistent with a lower volume.
The next chart, Chart 5, provides a geographic breakdown of sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column excluding currency effects.  Very strong sales growth to every region, the U.S., Canada, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were all in the high twenties to low 30% in terms of year-over-year growth, with Latin America leading all other regions at 42%. Emerging markets were particularly strong in the quarter, in total up 38% with China up 40%. This is the third consecutive quarter for 40-plus percent year-over-year growth in China.
I'll turn now to Chart 6, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $4 million, slightly better than a breakeven result. Q1 is typically a weaker cash flow quarter and we expected this Q1 to be especially low due to the larger-than-normal payout of performance-based compensation that was earned and expensed in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line. 
Despite a slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 100% for the full year. The only qualifier I would put on the free cash flow expectation is that we will continue to monitor the status of our pension plan funding and if we choose to make a discretionary contribution this year, cash conversion could be somewhat lower.
And that the excess to the final slide which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned we're revising guidance we've increased the range of full year sales to $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. That's a $200 million increase across the range compared to our previous guidance. The new low end of our revenue range is equal to the previous high end. Excluding currency effects for the full year, net revenue range now represents growth of 12% to 16%. The previous range was 8% to 12%, so that's a four-point increase in year-over-year growth across the range. 
For the full year we expect currency to contribute about one point of growth which is the same expectation as previous guidance. We expect segment margin to be about 17% or maybe a bit higher the previous range was 16% to 17%. We've increased our fiscal 2011 guidance per diluted earnings per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.60. We continue to expect the full year tax rate of 20% to 22%, and perhaps the other item worth commenting on his general corporate net their we now expect expense to be closer to $80 million for the full year. This guidance includes the expected results of the acquisition we recently announced but with respect to full year sales and earnings it's not really large enough to make a meaningful impact. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi and we'll begin the Q&A session."

So you're right in that w are expecting that to pickup in the second half of the year. That certainly what our analysis has told us so far. As that plays out in the second half of the year it's really timing now as to whether the majority of that revenue will come within this fiscal year or slide in to fiscal '12."

There's no question that automotive as a discrete industry is a very significant utilizer of Logix, if you will. And so those projects and we talked about that picking up in the second half of last year and strong into this year. That has been part of it. The other, I would say, two pieces of it is one OEM and that's a global story. And certainly the other piece of that OEM story is the expansion of our portfolio to where we have more price point products to be able to focus at a broader spectrum of the machine builders machines and so we talked about it as CompactLogix as you know. So I would say the combination of strength at OEMs, a combination of our motion and safety capabilities within the Logix platform, and then the actual scalability of the Logix platform that our expanding the business in addition to the process and the project activities. So I would say those are the three, four, five things that are creating it. But certainly as you know, I mean I have to make the comment, I don't think 38% is the ongoing rate of growth there. But it's such an evidence I think of the continued expansion of our served market and the execution of the strategy in that business."

One of the things that you probably remember from our investor conference in Automation Fair if that we're introducing and that will be this quarter PlantPAx 2.0 which really helps us expand to a number of areas. And we certainly think that that's going to be advantage for us and it will allow us to address some of the larger continuous process industries and we are on track for that release. With respect to industries and applications, certainly as we started the process it was really closely linked to the high-breadth areas, and now we find that evolving into the heavier industries. And certainly one of the reasons we made the acquisition of Highfront is because of the ability to address more of the mining and metals processing areas. And so that's another add to our capabilities in emerging markets where obviously natural resources are more important. And we had a very successful quarter in Asia where our Process business was up 40% year-over-year. So I would say emerging markets is where we're seeing the biggest impact of our process capabilities at this point in time. There's a lot of greenfield there.

They're very large companies and we're going to try to be able to create the environment where we can work with them wherever they're located, wherever the mice are and to utilize the resources that dramatically expands our capabilities in this industry to work globally and there's no reason it can be utilized in the U.S. I think mining actually will be a bigger play in Canada than it will be in the U.S. And certainly we're already looking at the way that this can help expand a business that we are already good in Canada that will allow us to take advantage of expertise that comes in the mines and in South Africa as well. And the other aspect of this acquisition is the also are involved in mineral processing, not just mining. And so that moves us one step downstream or upstream which ever way you view that, not more than just the extraction dimension of that industry and of that vertical. So that was another key aspect of what they brought us. And that processing part really is what is associated with our process industry. Mining, historically is more of a motor control types of applications, intelligent motor control. The processing of those minerals is what gets you into the process industry and we'll be able to use that in particular in Latin America Canada, Australia and also China and India."

But what I can do is give you a little color around what we see happening down there. If you take mining, obviously there's been mines in Chile and Peru for many years. So a portion of this is replacement. But I would say a higher percentage is new capacity coming on stream and the key is the commodity prices and the continued appetite for these resources globally which is really being driven by the expansion of the economies in emerging markets. So, yes, we do see this continuing but it's really dependent upon the utilization in the other industries particularly China, India, as time goes on. But we see that as a real driver in this space. If you look at other dimensions of what's going on in Latin America, oil and gas is very strong. Historically it was very strong in Venezuela. It continues to be positive there but I think everyone understands what's happened with capacity there, and the evolution of that industry. But it's picking up in Brazil. Brazil is more than making up, you're hearing all the time about deepwater finds in Brazil. They probably have most sophisticated deepwater talents in engineering in the world, quite frankly, today. Colombia continues to expand in gas in particular. So we see oil and gas as another layer on top of what's going on in the traditional mining industries. And in Brazil in mining obviously you have one of the world's leaders in. So a true global company and a true globally competitive company with great technology and great productivity. And then I would say the area that is now growing is the growing middle class of Latin America and the fact that they've had, to your point, a number of years of stability. There's been more investment. There's been more wealth creation. There's been more of the security investment, less inflation, although in some cases reasonably high but much less than it used to be so it's a stable political, stable economically and the middle class is building and that's what's driving automotive investment, food investment and the diversity of the industry there. So I think it's a combination of things across Latin America and really is an area that we have had and we'll continue to have success in with our capabilities."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today, I certainly appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. We had a great start to the fiscal year. And 28% revenue growth in Q1 was broad-based with all regions and both segments exceeding our expectations. We believe a few points of this growth came from year-end budget consumption by our customers, similar to last year, but even if we stripped that out, it was a great quarter. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of operating earnings improvement and topped 16% consecutive operating margin, and we almost doubled earnings per share from a year ago. After cash return on invested capital at the end of December was 25.6%, which is now well-above our long-term goal of 20% and is approaching the 26% peak that we saw in the last cycle. 
I'm sure by now you have all seen the reported financial results, but let me highlight some other indications of progress in Q1. EMEA had year-over-year sales growth of over 30%, not quite back to 2008 levels, but after lagging the rest of the world into recovery, it looks like our business in the EMEA region has turned the corner. Our sales growth in emerging markets was well-above the company average in Q1. This was our third consecutive quarter of 40% or higher year-over-year growth in China. The comps shared will get tougher from here on out, but we are confident China will deliver more than 20% growth in fiscal 2011. India grew over 30% and Latin America with 42% growth, had its third consecutive quarter of robust growth. 
Our OEM business was strong again this quarter, over 50% growth in our Machine Safety business. This is an indicator that our OEM strategy is working and we are seeing more penetration of safety content on machines. And Logix grew 38% in the quarter, establishing a new high for quarterly revenue, exceeding the previous high in Q4 of 2008. All of this is evidence that our global sales and marketing organization is doing a great job of executing our targeted initiatives. 
Lastly, we announced the acquisition of Hiprom, a system integrator based in South Africa that is focused on the mining and mineral processing industries. This is right in the sweet spot of our acquisition strategy, a niche acquisition that supports process in emerging markets that will be catalytic to organic growth. We expect to close this transaction around the end of February. 
Overall, a great quarter for us and an excellent start to the fiscal year.
Let's shift gears and talk about 2011. Our performance in Q1, along with positive macroeconomic trends and forecasts, make us optimistic that the recovery will continue in fiscal 2011. The tone from our customers regarding their CapEx spending is improving, but the timing of larger project spending in mature markets remain somewhat uncertain. No recovery is linear, and our quarterly results will oscillate around a trend line, but the good news is that the trend line is heading in the right direction. We expect our year-over-year growth rates to moderate in the remainder of the year, as the comparisons to last year begin to get more difficult. 
Taking all of that into consideration, we are revising our guidance for fiscal 2011. We are now projecting revenue growth of 12% to 16%, excluding currency. Based on this revenue outlook, we are revising fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance to $4.30 to $4.60. This is about an 11% increase in EPS at the midpoint, and if we end the year anywhere in this range, that will represent record earnings per share for the company.
Let me close by saying that I'm very proud of the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. Through their dedication and expertise, they have proven that they can execute in the tough times and capitalize on growth opportunities that this recovery has progressed. The members of our global organization, both those that touched the customer and those behind the scenes know how to be flexible and responsive to customer needs and that is what it takes to succeed. And that is why I'm confident that we will continue to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders.
And even though that Ted is a Steelers fan, I will now turn it over to him to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2011. Ted?"

As you can imagine, this is a somewhat difficult time to be a Steelers fan in Wisconsin, and since I am surrounded by Packers fans at the moment, including my boss, I guess, what I can safely say is I'm looking forward to a good game. At any rate, as Rondi mentioned, we posted charts for our website and my comments will reference those charts. As Keith noted, the Q1 results reflect a continuing global economic recovery, good execution across our businesses and regions and another very strong quarter for financial performance.
So starting with Chart 1, the Q1 results summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1.366 billion. That's up 28% compared to Q1 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation was less than $2 million, so a negligible impact. Segment operating earnings were $222 million, and increase of 62% compared to $137 million in Q1 last year. General corporate net was $15.7 million, down from $19.5 million a year ago. We indicated about $86 million in general corporate net expense for the full year in our November guidance, so Q1 was well-below that run rate. The lower level was due primarily to a gain on the sale of an investment. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.6%. That's slightly below the low-end of our full-year guidance range. We benefited in the quarter from the retroactive impact of the R&D tax credit extension. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.04, almost double last year's $0.54. 
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 144.5 million. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in Q1 at a cost of about $49 million. Despite share repurchases over the past year, the average diluted share count is up about 800,000 shares year-over-year, that increases primarily due to the effect of a higher share price on the dilution calculation.
Moving to Chart 2, the Q1 Results: Rockwell Automation. As I noted previously, sales for quarter one increased 28% year-over-year, but also increased about 1% sequentially. Q1 is our third consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth over 25%. Regarding the sequential sales increase of 1%, we typically experienced a modest decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1. So this was a better-than-expected start to the fiscal year. We suspect Q1 may have benefited from some customers using upcount calendar year capital and operating expense budgets. And in Asia, it appears that some project business may have been pulled in from Q2 due to the timing of the lunar new year this year, but clearly Q1 also saw a continued growth in fundamental demand.
Moving to the earnings side of the chart. You can observe the steady improvement over the course of last year, and I would also point out the sequential step up in earnings from Q4 to Q1 on a relatively modest sales increase. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, up 3.5 points from 12.8% in Q1 last year. That margin improvement reflects some good volume leverage offset by both higher compensation costs and growth spending.
Q1 last year was the last quarter to benefit from the salary reductions and the suspension of the 401(k) match that we implemented during the downturn. It was also the last quarter before increased compensation expense associated with the global salary and wage increase. You might also remember that we began to accelerate growth spending in the second half of last year. So in Q1, volume leverage had overcome both of these items to deliver the improved operating margins.
On a different note, although it's not displayed on the chart. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 25.7%. That's up from 9.5% in Q1 last year, largely due to the increased earnings. As Keith noted, ROIC is almost back to the peak of 26% that we experienced in the second quarter of fiscal year '08.
Now please turn to Chart 3, which summarizes the Q1 results in the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, we'll now experience seven consecutive quarters of sequential sales growth in the Architecture & Software segment. You can see four of those quarters reflected here. Year-over-year growth in Q1 was 31%. Currency had a slight negative impact on sales on a year-over-year basis. Architecture & Software sales in Q1 were up 7% sequentially and operating margin for the quarter was 24.9%, up 3.8 points from Q1 last year and up 2.6 points sequentially.
Chart 4 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q1 were up 26% compared to last year with a very minor positive impact from currency. Sales were down 4% sequentially. In the product portion of Control Products & Solutions, sales were up 4% sequentially, but that was offset by a 9% sequential decline in solutions and services. And that's a typical Q4-Q1 pattern in that portion of the Control Products & Solutions segment. Segment operating earnings increased 82% year-over-year with the related 2.9 point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were down 10% and operating margin contracted by less than a point, in both cases, consistent with the lower volume.
The next chart, Chart 5, provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. Very strong sales growth to every region, the U.S., Canada, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were all in the high 20s to low 30% in terms of year-over-year growth, with Latin America leading all other regions at 42%. Emerging markets were particularly strong in the quarter. In total, up 38%, with China up 40%. This is the third consecutive quarter for 40-plus percent year-over-year growth in China.
I'll turn now to Chart 6, Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $4 million, slightly better than a breakeven result. Q1 is typically a weaker cash flow quarter and we expected this Q1 to be especially low due to the larger-than-normal payout of performance-based compensation that was earned and expensed in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line. 
Despite the slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 100% for the full year. The only qualifier I would put on the free cash flow expectation is that we will continue to monitor the status of our pension plan funding and if we choose to make a discretionary contribution this year, cash conversion could be somewhat lower.
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we're revising guidance. We've increased the range of full-year sales to $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. That's a $200 million increase across the range compared to our previous guidance. The new low-end of our revenue range is equal to the previous high-end. Excluding currency effects for the full year, net revenue range now represents growth of 12% to 16%. The previous range was 8% to 12%, so that's a four-point increase in year-over-year growth across the range. 
For the full year, we expect currency to contribute about one point of growth, which is the same expectation as previous guidance. We expect segment margin to be about 17% or maybe a bit higher. The previous range was 16% to 17%. We've increased our fiscal 2011 guidance per diluted earnings per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.60. We continue to expect the full-year tax rate of 20% to 22%, and perhaps the other item worth commenting on is general corporate net. There we now expect expense to be closer to $80 million for the full year. This guidance includes the expected results of the acquisition we recently announced, but with respect to full-year sales and earnings, it's not really large enough to make a meaningful impact. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi and we'll begin the Q&A session."

And certainly the other piece of that OEM story is the expansion of our portfolio to where we have more price-point products to be able to focus at a broader spectrum of the machine builders machines. And so we talked about it as CompactLogix, as you know. And so I would say the combination of strength at OEMs, a combination of our motion and safety capabilities within the Logix platform, and then the actual scalability of the Logix platform are all things that are expanding the business in addition to the process and the project activities. So I would say those are the three, four, five things that are creating it. But certainly, as you know, I mean, I have to make the comment, I don't think 38% is the ongoing rate of growth there. But it's just an evidence, I think, of the continued expansion of our served market and the execution of the strategy in that business."

One of the things that you probably remember from our investor conference in Automation Fair is that we're introducing and that will be this quarter, PlantPAx 2.0, which really helps us expand into a number of areas. And we certainly think that that's going to be an advantage for us and it will allow us to address some of the larger continuous process industries and we are on track for that release. With respect to industries and applications, certainly as we started the process, it was really closely linked to the batch hybrid areas, and now we find that evolving into the heavier industries. And certainly one of the reasons we made the acquisition of Hiprom is because of the ability to address more of the mining and metals processing areas. And so that's another add to our capabilities in emerging markets, where obviously natural resources are more important. And we had a very successful quarter in Asia, where our Process business was up 40% year-over-year. So I would say emerging markets is where we're seeing the biggest impact of our process capabilities at this point in time. There's a lot of greenfield there.

And then in Q1, food, beverage and home and personal care had a strong quarter as well. So I think we're seeing that evolution into the consumer industry. That's one of the reasons we've talked about our ability to be successful in China, but today the predominance is still the heavy industry resource-based activities and there we do very well, infrastructure and a few others.

We think of it as catalytic in nature. And we look for ones that basically are bolt-on types of applications that either fill a technology gap, help broaden our domain expertise and allow us to be more global in both our product portfolio or our engineering deployment resources. So we do acquisitions as a key to the utilization of our allocation and continue to buying opportunities on a real global basis. I mean one of the things that have helped us in the emerging markets has been the ability to generate revenue growth and generate domain expertise via our acquisitions and build the critical mass faster in some of those countries and the recent Hiprom win certainly fits that category as well."

So we have enhanced our distribution in certain countries. Europe is not a monolithic, there's a different go-to-market access model in different countries. So there's really no one-size-fits-all or one approach and our team over there is putting together the distribution market access strategy that's required for the focus that we have in every country.

I'm not exactly sure when, but if you remember we had -- our long-term forecast on legacy is 8% to 10% decline per year. Last year, we grew mainly because of the MRO expansion and the continuation of existing machines.

And obviously South Africa has a very strong mining industry and our intention is to utilize this hundred people to be a center of excellence for the mining industry and to evolve that globally. Because many times in the mining industry, the players are global. They're very large companies and we're going to try to be able to create the environment where we can work with them wherever they're located, wherever the mines are located and to utilize the resources that dramatically expands our capabilities in this industry to work globally. And there's no reason it can be utilized in the U.S. I think mining actually will be a bigger play in Canada than it will be in the U.S. And certainly we're already looking at the ways that this can help expand a business that we are already good in Canada, but will allow us to take advantage of the expertise that comes in the mines and in South Africa as well. And the other aspect of this acquisition is they also are involved in mineral processing, not just mining. And so that moves us one step downstream or upstream, whichever way you view that world, but not more than just the extraction dimension of that industry and of that vertical. So that was another key aspect of what they brought us. And that processing part really is what is associated with our process industry. Mining, historically is more of a motor control-types of applications, intelligent motor control. The processing of those minerals is what gets you into the process industry and we'll be able to use that in particular in Latin America, Canada, Australia and also China and India."

But what I can do is give you a little color around what we see happening down there. If you take mining -- obviously there's been mines in Chile and Peru for many years. So a portion of this is replacement. But I would say a higher percentage is new capacity coming on stream and the key is the commodity prices and the continued appetite for these resources globally, which is really being driven by the expansion of the economy in emerging markets. So, yes, we do see this continuing, but it's really dependent upon the utilization in the other industries particularly China, India, as time goes on. But we see that as a real driver in this space. If you look at other dimensions of what's going on in Latin America, oil and gas is very strong. Historically it was very strong in Venezuela. It continues to be positive there, but I think everyone understands what's happened with capacity there and the evolution of that industry. But it's picking up in Brazil. Brazil is more than making up, you're hearing all the time about deepwater finds in Brazil. They probably have some of the most sophisticated deepwater talents in engineering in the world, quite frankly, today. Colombia continues to expand in gas in particular. So we see oil and gas as another layer on top of what's going on in the traditional mining industry. And in Brazil, in mining obviously, you have one of the world's leaders in Bally. So a true global company and a true globally competitive company with great technology and great productivity. And then I would say the area that is now growing is the growing middle class of Latin America and the fact that they've had, to your point, a number of years of stability. There's been more investment. There's been more wealth creation. There's been more of the security of investment, less inflation, although in some cases reasonably high, but much less than it used to be. So it's stable politically, stable economically and the middle class is building and that's what's driving automotive investment, food investment and the diversity of the industry there. So I think it's a combination of things across Latin America and really is an area that we have had and we'll continue to have success with our capabilities."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today, I certainly appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. We had a great start to the fiscal year. The 28% revenue growth in Q1 was broad-based, with all regions and both segments exceeding our expectations. We believe a few points of this growth came from year-end budget consumption by our customers, similar to last year, but even if we stripped that out, it was a great quarter. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of operating earnings improvement and topped 16% consecutive operating margin, and we almost doubled earnings per share from a year ago. After-cash return on invested capital at the end of December was 25.6%, which is now well above our long-term goal of 20% and is approaching the 26% peak that we saw in the last cycle. 
I'm sure by now you have all seen the reported financial results, but let me highlight some other indications of progress in Q1. EMEA had year-over-year sales growth of over 30%, not quite back to 2008 levels, but after lagging the rest of the world in recovery, it looks like our business in the EMEA region has turned the corner. Our sales growth in emerging markets was well above the company average in Q1. This was our third consecutive quarter of 40% or higher year-over-year growth in China. The comps shared will get tougher from here on out, but we are confident China will deliver more than 20% growth in fiscal 2011. India grew over 30% and Latin America, with 42% growth, had its third consecutive quarter of robust growth. 
Our OEM business was strong again this quarter, over 50% growth in our Machine Safety business. This is an indicator that our OEM strategy is working, and we are seeing more penetration of safety content on machines. And Logix grew 38% in the quarter, establishing a new high for quarterly revenue, exceeding the previous high in Q4 of 2008. All of this is evidence that our global sales and marketing organization is doing a great job of executing our targeted initiatives. 
Lastly, we announced the acquisition of Hiprom, a system integrator based in South Africa that is focused on the mining and mineral processing industries. This is right in the sweet spot of our acquisition strategy, a niche acquisition that supports process in emerging markets that will be catalytic to organic growth. We expect to close this transaction around the end of February. Overall, a great quarter for us and an excellent start to the fiscal year.
Let's shift gears and talk about 2011. Our performance in Q1, along with positive macroeconomic trends and forecasts, make us optimistic that the recovery will continue in fiscal 2011. The tone from our customers regarding their CapEx spending is improving, but the timing of larger project spending in mature markets remains somewhat uncertain. No recovery is linear, and our quarterly results will oscillate around a trend line, but the good news is that the trend line is heading in the right direction. We expect our year-over-year growth rates to moderate in the remainder of the year, as the comparisons to last year begin to get more difficult. 
Taking all of that into consideration, we are revising our guidance for fiscal 2011. We are now projecting revenue growth of 12% to 16%, excluding currency. Based on this revenue outlook, we are revising fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance to $4.30 to $4.60. This is about an 11% increase in EPS at the midpoint, and if we end the year anywhere in this range, that will represent record earnings per share for the company.
Let me close by saying that I'm very proud of the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. Through their dedication and expertise, they have proven that they can execute in the tough times and capitalize on growth opportunities that this recovery has progressed. The members of our global organization, both those that touched the customer and those behind the scenes, know how to be flexible and responsive to customer needs and that is what it takes to succeed. And that is why I'm confident that we will continue to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders.
And even though that Ted is a Steelers fan, I will now turn it over to him to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2011. Ted?"

As you can imagine, this is a somewhat difficult time to be a Steelers fan in Wisconsin, and since I am surrounded by Packers fans at the moment, including my boss, I guess what I can safely say is I'm looking forward to a good game. At any rate, as Rondi mentioned, we posted charts for our website and my comments will reference those charts. As Keith noted, the Q1 results reflect a continuing global economic recovery, good execution across our businesses and regions and another very strong quarter for financial performance.
So starting with Chart 1, the Q1 results summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1.366 billion. That's up 28% compared to Q1 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation was less than $2 million, so a negligible impact. Segment operating earnings were $222 million, and increase of 62%, compared to $137 million in Q1 last year. General corporate net was $15.7 million, down from $19.5 million a year ago. We indicated about $86 million in general corporate net expense for the full year in our November guidance, so Q1 was well below that run rate. The lower level was due primarily to a gain on the sale of an investment. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.6%. That's slightly below the low-end of our full-year guidance range. We benefited in the quarter from the retroactive impact of the R&D tax credit extension. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.04, almost double last year's $0.54. 
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 144.5 million. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in Q1 at a cost of about $49 million. Despite share repurchases over the past year, the average diluted share count is up about 800,000 shares year-over-year. That increase is primarily due to the effect of a higher share price on the dilution calculation.
Moving to Chart 2, the Q1 Results: Rockwell Automation. As I noted previously, sales for quarter one increased 28% year-over-year, but also increased about 1% sequentially. Q1 is our third consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth over 25%. Regarding the sequential sales increase of 1%, we typically experienced a modest decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1, so this was a better-than-expected start to the fiscal year. We suspect Q1 may have benefited from some customers using calendar year capital and operating expense budgets and in Asia, it appears that some project business may have been pulled in from Q2 due to the timing of the lunar new year this year, but clearly Q1 also saw continued growth in fundamental demand.
Moving to the earnings side of the chart. You can observe a steady improvement over the course of last year, and I would also point out the sequential step up in earnings from Q4 to Q1 on a relatively modest sales increase. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, up 3.5 points from 12.8% in Q1 last year. That margin improvement reflects some good volume leverage offset by both higher compensation costs and growth spending.
Q1 last year was the last quarter to benefit from the salary reductions and the suspension of the 401(k) match that we implemented during the downturn. It was also the last quarter before increased compensation expense associated with the global salary and wage increase. You might also remember that we began to accelerate growth spending in the second half of last year. So in Q1, volume leverage had to overcome both of these items to deliver the improved operating margins.
On a different note, although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 25.7%. That's up from 9.5% in Q1 last year, largely due to the increased earnings. As Keith noted, ROIC is almost back to the peak of 26% that we experienced in the second quarter of fiscal year '08.
Now please turn to Chart 3, which summarizes the Q1 results in the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, we'll now experience seven consecutive quarters of sequential sales growth in the Architecture & Software segment. You can see four of those quarters reflected here. Year-over-year growth in Q1 was 31%. Currency had a slight negative impact on sales on a year-over-year basis. Architecture & Software sales in Q1 were up 7% sequentially and operating margin for the quarter was 24.9%, up 3.8 points from Q1 last year and up 2.6 points sequentially.
Chart 4 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q1 were up 26% compared to last year, with a very minor positive impact from currency. Sales were down 4% sequentially. In the product portion of Control Products & Solutions, sales were up 4% sequentially, but that was offset by a 9% sequential decline in solutions and services, and that's a typical Q4-Q1 pattern in that portion of the Control Products & Solutions segment. Segment operating earnings increased 82% year-over-year with a related 2.9-point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were down 10% and operating margin contracted by less than a point, in both cases consistent with the lower volume.
The next chart, Chart 5, provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. Very strong sales growth to every region, the U.S., Canada, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were all in the high 20s to low 30% in terms of year-over-year growth, with Latin America leading all other regions at 42%. Emerging markets were particularly strong in the quarter. In total up 38%, with China up 40%. This is the third consecutive quarter for 40-plus percent year-over-year growth in China.
I'll turn now to Chart 6, Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $4 million, slightly better than a breakeven result. Q1 is typically a weaker cash flow quarter and we expected this Q1 to be especially low due to the larger-than-normal payout of performance-based compensation that was earned and expensed in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line. 
Despite the slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 100% for the full year. The only qualifier I would put on the free cash flow expectation is that we will continue to monitor the status of our pension plan funding and if we choose to make a discretionary contribution this year, cash conversion could be somewhat lower.
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we're revising guidance. We've increased the range of full-year sales to $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. That's a $200 million increase across the range compared to our previous guidance. The new low-end of our revenue range is equal to the previous high-end. Excluding currency effects for the full year, net revenue range now represents growth of 12% to 16%. The previous range was 8% to 12%, so that's a four-point increase in year-over-year growth across the range. 
For the full year, we expect currency to contribute about one point of growth, which is the same expectation as previous guidance. We expect segment margin to be about 17% or maybe a bit higher. The previous range was 16% to 17%. We've increased our fiscal 2011 guidance per diluted earnings per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.60. We continue to expect the full-year tax rate of 20% to 22%, and perhaps the other item worth commenting on is general corporate net. There we now expect expense to be closer to $80 million for the full year. This guidance includes the expected results of the acquisition we recently announced, but with respect to full-year sales and earnings, it's not really large enough to make a meaningful impact. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi and we'll begin the Q&A session."

So you're right in that we're expecting that to pick up in the second half of the year. That's certainly what our analysis has told us so far. As that plays out in the second half of the year, it's really timing now as to whether the majority of that revenue will come within this fiscal year or slide in to fiscal '12."

And so we talked about it as CompactLogix, as you know. And so I would say the combination of strength at OEMs, a combination of our motion and safety capabilities within the Logix platform, and then the actual scalability of the Logix platform are all things that are expanding the business in addition to the process and the project activities. So I would say those are the three, four, five things that are creating it. But certainly, as you know, I mean, I have to make the comment, I don't think 38% is the ongoing rate of growth there. But it's just as evidence, I think, of the continued expansion of our served market and the execution of the strategy in that business."

One of the things that you probably remember from our investor conference in Automation Fair is that we're introducing, and that will be this quarter, PlantPAx 2.0, which really helps us expand into a number of areas. And we certainly think that that's going to be an advantage for us and it will allow us to address some of the larger continuous process industries and we are on track for that release. With respect to industries and applications, certainly as we started the process, it was really closely linked to the batch hybrid areas, and now we find it evolving into the heavier industries. And certainly one of the reasons we made the acquisition of Hiprom is because of the ability to address more of the mining and metals processing areas. And so that's another add to our capabilities in emerging markets, where obviously natural resources are more important. And we had a very successful quarter in Asia, where our Process business was up 40% year-over-year. So I would say emerging markets is where we're seeing the biggest impact of our process capabilities at this point in time. There's a lot of green field there.

We normally have a decline in revenue in our Solutions business, Q4 to Q1. But orders continue to be strong and quite frankly, that's one of the reasons that we were able to raise our guidance range in revenue that we were able to see that backlog that we have built. And I believe the backlog Solutions is up 20% year-over-year. So that's what's giving us the confidence in the ability to have a stronger second half in Solutions. And right now, as we get towards the end of this quarter, really we talk about having six months of backlog in Solutions business, but that's not shippable backlog. That converts about 60% two quarters out. So we'll need to get a little more in between now and March. But at that point in time, most of the added orders will flow into fiscal year '12 revenue.

And obviously South Africa has a very strong mining industry and our intention is to utilize this hundred people to be a center of excellence for the mining industry and to evolve that globally. Because many times in the mining industry, the players are global. They're very large companies and we're going to try to be able to create the environment where we can work with them wherever they're located, wherever the mines are located and to utilize the resources that dramatically expand our capabilities in this industry to work globally. And there's no reason it can't be utilized in the U.S. I think mining actually will be a bigger play in Canada than it will be in the U.S. And certainly we're already looking at the ways that this can help expand a business that we are already good in Canada, but will allow us to take advantage of the expertise that comes in the mines and in South Africa as well. And the other aspect of this acquisition is they also are involved in mineral processing, not just mining. And so that moves us one step downstream or upstream, whichever way you view that world, but not more than just the extraction dimension of that industry and of that vertical. So that was another key aspect of what they brought us. And that processing part really is what is associated with our process industry. Mining historically is more of a motor control-types of applications, intelligent motor control. The processing of those minerals is what gets you into the process industry and we'll be able to use that, in particular in Latin America, Canada, Australia and also China and India."

But what I can do is give you a little color around what we see happening down there. If you take mining -- obviously there's been mines in Chile and Peru for many years. So a portion of this is replacement. But I would say a higher percentage is new capacity coming on stream and the key is the commodity prices and the continued appetite for these resources globally, which is really being driven by the expansion of the economies in emerging markets. So, yes, we do see this continuing, but it's really dependent upon the utilization in the other industries, particularly China, India, as time goes on. But we see that as a real driver in this space. If you look at other dimensions of what's going on in Latin America, oil and gas is very strong. Historically, it was very strong in Venezuela. It continues to be positive there, but I think everyone understands what's happened with capacity there and the evolution of that industry. But it's picking up in Brazil. Brazil is more than making up. You're hearing all the time about deepwater finds in Brazil. They probably have some of the most sophisticated deepwater talents in engineering in the world, quite frankly, today. Colombia continues to expand in gas in particular. So we see oil and gas as another layer on top of what's going on in the traditional mining industries. And in Brazil, in mining obviously, you have one of the world's leaders in Bally, so a true global company and a true globally competitive company with great technology and great productivity. And then I would say the area that is now growing is the growing middle class of Latin America and the fact that they've had, to your point, a number of years of stability. There's been more investment. There's been more wealth creation. There's been more of the security of investment, less inflation, although in some cases reasonably high, but much less than it used to be. So it's stable politically, stable economically and the middle class is building and that's what's driving automotive investment, food investment and the diversity of the industry there. So I think it's a combination of things across Latin America and really is an area that we have had and we'll continue to have success with our capabilities."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. As Rondi mentioned, our first slide captures the key messages for the quarter so I'll touch on the these during my remarks. 
We started the fiscal year with a very strong Q1 and that momentum continued in the second quarter with sales growth of 26%. I was very pleased again this quarter with our broad-based revenue growth. We had strong growth in every region and in both our Products and Solutions and Services businesses. Operating margin has continued to expand and earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14 was a record quarterly high for the company. 
We had a very strong cash flow quarter. Return on invested capital of 27.5% was a record high for the company, above the peak of 26% in the last cycle. So at the midway point of the fiscal year, it's safe to say that we are executing extremely well and capitalizing on the strength of the industrial markets. I'm sure by now you have all seen the reported financial results so let me give you some other highlights in the quarter. 
EMEA had its second consecutive quarter of 30% sales growth, overcoming some weakness in the Middle East and North Africa due to the recent political turmoil. We had several bright spots in emerging markets in Q2. China grew 36% and Latin America with 38% growth had it's fourth consecutive quarter of robust growth. Our OEM business was strong again this quarter. We continue to win machine conversion and to get more content on each machine. This quarter, we saw over 40% growth in our Motion Control business within architecture and software. This is a product line that is very important for OEM applications. All of this is evidence that our global organization continues to do a great job executing our targeted initiatives. 
Overall, another solid quarter and an excellent first half of the fiscal year. As you will recall, we significantly raised our full year revenue and earnings guidance in January. Some problem were too aggressive but our Q2 web revenue was in line with our guidance. And so what is our current thinking? 
The industrial sector has continued to demonstrate strength with growth in industrial production rates, some improvement in capacity utilization and continued strength in the PMI data. But the past quarter has seen a good deal of change in the macro environment and that has created some new headwinds to the ongoing recovery. 
Commodity costs and oil prices are increasing. Rising inflation is leading to tightening monetary policies in some emerging and developed economies. These, along with the Japan earthquake and related supply chain impact and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, all create greater uncertainty to the business outlook. 
Given our first half performance, but taking into account the more uncertain macro environment, we are increasing our revenue outlook to a range of $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion with about 1/2 of the increase coming from currency. Based on this revenue outlook and including additional headwinds from material cost inflation and higher oil prices, we are narrowing fiscal 2011 EPS guidance range of $4.40 to $4.60. Ted will go through the puts and takes in more detail. But I want to remind you that at the midpoint, this represents almost a 50% increase in earnings per share from 2010 and record earnings per share for the company. 
Before I close, I'd like to welcome the employees of High to Rockwell Automation. High Prompt is our newly acquired System Integration business in South Africa. This group has great engineering expertise in mining and minerals processing applications. We are thrilled that we have improved our capabilities to serve the growing mining market of subSahara and Africa and we intend to expand this expertise globally. 
Let me close by saying how proud I am of the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. It is their dedication and expertise that continue to deliver these results and create new opportunities. They are an important aspect of our competitive depreciation. Our global team members, both of those who touch the customer and those behind the scenes, are committed to winning and deepening our customer relationships and loyalty. And that is what it takes to succeed. And that is why I am confident that we will continue to be successful and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
Now with that, I'll turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Ted?"

I'll be starting with the Q2 results summary on Page 5. Revenue in the quarter was a $1,464,000,000, that's up 26% compared to Q2 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in th",1246,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll be starting with the Q2 results summary on Page 5. Revenue in the quarter was a $1,464,000,000, that's up 26% compared to Q2 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 2 points. Segment operating earnings were $244 million, an increase of 38% compared to $177 million in Q2 last year. General corporate net was $20.5 million compared to $23.6 million a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.3%. That's below our full year guidance range. 
We've benefited in the quarter from some discrete items that lowered the rate by about 3 points. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.14, up 48% from $0.77 in Q2 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $146.3 million. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in Q2 at a cost of about $58 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased 1.4 million shares. 
Despite share repurchases, the average diluted share count is up about 1.9 million shares year-over-year, primarily due to option exercises and the effect of a higher share price on the dilution calculation. 
Turning now to Page 6, the Q2 results for Rockwell Automation. As noted previously, sales for Q2 increased 26% year-over-year but also increased 7% sequentially. Q2 is our fourth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth of over 25%. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart. We are seeing steady improvement over the course of the past 4 quarters. Segment operating margin improved by 1.5 points year-over-year to 16.7%. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, offset by spending, mix and a higher-than-anticipated material costs and oil prices. 
The mix effects included higher growth in our Solutions and Services businesses and in our Products businesses. And within the Architecture and Software segment, we experienced significantly higher growth in some of the lower margin product areas. That's consistent with Keith's comments regarding the very strong growth we experienced with OEM customers in the quarter, particularly with motion control products and especially in Europe. 
Year-over-year conversion margin was 22%, somewhat lower than we expected, primarily due to the same mix and material costs elements. Although currency was a tailwind to sales, it was a modest headwind with respect to conversion margin. 
As in prior years, conversion margin can be somewhat variable quarter-to-quarter. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 27.5%. That's a record level for ROIC and up from 13.2% in Q2 of last year. 
Now moving on to Page 7. This slide summarizes the Q2 results of the Architecture and Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, year-over-year growth in this segment was 21% in Q2. Currency effects increased sales by about 2 points. Looking at the chart, you can see the growth moderated somewhat sequentially and sequential growth was a little 1% to 2%. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 24.4%, up about 6/10 of a point compared to last year. Sequentially, operating margin decreased by about 0.5 prim resulting from the mix change resulting from the segment that I referred to on the previous chart. 
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products and Solutions segment. Sales in Q2 were $839.9 million, up 30% compared to last year with 2 points of that increase due to currency effects. On a year-over-year basis, sales from the products portion of control products and solutions were at about the same rate as the Architecture and Software segment with the Solutions and Services businesses increasing by 33%. 
An unusually large project was completed and build in the quarter that increased solutions and services sales by about $22 million. In total for this segment, sales increased 12% sequentially. 
Moving to the right side of this chart. Segment operating earnings increased 68% year-over-year with the related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin. As you can see on the chart, there was a significant sequential increase in operating earnings that was driven primarily by the sequential sales increase. 
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which excludes currency effects, very good growth pretty much across-the-board. EMEA was particularly strong with 30% growth. As previously mentioned, very good performance in the quarter with OEM customers. Latin America had another very strong quarter at 38%. And the U.S. and Asia-Pacific both in the low 20% range. Emerging markets continue to demonstrate growth above the company average and China was particularly strong at 36% year-over-year growth. 
I'll turn now to Page 10 to free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $226 million, which represents conversion on net income of about 136%. That's a very good result. Year-to-date, free cash flow was at $231 million. That's conversion of about 73%. We're below our targeted 100% conversion year-to-date. You may recall on Q1, we had a larger than normal payout of performance-based compensation that was earned in expense in the last fiscal year. With the very good progress in Q2, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 100% for the full year. 
We are continuing to monitor the status of our pension plan funding. And if we choose to make a discretionary contribution this year, cash conversion could be lower than the 100%. During the quarter, we announced that we replaced our revolving credit facilities with a new $750 million 4-year facility. Previously, we had a 1-year facility expiring in March 2011 and a 3-year expiring in March 2012. The previous facilities totaled approximately $568 million. 
And that takes us to the final side which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we've narrowed the guidance range. We've increased the range of full year sales to $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion. That's a $100 million increase at the new high end, about 1/2 of that increase is due to a currency and the balance was somewhat higher expectation for organic growth. 
For the full year, the revenue range now or plus growth of approximately 15% to 17% excluding currency effects. The previous range was 12% to 16%. For the full year, we now expect currency to contribute approximately 2 points to growth. Based on currency rates experienced in the second quarter, we've increased that by a little more than 1 point from our previous guidance. We continue to expect segment margin to be about 17%. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share is now $4.40 to $4.60. 
Using the high end of the guidance range as an example, we added $100 million of sales but did not increase in PS guidance. The additional earnings contribution due to sales increases that are attributable to currency effects is not large, coupled with the contribution we expect from some additional organic growth, that favorable impact is being offset by some of the mix effects we experienced in Q2. Added headwinds in the balance of the year related to material costs and oil price increases and a moderate negative impact on EPS calculation of higher share count. 
A couple of other items related to the full year guidance. We expect the full year tax rate of 20% to 21%. And we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be an expense of about $80 million for the full year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi and we'll begin the Q&A."

As you know, as we talked about guidance last time or what we expected an improvement in our Solutions business in the second half of the year, we still expect that to happen. If you look at, we did have some increase in our front log in the quarter and a slight increase mainly in solutions in our backlog in the quarter. So and improvement in I'll say, the large CapEx projects that are in the funnel, if you will, in North America particularly as we exited the quarter. So that kind of goes back to the comment I made about the industrial metrics that we monitor still remains strong. So at this point, we have not seen a reaction to the aspects of our core ordering. What we have seen I guess to maybe just put a little more color on it is we have seen a slowdown and change in Middle East and North Africa. And while that's not a large part of our business, there are some -- the work is just not being done they're at the current time. And that is impacting both ongoing projects and future projects, but it is a small enough number that we did not see a big impact in our performance or expect a big impact in our performance from that. With respect to Japan, the impact there was not felt in the quarter at all. And in fact, Japan had a good quarter, which is a little, may seem a little strange, but we have not seen the impact there. The Japan situation is something that we are monitoring very, very closely, because it's a potential impact to our supply chain. We do not believe there will be an impact to our Supply Chain in the third quarter. We have adequate stocks and inventories and the supply chain can support our third quarter. We are very mindful and watching the fourth quarter and beyond. And in particular, our concern with respect to Japan and the supply chain is really the subtier suppliers to our component suppliers. There is some heavy concentration in some of the industry that supports particularly electronics. And those subsuppliers have been impacted and it's a question of when they can get their production lines running, when the environment there will stabilize both in transportation and energy, and will we be able to maintain an adequate supply or find adequate replacement that could impact at some point in our fourth quarter or more probably going into 2012. So our concern in the macro area is it really, in the Middle East, North Africa and supply-chain of component suppliers from Japan as we move into our fourth quarter."

But, I think, you probably may have seen the comments from Toyota just recently where they expect substantial production declines over an extended period of time. Our only concern with automotive is if there is a prolonged reduction in production, that's going to impact their investment simply because of profitability and cash flow. And that is something that could be an impact later, but today, projects actually have increased in the quarter. I should say the front log of projects, particularly in North America, have increased in the quarter in auto. And we are seeing continued strength in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. So no change yet.

The last couple of months, auto sales have slowed and that's really mainly because of the incentives the Chinese have placed on the, in that market have stopped and also the thought of, are they going to continue to limit the availability of I'll call it, licenses, in some of the major cities, being Beijing and Shanghai, are the ones most talked about. But we have not -- given that, we are still not seeing any slowdown in the spending or the investment that are going on in China. In particular, some of the multinationals are continuing to expand their joint ventures. And some of the leading Chinese manufacturers, domestic manufacturers, are also increasing their capacity. I think if there is any fallout, it will be in the second tier and third tier suppliers as opposed to the 5 to 10 leading suppliers that are competing very aggressively in China. So we also see there that we are able to work both across the automation space as well as the information in the automotive market. And that is one of the areas that we had targeted for our information solutions growth and we are seeing some start of traction in that spaces while in China. With respect to China in general, we continue to see the high growth. This was in the high 30s and that you'd remember the last 3 quarters we were up 40 and 40 plus. So obviously, we're going to start lapping some very, very strong growth quarters in the second half of our year. We expect that we will continue to see solid growth. And for the full year, we expect to be a little over 20% for the full year. And we do expect that China will continue to be able to grow at that rate over the short and intermediate term. And we continue to add resources. We continue to expand our distribution and channel capabilities in China. And continue to build out the organization infrastructure and be able to absorb that growth and the we're cognizant of the need to have the resources and the structure and the talent to be able to continue to drive growth in that market. And we know we're outperforming the underlying market growth there. So we feel good about China and its future for Rockwell Automation."

The one piece is the controllers and software. And that has margin above the segment average. We also have for lack of a better word, peripheral products, which is, where we have Motion Control and a lot of our component, Sensing and Safety businesses. Those have very good product margins. It just so happens that they're not at the same level as our software and controllers. And so they're below the segment average. And while those are very good margins, and as Ted say, we'd be happy to report continued growth in any of those and we have talked about the high rates of growth in safety. And in EMEA, by the way, we have another higher growth rate this quarter. So those 2 pieces make up a very important piece about our OEM portfolio. And the other positive part of this is we are now selling more of our portfolio on the machines. And that's a real positive for the conversion and for the ongoing building of this  annuity at OEMs. And more importantly, while we are excited about building that OEM segment is because at some point in the future, it converts to MRO business. And certainly the MRO business in our products is also a very solid and important portion of the business, not just for Rockwell Automation but for our channel partners as well. So it's strictly what's really good and what's good. And that's the dynamics that are playing on here with the margin, but we're absolutely excited about OEM business. We are excited about our Motion business, our Sensing Component businesses, our Safety Component, those are all great businesses. And our goal is to grow on as fast as possible and as a long as possible so we can build and install base as well as being the control supplier of choice at those OEMs and sell them everything out of our portfolio. So, I think, that's -- we continue to work on margins in all our business, including our controllers and our software. So the goal is how can we improve all of our margins, but the mix continues to be one that given on how that plays out in any given quarter, can move the average A&S margin a little bit up or down."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. As Rondi mentioned, our first slide captures the key messages from the quarter, so I'll touch on the these during my remarks. 
We started the fiscal year with a very strong Q1 and that momentum continued in the second quarter with sales growth of 26%. I was very pleased again this quarter with our broad-based revenue growth. We had strong growth in every region and in both our Products and Solutions and Services businesses. 
Operating margin has continued to expand, and earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14 was a record quarterly high for the company. 
We had a very strong cash flow quarter. Return on invested capital of 27.5% was a record high for the company, above the peak of 26% in the last cycle. 
So at the midway point of the fiscal year, it's safe to say that we are executing extremely well and capitalizing on the strength of the industrial markets. 
I'm sure by now you have all seen the reported financial results so let me give you some other highlights in the quarter. EMEA had its second consecutive quarter of 30% sales growth, overcoming some weakness in the Middle East and North Africa due to the recent political turmoil. We had several bright spots in emerging markets in Q2. China grew 36% and Latin America, with 38% growth, had it's fourth consecutive quarter of robust growth. 
Our OEM business was strong again this quarter. We continue to win machine conversion and to get more content on each machine. This quarter, we saw over 40% growth in our Motion Control business within architecture and software. This is a product line that is very important for OEM applications. All of this is evidence that our global organization continues to do a great job executing our targeted initiatives. 
Overall, another solid quarter and an excellent first half of the fiscal year. As you will recall, we significantly raised our full year revenue and earnings guidance in January. Some thought we were too aggressive but our Q2 net revenue was in line with that guidance. So what is our current thinking? 
The industrial sector has continued to demonstrate strength with growth in industrial production rates, some improvement in capacity utilization and continued strength in the PMI data. But the past quarter has seen a good deal of change in the macro environment and that has created some new headwinds to the ongoing recovery. 
Commodity costs and oil prices are increasing. Rising inflation is leading to tightening monetary policies in some emerging and developed economies. These, along with the Japan earthquake and related supply chain impact and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, all create greater uncertainty to the business outlook. 
Given our first half performance, but taking into account the more uncertain macro environment, we are increasing our revenue outlook to a range of $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion with about 1/2 of the increase coming from currency. Based on this revenue outlook and including additional headwinds from material cost inflation and higher oil prices, we are narrowing fiscal 2011 EPS guidance range to $4.40 to $4.60. 
Ted will go through the puts and takes in more detail. But I want to remind you that at the midpoint, this represents almost a 50% increase in earnings per share from 2010 and record earnings per share for the company. 
Before I close, I'd like to welcome the employees of Hiprom to Rockwell Automation. Hiprom is our newly acquired System Integration business in South Africa. This group has great engineering expertise in mining and minerals processing applications. We are thrilled that we have improved our capabilities to serve the growing mining market of sub-Sahara and Africa, and we intend to expand this expertise globally. 
Let me close by saying how proud I am of the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. It is their dedication and expertise that continue to deliver these results and create new opportunities. They are an important aspect of our competitive differentiation. Our global team members, both those who touch the customer and those behind the scenes, are committed to winning and deepening our customer relationships and loyalty. And that is what it takes to succeed. And that is why I'm confident that we will continue to be successful and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
Now with that, I'll turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Ted?"

I'll be starting with the Q2 results summary on Page 5. Revenue in the quarter was a $1,464,000,000, that's up 26% compared to Q2 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in",1243,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll be starting with the Q2 results summary on Page 5. 
Revenue in the quarter was a $1,464,000,000, that's up 26% compared to Q2 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 2 points. Segment operating earnings were $244 million, an increase of 38%, compared to $177 million in Q2 last year. General corporate net was $20.5 million, compared to $23.6 million a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.3%. That's below our full year guidance range. We've benefited in the quarter from some discrete items that lowered the rate by about 3 points. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.14, up 48% from $0.77 in Q2 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 146.3 million. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in Q2 at a cost of about $58 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.4 million shares. Despite share repurchases, the average diluted share count is up about 1.9 million shares year-over-year, primarily due to option exercises and the effect of a higher share price on the dilution calculation. 
Turning now to Page 6, the Q2 results for Rockwell Automation. As noted previously, sales for Q2 increased 26% year-over-year but also increased 7%, sequentially. Q2 is our fourth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth over 25%. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart. We're seeing steady improvement over the course of the past 4 quarters. Segment operating margin improved by 1.5 points year-over-year to 16.7%. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, offset by spending, mix and higher-than-anticipated material costs and oil prices. 
The mix effects included higher growth in our Solutions and Services businesses and in our Product businesses. And within the Architecture and Software segment, we experienced significantly higher growth in some of the lower margin product areas. That's consistent with Keith's comments regarding the very strong growth we experienced with OEM customers in the quarter, particularly with motion control products and especially in Europe. 
The year-over-year conversion margin was 22%, somewhat lower than we expected, primarily due to the same mix and material costs elements. Although currency was a tailwind to sales, it was a modest headwind with respect to conversion margin. As in prior years, conversion margin can be somewhat variable quarter-to-quarter. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 27.5%. That's a record level for ROIC and up from 13.2% in Q2 of last year. 
Now moving on to Page 7. This slide summarizes the Q2 results of the Architecture and Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, year-over-year growth in this segment was 21% in Q2. Currency effects increased sales by about 2 points. Looking at the chart, you can see the growth moderated somewhat sequentially and sequential growth was a little 1% to 2%. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 24.4%, up about 6/10 of a point compared to last year. Sequentially, operating margin decreased by about 1/2 point, primarily resulting from the mix change within the segment that I referred to on the previous chart. 
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products and Solutions segment. Sales in Q2 were $839.9 million, up 30% compared to last year, with 2 points of that increase due to currency effects. On a year-over-year basis, sales for the products portion of control products and solutions were up at about the same rate as the Architecture and Software segment, with the Solutions and Services businesses increasing by 33%. An unusually large project was completed and built in the quarter that increased solutions and services sales by about $22 million. In total for this segment, sales increased 12% sequentially. 
Moving to the right side of this chart. Segment operating earnings increased 68% year-over-year with the related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin. As you can see on the chart, there was a significant sequential increase in operating earnings that was driven primarily by the sequential sales increase. 
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which excludes currency effects. Very good growth pretty much across the board. EMEA was particularly strong with 30% growth. As previously mentioned, very good performance in the quarter with OEM customers. Latin America had another very strong quarter at 38%, and the U.S. and Asia Pacific both in the low 20% range. Emerging markets continue to demonstrate growth above the company average, and China was particularly strong at 36% year-over-year growth. 
I'll turn now to Page 10 to free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $226 million, which represents conversion on net income of about 136%. That's a very good result. Year-to-date, free cash flow was at $231 million. That's conversion of about 73%. 
We're below our targeted 100% conversion year-to-date. You may recall on Q1, we had a larger-than-normal payout of performance-based compensation that was earned in expense in the last fiscal year.  With the very good progress in Q2, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 100% for the full year.  We're continuing to monitor the status of our pension plan funding. And if we choose to make a discretionary contribution this year, cash conversion could be lower than the 100%. 
During the quarter, we announced that we replaced our revolving credit facilities with a new $750 million 4-year facility. Previously, we had a one-year facility expiring in March 2011 and a 3-year expiring in March 2012. The previous facilities totaled approximately $568 million. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we've narrowed the guidance range. We've increased the range of full year sales to $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion. That's a $100 million increase at the new high end, about 1/2 of that increase is due to currency and the balance reflects a somewhat higher expectation for organic growth. 
For the full year, the revenue range now reflects growth of approximately 15% to 17% excluding currency effects. The previous range was 12% to 16%. 
For the full year, we now expect currency to contribute approximately 2 points to growth. Based on currency rates experienced in the second quarter, we've increased that by a little more than 1 point from our previous guidance. We continue to expect segment margin to be about 17%. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share is now $4.40 to $4.60. 
Using the high end of the guidance range as an example, we added $100 million of sales but did not increase EPS guidance. The additional earnings contribution due to sales increases that are attributable to currency effects is not large, coupled with the contribution we expect from some additional organic growth, that favorable impact is being offset by some of the mix effects we experienced in Q2. Added headwinds in the balance of the year related to material costs and oil price increases and a moderate negative impact on EPS calculation of higher share count. 
A couple of other items related to the full year guidance. We expect the full year tax rate of 20% to 21%. And we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be an expense of about $80 million for the full year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we'll begin the Q&A."

As we talked about guidance last time where we expected an improvement in our Solutions business in the second half of the year, we still expect that to happen. If you look at -- we did have some increase in our front log in the quarter and a slight increase mainly in solutions in our backlog in the quarter. So and improvement in, I'll say, the large CapEx projects that are in the funnel, if you will, in North America particularly as we exited the quarter. So that kind of goes back to the comment I made about the industrial metrics that we monitor still have remained strong. So at this point, we have not seen a reaction to the aspects of our core ordering. What we have seen -- I guess, to maybe just put a little more color on it, is we have seen a slowdown and change in Middle East and North Africa. And while that's not a large part of our business, there are some -- the work is just not being done there at the current time. And that is impacting both ongoing projects and future projects, but it is a small enough number that we did not see a big impact in our performance or expect a big impact in our performance from that. With respect to Japan, the impact there was not felt in the quarter at all. And in fact, Japan had a good quarter, which is a little -- may seem a little strange, but we have not seen the impact there. The Japan situation is something that we are monitoring very, very closely, because it's a potential impact to our supply chain. We do not believe there will be an impact to our supply chain in the third quarter. We have adequate stocks and inventories and the supply chain can support our third quarter. We are very mindful and watching the fourth quarter and beyond. And in particular, our concern with respect to Japan and the supply chain is really the sub-tier suppliers to our component suppliers. There is some heavy concentration in some of the industries that support particularly electronics. And those sub-suppliers have been impacted, and it's a question of when they can get their production lines running, when the environment there will stabilize both in transportation and energy, and will we be able to maintain an adequate supply or find adequate replacement that could impact at some point in our fourth quarter or more probably going into 2012. So our concern in the macro area is really Middle East, North Africa and supply chain of component suppliers from Japan, as we move into our fourth quarter."

I should say the front log of projects, particularly in North America, have increased in the quarter in auto. And we are seeing continued strength in Asia Pacific and Latin America. So no change yet. A concern in the future that if there is a supply chain, extended supply-chain disruption that some of the automakers may have to revisit some of their CapEx spending just simply based upon current business performance."

Likewise, water and wastewater continues to be a solid vertical. The below average really is around food and beverage. Now I don't want that to be a negative. It sounded like a negative because food and beverage never is dramatically high but it never is substantially weak. And so it just keeps moving along at the expected rate. It just so happens that these growth rates is below the company average. But we still do very well there, and it's a very important segment for us. And within the Consumer segment, we are seeing some improvement in the home and personal care sector, particularly in some of the large project spending, which means there is -- there are new lines coming on in that OEM and vertical segment, which would mainly be things like around converting machines for personal care products or for other aspects of home care.

But we have not -- given that, we are still not seeing any slowdown in the spending or the investments that are going on in China. In particular, some of the multinationals are continuing to expand their joint ventures. And some of the leading Chinese manufacturers, domestic manufacturers, are also increasing their capacity. I think if there is any fallout, it will be in the second tier and third tier suppliers as opposed to the 5 to 10 leading suppliers that are competing very aggressively in China. So we also see there that we are able to work both across the automation space as well as the information space in the automotive market. And that is one of the areas that we have targeted for our information solutions growth, and we are seeing some start of traction in that spaces well in China. With respect to China in general, we continue to see the high growth. This was in the high 30s, and if you remember the last 3 quarters we were up 40 and 40-plus. So obviously, we're going to start lapping some very, very strong growth quarters in the second half of our year. We expect that we will continue to see solid growth. And for the full year, we expect to be a little over 20% for the full year. And we do expect that China will continue to be able to grow at that rate over the short and intermediate term. And we continue to add resources. We continue to expand our distribution and channel capabilities in China and continue to build out the organization infrastructure to be able to absorb that growth. And we're very cognizant of the need to have the resources and the structure and the talent to be able to continue to drive growth in that market.

And as Ted mentioned, that is one of the options for cash deployment. And that's why we are trying to balance the cash needs of running the business with acquisitions with return of excess to shareholders whether that's dividends or whether that's a dividend increase or whether that's ramping up in the second half of the year, our stock repurchase.

We also think that goes back to a normal, more normal level as we get through the balance of the year.

The one piece is the controllers and software. And that has margins above the segment average. We also have, for lack of a better word, peripheral products, which is, where we have Motion Control and a lot of our component, Sensing and Safety businesses. Those have very good product margins. It just so happens they're not at the same level as our software and controllers. And so they are below the segment average. And while those are very good margins, and as Ted said, we'd be happy to report continued growth in any of those, and we have talked about the high rates of growth in Safety. And in EMEA, by the way, we have another high growth rate this quarter. So those 2 pieces make up a very important piece of our OEM portfolio. And the other positive part of this is we are now selling more of our portfolio on the machines. And that's a real positive for the conversion and for the ongoing building of this  annuity at OEMs. And more importantly, while we are excited about building that OEM segment is because at some point in the future, it converts to MRO business. And certainly the MRO business in our products is also a very solid and important portion of the business, not just to Rockwell Automation but for our channel partners as well. So it's strictly a  what's really good and what's good. And that's the dynamics that are playing on here with the margin, but we're absolutely excited about OEM business. We're excited about our Motion business, our Sensing Component businesses, our Safety Components. Those are all great businesses. And our goal is to grow on as fast as possible and as a long as possible so we can build an installed base, as well as being the control supplier of choice at those OEMs and sell them everything out of our portfolio. So, I think, that's -- we continue to work on margins in all our businesses, including our controllers and our software. So the goal is how can we improve all of our margins, but the mix continues to be one that given on how that plays out in any given quarter, can move the average A&S margin a little bit up or down."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. As Rondi mentioned, our first slide captures the key messages from the quarter, so I'll touch on the these during my remarks. 
We started the fiscal year with a very strong Q1 and that momentum continued in the second quarter with sales growth of 26%. I was very pleased again this quarter with our broad-based revenue growth. We had strong growth in every region and in both our Products and Solutions and Services businesses. 
Operating margin has continued to expand, and earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14 was a record quarterly high for the company. 
We had a very strong cash flow quarter. Return on invested capital by 27.5% was a record high for the company, above the peak of 26% in the last cycle. 
So at the midway point of the fiscal year, it's safe to say that we are executing extremely well and capitalizing on the strength of the industrial markets. 
I'm sure by now you have all seen the reported financial results so let me give you some other highlights in the quarter. EMEA had its second consecutive quarter of 30% sales growth, overcoming some weakness in the Middle East and North Africa due to the recent political turmoil. We had several bright spots in emerging markets in Q2. China grew 36% and Latin America, with 38% growth, had it's fourth consecutive quarter of robust growth. 
Our OEM business was strong again this quarter. We continue to win machine conversions and to get more content on each machine. This quarter, we saw over 40% growth in our Motion Control business within architecture and software. This is a product line that is very important for OEM applications. All of this is evidence that our global organization continues to do a great job executing our targeted initiatives. 
Overall, another solid quarter and an excellent first half of the fiscal year. As you will recall, we significantly raised our full year revenue and earnings guidance in January. Some thought we were too aggressive but our Q2 net revenue was in line with that guidance. So what is our current thinking? 
The industrial sector has continued to demonstrate strength with growth in industrial production rates, some improvement in capacity utilization and continued strength in the PMI data. But the past quarter has seen a good deal of change in the macro environment and that has created some new headwinds to the ongoing recovery. 
Commodity costs and oil prices are increasing. Rising inflation is leading to tightening monetary policies in some emerging and developed economies. These, along with the Japan earthquake and related supply chain impact and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, all create greater uncertainty to the business outlook. 
Given our first half performance, but taking into account the more uncertain macro environment, we are increasing our revenue outlook to a range of $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion with about 1/2 of the increase coming from currency. Based on this revenue outlook and including additional headwinds from material cost inflation and higher oil prices, we are narrowing fiscal 2011 EPS guidance range to $4.40 to $4.60. 
Ted will go through the puts and takes in more detail. But I want to remind you that at the midpoint, this represents almost a 50% increase in earnings per share from 2010 and record earnings per share for the company. 
Before I close, I'd like to welcome the employees of Hiprom to Rockwell Automation. Hiprom is our newly acquired System Integration business in South Africa. This group has great engineering expertise in mining and minerals processing applications. We are thrilled that we have improved our capabilities to serve the growing mining market of sub-Sahara and Africa, and we intend to expand this expertise globally. 
Let me close by saying how proud I am of the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. It is their dedication and expertise that continue to deliver these results and create new opportunities. They are an important aspect of our competitive differentiation. Our global team members, both those who touch the customer and those behind the scenes, are committed to winning and deepening our customer relationships and loyalty. And that is what it takes to succeed. And that is why I'm confident that we will continue to be successful and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
Now with that, I'll turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Ted?"

I'll be starting with the Q2 results summary on Page 5. Revenue in the quarter was a $1,464,000,000, that's up 26% compared to Q2 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in",1243,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll be starting with the Q2 results summary on Page 5. 
Revenue in the quarter was a $1,464,000,000, that's up 26% compared to Q2 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 2 points. Segment operating earnings were $244 million, an increase of 38%, compared to $177 million in Q2 last year. General corporate net was $20.5 million, compared to $23.6 million a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.3%. That's below our full year guidance range. We've benefited in the quarter from some discrete items that lowered the rate by about 3 points. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.14, up 48% from $0.77 in Q2 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 146.3 million. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in Q2 at a cost of about $58 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.4 million shares. Despite share repurchases, the average diluted share count is up about 1.9 million shares year-over-year, primarily due to option exercises and the effect of a higher share price on the dilution calculation. 
Turning now to Page 6, the Q2 results for Rockwell Automation. As noted previously, sales for Q2 increased 26% year-over-year but also increased 7%, sequentially. Q2 is our fourth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth over 25%. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart. We're seeing steady improvement over the course of the past 4 quarters. Segment operating margin improved by 1.5 points year-over-year to 16.7%. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, offset by spending, mix and higher-than-anticipated material costs and oil prices. 
The mix effects included higher growth in our Solutions and Services businesses and in our Product businesses. And within the Architecture and Software segment, we experienced significantly higher growth in some of the lower margin product areas. That's consistent with Keith's comments regarding the very strong growth we experienced with OEM customers in the quarter, particularly with motion control products and especially in Europe. 
The year-over-year conversion margin was 22%, somewhat lower than we expected, primarily due to the same mix and material costs elements. Although currency was a tailwind to sales, it was a modest headwind with respect to conversion margin. As in prior years, conversion margin can be somewhat variable quarter-to-quarter. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 27.5%. That's a record level for ROIC and up from 13.2% in Q2 of last year. 
Now moving on to Page 7. This slide summarizes the Q2 results of the Architecture and Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, year-over-year growth in this segment was 21% in Q2. Currency effects increased sales by about 2 points. Looking at the chart, you can see the growth moderated somewhat sequentially and sequential growth was a little 1% to 2%. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 24.4%, up about 6/10 of a point compared to last year. Sequentially, operating margin decreased by about 1/2 point, primarily resulting from the mix change within the segment that I referred to on the previous chart. 
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products and Solutions segment. Sales in Q2 were $839.9 million, up 30% compared to last year, with 2 points of that increase due to currency effects. On a year-over-year basis, sales for the products portion of control products and solutions were up at about the same rate as the Architecture and Software segment, with the Solutions and Services businesses increasing by 33%. An unusually large project was completed and built in the quarter that increased solutions and services sales by about $22 million. In total for this segment, sales increased 12% sequentially. 
Moving to the right side of this chart. Segment operating earnings increased 68% year-over-year with the related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin. As you can see on the chart, there was a significant sequential increase in operating earnings that was driven primarily by the sequential sales increase. 
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which excludes currency effects. Very good growth pretty much across the board. EMEA was particularly strong with 30% growth. As previously mentioned, very good performance in the quarter with OEM customers. Latin America had another very strong quarter at 38%, and the U.S. and Asia Pacific both in the low 20% range. Emerging markets continue to demonstrate growth above the company average, and China was particularly strong at 36% year-over-year growth. 
I'll turn now to Page 10 to free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $226 million, which represents conversion on net income of about 136%. That's a very good result. Year-to-date, free cash flow was at $231 million. That's conversion of about 73%. 
We're below our targeted 100% conversion year-to-date. You may recall on Q1, we had a larger-than-normal payout of performance-based compensation that was earned in expense in the last fiscal year.  With the very good progress in Q2, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 100% for the full year.  We're continuing to monitor the status of our pension plan funding. And if we choose to make a discretionary contribution this year, cash conversion could be lower than the 100%. 
During the quarter, we announced that we replaced our revolving credit facilities with a new $750 million 4-year facility. Previously, we had a one-year facility expiring in March 2011 and a 3-year expiring in March 2012. The previous facilities totaled approximately $568 million. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we've narrowed the guidance range. We've increased the range of full year sales to $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion. That's a $100 million increase at the new high end, about 1/2 of that increase is due to currency and the balance reflects a somewhat higher expectation for organic growth. 
For the full year, the revenue range now reflects growth of approximately 15% to 17% excluding currency effects. The previous range was 12% to 16%. 
For the full year, we now expect currency to contribute approximately 2 points to growth. Based on currency rates experienced in the second quarter, we've increased that by a little more than 1 point from our previous guidance. We continue to expect segment margin to be about 17%. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share is now $4.40 to $4.60. 
Using the high end of the guidance range as an example, we added $100 million of sales but did not increase EPS guidance. The additional earnings contribution due to sales increases that are attributable to currency effects is not large, coupled with the contribution we expect from some additional organic growth, that favorable impact is being offset by some of the mixed effects we experienced in Q2. Added headwinds in the balance of the year related to material costs and oil price increases and a moderate negative impact on EPS calculation of higher share count. 
A couple of other items related to the full year guidance. We expect the full year tax rate of 20% to 21%. And we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be an expense of about $80 million for the full year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we'll begin the Q&A."

As we talked about guidance last time where we expected an improvement in our Solutions business in the second half of the year, we still expect that to happen. If you look at -- we did have some increase in our front log in the quarter and a slight increase mainly in solutions in our backlog in the quarter. So and improvement in, I'll say, the large CapEx projects that are in the funnel, if you will, in North America particularly as we exited the quarter. So that kind of goes back to the comment I made about the industrial metrics that we monitor still have remained strong. So at this point, we have not seen a reaction to the aspects of our core ordering. What we have seen -- I guess, to maybe just put a little more color on it, is we have seen a slowdown and change in Middle East and North Africa. And while that's not a large part of our business, there are some -- the work is just not being done there at the current time. And that is impacting both ongoing projects and future projects, but it is a small enough number that we did not see a big impact in our performance or expect a big impact in our performance from that. With respect to Japan, the impact there was not felt in the quarter at all. And in fact, Japan had a good quarter, which is a little -- may seem a little strange, but we have not seen the impact there. The Japan situation is something that we are monitoring very, very closely, because it's a potential impact to our supply chain. We do not believe there will be an impact to our supply chain in the third quarter. We have adequate stocks and inventories and the supply chain can support our third quarter. We are very mindful and watching the fourth quarter and beyond. And in particular, our concern with respect to Japan and the supply chain is really the sub-tier suppliers to our component suppliers. There is some heavy concentration in some of the industries that support particularly electronics. And those sub-suppliers have been impacted, and it's a question of when they can get their production lines running, when the environment there will stabilize both in transportation and energy, and will we be able to maintain an adequate supply or find adequate replacement that could impact at some point in our fourth quarter or more probably going into 2012. So our concern in the macro area is really Middle East, North Africa and supply chain of component suppliers from Japan, as we move into our fourth quarter."

Now we are not on the vehicles, so the fact that they're running at less capacity does not immediately impact us as a supplier. But, I think, you probably have seen the comments from Toyota just recently where they expect substantial production declines over an extended period of time. Our only concern with automotive is if there is a prolonged reduction in production, that's going to impact their investment simply because of profitability and cash flow. And that is something that could be an impact later, but today, projects actually have increased in the quarter. I should say the front log of projects, particularly in North America, have increased in the quarter in auto. And we are seeing continued strength in Asia Pacific and Latin America. So no change yet. A concern in the future that if there is a supply chain, extended supply-chain disruption that some of the automakers may have to revisit some of their CapEx spending just simply based upon current business performance."

And we had to buy those components in different markets from different channels than would be our traditional suppliers so we could increase inventory and protect production. And that cost us, and we expect it to cost us a little more money in the second half of the year to be able to do that. And quite candidly, we felt that was a good trade-off and one that we would make basically any day, to do the best we can, as fast as we can to provide a little more confidence in our supply chain to be able to support the growth, particularly at the growth rates we're now seeing. I mean, it's very important to us to keep driving growth and to minimize as best we can any supply-chain disruption, and I've got to hand it to our supply chain people, our logistics people. They have done a great job in managing the front end of this process, and we feel as good as we can about the outlook there.

The current situation would be those performing above Rockwell Automation average would be transportation, which we would include auto and tire in that mining. The verticals that are, at the company average, really are heavily in the heavy industries, oil and gas, particularly in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Metals is getting a little stronger mainly due to the automotive demands and commodity prices that are out there now. And those, that are -- and we're starting to see growth again in the life sciences area at about the company average. And that one was lying previously. Likewise, water and wastewater continues to be a solid vertical. The below average really is around food and beverage. Now I don't want that to be a negative. It sounded like a negative because food and beverage never is dramatically high but it never is substantially weak. And so it just keeps moving along at the expected rate. It just so happens that these growth rates is below the company average. But we still do very well there, and it's a very important segment for us. And within the Consumer segment, we are seeing some improvement in the home and personal care sector, particularly in some of the large project spending, which means there is -- there are new lines coming on in that OEM and vertical segment, which would mainly be things like around converting machines for personal care products or for other aspects of home care. So that's what we're seeing. The strength that at this point in time and that's how we're seeing the different verticals across Rockwell Automation."

Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing among Chinese sort of auto customer specifically because, I guess, the one difference of Chinese auto versus everywhere else is, obviously, they have supply-chain issues. But the demand side in China, I guess, has been weaker for 5 or 6 months in automotive.

Let's talk about automotive in China first. You're absolutely right. The last couple of months, auto sales have slowed, and that's really mainly because of the incentives the Chinese have placed in that market have stopped, and also the thought of, are they going to continue to limit the availability of, I'll call it, licenses, in some of the major cities, being Beijing and Shanghai, are the ones most talked about. But we have not -- given that, we are still not seeing any slowdown in the spending or the investments that are going on in China. In particular, some of the multinationals are continuing to expand their joint ventures. And some of the leading Chinese manufacturers, domestic manufacturers, are also increasing their capacity. I think if there is any fallout, it will be in the second tier and third tier suppliers as opposed to the 5 to 10 leading suppliers that are competing very aggressively in China. So we also see there that we are able to work both across the automation space as well as the information space in the automotive market. And that is one of the areas that we have targeted for our information solutions growth, and we are seeing some start of traction in that spaces well in China. With respect to China in general, we continue to see the high growth. This was in the high 30s, and if you remember the last 3 quarters we were up 40 and 40-plus. So obviously, we're going to start lapping some very, very strong growth quarters in the second half of our year. We expect that we will continue to see solid growth. And for the full year, we expect to be a little over 20% for the full year. And we do expect that China will continue to be able to grow at that rate over the short and intermediate term. And we continue to add resources. We continue to expand our distribution and channel capabilities in China and continue to build out the organization infrastructure to be able to absorb that growth. And we're very cognizant of the need to have the resources and the structure and the talent to be able to continue to drive growth in that market. And we know we're outperforming the underlying market growth there. So we feel good about China and its future for Rockwell Automation."

So I'm hoping that we'll have another one to talk about in the near future here. And we continue to exercise the pipeline, and we continue to drive opportunities on a global basis. As I would say, in the last 12 months, 18 months, we certainly tried to expand the radar screen to have a much more interest on companies that are in emerging markets and are able to help us grow faster in those high growth potential areas, so we think we have a solid pipeline. And as Ted mentioned, that is one of the options for cash deployment. And that's why we are trying to balance the cash needs of running the business with acquisitions with return of excess to shareholders whether that's dividends or whether that's a dividend increase or whether that's ramping up in the second half of the year, our stock repurchase. We still have, as you mentioned, a question around a voluntary contribution to the pension plan. That can also impact that. And what we try to do is to make sure we are able to make any acquisitions that we want and after that, we apply it to  those other categories.

We also think that goes back to a normal, more normal level as we get through the balance of the year. Frankly, if in the balance of year, Motion Control continues growing at 40% year-over-year, on top of the  conversion margin because of that, I'm not going to be disappointed."

The one piece is the controllers and software. And that has margins above the segment average. We also have, for lack of a better word, peripheral products, which is, where we have Motion Control and a lot of our component, Sensing and Safety businesses. Those have very good product margins. It just so happens they're not at the same level as our software and controllers. And so they are below the segment average. And while those are very good margins, and as Ted said, we'd be happy to report continued growth in any of those, and we have talked about the high rates of growth in Safety. And in EMEA, by the way, we have another high growth rate this quarter. So those two pieces make up a very important piece of our OEM portfolio. And the other positive part of this is we are now selling more of our portfolio on the machines. And that's a real positive for the conversion and for the ongoing building of this  annuity at OEMs. And more importantly, why we are excited about building that OEM segment is because at some point in the future, it converts to MRO business. And certainly the MRO business in our products is also a very solid and important portion of the business, not just to Rockwell Automation but for our channel partners as well. So it's strictly a  what's really good and what's good. And that's the dynamics that are playing on here with the margin, but we're absolutely excited about OEM business. We're excited about our Motion business, our Sensing Component businesses, our Safety Components. Those are all great businesses. And our goal is to grow on as fast as possible and as a long as possible so we can build an installed base, as well as being the control supplier of choice at those OEMs and sell them everything out of our portfolio. So, I think, that's -- we continue to work on margins in all our businesses, including our controllers and our software. So the goal is how can we improve all of our margins, but the mix continues to be one that given on how that plays out in any given quarter, can move the average A&S margin a little bit up or down."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. Please turn to Page 4, which captures the key messages for the quarter. I'll touch on these during my remarks. I am very pleased with a record results in the third quarter. Sales of over $1.5 billion, earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.22 and after-tax return on invested capital of 29.3% are all new quarterly highs for the company. Strong organic growth of almost 14% and the diversity of that sales growth across regions and verticals indicate that we are capitalizing on our growth opportunities. Architecture & Software had an outstanding quarter with LOGIX growth of over 25% excluding the impact of currency. Operating margins continue to improve in the quarter and year-to-date margin is up over 2 percentage points compared to a year ago. There again, A&S was a standout, with the highest quarterly operating margin during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Control Products & Solutions margins dipped compared to Q2 primarily because of lower organic volume and acquisitions. Plus keep in mind that Solutions margins tend to fluctuate more quarter to quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we are pleased that the margin in this segment has expanded almost 2 percentage points.
Cash flow was strong again this quarter in spite of the additional layer of inventory that we added to protect our customers after the Japan crisis. Fortunately, at this point, we don't see any significant risk to our supply chain due to Japan. I think Japan has managed very well in the crisis. Before I comment on the outlook, let me give you some other highlights in the quarter.
India was the star in emerging Asia with 27% organic growth. China was at midteens growth, which was in line with our expectations given the very strong Q3 from last year. We are gaining traction in emerging Europe in Q3, we had a significant $3 million water waste water win in Turkey. I'm pleased with the progress we are making in Process. Our Process business had its best quarter of the year with 18% year-over-year sales growth and 9% sequential growth, both on a currency neutral basis.
Globally, we are seeing more and larger legacy DCS conversion opportunities, and we continue to invest in our process domain expertise for selling, Application Engineering and technical support. Success with OEM customers continues to contribute to the above market growth we have seen in EMEA. And we closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter announced at 21% dividend increase and stepped up our share repurchases.
Our results in the third quarter kept us on track for an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. We have had excellent performance in through the first 3 quarters of the year. And capitalizing the strength of the industrial recovery and executing our growth and performance strategy. We are now 9 quarters into the recovery and market growth rates are recovering just as we would expect at this stage.
Given our strong year-to-date results and an increased tailwind from currency, we are increasing our full year sales outlook to approximately $5.9 billion, about half of the increase compared to the prior guidance is from currency in acquisitions, the other half from additional organic volume.
Based on the sales outlook, we are raising our fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance for $4.55 to $4.65. And we'll go through the puts and takes in more detail but at the midpoint, this represents more than a 50% increase in earnings per share compared to 2010 and record earnings per share from continuing operations.
Before I close, I'd like to welcome the employees of Lektronix to Rockwell Automation. Lektronix is our newly acquired Repair and Maintenance Service business based in the U.K. but with operations around the world. They serve a broad range of discrete and process industries and have expertise in most industrial automation products not just ours. We are excited to have them onboard, and we know they will help us expand our service to customers around the world.
And once again, I want to take the opportunity to thank the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and expertise support of the business and productivity needs of our customers and enabled us to sustain our long tradition of innovation and deliver superior financial performance. So with that, I will turn it over to tad to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter. And our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Ted?"

Bills in the quarter were $1,516,000, up 20% compared to Q3 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 6 points, that's a considerably larger currency impact than in recent quarters. Segment operating earnings were $263 million, an increase of 33% compared to Q3 last year. General Corporate net expense was $22.3 million compared to $23.1 million a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%. We benefited in the quarter from some discrete items that lowered the rate by about 2 points. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.22, an increase of 47% from $0.83 in Q3 last year. There was also a small benefit from discontinued operations in Q3 related to various a legacy legal and tax matters. Diluted earnings per share including that benefit was $0.01 higher at $1.23. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 145.9 million. As Keith mentioned, we stepped up share repurchases in Q3. We repurchased approximately 1.35 million shares in Q3 at a cost of about $114 million. Year-to-date through June, we've repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares. Turning to Page 6, of Q3 results of Rockwell Automation total. So on the left side of this slide, you can see the trend in sales. As I noted, sales were up 20% year-over-year in the quarter and also up 4% sequentially.
Moving to earnings on the right side of the slide. We've seen steady improvement over the past year, segment operating margins has continued to expand and improve by 1.8 points year-over-year to 17.4%. Operating margin improved sequentially by 7/10 of a point. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflects the volume leverage partially offset by increased spending to support growth and as Keith noted, we saw particularly strong margin performance and Architecture & Software segment in the quarter.
The year-over-year incremental margin was about 26%, so better than our Q2 result. The effects of currency and acquisitions reduced incremental margin by about 5 points in the quarter. On a relative basis, these effects had a significantly more negative impact on Control Products and Solutions segment and also some continued impact in Q3 from the unfavorable material costs that we talked about last quarter, but I was pretty much what we expected it to be coming into the quarter.
Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 29.3%. That's up from 17.7% in Q3 last year and another record for return on invested capital. Moving now to Page 7, this slide summarizes of the Q3 results of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment reported a really outstanding quarter with regards to both sales and margin performance. On the left side of the slide, year-over-year sales growth in the segment was up 21% in the third quarter, that included about 6 points of growth due to currency translation. Sequential growth was 8%.
We continue to see particularly good performance in this segment in the EMEA region reflecting in part continued success with OEM customers. Operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, up 3.5 points compared to last year. That's due primarily to a strong volume leverage, partially offset by increased spending.
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Bills in Q3 were $843 million up 18% compared to last year with about 5 points of the increased due to currency translation and about 1 points from acquisition. On a year-over-year basis, sales for the product portion of Control Products & Solutions segment were often about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment with the solutions and services business increasing by 16%. For the segment as a whole, you can see on the left side of the slide all in, sales were basically flat, sequentially but excluding currency translation, sales declined by about 2%.
Moving to the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings increased 20% year-over-year with a small improvement in operating margin. In Control Products & Solutions, volume leverage was just about offset by increased spending and somewhat lower margins in the Solutions businesses.
Solutions business margins tend to be somewhat more variable quarter to quarter. Also as I previously mentioned, currency effects is somewhat more negative impact on margins in the segment in this quarter. The Control Products & Solutions segments has fundamentally higher margins today than where we were at the beginning of their cover in last cycle. Year-to-date in the segment, operating margin is up 1.8 points, and we expect margin to expand as this recovery continues.
On Page 9, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which excludes currency effects. Very good growth across the regions, another particularly strong quarter in the EMEA region with 21% growth. That was about 19% growth excluding the impact from acquisitions. Latin America had another strong quarter with 21% growth. Asia-Pacific came in at 14% in the U.S. and Canada at about 10%.
Emerging markets continue to grow about the company average. 
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $194 million, which represents conversion on net income of 108%, that's a very good result. Year-to-date, free cash flow is at $424 million, that's a conversion of about 86%. We now feel it's likely will make discretionary U.S. pension contribution in the fourth quarter and that will put cash conversion for the full year more in the range of 75% to 85%.
And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we're increasing sales and earnings guidance. We've increased the full year sales to approximately $5.9 billion. That's $150 million increase compared to the previous guidance midpoint. About half of that increase is due to currency and acquisitions and the balance reflects somewhat higher organic growth in both the third and fourth quarter. For the full year, that represents growth of approximately 18% excluding currency effects, previous guidance range was 15% to 70%. Based on currency rates experienced in Q3, for the full year, we now expect currency to contribute a little over 3 points to growth. We've increased that by about 1 point from our previous guidance. We continue to expect segment margin to be about 17%. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is now $4.55 to $4.65. Compared to the previous guidance, we raised EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint and with only one quarter remaining in this fiscal year, we've narrowed the range from $0.20 to $0.10.
Basically compared to the prior guidance, midpoint to midpoint, we're getting a positive contribution from volume and a somewhat lower tax rate that was partially offset by less favorable mix and increased performance-based compensation expense due to the higher sales and earnings.
A couple of other items related to the full year guidance, we expect the full-year tax rate of 19% to 20%, lower byte 1 point compared to the previous guidance and it is a expect general corporate tax expense of about $80 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back to run the and we'll get to Q&A."

The only caveat and reminder I'll put it on that is this quarter, we have -- August is a very weak month and certainly, a preponderance of our revenue for the quarter close in September and that means it's 6 weeks away and we'll hopefully see how that plays out.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. Please turn to Page 4, which captures the key messages from the quarter. I'll touch on these during my remarks. I am very pleased with the record results in the third quarter. Sales of over $1.5 billion, earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.22 and after-tax return on invested capital of 29.3% are all new quarterly highs for the company. Strong organic growth of almost 14% and the diversity of that sales growth across regions and verticals indicate that we are capitalizing on our growth opportunities. Architecture & Software had an outstanding quarter with LOGIX growth of over 25% excluding the impact of currency. Operating margins continue to improve in the quarter and year-to-date margin is up over 2 percentage points compared to a year ago. Here again, A&S was a standout, with the highest quarterly operating margin since the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Control Products & Solutions margins dipped compared to Q2, primarily because of lower organic volume and acquisitions. Plus keep in mind that Solutions margins tend to fluctuate more quarter-to-quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we are pleased that the margin in this segment has expanded almost 2 percentage points.
Cash flow was strong again this quarter in spite of the additional layer of inventory that we added to protect our customers after the Japan crisis. Fortunately, at this point, we don't see any significant risk to our supply chain due to Japan. I think Japan has managed very well through the crisis. Before I comment on the outlook, let me give you some other highlights in the quarter.
India was a star in emerging Asia with 27% organic growth. China was at mid-teens growth, which was in line with our expectations given the very strong Q3 from last year. We are gaining traction in emerging Europe in Q3. We had a significant $3 million water waste water win in Turkey. I'm pleased with the progress we are making in Process. Our Process business had its best quarter of the year with 18% year-over-year sales growth and 9% sequential growth, both on a currency neutral basis.
Globally, we are seeing more and larger legacy DCS conversion opportunities, and we continue to invest in our process domain expertise for selling, Application Engineering and technical support. Success with OEM customers continues to contribute to the above market growth we have seen in EMEA. And we closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter announced at 21% dividend increase and stepped up our share repurchases.
Our results in the third quarter kept us on track for an outstanding year for the company and for our shareowners. We have had excellent performance through the first 3 quarters of the year by capitalizing on the strength of the industrial recovery and executing our growth and performance strategy. We are now 9 quarters into the recovery and market growth rates are moderating just as we would expect at this stage.
Given our strong year-to-date results and an increased tailwind from currency, we are increasing our full year sales outlook to approximately $5.9 billion, about half of the increase compared to the prior guidance is from currency and acquisitions, but the other half from additional organic volume.
Based on the sales outlook, we are raising our fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance for $4.55 to $4.65. And we'll go through the puts and takes in more detail. But at the midpoint, this represents more than a 50% increase in the earnings per share compared to 2010 and record earnings per share from continuing operations.
Before I close, I'd like to welcome the employees of Lektronix to Rockwell Automation. Lektronix is our newly acquired Repair and Maintenance Service business based in the U.K. but with operations around the world. They serve a broad range of both discrete and process industries, and have expertise in most industrial automation products not just ours. We are excited to have them onboard, and we know they will help us expand our service to customers around the world.
And once again, I want to take the opportunity to thank the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and expertise support the business and productivity needs of our customers and enabled us to sustain our long tradition of innovation and deliver superior financial performance. So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter. And our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Ted?"

Sales in the quarter were $1,516,000, up 20% compared to Q3 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 6 points, that's a considerably larger currency impact than recent quarters. Segment operating earnings were $263 million, an increase of 33% compared to Q3 last year. General Corporate net expense was $22.3 million compared to $23.1 million a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%. We benefited in the quarter from some discrete items that lowered the rate by about 2 points. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.22, an increase of 47% from $0.83 in Q3 last year. There was also a small benefit from discontinued operations in Q3 related to various legacy legal and tax matters. Diluted earnings per share including that benefit was $0.01 higher at $1.23. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 145.9 million. As Keith mentioned, we stepped up share repurchases in Q3. We repurchased approximately 1.35 million shares in Q3 at a cost of about $114 million. Year-to-date through June, we've repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares. 
Turning to Page 6, the Q3 results Rockwell Automation total. So on the left side of this slide, you can see the trend in sales. As I noted, sales were up 20% year-over-year in the quarter and also up 4%, sequentially.
Moving to earnings on the right side of the slide. We've seen steady improvement over the past year, segment operating margins has continued to expand and improve by 1.8 points year-over-year to 17.4%. Operating margin improved sequentially by 7/10 of a point. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflects the volume leverage, partially offset by increased spending to support growth. And as Keith noted, we saw particularly strong margin performance in the Architecture & Software segment in the quarter.
The year-over-year incremental margin was about 26%, so better than our Q2 result. The effects of currency and acquisitions reduced incremental margin by about 5 points in the quarter. On a relative basis, these effects had a significantly more negative impact on the Control Products & Solutions segment. And also some continued impact in Q3 from the unfavorable material costs that we talked about last quarter, but that was pretty much what we expected it to be coming into the quarter.
Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 29.3%. That's up from 17.7% in Q3 last year and another record for return on invested capital. 
Moving now to Page 7. This slide summarizes the Q3 results of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment reported a really outstanding quarter with regards to both sales and margin performance. On the left side of the slide, year-over-year sales growth in the segment was 21% in the third quarter, that included about 6 points of growth due to currency translation. Sequential growth was 8%.
We continue to see particularly good performance in this segment in the EMEA region, reflecting in part continued success with OEM customers. Operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, up 3.5 points compared to last year. That's due primarily to a strong volume leverage, partly offset by increased spending.
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q3 were $843 million, up 18% compared to last year with about 5 points of the increased due to currency translation and about 1 point from acquisition. On a year-over-year basis, sales for the products portion of Control Products & Solutions segment were up at about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment with the solutions and services business increasing by 16%. For the segment, as a whole, you can see here on the left side of the slide all in, sales were basically flat sequentially, but excluding currency translation, sales declined by about 2%.
Moving to the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings increased 20% year-over-year with a small improvement in operating margin. In Control Products & Solutions, volume leverage was just about offset by increased spending and somewhat lower margins in the solutions businesses.
Solutions business margins tend to be somewhat more variable quarter to quarter. Also as I previously mentioned, currency effects had a somewhat more negative impact on margins in this segment this quarter. The Control Products & Solutions segments has fundamentally higher margins today than where we were at the beginning of the recovery in the last cycle. Year-to-date in this segment, operating margin is up 1.8 points, and we expect margin to expand as the recovery continues.
On Page 9, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which excludes currency effects. Very good growth across the regions, another particularly strong quarter in the EMEA region with 21% growth. That was about 19% growth excluding the impact of acquisitions. Latin America had another strong quarter with 21% growth. Asia-Pacific came in at 14%, and the U.S. and Canada at about 10%.
Emerging markets continue to grow above the company average. 
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $194 million, which represents conversion on net income of 108%, that's a very good result. Year-to-date, free cash flow is at $424 million, that's a conversion of about 86%. We now feel it's likely that we will make a discretionary U.S. pension contribution in the fourth quarter, and that will put cash conversion for the full year more in the range of 75% to 85%.
And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we're increasing sales and earnings guidance. We've increased full year sales to approximately $5.9 billion. That's $150 million increase compared to the previous guidance midpoint. About half of that increase is due to currency and acquisitions and the balance reflects a somewhat higher organic growth in both the third and fourth quarter. For the full year, that represents growth of approximately 18%, excluding currency effects, previous guidance range was 15% to 17%. Based on currency rates experienced in Q3, for the full year, we now expect currency to contribute a little over 3 points to growth. We've increased that by about 1 point from our previous guidance. We continue to expect segment margin to be about 17%. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is now $4.55 to $4.65. Compared to the previous guidance, we raised EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint and with only one quarter remaining in this fiscal year, we've narrowed the range from $0.20 to $0.10.
Basically compared to the prior guidance, midpoint to midpoint, we're getting a positive contribution from volume and a somewhat lower tax rate that was partially offset by less favorable mix and increased performance-based compensation expense due to the higher sales and earnings.
A couple of other items related to the full year guidance, we expect the full-year tax rate of 19% to 20%, lower by 1 point compared to the previous guidance and we continue to expect general corporate net expense of about $80 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back to Rondi, and we'll get to Q&A."

So we feel pretty good about our outlook at this point in the process. The only caveat and reminder I'll put it on that is this quarter, we have -- August is a very weak month and certainly, a preponderance of our revenue for the quarter close in September and that means it's 6 weeks away and we'll hopefully see how that plays out. With respect to once again the China and U.S., both China and the U.S. had sequential growth in the quarter. So the moderation is on a year-over-year performance as we go forward based upon where we are in a recovery, for sure, in the U.S. and just based upon a very significant growth in China in our fourth quarter of last year."

We've been very pleased with the developments of our sales organization and competence in this area and our channel partners, whether it be system integrators or our distributors, both of those are very critical to continuing to build what we would call the ecosystem to be able to support the process industries. And that part has gone well, but it's never ended either. So we keep building that, the technology, every release of a new logic platform generally has something in it that is a better -- that helps the process application and some more than others but certainly when we released PlantPAx 2.0, that was a very significant improvement in our capability. The other area in process that we are working very hard on it is with the process grid OEMs, and that's another way that Rockwell Automation can differentiate the fact that we know how to interface with OEM. Just a big part of our machine -- our discrete business has been historically and as all of you know, we've been focusing on OEMs the last couple of years and process grid is just one of the 6 segments that we go after. But it is very important from the overall plant-wide optimization strategy that we are implementing. So the ability to address more application, more industry continues to help us, continues to help us grow at the rates we're growing.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. Please turn to Page 4, which captures the key messages from the quarter. I'll touch on these during my remarks. I am very pleased with the record results in the third quarter. Sales of over $1.5 billion, earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.22 and after-tax return on invested capital of 29.3% are all new quarterly highs for the company. Strong organic growth of almost 14% and the diversity of that sales growth across regions and verticals indicate that we are capitalizing on our growth opportunities. Architecture & Software had an outstanding quarter with LOGIX growth of over 25% excluding the impact of currency. Operating margin continued to improve in the quarter and year-to-date margin is up over 2 percentage points compared to a year ago. Here again, A&S was a standout, with the highest quarterly operating margin since the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Control Products & Solutions margins dipped compared to Q2, primarily because of lower organic volume and acquisitions. Plus keep in mind that Solutions margins tend to fluctuate more quarter-to-quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we are pleased that the margin in this segment has expanded almost 2 percentage points.
Cash flow was strong again this quarter in spite of the additional layer of inventory that we added to protect our customers after the Japan crisis. Fortunately, at this point, we don't see any significant risk to our supply chain due to Japan. I think Japan has managed very well through the crisis. Before I comment on the outlook, let me give you some other highlights in the quarter.
India was a star in emerging Asia with 27% organic growth. China was at mid-teens growth, which was in line with our expectations given the very strong Q3 from last year. We are gaining traction in emerging Europe in Q3. We had a significant $3 million water waste water win in Turkey. I'm pleased with the progress we are making in Process. Our Process business had its best quarter of the year with 18% year-over-year sales growth and 9% sequential growth, both on a currency neutral basis.
Globally, we are seeing more and larger legacy DCS conversion opportunities, and we continue to invest in our process domain expertise for selling, Application Engineering and technical support. Success with OEM customers continues to contribute to the above market growth we have seen in EMEA. And we closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter announced at 21% dividend increase and stepped up our share repurchases.
Our results in the third quarter kept us on track for an outstanding year for the company and for our shareowners. We have had excellent performance through the first 3 quarters of the year by capitalizing on the strength of the industrial recovery and executing our growth and performance strategy. We are now 9 quarters into the recovery and market growth rates are moderating just as we would expect at this stage.
Given our strong year-to-date results and an increased tailwind from currency, we are increasing our full year sales outlook to approximately $5.9 billion, about half of the increase compared to the prior guidance is from currency and acquisitions, but the other half from additional organic volume.
Based on the sales outlook, we are raising our fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance for $4.55 to $4.65. And we'll go through the puts and takes in more detail. But at the midpoint, this represents more than a 50% increase in the earnings per share compared to 2010 and record earnings per share from continuing operations.
Before I close, I'd like to welcome the employees of Lektronix to Rockwell Automation. Lektronix is our newly acquired Repair and Maintenance Service business based in the U.K. but with operations around the world. They serve a broad range of both discrete and process industries, and have expertise in most industrial automation products - not just ours. We are excited to have them onboard, and we know they will help us expand our service to customers around the world.
And once again, I want to take the opportunity to thank the people and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and expertise support the business and productivity needs of our customers and enable us to sustain our long tradition of innovation and deliver superior financial performance. So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter. And our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Ted?"

I'll start with Q3 results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,516,000,000 up 20% compared to Q3 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,516,000,000 up 20% compared to Q3 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 6 points, that's a considerably larger currency impact than recent quarters. Segment operating earnings were $263 million, an increase of 33% compared to Q3 last year. General Corporate net expense was $22.3 million compared to $23.1 million a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%. We benefited in the quarter from some discrete items that lowered the rate by about 2 points. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.22, an increase of 47% from $0.83 in Q3 last year. There was also a small benefit from discontinued operations in Q3 related to various legacy legal and tax matters. Diluted earnings per share including that benefit was $0.01 higher at $1.23. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 145.9 million. As Keith mentioned, we stepped up share repurchases in Q3. We repurchased approximately 1.35 million shares in Q3 at a cost of about $114 million. Year-to-date through June, we've repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares. 
Turning to Page 6, the Q3 results Rockwell Automation total. So on the left side of this slide, you can see the trend in sales. As I noted, sales were up 20% year-over-year in the quarter and also up 4%, sequentially.
Moving to earnings on the right side of the slide. We've seen steady improvement over the past year, segment operating margins has continued to expand and improve by 1.8 points year-over-year to 17.4%. Operating margin improved sequentially by 7/10 of a point. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflects volume leverage, partially offset by increased spending to support growth. And as Keith noted, we saw particularly strong margin performance in the Architecture & Software segment in the quarter.
The year-over-year incremental margin was about 26%, so better than our Q2 result. The effects of currency and acquisitions reduced incremental margin by about 5 points in the quarter. On a relative basis, these effects had a significantly more negative impact on the Control Products & Solutions segment. And also some continued impact in Q3 from the unfavorable material costs that we talked about last quarter, but that was pretty much what we expected it to be coming into the quarter.
Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 29.3%. That's up from 17.7% in Q3 last year and another record for return on invested capital. 
Moving now to Page 7. This slide summarizes the Q3 results of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment reported a really outstanding quarter with regards to both sales and margin performance. On the left side of the slide, year-over-year sales growth in the segment was 21% in the third quarter, that included about 6 points of growth due to currency translation. Sequential growth was 8%.
We've continue to see particularly good performance in this segment in the EMEA region, reflecting in part continued success with OEM customers. Operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, up 3.5 points compared to last year. That's due primarily to a strong volume leverage, partly offset by increased spending.
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in Q3 were $843 million, up 18% compared to last year with about 5 points of the increased due to currency translation and about 1 point from acquisition. On a year-over-year basis, sales for the products portion of Control Products & Solutions segment were up at about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment with the solutions and services business increasing by 16%. For the segment, as a whole, you can see here on the left side of the slide all in, sales were basically flat sequentially, but excluding currency translation, sales declined by about 2%.
Moving to the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings increased 20% year-over-year with a small improvement in operating margin. In Control Products & Solutions, volume leverage was just about offset by increased spending and somewhat lower margins in the solutions businesses.
Solutions business margins tend to be somewhat more variable quarter to quarter. Also as I previously mentioned, currency effects had a somewhat more negative impact on margins in this segment this quarter. The Control Products & Solutions segments has fundamentally higher margins today than where we were at the beginning of the recovery in the last cycle. Year-to-date in this segment, operating margin is up 1.8 points, and we expect margin to expand as the recovery continues.
On Page 9, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which excludes currency effects. Very good growth across the regions, another particularly strong quarter in the EMEA region with 21% growth. That was about 19% growth excluding the impact of acquisitions. Latin America had another strong quarter with 21% growth. Asia-Pacific came in at 14%, and the U.S. and Canada at about 10%.
Emerging markets continue to grow above the company average. 
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $194 million, which represents conversion on net income of 108%, that's a very good result. Year-to-date, free cash flow is at $424 million, that's a conversion of about 86%. We now feel it's likely that we will make a discretionary U.S. pension contribution in the fourth quarter, and that will put cash conversion for the full year more in the range of 75% to 85%.
And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '11. As Keith mentioned, we're increasing sales and earnings guidance. We've increased full year sales to approximately $5.9 billion. That's $150 million increase compared to the previous guidance midpoint. About half of that increase is due to currency and acquisitions and the balance reflects a somewhat higher organic growth in both the third and fourth quarter. For the full year, that represents growth of approximately 18%, excluding currency effects, previous guidance range was 15% to 17%. Based on currency rates experienced in Q3, for the full year, we now expect currency to contribute a little over 3 points to growth. We've increased that by about 1 point from our previous guidance. We continue to expect segment margin to be about 17%. Our fiscal 2011 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is now $4.55 to $4.65. Compared to the previous guidance, we raised EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint and with only one quarter remaining in this fiscal year, we've narrowed the range from $0.20 to $0.10.
Basically compared to the prior guidance, midpoint to midpoint, we're getting a positive contribution from volume and a somewhat lower tax rate that was partially offset by less favorable mix and increased performance-based compensation expense due to the higher sales and earnings.
A couple of other items related to the full year guidance, we expect the full-year tax rate of 19% to 20%, lower by 1 point compared to the previous guidance and we continue to expect general corporate net expense of about $80 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back to Rondi, and we'll get to Q&A."

So we feel pretty good about our outlook at this point in the process. The only caveat and reminder I'll put it on that is this quarter, we have -- August is a very weak month and certainly, a preponderance of our revenue for the quarter close in September and that means it's 6 weeks away and we'll hopefully see how that plays out. With respect to once again the China and U.S., both China and the U.S. had sequential growth in the quarter. So the moderation is on a year-over-year performance as we go forward based upon where we are in a recovery, for sure, in the U.S. and just based upon a very significant growth in China in our fourth quarter of last year."

So we keep building that, the technology, every release of a new logic platform generally has something in it that is a better -- that helps the process application and some more than others but certainly when we released PlantPAx 2.0, that was a very significant improvement in our capability.

The fourth quarter capped a year of outstanding sales and earnings performance. All regions performed extremely well. In the emerging markets, year-over-year growth rates moderated as we anticipated and discussed on the last earnings call, but sequential growth was solid at 14%. Great execution in our solutions businesses resulted in a very strong quarter with the Control Products & Solutions segment. On total company sales growth of 22%, earnings per share grew more than 50% to $1.39. So in every dimension, another excellent quarter.
We have a lot to be proud of in 2011. In the midst of packets of economic turmoil, social unrest and natural disasters, we hit on all cylinders. For the full year, we had record sales of $6 billion and now have exceeded peak sales from the previous cycle. Logix sales grew 29%, reflecting the success of our plantwide optimization strategy and continued penetration both in process applications and with OEM customers. Emerging markets grew over 30%, reaching 22% of total sales despite strong sales growth in the U.S. and Europe.
Sales growth for the year of 24% is noteworthy. Our earnings per share growth of 57% more than, double our sales growth rate, is even more impressive. Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to fund organic growth, made 2 acquisitions, significantly increased the dividend for the second consecutive year, repurchased 4 million shares and made $450 million in discretionary U.S. pension contributions in September and October.
The performance this past year is evidenced that not only is the strategy right but our team is executing extremely well. I want to thank our employees for their dedication in making this year possible and our customers and partners for their continued support.
Let me shift gears and talk about future. Although it is hard to know exactly how this business cycle will play out in the near term, the long-term outlook is bright for the automation market and for Rockwell Automation in particular. There is an ongoing need for automation investment in developed markets to drive productivity and manufacturing flexibility, to address safety and sustainability needs of customers and to replace an aging installed base. 
In emerging markets, the case for automation is even more compelling. There still is a need for infrastructure investment such as metro systems, port facilities and Water Wastewater treatment plants. Oil and gas and mining investment remains healthy and is critical to the economic development of the emerging market.
Rising standards of living, including a rapidly growing middle class will increase a need for consumer products manufacturing, and wage inflation is a natural tailwind for automation investment.
The time I spent with customers reinforces my confidence that we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on these trends. Our relentless focus on developing innovative solutions to our customers' business needs enables us to constantly expand the opportunities available to us. 
Let me give you a flavor of the broad range of applications for our technology. Our PlantPAx system used to standardize process control for resin reactors used in paint manufacturing for a customer with 12 plants around the world; a turnkey solutions for control and remotely monitoring various bitumen extraction sites spread across northern Canada; a complete solution, including design, engineering, commissioning, validation and product trials for a manufacturer of baby milk in China; an integrated process in power control system for high altitude mining in the Andes; and converting a European tire machine builder to a common platform through motion, safety and control.
Our customers look to us for our innovative design, deep domain expertise and thought leadership. We are committed to supporting our customers from the idea stage through the total life cycle of their automation investment. I have never seen better alignment across our global organization around our strategic priorities. We care about how customers judge our performance just as we care about how investors judge our performance. We are confident that when we satisfy our customers, our shareowners benefit.
So let me give you our thoughts on fiscal 2012. The global economic picture is pretty cloudy these days. In mature markets, the outlook is for low and uneven growth. Some are even predicting a mild recession in Europe. In emerging markets, growth rates are expected to moderate. Customers are spending now, but we are hearing a more cautious tone about their spending outlook. It's possible that customers may adopt a wait-and-see attitude on CapEx in early calendar 2012. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our opportunities. We have demonstrated success in our key growth accelerators and our new product pipeline is as robust as it has ever been. 
With all of that in mind for fiscal 2012, we are projecting sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, growth of 5% to 9%, excluding currency. Based on this sales outlook, we are providing fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.05 to $5.45. We enter fiscal '12 from a position of strength, technology leadership, talented and dedicated employees, expanding opportunities and a strong financial position. We will remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. 
We proved during the downturn in 2009 and the recovery in 2010 that our management team is nimble and knows how to take actions that balance the long-term health of the company with short-term economic reality.
Our strategic priorities remain the same, and we will continue to invest in our best growth opportunities. Before I wrap up, I hear that we are expecting a full house at the Investor Meeting during automation fair in Chicago next week. For those of you haven't been to an automation fair, we expect to host over 10,000 customers and partners from all over the world, and it's a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among customers.
We will take you on a hosted tour of the show floor and then hold a webcast where you will learn more about our strategy and how we help our customers, from me, Frank, the head of our Architecture & Software solutions; the head of our Control Products & Solutions segment; and John McDermott, the leader of our global sales and marketing team. We are really pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about us, and we look forward to seeing you there.
So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?"

As usual, I'll start with the Q4 results summary that's on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,654,000,000, an increase of 22% compared to Q4 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,654,000,000, an increase of 22% compared to Q4 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points and acquisitions added about another 1 point. Segment operating earnings were $298 million, an increase of 45% compared to last year. General Corporate net was $22.2 million. That's down from $27.4 million a year ago. And the effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.2%.
Diluted earnings per share was $1.39, an increase of 53% compared to $0.91 in Q4 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $144.4 million. And in Q4, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $78 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4 million shares at a cost of $299 million.
Turning to Page 6 now, on our Q4 results, Rockwell Automation total. On the left side of this slide, you can see the sales results for the past several quarters. It's been a steady upward trend with a particularly strong sequential increase in Q4. As I've noted on previous slide, in Q4 sales were up 22% year-over-year and they were also up 9% sequentially. 
Moving to earnings on the right side of the chart, consistent and significant improvement in earnings as well. Segment operating margins has continued to expand and increased by 2.9 points point year-over-year to 18%. Sequentially, operating margin improved by 0.06 of a point. The year-over-year improvement and operating margin reflects volume leverage, partially offset by mix and increased spending to support growth. I'll cover this in more detail later, but our solutions businesses had a great quarter and that sales mix created a bit of headwind to operating margin in Q4.
The year-over-year incremental margin was about 31%. That's an improvement from Q3 as we reflected in our guidance last quarter. We experienced higher conversion margin in both segments. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 31.6%, another record result.
Moving on to Page 7. This slide summarizes the fourth quarter results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $683 million in the quarter, a year-over-year sales increase of 19%. That included about 5 points of growth due to currency translation. Sequentially, sales increased by 2%. Operating margin in this segment for the quarter was 26%. That's up 3.7 points compared to Q4 last year. So a very good quarter in all respects for Architecture & Software. 
The next slide, Page 8 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. CP&S sales in Q4 were $971 million, a very strong year-over-year increase of 24%. About 4.5 points of the increase was due to currency translation and about 1.5 points from acquisitions. I mentioned earlier the strong sales results in our solutions businesses. We had extraordinary execution in these businesses for the quarter. Sales in our solutions and services businesses increased by 27% year-over-year while sales for the product portion of Control Products & Solutions increased 21%.
We normally experience significant growth in the Control Products & Solutions segment from Q3 to Q4 but this year was particularly strong with 15% sequential growth. Moving to the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings increased 57% year-over-year, and we saw significant operating margin expansion year-over-year and sequentially. 
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which displays the year-over-year growth excluding currency effects, just a great growth across all regions. The strongest growth was in the Americas. The U.S. and Canada had a really strong and to year. Latin America grew 23% year-over-year, and we were pleased to see another very solid quarter from EMEA and Asia-Pacific, with growth in the midteens. As Keith mentioned, the emerging market growth rates decelerated a bit this quarter on a year-over-year basis but still healthy in the high teens excluding currency, and that result is consistent with the expectations we've discussed on the third quarter earnings call.
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $137 million, and that represents conversion on net income of 68%. The free cash flow result includes the impact of $150 million pretax contribution in September to our U.S. pension trust. Excluding the after-tax effect of that contribution, conversion on net income would have been 130%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $562 million. That represents conversion on net income of 81%. If you exclude the discretionary pension contribution, conversion for the full year would have been 96% pretty close to our 100% target.
We also made an additional discretionary pension contribution of $300 million in October. The contributions in September and October were in response to continued declines in the pension discount rate and a consequent increase in the underfunded status of our pension plans. With these contributions, we feel the plans are appropriately funded. Obviously, future required contributions will depend on future discount rates and asset performance, along with some other factors. But we expect these contributions to cover any otherwise mandatory U.S. contributions for about the next few years.
So that's the fourth quarter. Let's move to Page 11 for a summary of the full year fiscal '11 results. Keith touched on much of this, so I'll be brief. Sales reached $6 billion for the full year, up 24%, with organic growth of 20%. So fiscal '11 was a second year of a pretty robust recovery on the industrial side of the economy and very good execution across the company. This result puts us above the prior cycle peak sales.
Segment operating margin for the full year was a little over 17%. We view that as a very good result at this point in our recovery. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $4.79. So on a 24% increase in sales, EPS from continuing operations increased 57%. 
And we've already covered cash flow, so let's move to Page 12 and discuss the outlook for fiscal '12.
I'll start with some anticipated headwinds and tailwinds. Related to sales performance in fiscal '12, we believe that macroeconomic conditions will be a headwind. Mobile economic growth is clearly moderating. We expect to see flat to low single-digit GDP growth in the mature markets and somewhat lower growth than in fiscal year '11 in the emerging markets. Overall, a significantly less favorable growth environment than we experienced last year. In addition to the moderating growth, as Keith discussed, there's considerable uncertainty in the global economic picture, and we think that may cause customers to be cautious in regard to the capital spending plans in fiscal '12. We also expect currency to be a modest headwind to sales in fiscal '12. 
On the tailwind side for sales, we have the benefit of a solid baseline as reflected in our run rates from the second half of fiscal year '11. For currency or I'm sorry, for earnings, currency will be a headwind. We also have a headwind to earnings and the carryover impact of fiscal year '11 spending increases, and we plan some continued investment in fiscal '12 as we continue to see top line improvement.
We also expect significant earnings headwinds due to a higher effective tax rate. For the full year fiscal year '11, our effective tax rate was 19.7%. For fiscal '12, we expect an effective rate of about 24%. We benefited from some significant discrete items in fiscal year '11. Our underlying effective rate in fiscal '11 was more like 22% to 23%. Earnings tailwinds include higher sales volume and a reset of incentive compensation. Given our financial performance in fiscal '11, last year was an above average year for incentive compensation. We expect to be back to more typical levels in fiscal '12. As I've mentioned previously, our incentive compensation is better broad-based and covers virtually all of our employees. Finally, we're expecting an earnings per share tailwind from lower share count.
So turning now to Page 13, this slide summarizes our fiscal '12 guidance. Our sales outlook is a range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that represents a year-over-year increase of between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce sales by about one point in fiscal '12. We're assuming that currency rates for the year will be about equal to the rates we experienced in October. As one benchmark in that regard, the guidance assumes a euro of $1.37. We expect segment operating margin to be about 18%. Based on these planning assumptions, we're projecting diluted EPS of between $5.05 and $5.45. I've addressed the effective tax rate expectations, and although it's not displayed here, we expect general corporate net spending of about $86 million. That's about $5 million higher than in fiscal year '11, and the increase is primarily because we had a $4 million gain on the sale of an asset in fiscal year '11.
Finally, we expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% on net income. That includes the effect of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in October. Excluding the after-tax effect of that contribution, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.
And with that, I'll turn this back to Rondi and we can begin the Q&A session."

There's not necessarily total certainty on which projects will clear and which ones will clear based upon witness testing, based upon customer requirements, based upon shipping and the ability to recognize revenue. And so we normally expect I'll just say some discount from what would be in the plan. And this quarter was one of those that is just unique about the fact that everything cleared. And so not only didn't we have a discount, but we have the overperformance that went away, and I think it's just an example of the variability that happens certainly in our solutions business, and I think there's good and bad news here. The good news is it was a great quarter. And certainly, we also had a very strong quarter of orders. So the book to bill was just under 1. And normally in our fourth quarter, it's a lower number because we always outperform shipments versus orders. But we had very strong orders months, so we're pleased with that in addition to the great sales. The bad news part of it is we probably created a gap in Q1 because of that strong shipment that normally would have flowed into Q1. We now have that as a gap but we don't see any problem in the full year because of the strong orders. But we aren't going to probably be able to fill that gap completely in Q1. So a lot of positives there, but certainly, we'll create a short-term gap. But no specific industry, no specific geography, just very, very good execution by our entire team on a projects business that is inherently lumpy and uneven."

What we are getting a question about is as they are planning for 2012, and how are they going to set their capital spending for the new year? They're becoming a little more cautious in what they're seeing in the environment, and therefore, as you so know, uncertainty is not the friend of investment. And certainly, one can say at a minimum we've had some uncertainty; and at a maximum, it's been quite chaotic in the evolution of the macroeconomic environment.

Certainly, at a minimum, there's the divide between North and South Europe. And South Europe for the last half of the year was performing weaker than the North. And when I say the North, I mean Germany, the Scandinavian countries in particular. So we are seeing a difference within, I'll just say, Western Europe, and the outlook there is certainly slowing in particular. We know that European OEM machine makers will have a slower growth than they did in 2011. Some of the industry organizations have forecast that indicate there'll be a slowing from a very high levels to, I'll say, a lower growth rate, but still growth. And we certainly know, talking to our OEMs, that while they are running at very high levels and they're certainly coming up to their capacity, they feel good about the next quarter, but I think as we roll into calendar 2012, they have less visibility, and as I said, those industry statistics indicate that there will be slowing. Some people say Europe's going to be in a recession. I think we're certainly on the edge. If you look at some of the recent PMI information, some of the industrial production, it's certainly slowing, and how they work their way through the debt crisis I think will tell us which is side of 0 do they fall on. And at this point, I think it's just a tough call. We like our position in Europe. We think we have growing share this past year as evidenced by the very strong growth we had year-over-year. Obviously, it's not our most -- it's not the best position given our strongest global competitor that is your home country. But we like our position. We like our differentiation with our integrated architecture and our intelligent motor control. And as we are growing our solutions and services capabilities, these are all opportunities for us to grow share in an area where we are definitely not the leaders. So we like our position. We like our differentiation, and as I mentioned earlier, that team there is functioning really well, executing the priorities and winning in the areas that we've targeted for growth."

I think there's the second and third tier companies and some of the credit capabilities that are going on there create a natural slowing and breaking effect. And obviously, as you well know, they have some inflation issues that you're trying to manage as well. But next year, we expect China to grow in the mid to high teens, which we think is continued very grew good growth given the growth we've had the last couple of years, and that is a continued outlook of good opportunities in both the OEM sector as well as the consumer industries continue to grow in China. That will be helpful. I would say that we had good orders growth in Q4. And once again, from our perspective, I would say it appears at this point in time anyway that China will have managed with a soft landing through another one of the bubbles that seem to always, not always, but have come about over the last couple of years. So we have a positive outlook for China at this point in time, and we expect to continue to not just grow but to take share, particularly as some of our newer products are introduced over the next fiscal year."

We think Toyota, in particular, will grow their capital spending. Obviously, they had some challenges this past year that they had to address from -- just from a recovery from a very significant disaster and the strong yen. And they certainly managed their capital spending this next year or last year, and so we expect that to be increased. Also GM, as they continue to come back strong, we expect that they will continue to win best in new platforms; and certainly, Ford and Chrysler. I should say Ford was spending throughout the cycle, so we would expect Ford to be consistent. And Chrysler Fiat is also looking at increasing their cap spending on a year-over-year basis. So right now, we believe that we'll see slightly more automotive spending in our next fiscal year, and certainly, we think that we'll be able to achieve growth in that area given our historical strength and our continued work of that in particular in the emerging countries and you mentioned a couple of them, Brazil and China are very important in the automotive manufacturing vertical."

And we do know that there is a large percentage, not a large -- a large dollar amount, tens of billions of that is basically legacy and old process systems that are at end of life. And that is one of the areas that we have targeted for our process growth, simply because a lot of those systems are no longer replaceable, if you will. There's not a migration because they are old systems that are no longer supported. And we see that as the opportunity for us to be able to demonstrate the value of plantwide optimization. And in particular after 20 to 30 years, where DCS systems were the only way to solve and to support that customer, today, a Logix Control architecture is very compatible with the application and the functionality requirements. So once again, it demonstrates the value of plantwide optimization and customers are making those choices. Process in the fourth quarter, for us, was the highest growth for the year. It grew 25%, and we believe that process in fiscal '12 will grow above the company average, and in the teams. So we see process as a continued opportunity for us to grow share. We are the market share that leader there, so I don't want people to get the wrong impression. We are probably fifth, fourth, fifth, depending on how you define the market, but I would say, we're continuing to be able to grow share and we would expect that to continue as the evolution of PlantPAx and we get a little more traction with the recent release of 2.0 and then certainly, as we continue to grow our expertise in that different applications. So we see process there as an ongoing growth opportunity for Rockwell."

If we can see the amount of units being sold continue to grow a little bit year after year, I think that will give them the confidence and the dollars to continue to reinvest. So I think it really boils down to the success in the market and the ability to bring the consumer back into the game, and obviously, what we've been talking about now for at least the last year is that while this has been a manufacturing-led recovery, the consumer is still struggling, whether it's high unemployment, consumer confidence, the continued reducing their debt burden, deleveraging. All of that is somewhat of a phenomenon, but we do believe the opportunities for continued growth in automotive investment bodes well certainly for the short term.

And we'd also see that the home and personal care products also continue to see, for us anyways and for the industry, solid growth. Life sciences I think continues to struggle a little as the companies continue to deal with some of the change in the industry and the impact that has on their P&Ls and balance sheets.

I think we are reverting to the mean relative to the past quarters in terms of the percentage of the call spent on that, though, which I'm sure you find refreshing. So if you look at the implied incremental margins, at the segment level within the 2012 framework and we assume we're working with the high-end of the organic revenue growth range, the 18% segment margin you called out would imply -- if we get the math right, about 27%, 20%, which is right in line with what you did in 2011. And I'm just wondering if you can provide some more, on your thinking behind that number in terms of the various puts and takes. So it sounds like you think price cost is a little bit more benign this year. Presumably, you're not assuming Japan's going to continue to be a problem. You mentioned that the growth rate for process you think is going to be similar for the company overall. So that doesn't really -- mix doesn't seem to be an impact issue from process. But maybe you can talk about products versus solutions and any other items that went into your thinking in terms of that upper 20s incrementals, assuming I got that right."

The fourth quarter capped to be a year of outstanding sales and earnings performance. All regions performed extremely well. In the emerging markets, year-over-year growth rates moderated as we anticipated and discussed on the last earnings call, but sequential growth was solid at 14%. Great execution in our solutions businesses resulted in a very strong quarter with the Control Products & Solutions segment. On total company sales growth of 22%, earnings per share grew more than 50% to $1.39. So in every dimension, another excellent quarter.
We have a lot to be proud of in 2011. In the midst of packets of economic turmoil, social unrest and natural disasters, we hit on all cylinders. For the full year, we had record sales of $6 billion and now have exceeded peak sales from the previous cycle. Logix sales grew 29%, reflecting the success of our plant-wide optimization strategy and continued penetration both in process applications and with OEM customers. Emerging markets grew over 30%, reaching 22% of total sales despite strong sales growth in the U.S. and Europe.
Sales growth for the year of 24% is noteworthy. Our earnings per share growth of 57% more than double our sales growth rate is even more impressive. Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to fund organic growth, made 2 acquisitions, significantly increased the dividend for the second consecutive year, repurchased 4 million shares and made $450 million in discretionary U.S. pension contributions in September and October.
The performance this past year is evidenced that not only is the strategy right, but our team is executing extremely well. I want to thank our employees for their dedication in making this year possible and our customers and partners for their continued support.
Let me shift gears and talk about future. Although it is hard to know exactly how this business cycle will play out in the near term, the long-term outlook is bright for the automation market and for Rockwell Automation in particular. There is an ongoing need for automation investment in developed markets to drive productivity and manufacturing flexibility, to address safety and sustainability needs of customers and to replace an aging installed base. 
In emerging markets, the case for automation is even more compelling. There still is a need for infrastructure investment such as metro systems, port facilities and Water Wastewater treatment plants. Oil and gas and mining investment remains healthy and is critical to the economic development of emerging markets. Rising standards of living, including a rapidly growing middle class will increase a need for consumer products manufacturing, and wage inflation is a natural tailwind for automation investment.
The time I spent with customers reinforces my confidence that we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on these trends. Our relentless focus on developing innovative solutions to our customers' business needs enables us to constantly expand the opportunities available to us. 
Let me give you a flavor of the broad range of applications for our technology. Our PlantPAx system used to standardize process control for resin reactors used in paint manufacturing for a customer with 12 plants around the world; a turnkey solution for control and remotely monitoring various bitumen extraction sites spread across northern Canada; a complete solution, including design, engineering, commissioning, validation and product trials for a manufacturer of baby milk in China; an integrated process in power control system for high altitude mining in the Andes; and converting a European tire machine builder to a common platform through motion, safety and control.
Our customers look to us for our innovative designs, deep domain expertise and thought leadership. We are committed to supporting our customers from the idea stage through the total life cycle of their automation investment. I have never seen better alignment across our global organization around our strategic priorities. We care about how customers judge our performance just as we care about how investors judge our performance. We are confident that when we satisfy our customers, our shareowners benefit.
So let me give you our thoughts on fiscal 2012. The global economic picture is pretty cloudy these days. In mature markets, the outlook is for low and uneven growth. Some are even predicting a mild recession in Europe. In emerging markets, growth rates are expected to moderate. Customers are spending now, but we are hearing a more cautious tone about their spending outlook. It's possible that customers may adopt a wait-and-see attitude on CapEx in early calendar 2012. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our opportunities. We have demonstrated success in our key growth accelerators and our new product pipeline is as robust as it has ever been. 
With all of that in mind for fiscal 2012, we are projecting sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, growth of 5% to 9%, excluding currency. Based on this sales outlook, we are providing fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.05 to $5.45. We enter fiscal '12 from a position of strength, technology leadership, talented and dedicated employees, expanding opportunities and a strong financial position. We will remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. 
We proved during the downturn in 2009 and the recovery in 2010 that our management team is nimble and knows how to take actions that balance the long-term health of the company with short-term economic realities.
Our strategic priorities remain the same, and we will continue to invest in our best growth opportunities. Before I wrap up, I hear that we are expecting a full house at the Investor Meeting during Automation Fair in Chicago next week. For those of you haven't been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host over 10,000 customers and partners from all over the world, and it's a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among customers.
We will take you on a hosted tour of the show floor and then hold a webcast, where you will learn more about our strategy and how we help our customers, from me, Frank Kulaszewicz, the head of our Architecture & Software segment; Blake Moret, the head of our Control Products & Solutions segment; and John McDermott, the leader of our Global Sales and Marketing team. We are really pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about us, and we look forward to seeing you there.
So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?"

As usual, I'll start with the Q4 results summary that's on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,654,000,000, an increase of 22% compared to Q4 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,654,000,000, an increase of 22% compared to Q4 last year. The year-over-year impact of currency translation increased sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points and acquisitions added about another point. Segment operating earnings were $298 million, an increase of 45% compared to last year. General corporate net was $22.2 million, that's down from $27.4 million a year ago. And the effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.2%.
Diluted earnings per share was $1.39, an increase of 53% compared to $0.91 in Q4 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $144.4 million. And in Q4, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $78 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4 million shares at a cost of $299 million.
Turning to Page 6 now, on our Q4 results, Rockwell Automation total. On the left side of this slide, you can see the sales results for the past several quarters. It's been a steady upward trend with a particularly strong sequential increase in Q4. As I noted on previous slide, in Q4 sales were up 22% year-over-year and they were also up 9% sequentially. 
Moving to earnings on the right side of the chart, consistent and significant improvement in earnings as well. Segment operating margins has continued to expand and increased by 2.9 points year-over-year to 18%. Sequentially, operating margin improved by 0.6 point. The year-over-year improvement and operating margin reflects volume leverage, partially offset by mix and increased spending to support growth. I'll cover this in more detail later, but our solutions businesses had a great quarter and that sales mix created a bit of headwind to operating margin in Q4.
The year-over-year incremental margin was about 31%. That's an improvement from Q3 as were reflected in our guidance last quarter. We experienced higher conversion margin in both segments. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 31.6%, another record result.
Moving on to Page 7. This slide summarizes the fourth quarter results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $683 million in the quarter, a year-over-year sales increase of 19%. That included about 5 points of growth due to currency translation. Sequentially, sales increased by 2%. Operating margin in this segment for the quarter was 26%, that's up 3.7 points compared to Q4 last year. So a very good quarter in all respects for Architecture & Software. 
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. CP&S sales in Q4 were $971 million, a very strong year-over-year increase of 24%. About 4.5 points of the increase was due to currency translation and about 1.5 points from acquisitions. I mentioned earlier the strong sales results in our solutions businesses. We had extraordinary execution in these businesses for the quarter. Sales in our solutions and services businesses increased by 27% year-over-year while sales for the product portion of Control Products & Solutions increased 21%.
We normally experience significant growth in the Control Products & Solutions segment from Q3 to Q4, but this year was particularly strong with 15% sequential growth. Moving to the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings increased 57% year-over-year, and we saw significant operating margin expansion year-over-year and sequentially. 
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which displays the year-over-year growth excluding currency effects, just a great growth across all regions. The strongest growth was in the Americas. The U.S. and Canada had a really strong end to the year. Latin America grew 23% year-over-year, and we were pleased to see another very solid quarter from EMEA and Asia-Pacific, with growth in the mid-teens. As Keith mentioned, emerging market growth rates decelerated a bit this quarter on a year-over-year basis but still healthy in the high-teens excluding currency, and that result is consistent with the expectations we've discussed on the third quarter earnings call.
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $137 million, and that represents conversion on net income of 68%. The free cash flow result includes the impact of $150 million pretax contribution in September to our U.S. pension trust. Excluding the after-tax effect of that contribution, conversion on net income would have been 130%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $562 million. That represents conversion on net income of 81%. If you exclude the discretionary pension contribution, conversion for the full year would have been 96%, pretty close to our 100% target.
We also made an additional discretionary pension contribution of $300 million in October. The contributions in September and October were in response to continued declines in the pension discount rate and a consequent increase in the underfunded status of our pension plans. With these contributions, we feel the plans are appropriately funded. Obviously, future required contributions will depend on future discount rates and asset performance, along with some other factors. But we expect these contributions to cover any otherwise mandatory U.S. contributions for about the next few years.
So that's the fourth quarter. Let's move to Page 11 for a summary of the full year fiscal '11 results. Keith touched on much of this, so I'll be brief. Sales reached $6 billion for the full year, up 24%, with organic growth of 20%. So fiscal '11 was a second year of a pretty robust recovery on the industrial side of the economy and very good execution across the company. This result puts us above the prior-cycle peak sales.
Segment operating margin for the full year was a little over 17%. We view that as a very good result at this point in our recovery. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $4.79. So on a 24% increase in sales, EPS from continuing operations increased 57%. And we've already covered cash flow, so let's move to Page 12 and discuss the outlook for fiscal '12.
I'll start with some anticipated headwinds and tailwinds. Related to sales performance in fiscal '12, we believe that macroeconomic conditions will be a headwind. Global economic growth is clearly moderating. We expect to see flat to low-single digit GDP growth in the mature markets, and somewhat lower growth than in fiscal year '11 in the emerging markets. Overall, a significantly less favorable growth environment than we experienced last year. In addition to the moderating growth, as Keith discussed, there's considerable uncertainty in the global economic picture, and we think that may cause customers to be cautious in regard to the capital spending plans in fiscal '12. We also expect currency to be a modest headwind to sales in fiscal '12. 
On the tailwind side for sales, we have the benefit of a solid baseline as reflected in our run rates from the second half of fiscal year '11. For currency -- or I'm sorry, for earnings, currency will be a headwind. We also have a headwind to earnings and the carryover impact of fiscal year '11 spending increases, and we plan some continued investment in fiscal '12 as we continue to see top line improvement.
We also expect a significant earnings headwinds due to a higher effective tax rate. For the full year fiscal year '11, our effective tax rate was 19.7%. For fiscal '12, we expect an effective rate of about 24%. We benefited from some significant discrete items in fiscal year '11. Our underlying effective rate in fiscal '11 was more like 22% to 23%. Earnings tailwinds include higher sales volume and a reset of incentive compensation. Given our financial performance in fiscal '11, last year was an above average year for incentive compensation. We expect to be back to more typical levels in fiscal '12. As I've mentioned previously, our incentive compensation is very broad based and covers virtually all of our employees. Finally, we're expecting an earnings per share tailwind from lower share count.
So turning now to Page 13, this slide summarizes our fiscal '12 guidance. Our sales outlook is a range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that represents a year-over-year increase of between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce sales by about one point in fiscal '12. We're assuming that currency rates for the year will be about equal to the rates we experienced in October. As one benchmark in that regard, the guidance assumes a euro of $1.37. We expect segment operating margin to be about 18%. Based on these planning assumptions, we're projecting diluted EPS of between $5.05 and $5.45. I've addressed the effective tax rate expectation, and although it's not displayed here, we expect general corporate net spending of about $86 million. That's about $5 million higher than in fiscal year '11, and the increase is primarily because we had a $4 million gain on the sale of an asset in fiscal year '11.
Finally, we expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% on net income. That includes the effect of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in October. Excluding the after-tax effect of that contribution, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.
And with that, I'll turn this back to Rondi and we can begin the Q&A session."

And so we normally expect, I'll just say some discount from what would be in the plan. And this quarter was one of those that is just unique about the fact that everything cleared. And so not only didn't we have the discount, but we have the over performance that went away, and I think it's just an example of the variability that happens, certainly, in our solutions business. And I think there's good and bad news here. The good news is it was a great quarter. And certainly, we also had a very strong quarter of orders. So the book to bill was just under one. And normally in our fourth quarter, it's a lower number because we always outperform shipments versus orders. But we had very strong orders months, so we're pleased with that in addition to the great sales. The bad news part of it is, we probably created a gap in Q1 because of that strong shipment that normally would have flowed into Q1. We now have that as a gap, but we don't see any problem in the full year because of the strong orders. But we aren't going to probably be able to fill that gap completely in Q1. So a lot of positives there, but certainly, we'll create a short-term gap. But no specific industry, no specific geography, just very, very good execution by our entire team on a projects business that is inherently lumpy and uneven."

What we are getting a question about is as they are planning for 2012, and how are they going to set their capital spending for the new year? They're becoming a little more cautious in what they're seeing in the environment. And therefore, as you so know, uncertainty is not the friend of investment. And certainly, one can say at a minimum we've had some uncertainty and at a maximum, it's been quite chaotic in the evolution of the macroeconomic environment.

Certainly, at a minimum, there's a divide between North and South Europe. And South Europe, for the last half of the year, was performing weaker than the North. And when I say the North, I mean Germany, the Scandinavian countries in particular. So we are seeing a difference within, I'll just say, Western Europe. And the outlook there is, certainly, are slowing in particular. We know that European OEM machine makers will have a slower growth than they did in 2011. Some of the industry organizations have forecast that indicate there'll be a slowing from very high levels to, I'll say, a lower growth rate, but still growth. And we certainly know, talking to our OEMs, that while they are running at very high levels and they're certainly coming up to their capacity heads, they feel good about the next quarter. But I think as we roll into calendar 2012, they have less visibility. And as I said, those industry statistics indicate that it will be slowing. Some people say Europe's going to be in a recession. I think we're certainly on the edge. If you look at some of the recent PMI information, some of the industrial production, it's certainly slowing. And how they work their way through the debt crisis I think will tell us which side of 0 do they fall on. And at this point, I think it's just a tough call. We like our position in Europe. We think we have growing share there this past year as evidenced by the very strong growth we had year-over-year. Obviously, it's not our most -- it's not the best position given our strongest global competitor, that is their home country. But we like our position. We like our differentiation with our integrated architecture and our intelligent motor control. And as we are growing our solutions and services capabilities, these are all opportunities for us to grow share in an area where we are definitely not the leaders. So we like our position. We like our differentiation. And as I mentioned earlier, that team there is functioning really well, executing the priorities and winning in the areas that we've targeted for growth."

But next year, we expect China to grow in the mid- to high-teens, which we think has continued very grew good growth given the growth we've had the last couple of years, and that is a continued outlook of good opportunities in both the OEM sector, as well as the consumer industries continue to grow in China. That will be helpful. I would say that we had good orders growth in Q4. And once again, from our perspective, I would say it appears at this point in time anyway that China will have managed with a soft landing through another one of the bubbles that seemed to always, not always, but have come about over the last couple of years. So we have a positive outlook for China at this point in time, and we expect to continue to not just grow but to take share, particularly as some of our newer products are introduced over the next fiscal year."

And we do know that there is a large percentage, a large dollar amount, tens of billions that is basically legacy and old process systems that are at end of life. And that is one of the areas that we have targeted for our process growth, simply because a lot of those systems are no longer replaceable, if you will. There's not a migration because they are old systems that are no longer supported. And we see that as the opportunity for us to be able to demonstrate the value of plant-wide optimization. And in particular, after 20 to 30 years, where DCS systems were the only way to solve and to support that customer, today, a Logix Control architecture is very compatible with the application and the functionality requirements. So once again, it demonstrates the value of plant-wide optimization and customers are making those choices. Process in the fourth quarter, for us, was the highest growth for the year. It grew at 25%, and we believe that process in fiscal '12 will grow above the company average and in the teens. So we see process as a continued opportunity for us to grow share. I mean, we aren't the market share that leader there, so I don't want people to get the wrong impression. We're probably fifth, fourth, fifth, depending on how you define the market. But I would say, we're continuing to be able to grow share and we would expect that to continue as the evolution of PlantPAx, and we get a little more traction with the recent release of 2.0 and then certainly, as we continue to grow our expertise in that different applications.

But if you read -- most of the studies and statistics now say that the age of the fleet is at its highest level, I'm not sure if ever, but certainly recently, it's at the highest level. Which means basically that the automotive companies are expecting a tailwind from the replacement cycle. And I think that bodes well if we can see the amount of units being sold continue to grow a little bit year-after-year, I think that will give them the confidence and the dollars to continue to reinvest. So I think it really boils down to the success in the market and the ability to bring the consumer back into the game. And obviously, what we've been talking about now for at least the last year is that, while this has been a manufacturing-led recovery, the consumer is still struggling, whether it's high unemployment, consumer confidence, the continued reducing their debt burden, deleveraging. All of that is somewhat of a phenomenon, but we do believe the opportunities for continued growth in automotive investment bodes well certainly for the short term. And as I said longer term, it really boils down to success in the marketplace that each one of the companies have."

So I would say we've continued to see reasonable growth in the food and beverage sector. We do see some of the shifting in spending in consumer to some of the growth markets. Certainly, the emerging markets is where that is I think best seen in our business at this point in time as they follow where consumer spending and the growth of disposable income is growing most rapidly. And we'd also see that the home and personal care products also continue to see, for us anyways and for the industry, solid growth. Life sciences I think continues to struggle a little as the companies continue to deal with some of the change in the industry and the impact that has on their P&Ls and balance sheets. But we have seen expansion in some of the emerging markets in the life sciences sector, and we would expect that to continue as well. So our outlook next year is that it'll be a growth, but it will probably be growth below the company average."

The fourth quarter capped to be a year of outstanding sales and earnings performance. All regions performed extremely well. In the emerging markets, year-over-year growth rates moderated as we anticipated and discussed on the last earnings call, but sequential growth was solid at 14%. Great execution in our solutions businesses resulted in a very strong quarter for the Control Products & Solutions segment. On total company sales growth of 22%, earnings per share grew more than 50% to $1.39. So in every dimension, another excellent quarter.
We have a lot to be proud of in 2011. In the midst of pockets of economic turmoil, social unrest and natural disasters, we hit on all cylinders. For the full year, we had record sales of $6 billion and now have exceeded peak sales from the previous cycle. Logix sales grew 29%, reflecting the success of our plant-wide optimization strategy and continued penetration both in process applications and with OEM customers. Emerging markets grew over 30%, reaching 22% of total sales despite strong sales growth in the U.S. and Europe.
Sales growth for the year of 24% is noteworthy. Our earnings per share growth of 57% more than double our sales growth rate is even more impressive. Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to fund organic growth, make 2 acquisitions, significantly increased the dividend for the second consecutive year, repurchase 4 million shares and made $450 million in discretionary U.S. pension contributions in September and October.
The performance this past year is evidence that not only is the strategy right, but our team is executing extremely well. I want to thank our employees for their dedication in making this year possible and our customers and partners for their continued support.
Let me shift gears and talk about the future. Although it is hard to know exactly how this business cycle will play out in the near term, the long-term outlook is bright for the automation market and for Rockwell Automation in particular. There is an ongoing need for automation investment in developed markets to drive productivity and manufacturing flexibility, to address safety and sustainability needs of customers and to replace an aging installed base. 
In emerging markets, the case for automation is even more compelling. There still is a need for infrastructure investment such as metro systems, port facilities and Water Wastewater treatment plants. Oil and gas and mining investment remains healthy and is critical to the economic development of emerging markets. Rising standards of living, including a rapidly growing middle class will increase a need for consumer products manufacturing, and wage inflation is a natural tailwind for automation investment.
The time I spent with customers reinforces my confidence that we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on these trends. Our relentless focus on developing innovative solutions to our customers' business needs enables us to constantly expand the opportunities available to us. 
Let me give you a flavor of the broad range of applications for our technology. Our PlantPAx system used to standardize process control for resin reactors used in paint manufacturing for a customer with 12 plants around the world; a turnkey solution for control and remotely monitoring various bitumen extraction sites spread across northern Canada; a complete solution, including design, engineering, commissioning, validation and product trials for a manufacturer of baby milk in China; an integrated process in power control system for high altitude mining in the Andes; and converting a European tire machine builder to a common platform for motion, safety and control.
Our customers look to us for our innovative designs, deep domain expertise and thought leadership. We are committed to supporting our customers from the idea stage through the total life cycle of their automation investment. I have never seen better alignment across our global organization around our strategic priorities. We care about how customers judge our performance just as we care about how investors judge our performance. We are confident that when we satisfy our customers, our shareowners benefit.
So let me give you our thoughts on fiscal 2012. The global economic picture is pretty cloudy these days. In mature markets, the outlook is for low and uneven growth. Some are even predicting a mild recession in Europe. In emerging markets, growth rates are expected to moderate. Customers are spending now, but we are hearing a more cautious tone about their spending outlook. It's possible that customers may adopt a wait-and-see attitude on CapEx in early calendar 2012. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our opportunities. We have demonstrated success in our key growth accelerators and our new product pipeline is as robust as it has ever been. 
With all of that in mind for fiscal 2012, we are projecting sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, growth of 5% to 9%, excluding currency. Based on this sales outlook, we are providing fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.05 to $5.45. We enter fiscal '12 from a position of strength, technology leadership, talented and dedicated employees, expanding opportunities and a strong financial position. We will remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. 
We proved during the downturn in 2009 and the recovery in 2010 that our management team is nimble and knows how to take actions that balance the long-term health of the company with short-term economic realities.
Our strategic priorities remain the same, and we will continue to invest in our best growth opportunities. Before I wrap up, I hear that we are expecting a full house at the Investor Meeting during Automation Fair in Chicago next week. For those of you haven't been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host over 10,000 customers and partners from all over the world, and it's a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among customers.
We will take you on a hosted tour of the show floor and then hold a webcast, where you will learn more about our strategy and how we help our customers, from me, Frank Kulaszewicz, the head of our Architecture & Software segment; Blake Moret, the head of our Control Products & Solutions segment; and John McDermott, the leader of our Global Sales and Marketing team. We are really pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about us, and we look forward to seeing you there.
So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?"

And the effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.2%.
Diluted earnings per share was $1.39, an increase of 53% compared to $0.91 in Q4 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $144.4 million. And in Q4, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $78 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4 million shares at a cost of $299 million.
Turning to Page 6 now, on our Q4 results, Rockwell Automation total. On the left side of this slide, you can see the sales results for the past several quarters. It's been a steady upward trend with a particularly strong sequential increase in Q4. As I noted on a previous slide, in Q4 sales were up 22% year-over-year and they were also up 9% sequentially. 
Moving to earnings on the right side of the chart, consistent and significant improvement in earnings as well. Segment operating margins has continued to expand and increase by 2.9 points year-over-year to 18%. Sequentially, operating margin improved by 6/10 of a point. The year-over-year improvement and operating margin reflects volume leverage, partially offset by mix and increased spending to support growth. I'll cover this in more detail later, but our solutions businesses had a great quarter and that sales mix created a bit of headwind to operating margin in Q4.
The year-over-year incremental margin was about 31%. That's an improvement from Q3 as we reflected in our guidance last quarter. We experienced higher conversion margin in both segments. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 31.6%, another record result.
Moving on to Page 7. This slide summarizes the fourth quarter results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $683 million in the quarter, a year-over-year sales increase of 19%. That included about 5 points of growth due to currency translation. Sequentially, sales increased by 2%. Operating margin in this segment for the quarter was 26%, that's up 3.7 points compared to Q4 last year. So a very good quarter in all respects for Architecture & Software. 
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. CP&S sales in Q4 were $971 million, a very strong year-over-year increase of 24%. About 4.5 points of the increase was due to currency translation and about 1.5 points from acquisitions. I mentioned earlier the strong sales results in our solutions businesses. We had extraordinary execution in these businesses for the quarter. Sales in our solutions and services businesses increased by 27% year-over-year while sales for the product portion of Control Products & Solutions increased 21%.
We normally experience significant growth in the Control Products & Solutions segment from Q3 to Q4, but this year was particularly strong with 15% sequential growth. Moving to the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings increased 57% year-over-year, and we saw significant operating margin expansion year-over-year and sequentially. 
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which displays the year-over-year growth excluding currency effects, just a great growth across all regions. The strongest growth was in the Americas. The U.S. and Canada had a really strong end to the year. Latin America grew 23% year-over-year, and we were pleased to see another very solid quarter from EMEA and Asia-Pacific, with growth in the mid-teens. As Keith mentioned, emerging market growth rates decelerated a bit this quarter on a year-over-year basis but still healthy in the high-teens excluding currency, and that result is consistent with the expectations we've discussed on the third quarter earnings call.
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $137 million, and that represents conversion on net income of 68%. The free cash flow result includes the impact of $150 million pretax contribution in September to our U.S. pension trust. Excluding the after-tax effect of that contribution, conversion on net income would have been 130%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $562 million. That represents conversion on net income of 81%. If you exclude the discretionary pension contribution, conversion for the full year would have been 96%, pretty close to our 100% target.
We also made an additional discretionary pension contribution of $300 million in October. The contributions in September and October were in response to continued declines in the pension discount rate and a consequent increase in the underfunded status of our pension plans. With these contributions, we feel the plans are appropriately funded. Obviously, future required contributions will depend on future discount rates and asset performance, along with some other factors. But we expect these contributions to cover any otherwise mandatory U.S. contributions for about the next few years.
So that's the fourth quarter. Let's move to Page 11 for a summary of the full year fiscal '11 results. Keith touched on much of this, so I'll be brief. Sales reached $6 billion for the full year, up 24%, with organic growth of 20%. So fiscal '11 was a second year of a pretty robust recovery on the industrial side of the economy and very good execution across the company. This result puts us above the prior-cycle peak sales.
Segment operating margin for the full year was a little over 17%. We view that as a very good result at this point in the recovery. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $4.79. So on a 24% increase in sales, EPS from continuing operations increased 57%. And we've already covered cash flow, so let's move to Page 12 and discuss the outlook for fiscal '12.
I'll start with some anticipated headwinds and tailwinds. Related to sales performance in fiscal '12, we believe that macroeconomic conditions will be a headwind. Global economic growth is clearly moderating. We expect to see flat to low-single digit GDP growth in the mature markets, and somewhat lower growth than in fiscal year '11 in the emerging markets. Overall, a significantly less favorable growth environment than we experienced last year. In addition to the moderating growth, as Keith discussed, there's considerable uncertainty in the global economic picture, and we think that may cause customers to be cautious in regard to the capital spending plans in fiscal '12. We also expect currency to be a modest headwind to sales in fiscal '12. 
On the tailwind side for sales, we have the benefit of a solid baseline as reflected in our run rates from the second half of fiscal year '11. For currency -- or I'm sorry, for earnings, currency will be a headwind. We also have a headwind to earnings and the carryover impact of fiscal year '11 spending increases, and we plan some continued investment in fiscal '12 as we continue to see top line improvement.
We also expect a significant earnings headwinds due to a higher effective tax rate. For the full year fiscal year '11, our effective tax rate was 19.7%. For fiscal '12, we expect an effective rate of about 24%. We benefited from some significant discrete items in fiscal year '11. Our underlying effective rate in fiscal '11 was more like 22% to 23%. Earnings tailwinds include higher sales volume and a reset of incentive compensation. Given our financial performance in fiscal '11, last year was an above average year for incentive compensation. We expect to be back to more typical levels in fiscal '12. As I've mentioned previously, our incentive compensation is very broad based and covers virtually all of our employees. Finally, we're expecting an earnings per share tailwind from lower share count.
So turning now to Page 13, this slide summarizes our fiscal '12 guidance. Our sales outlook is a range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that represents a year-over-year increase of between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce sales by about one point in fiscal '12. We're assuming that currency rates for the year will be about equal to the rates we experienced in October. As one benchmark in that regard, the guidance assumes a euro of $1.37. We expect segment operating margin to be about 18%. Based on these planning assumptions, we're projecting diluted EPS of between $5.05 and $5.45. I've addressed the effective tax rate expectation, and although it's not displayed here, we expect general corporate net spending of about $86 million. That's about $5 million higher than in fiscal year '11, and the increase is primarily because we had a $4 million gain on the sale of an asset in fiscal year '11.
Finally, we expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% on net income. That includes the effect of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in October. Excluding the after-tax effect of that contribution, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.
And with that, I'll turn this back to Rondi and we can begin the Q&A session."

And so we normally expect, I'll just say some discount from what would be in the plan. And this quarter was one of those that is just unique about the fact that everything cleared. And so not only didn't we have the discount, but we have the over performance that went away, and I think it's just an example of the variability that happens, certainly, in our solutions business. And I think there's good and bad news here. The good news is it was a great quarter. And certainly, we also had a very strong quarter of orders. So the book to bill was just under one. And normally in our fourth quarter, it's a lower number because we always outperform shipments versus orders. But we had very strong orders months, so we're pleased with that in addition to the great sales. The bad news part of it is, we probably created a gap in Q1 because of that strong shipment that normally would have flowed into Q1. We now have that as a gap, but we don't see any problem in the full year because of the strong orders. But we aren't going to probably be able to fill that gap completely in Q1. So a lot of positives there, but certainly, we'll create a short-term gap. But no specific industry, no specific geography, just very, very good execution by our entire team on a projects business that is inherently lumpy and uneven."

They're becoming a little more cautious in what they're seeing in the environment. And therefore, as you know, uncertainty is not the friend of investment.

Certainly, at a minimum, there's a divide between North and South Europe. And South Europe, for the last half of the year, was performing weaker than the North. And when I say the North, I mean Germany, the Scandinavian countries in particular. So we are seeing a difference within, I'll just say, Western Europe. And the outlook there is, certainly, are slowing in particular. We know that European OEM machine makers will have a slower growth than they did in 2011. Some of the industry organizations have forecast that indicate there'll be a slowing from very high levels to, I'll say, a lower growth rate, but still growth. And we certainly know, talking to our OEMs, that while they are running at very high levels and they're certainly coming up to their capacity heads, they feel good about the next quarter. But I think as we roll into calendar 2012, they have less visibility. And as I said, those industry statistics indicate that it'll be slowing. Some people say Europe's going to be in a recession. I think we're certainly on the edge. If you look at some of the recent PMI information, some of the industrial production, it's certainly slowing. And how they work their way through the debt crisis I think will tell us which side of zero do they fall on. And at this point, I think it's just a tough call. We like our position in Europe. We think we have growing share there this past year as evidenced by the very strong growth we had year-over-year. Obviously, it's not our most -- it's not the best position given our strongest global competitor, that is their home country. But we like our position. We like our differentiation with our integrated architecture and our intelligent motor control. And as we are growing our solutions and services capabilities, these are all opportunities for us to grow share in an area where we are definitely not the leaders. So we like our position.

That will be helpful. I would say that we had good orders growth in Q4. And once again, from our perspective, I would say it appears at this point in time anyway that China will have managed with a soft landing through another one of the bubbles that seemed to always, not always, but have come about over the last couple of years.

We think Toyota, in particular, will grow their capital spending. Obviously, they had some challenges this past year that they had to address just from a recovery from a very significant disaster and the strong yen. And they certainly managed capital spending this next year or last year. And so we expect that to be increased. Also GM, as they continue to come back strong, we expect that they will continue to invest in new platforms. And certainly, Ford and Chrysler. I should say Ford was spending throughout the cycle, so we would expect Ford to be consistent. And Chrysler Fiat is also looking at increasing their cap spending on a year-over-year basis. So right now, we believe that we'll see slightly more automotive spending in our next fiscal year. And certainly, we think that we'll be able to achieve growth in that area given our historical strength and our continued working of that, in particular, in the emerging countries. And you've mentioned a couple of them, Brazil and China are very important in the automotive manufacturing vertical."

And certainly, the vast majority of spending in the emerging markets is for capacity expansion. And I think that's at a first order look, I think that's a fair characterization of how we think about it and how we believe the spending occurred. So just look at our sales in Latin America, in the majority of probably about 70% to 75% of Asia-Pacific, and probably about 20% in EMEA and view that as emerging countries and therefore, capacity expansion."

And we do know that there is a large percentage, a large dollar amount, tens of billions that is basically legacy and old process systems that are at end of life. And that is one of the areas that we have targeted for our process growth, simply because a lot of those systems are no longer replaceable, if you will. There's not a migration because they are old systems that are no longer supported. And we see that as the opportunity for us to be able to demonstrate the value of plant-wide optimization. And in particular, after 20 to 30 years, where DCS systems were the only way to solve and to support that customer, today, a Logix Control architecture is very compatible with the application and the functionality requirements. So once again, it demonstrates the value of plant-wide optimization and customers are making those choices. Process in the fourth quarter, for us, was the highest growth for the year. It grew at 25%, and we believe that process in fiscal '12 will grow above the company average and in the teens. So we see process as a continued opportunity for us to grow share. I mean, we aren't the market share leader there, so I don't want people to get the wrong impression. We're probably fifth, fourth, fifth, depending on how you define the market. But I would say, we're continuing to be able to grow share and we would expect that to continue as the evolution of PlantPAx, and we get a little more traction with the recent release of 2.0 and then certainly, as we continue to grow our expertise in that different applications. So we see process as an ongoing growth opportunity for Rockwell."

But if you read -- most of the studies and statistics now say that the age of the fleet is at its highest level, I'm not sure if ever, but certainly recently, it's at the highest level. Which means basically that the automotive companies are expecting a tailwind from the replacement cycle. And I think that bodes well if we can see the amount of units being sold continue to grow a little bit year-after-year, I think that will give them the confidence and the dollars to continue to reinvest. So I think it really boils down to the success in the market and the ability to bring the consumer back into the game. And obviously, what we've been talking about now for at least the last year is that, while this has been a manufacturing-led recovery, the consumer is still struggling, whether it's high unemployment, consumer confidence, the continued reducing their debt burden, deleveraging. All of that is somewhat of a phenomenon, but we do believe the opportunities for continued growth in automotive investment bodes well certainly for the short term. And as I said longer term, it really boils down to success in the marketplace that each one of the companies have."

Certainly, the emerging markets is where that is I think best seen in our business at this point in time as they follow where consumer spending and the growth of disposable income is growing most rapidly. And we'd also see that the home and personal care products also continue to see, for us anyways and for the industry, solid growth. Life sciences I think continues to struggle a little as the companies continue to deal with some of the change in the industry and the impact that has on their P&Ls and balance sheets. But we have seen expansion in some of the emerging markets in the life sciences sector, and we would expect that to continue as well.
