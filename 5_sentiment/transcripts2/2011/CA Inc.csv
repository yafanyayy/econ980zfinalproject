Thank you for joining us. So let me start with the highlights. CA Technologies delivered another strong quarter thanks to continued focus on execution and a leading portfolio solutions to manage and secure IP infrastructures. 
Year-over-year revenue grew 5% in constant currency, three points of this growth was organic, two points was acquired. This demonstrates our ability to introduce new products, acquire technologies and more importantly, effectively integrate them into our customer offerings. This is driving our growth today and establish in the base for growth in the future. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, reflecting the acquisitions that were closed during fiscal year 2010 and 2011. We reported a non-GAAP tax rate of 32%, the result of continued improvements in tax. Non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in constant currency. 
Cash flow from operations increased 45% in constant currency and keeps us on track to meet full year expectations. And finally, while we saw a modest decline in bookings, current revenue backlog grew 4% in constant currency, a good indicator for me of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth this year and beyond. 
We feel very good about where we are, both from a strategic standpoint and relative to our financial objectives. This gives us the confidence to increase the low end of revenue guidance and both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share ranges, which we provided this afternoon.  Before I turn the call over to Nancy, let me update you on our performance against the strategic priorities I outlined at the beginning of this fiscal year. 
They are: Increasing the number of freestanding sales with the introduction of new products; responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises; and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer requirements and emerging trends. 
On the first priority, freestanding sales. As we said last quarter, freestanding sales give us the opportunity to increase our share of the technology customers wallet through broad cross-selling to current customers and the addition of new customers. Progress can be seen in the 50% constant currency increase in software fees and other revenue. These are sales of application performance management, NetQoS and other perpetually licensed software closed outside a renewal. 
Success can also be seen in new product sales performance. Let me give you a little insight into the business booked during the quarter. 
Year-over-year, total new product sales and capacity grew low-single digits. Distributed new product sales grew low-double digits. Virtualization Management and service automation new sales grew more than 25% year-over-year. We also added more than 40 new logos to this business, of which just under half were completely new to CA Technologies. Customers using this technology includes CBS, South Carolina state, Rio Tinto and Fujitsu Australia. 
In addition, we closed the acquisition of Hyperformix, which provides capacity management planning for virtual, physical and cloud environments. During the quarter, Hyperformix added a number of blue-chip customers such as PG&E and VP. 
Next, Service Assurance new sales growth outpaced the market and we added more than 120 new logos, including 24 competitive replacements. Identity and Access Management sales including newly acquired archive [ph] systems were flat year-over-year. These deals have long sales cycles and tend to be variable quarter-to-quarter. However, the number of transactions closed did increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter with customers like Access Switzerland and Toyota Financial, making purchases, an indicator of the health of this business. 
In Cloud Computing, we continue to extend our technology lead, leveraging dozens of cloud patents and patent applications. We also closed the largest multimillion dollar three-tier AppLogic transaction to date with Scale Matrix. The interim capacity grew low-double digits. Growth in distributed new product sales and mainframe capacity was offset by a year-over-year decline in mainframe new product sales due in part to a challenging year-over-year compare that included a large transaction in Latin America, as well as a decline in new sales of consumer and small and medium business solutions. 
Overall, I am pleased with the progress we are making in new product sales, the indicator that our strategic focus is working. 
Our second priority is to increase our presence and to respond to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises. In the third quarter, I traveled throughout our principle growth geographies including trips to Latin America, India, China, Japan and Southeast Asia, and met with customers, systems integrators and channel partners. 
Our focus on Cloud Computing is resonating as many of these customers and partners are making the move faster than our counterparts in North America and Europe. During the quarter, we were selected by one of Singapore's largest banks to help execute their cloud strategy and we're chosen by Infosys to be a partner for cloud initiatives. 
Our new soft products also have expanded our of lease to reach of these markets and customers. This quarter, the Nimsoft team added more than three dozen new customers, including Mahindra Safion, SOCOM, Rock Force Networks, Melbourne IT and Carpathian Hosting. In addition to Nimsoft, we are building our SaaS capabilities, for example, Clarity PPM on-demand and Service Desk on-demand now have more than 120 on-demand customers and added 17 new logos during the quarter. 
Also, the acquisition of Arcot Systems has brought SaaS-based advanced authentication and fraud prevention solutions to CA Technologies. Arcot currently secures more than 150 million identities and helps prevent fraudulent transactions for about 1 million online credit and debit card transactions each day. 
Our third priority is to further align our business with our customers' needs. Of the many initiatives we have put in place, I would like to highlight two. The first initiative addresses the fast-growing $2 billion communication service provider market. 
This afternoon, we announced the acquisition of Torokina Networks. With the addition of Torokina to our Service Assurance portfolio, CA Technologies now supports specialized network devices for rapidly growing 3G and 4G mobile voice and data environments.  CSPs can look to us to solve their unique performance management needs for both internal IT and network operations requirements. 
The second initiative is focused on building out a robust partner ecosystem. We made excellent progress this quarter with two milestone accomplishments. First, Microsoft and CA Technologies signed an agreement to do joint development in the cloud. And in addition, we agreed to a joint go-to-market framework with shared revenue on a global basis. 
We also were selected by SAP to provide Web Access Management for their customers. We look forward to expanding our global footprint through the added reach of these two powerful partners. 
Now I will turn the call over to Nancy, who will review the financial details of the quarter. Nancy?"

First, please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in the current portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future subscription and maintenance revenue",1258,"Thank you, Bill. First, please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. 
Growth in the current portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future subscription and maintenance revenue growth. Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported, with the current portion growing 4% on a constant currency basis and as reported. Let me give you some insight into the business that contributed to revenue backlog. 
As we frequently say, bookings are not the best indicator of future growth expectations for CA Technologies and this quarter is a good example of why that is the case as we were able to deliver strong results despite a modest decrease in bookings. This was largely the result of a year-over-year decrease in our license and maintenance renewals. As anticipated, the total value of renewals accelerated from the second to the third quarter and we expect to see acceleration into the fourth quarter. We continue to expect the full year renewal portfolio to be down 10% compared to fiscal 2010. 
Given the varied timing of these renewals, we focus on our renewal yield to judge the health of the business. Our renewal yield was just under 90% during the quarter. This does not include the effect of the price increase announced in July. Geographically, sales were up solidly in North America and down internationally, where Europe remains a work-in-process.  As we said, we have made leadership changes across the region and are introducing disciplines designed to accelerate new product sales in Europe. We are making progress, but it will take several quarters before the operation is where we wanted. 
Overall, our performance is where we need to be to sustain growth and year-to-date results give us the confidence to increase the low end of revenue guidance for the full year. 
Moving to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.17 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 4% as reported. This includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $8 million. 
In constant currency, revenue growth in North America of 7% was partially offset by international performance where revenue grew 1%.  Within our International segment, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Japan delivered solid performance offset by Europe. 
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $995 million, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $82 million, up 50% in constant currency and up 52% as reported. This was driven by performance in our Service Assurance business, particularly NetQoS and CA Infrastructure Management, our new suite integrating eHealth with NetQoS. 
Revenue from Professional Services was $88 million, up 23% in constant currency and 21% as reported. Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. 
Operating expenses were $774 million, up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% as reported. This increase in expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010 and 2011, which have accelerated revenue growth this year and are laying the foundation for the future.  Operating income before interest and taxes was $391 million, up 1% on a constant currency basis and down 1% as reported. 
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, a decrease of one percentage point year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, up 11% in constant currency and as reported, including a negative $0.01 headwind from currency. This EPS growth was partially driven by improvements in our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter which was 32%. This is one percentage point better than the low end of our guidance range. 
This afternoon, we updated our full year tax rate guidance for both GAAP and non-GAAP, which is a reflection of our continuing work on taxes to deliver a tax rate more closely aligned with industry norms. 
Turning to GAAP results. GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income was $338 million, flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. While earnings per diluted common share was $0.39, down 17% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate was 39%, due to a number of discrete adverse tax items arising in the quarter, which are not expected to recur. This GAAP tax rate represents an unfavorable year-over-year compare to the third quarter of the previous year when the GAAP tax rate was 22% as a result of favorable discrete items. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $496 million, up 45% in constant currency and as reported, compared to $342 million in the prior-year period. This growth reflects both a year-over-year increase of $78 million and upfront cash collections from single installment payments to $152 million and an increase in collections on trade receivables of $122 million.  Total billings backlog of $4.7 billion was up 1% in constant currency and as reported. 
Looking at our balance sheet. CA Technologies ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to $1.1 billion. During the third fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of stock for a total of $35 million. This leaves approximately $330 million in approved repurchases and remaining approval, and we continue to be in the market. 
With that, I'd like to update guidance for fiscal year 2011. We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company. As a reminder, it has been our practice to provide guidance based upon exchange rates on the last date of the previous quarter, in this case, December 31, and guidance includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Guidance is as follows: For revenue, an increase in the low end of the range. Revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 4% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.48 billion to $4.55 billion. We have revised our non-GAAP operating margin, which is now expected to be 34%. This reflects the impact of acquisitions closed during the quarter. 
In addition, we also expect seasonal fourth quarter expenses associated with commissions. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 32% and 33%. This is the next step to delivering on our long-term tax rate guidance of 30% to 32%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ranges were increased this afternoon. 
Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 10% to 15% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.98. Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 8% to 14% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.67. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisition. 
For the full year, we expect approximately 504 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 508 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases. 
Now with that, I will turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?"

Virtualization and Cloud Computing are top of mind. Customers understand that management and security are vital if they are to implement the technology roadmaps required to drive their businesses.

Thank you for joining us. So let me start with the highlights. CA Technologies delivered another strong quarter, thanks to continued focus on execution and a leading portfolio solutions to manage and secure IT infrastructures. 
Year-over-year, revenue grew 5% in constant currency. Three points of this growth was organic, two points was acquired. This demonstrates our ability to introduce new products, acquire technologies and more importantly, effectively integrate them into our customer offerings. This is driving our growth today and establishing the base for growth in the future. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, reflecting the effect of acquisitions that were closed during fiscal year 2010 and 2011. We reported a non-GAAP tax rate of 32%, the result of continued improvements in tax. Non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in constant currency. 
Cash flow from operations increased 45% in constant currency and keeps us on track to meet full year expectations. And finally, while we saw a modest decline in bookings, current revenue backlog grew 4% in constant currency, a good indicator for me of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth, this year and beyond. 
We feel very good about where we are, both from a strategic standpoint and relative to our financial objectives. This gives us the confidence to increase the low end of revenue guidance and both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share ranges, which we provided this afternoon. 
Before I turn the call over to Nancy, let me update you on our performance against the strategic priorities I outlined at the beginning of this fiscal year. They are: increasing the number of freestanding sales with the introduction of new products; responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises; and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer requirements and emerging trends. 
On the first priority, freestanding sales. As we said last quarter, freestanding sales give us the opportunity to increase our share of the technology customer's wallet, through both cross-selling to current customers and the addition of new customers. Progress can be seen in the 50% constant currency increase, in software fees and other revenue. These are sales of application performance management, NetQoS and other perpetually licensed software closed outside a renewal. Success can also be seen in new product sales performance. Let me give you a little insight into the business booked during the quarter. 
Year-over-year, total new product sales and capacity grew low single digits. Distributed new product sales grew low double digits. Virtualization management and service automation new sales grew more than 25% year-over-year. We also added more than 40 new logos to this business, of which just under half were completely new to CA Technologies. Customers using this technology include CBS, South Carolina State, Rio Tinto and Fujitsu Australia. 
In addition, we closed the acquisition of Hyperformix, which provides capacity management planning for virtual, physical and cloud environments. During the quarter, Hyperformix added a number of blue-chip customers such as PG&E and BP. 
Next, Service Assurance new sales growth outpaced the market, and we added more than 120 new logos, including 24 competitive replacements. Identity and Access Management sales, including newly acquired Arcot Systems, were flat year-over-year. These deals have long sales cycles and tend to be variable quarter-to-quarter. However, the number of transactions closed did increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter, with customers like AXA Switzerland and Toyota Financial, making purchases, an indicator of the health of this business. 
In Cloud Computing, we continue to extend our technology lead, leveraging dozens of cloud patents and patent applications. We also closed the largest multi-million dollar 3Tera AppLogic transaction to date with ScaleMatrix. Mainframe capacity grew low double digits. Growth in distributed new product sales and mainframe capacity was offset by a year-over-year decline in mainframe new product sales, due in part to a challenging year-over-year compare that included a large transaction in Latin America, as well as a decline in new sales of consumer and small and medium business solutions. 
Overall, I am pleased with the progress we are making in new product sales, the indicator that our strategic focus is working. 
Our second priority is to increase our presence and to respond to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises. In the third quarter, I traveled throughout our principle growth geographies, including trips to Latin America, India, China, Japan and Southeast Asia, and met with customers, systems integrators and channel partners. Our focus on Cloud Computing is resonating, as many of these customers and partners are making the move faster than their counterparts in North America and Europe. During the quarter, we were selected by one of Singapore's largest banks to help execute their cloud strategy and were chosen by Infosys to be a partner for cloud initiatives. 
Our Nimsoft products have also expanded our ability to reach these markets and customers. This quarter, the Nimsoft team added more than three dozen new customers, including Mahindra Satyam, Celcom, RackForce Networks, Melbourne IT and Carpathia Hosting. In addition to Nimsoft, we are building our SaaS capabilities. For example, Clarity PPM On Demand and Service Desk On Demand now have more than 120 on-demand customers and added 17 new logos during the quarter. 
Also, the acquisition of Arcot Systems has brought SaaS-based advanced authentication and fraud prevention solutions to CA Technologies. Arcot currently secures more than 150 million identities and helps prevent fraudulent transactions for about 1 million online credit and debit card transactions each day. 
Our third priority is to further align our business with our customers' needs. Of the many initiatives we have put in place, I would like to highlight two. The first initiative addresses the fast-growing $2 billion Communication Service Provider market. This afternoon, we announced the acquisition of Torokina Networks. With the addition of Torokina to our Service Assurance portfolio, CA Technologies now supports specialized network devices for rapidly growing 3G and 4G mobile voice and data environments. CSPs can look to us to solve their unique performance management needs for both internal IT and network operations requirements. 
The second initiative is focused on building out a robust partner ecosystem. We made excellent progress this quarter with two milestone accomplishments. First, Microsoft and CA Technologies signed an agreement to do joint development in the Cloud. And in addition, we agreed to a joint go-to-market framework with shared revenue on a global basis. We also were selected by SAP to provide Web Access Management for their customers. We look forward to expanding our global footprint through the added reach of these two powerful partners. 
Now I will turn the call over to Nancy, who will review the financial details of the quarter. Nancy?"

First, please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in the current portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future subscription and maintenance revenue growth. Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported, with the current portion growing 4% on a constant currency basis and as reported. 
Let me give you some insight into the business that contributed to revenue backlog. As we frequently say, bookings are not the best indicator of future growth expectations for CA Technologies. And this quarter is a good example of why that is the case, as we were able to deliver strong results despite a modest decrease in bookings. This was largely the result of a year-over-year decrease in our license and maintenance renewals. As anticipated, the total value of renewals accelerated from the second to the third quarter and we expect to see acceleration into the fourth quarter. We continue to expect the full year renewal portfolio to be down 10% compared to fiscal 2010. 
Given the varied timing of these renewals, we focus on our renewal yield to judge the health of the business. Our renewal yield was just under 90% during the quarter. This does not include the effect of the price increase announced in July. 
Geographically, sales were up solidly in North America and down internationally, where Europe remains a work in process. As we said, we have made leadership changes across the region and are introducing disciplines designed to accelerate new product sales in Europe. We are making progress, but it will take several quarters before the operation is where we want it. 
Overall, our performance is where we need to be to sustain growth and year-to-date results give us the confidence to increase the low end of revenue guidance for the full year. 
Moving to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.17 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 4% as reported. This includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $8 million. In constant currency, revenue growth in North America of 7% was partially offset by International performance where revenue grew 1%. Within our International segment, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan delivered solid performance offset by Europe. 
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $995 million, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $82 million, up 50% in constant currency and up 52% as reported. This was driven by performance in our Service Assurance business, particularly NetQoS and CA Infrastructure Management, our new suite integrating eHealth with NetQoS. Revenue from Professional Services was $88 million, up 23% in constant currency and 21% as reported. 
Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $774 million, up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% as reported. This increase in expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010 and 2011, which have accelerated revenue growth this year and are laying the foundation for the future.  Operating income before interest and taxes was $391 million, up 1% on a constant currency basis and down 1% as reported. 
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, a decrease of one percentage point year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, up 11% in constant currency and as reported, including a negative $0.01 headwind from currency. This EPS growth was partially driven by improvements in our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter which was 32%. This is one percentage point better than the low end of our guidance range. 
This afternoon, we updated our full year tax rate guidance for both GAAP and non-GAAP, which is a reflection of our continuing work on taxes to deliver a tax rate more closely aligned with industry norms. 
Turning to GAAP results. GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income was $338 million, flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported. While earnings per diluted common share was $0.39, down 17% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate was 39%, due to a number of discrete adverse tax items arising in the quarter, which are not expected to recur. This GAAP tax rate represents an unfavorable year-over-year compare to the third quarter of the previous year, when the GAAP tax rate was 22% as a result of favorable discrete items. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $496 million, up 45% in constant currency and as reported compared to $342 million in the prior-year period. This growth reflects both a year-over-year increase of $78 million in upfront cash collections from single installment payments to $152 million and an increase in collections on trade receivables of $122 million. Total billings backlog of $4.7 billion was up 1% in constant currency and as reported. 
Looking at our balance sheet. CA Technologies ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to $1.1 billion. During the third fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of stock for a total of $35 million. This leaves approximately $330 million in approved repurchases and remaining approval, and we continue to be in the market. 
With that, I'd like to update guidance for fiscal year 2011. We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company. As a reminder, it has been our practice to provide guidance based upon exchange rates on the last date of the previous quarter, in this case, December 31. And guidance includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Guidance is as follows: for revenue, an increase in the low end of the range. Revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 4% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.48 billion to $4.55 billion. We have revised our non-GAAP operating margin, which is now expected to be 34%. This reflects the impact of acquisitions closed during the quarter. In addition, we also expect seasonal fourth quarter expenses associated with commissions. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 32% and 33%. This is the next step to delivering on our long-term tax rate guidance of 30% to 32%. 
Both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ranges were increased this afternoon. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 10% to 15% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.98. Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 8% to 14% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.67. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisition. 
For the full year, we expect approximately 504 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 508 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases. 
Now with that, I will turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?"

Thank you for joining us. So let me start with the highlights. CA Technologies delivered another strong quarter, thanks to continued focus on execution and our leading portfolio solutions to manage and secure IT infrastructures. 
Year-over-year, revenue grew 5% in constant currency. Three points of this growth was organic.  Two points was acquired. This demonstrates our ability to introduce new products, acquire technologies and, more importantly, effectively integrate them into our customer offerings. This is driving our growth today and establishing a base for growth in the future. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, reflecting the effect of acquisitions that were closed during fiscal year 2010 and 2011. We reported a non-GAAP tax rate of 32%, the result of continued improvements in tax. Non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in constant currency. 
Cash flow from operations increased 45% in constant currency and keeps us on track to meet full year expectations. And finally, while we saw a modest decline in bookings, current revenue backlog grew 4% in constant currency, a good indicator for me of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth this year and beyond. 
We feel very good about where we are, both from a strategic standpoint and relative to our financial objectives. This gives us the confidence to increase the low end of revenue guidance and both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings-per-share ranges, which we provided this afternoon. 
Before I turn the call over to Nancy, let me update you on our performance against the strategic priorities I outlined at the beginning of this fiscal year. They are:  increasing the number of freestanding sales with the introduction of new products, responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer requirements and emerging trends. 
On the first priority, freestanding sales. As we said last quarter, freestanding sales give us the opportunity to increase our share of the technology customer's wallet through both cross-selling to current customers and the addition of new customers. Progress can be seen in the 50% constant-currency increase in software fees and other revenue. These are sales of application performance management, NetQoS and other perpetually licensed software closed outside a renewal. Success can also be seen in new product sales performance. Let me give you a little insight into the business booked during the quarter. 
Year-over-year, total new product sales and capacity grew low single-digits. Distributed new product sales grew low double-digits. Virtualization management and service automation new sales grew more than 25% year-over-year. We also added more than 40 new logos to this business, of which just under half were completely new to CA Technologies. Customers using this technology include CBS, South Carolina State, Rio Tinto and Fujitsu Australia. 
In addition, we closed the acquisition of Hyperformix, which provides capacity management planning for virtual, physical and cloud environments. During the quarter, Hyperformix added a number of blue-chip customers, such as PG&E and BP. 
Next, Service Assurance new sales growth outpaced the market, and we added more than 120 new logos, including 24 competitive replacements. Identity and Access Management sales, including newly acquired Arcot Systems, were flat year-over-year. These deals have long sales cycles and tend to be variable quarter-to-quarter. However, the number of transactions closed did increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter, with customers like AXA Switzerland and Toyota Financial making purchases, an indicator of the health of this business. 
In Cloud Computing, we continue to extend our technology lead, leveraging dozens of cloud patents and patent applications. We also closed the largest multi-million-dollar 3Tera AppLogic transaction to date with ScaleMatrix. Mainframe capacity grew low double-digits. Growth in distributed new product sales and mainframe capacity was offset by a year-over-year decline in mainframe new product sales, due in part to a challenging year-over-year compare that included a large transaction in Latin America as well as a decline in new sales of consumer and small- and medium-business solutions. 
Overall, I am pleased with the progress we are making in new product sales, the indicator that our strategic focus is working. 
Our second priority is to increase our presence and to respond to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises. In the third quarter, I traveled throughout our principal growth geographies, including trips to Latin America, India, China, Japan and Southeast Asia, and met with customers, systems integrators and channel partners. Our focus on Cloud Computing is resonating, as many of these customers and partners are making the move faster than their counterparts in North America and Europe. During the quarter, we were selected by one of Singapore's largest banks to help execute their cloud strategy and were chosen by Infosys to be a partner for cloud initiatives. 
Our Nimsoft products have also expanded our ability to reach these markets and customers. This quarter, the Nimsoft team added more than three dozen new customers, including Mahindra Satyam, Celcom, RackForce Networks, Melbourne IT and Carpathia Hosting. In addition to Nimsoft, we are building our SaaS capabilities. For example, Clarity PPM On Demand and Service Desk On Demand now have more than 120 on-demand customers and added 17 new logos during the quarter. 
Also, the acquisition of Arcot Systems has brought SaaS-based advanced authentication and fraud prevention solutions to CA Technologies. Arcot currently secures more than 150 million identities and helps prevent fraudulent transactions for about 1 million online credit and debit card transactions each day. 
Our third priority is to further align our business with our customers' needs. Of the many initiatives we have put in place, I would like to highlight two. The first initiative addresses the fast-growing $2 billion communications service provider market. This afternoon, we announced the acquisition of Torokina Networks. With the addition of Torokina to our Service Assurance portfolio, CA Technology now supports specialized network devices for rapidly growing 3G and 4G mobile voice and data environments. CSPs can look to us to solve their unique performance management needs for both internal IT and network operations requirements. 
The second initiative is focused on building out a robust partner ecosystem. We made excellent progress this quarter with two milestone accomplishments. First, Microsoft and CA Technologies signed an agreement to do joint development in the Cloud. And in addition, we agreed to a joint go-to-market framework with shared revenue on a global basis. We also were selected by SAP to provide Web Access Management for their customers. We look forward to expanding our global footprint through the added reach of these two powerful partners. 
Now I will turn the call over to Nancy, who will review the financial details of the quarter. Nancy?"
262913,117863222,95291,"CA Technologies, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. First, please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in the current portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future subscription and maintenance revenue gr",1258,"Thank you, Bill. First, please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in the current portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future subscription and maintenance revenue growth. Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and 1% as reported, with the current portion growing 4% on a constant-currency basis and as reported. 
Let me give you some insight into the business that contributed to revenue backlog. As we frequently say, bookings are not the best indicator of future growth expectations for CA Technologies. And this quarter is a good example of why that is the case, as we were able to deliver strong results despite a modest decrease in bookings. This was largely the result of a year-over-year decrease in our license and maintenance renewals. As anticipated, the total value of renewals accelerated from the second to the third quarter, and we expect to see acceleration into the fourth quarter. We continue to expect the full year renewal portfolio to be down 10% compared to fiscal 2010. 
Given the varied timing of these renewals, we focus on our renewal yield to judge the health of the business. Our renewal yield was just under 90% during the quarter. This does not include the effect of the price increase announced in July. 
Geographically, sales were up solidly in North America and down internationally, where Europe remains a work in process. As we said, we have made leadership changes across the region and are introducing disciplines designed to accelerate new product sales in Europe. We are making progress, but it will take several quarters before the operation is where we want it. 
Overall, our performance is where we need to be to sustain growth, and year-to-date results give us the confidence to increase the low end of revenue guidance for the full year. 
Moving to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.17 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 4% as reported. This includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $8 million. In constant currency, revenue growth in North America of 7% was partially offset by International performance, where revenue grew 1%. Within our International segment, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan delivered solid performance offset by Europe. 
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $995 million, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $82 million, up 50% in constant currency and up 52% as reported. This was driven by performance in our Service Assurance business, particularly NetQoS and CA Infrastructure Management, our new suite integrating eHealth with NetQoS. Revenue from Professional Services was $88 million, up 23% in constant currency and 21% as reported. 
Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $774 million, up 7% on a constant-currency basis and 6% as reported. This increase in expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010 and 2011, which have accelerated revenue growth this year and are laying the foundation for the future.  Operating income before interest and taxes was $391 million, up 1% on a constant-currency basis and down 1% as reported. 
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, a decrease of one percentage point year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, up 11% in constant currency and as reported, including a negative $0.01 headwind from currency. This EPS growth was partially driven by improvements in our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter, which was 32%. This is one percentage point better than the low end of our guidance range. 
This afternoon, we updated our full year tax rate guidance for both GAAP and non-GAAP, which is a reflection of our continuing work on taxes to deliver a tax rate more closely aligned with industry norms. 
Turning to GAAP results. GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income was $338 million, flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported, while earnings per diluted common share was $0.39, down 17% in constant currency and 20% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate was 39%, due to a number of discrete adverse tax items arising in the quarter which are not expected to recur. This GAAP tax rate represents an unfavorable year-over-year compare to the third quarter of the previous year, when the GAAP tax rate was 22% as a result of favorable discrete items. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $496 million, up 45% in constant currency and as reported compared to $342 million in the prior-year period. This growth reflects both a year-over-year increase of $78 million in upfront cash collections from single installment payments to $152 million and an increase in collections on trade receivables of $122 million. Total billings backlog of $4.7 billion was up 1% in constant currency and as reported. 
Looking at our balance sheet. CA Technologies ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to $1.1 billion. During the third fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of stock for a total of $35 million. This leaves approximately $330 million in approved repurchases and remaining approval, and we continue to be in the market. 
With that, I'd like to update guidance for fiscal year 2011. We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant-currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company. As a reminder, it has been our practice to provide guidance based upon exchange rates on the last date of the previous quarter; in this case, December 31. And guidance includes a partial hedge of operating income. 
Guidance is as follows: for revenue, an increase in the low end of the range. Revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 4% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.48 billion to $4.55 billion. We have revised our non-GAAP operating margin, which is now expected to be 34%. This reflects the impact of acquisitions closed during the quarter. In addition, we also expect seasonal fourth quarter expenses associated with commissions. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 32% and 33%. This is the next step to delivering on our long-term tax rate guidance of 30% to 32%. 
Both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ranges were increased this afternoon. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 10% to 15% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.98. Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 8% to 14% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.67. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475 billion. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisition. 
For the full year, we expect approximately 504 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 508 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases. 
Now with that, I will turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?"

As I said at the beginning of the call, I am encouraged by our execution capability and third quarter performance. Customers and industry analysts agree that the market is moving very quickly and to where we thought it would when we adopted our strategy. 
Virtualization and Cloud Computing are top of mind. Customers understand that management and security are vital, if they are to implement the technology roadmaps required to drive their businesses. 
From my vantage point, I see the rate and pace of this market moving faster than anyone anticipated, and I believe it will be much bigger than anyone is predicting. This is good for CA Technologies. We know what to do. We know how to do it. And we are focused on a strong finish to this fiscal year.

Those are the investments we're making this year.  We're beginning to see payback on those now, but the real benefit, we think, comes in fiscal year '12 and beyond. So it's really just lining up for us, and we're feeling very good that all that we're talking about here and have this year is going the right direction, is going to take us where we said we were going to go."

Before we begin, and as you may have read in the press release this afternoon, Nancy Cooper is retiring. I expect to announce here replacement very soon, and she has agreed to stay in her role until I have announced her replacement. On behalf of the CA Technologies team, I thank Nancy for her continued service and her contributions.
And now, let me review our results and outlook. As we said at the beginning of the year, fiscal year 2011 was both a growth and investment year. These investments have driven strength and improvements in many areas. We set out to accomplish a great deal this year, and we did what we set out to do. We also had some challenges in some products and in EMEA. We are addressing them head-on, and are still making good overall progress as a company. And the guidance we are providing this afternoon shows that we expect fiscal year 2012 to be even stronger than 2011. 
Our strategy is the right one, and is working. That is focusing on mainframe distributed cloud and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Our vendor-agnostic approach is what customers tell me they need and are buying. No one else can claim the breadth of our solutions. We are investing in geographic expansion and in new account solution through business partners. Both are gaining traction. In fact, just last week, we announced a strategic initiative with the BCE, the virtual computing environment company. In addition, CA Technologies was named by HP as a strategic Alliance One partner. Our two companies will work together on expanding moves to market and joint development projects. More details will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Last week, we also hosted more than 130 executives from 98 partner organizations worldwide at our Partner Summit in New York City. From what I'm hearing from our partners is they see a new level of commitment and focus on our mutual success. We have effectively integrated our acquisitions, and we are now investing in them to accelerate growth. 
For example, during the fourth quarter, we invested an incremental $14 million or $0.02 of earnings per share. This included almost doubling the number of employees at Nimsoft and integrating new technologies. We combined Intech's service desk with Nimsoft offering, which has created the integrated IP management as a service solution called Nimsoft Unified Manager. We are also of rationalizing our business, including this afternoon's announcement that we have reached an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business to Updata Partners. These actions further focus our resources on areas of strategic importance to CA Technologies.
In addition, our focus on improving our management systems have given us ability to address business opportunities more quickly than even a year ago. These improved execution ability translated into financial results in fiscal year 2011.
Let me summarize our full year results from continuing operations. All of which are within our guidance ranges. Revenue was $4.4 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Approximately half of this revenue growth was organic. We held full gear non-GAAP operating margins that, while we made significant investments in the business especially in the last quarter.
We grew our non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.92, up 13% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Fiscal year 2011 cash flow benefited from lower year-over-year cash taxes, offset by investments related to our acquisitions. 
Finally, total revenue backlog reached a record $8.8 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Our current revenue backlog grew 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported.
We believe, as stated on here, that current revenue backlog is a positive indicator of our future revenue growth and lays a foundation for fiscal 2012. In fact, our outlook for fiscal 2012 shows even greater revenue growth than last year.
We expect revenue to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. We are committed to holding non-GAAP operating margins at 34%, while investing more in emerging enterprises and markets this year than in last. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 6% to 10% in constant currency. Cash flow is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency, reflecting investments in emerging enterprises and markets.
In addition, our board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase, bringing the total available for repurchase to approximately $700 million. We have also announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. And finally, we are in the process of reorganizing our internal management reporting, and we'll change our segment disclosure in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
This will provide better visibility to our business and the progress we are making against our strategy. From a full year new product perspective, total new product sales and mainframe capacity increased in the low single digits. I am confident we can do better. Within this, however, we grew our distributor new product portfolio more than 15% year-over-year. This was led by double-digit growth in new product sales of Service Assurance including Nimsoft, virtualization and service automation and service portfolio management. While Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, grew high single digits. These are the areas of our strategic focus for our company. These growth in distributed new products this was offset by mainframe new product and capacity sales, which were down approximately 25%.
Mainframe performance is linked to the size and customer mix in our renewal portfolio, which fluctuates quarter-to-quarter and a year-to-year. As you know, our renewals were back-end loaded in fiscal 2011. And in the fourth quarter, capacity grew 50% year-over-year, the highest amount in 15 quarters. We are also beginning to see success with our new competitive replacement program, which launched in the second quarter closing over 15 replacement in the last nine months of the year.
In fiscal year 2012, we are continuing to focus on delivering innovation, strengthening our sales coverage model and making it even easier for customers to move to our full portfolio of solutions.
This afternoon, we are pleased to announce the addition of Peter Griffiths, who will be joining us at the end of May to lead our Technology and Development Group. Peter brings extensive software development and business management expertise from his roles at IBM, Cognos and relational matters. Peter will drive initiatives to enhance our product positioning and thought leadership in the technology community.
From a geographic perspective, full year North American revenue grew 7% year-over-year in constant currency, while EMEA's growth is not as strong as we would like. We knew that a turnaround in this region is going to be slow, but it's growing slower than I expected. And I am not satisfied with that.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are investing in EMEA, changing to go-to-market model and building new channel relationships. These are long-term initiatives, and will take quarters, not months. I'm convinced, we have the right personnel in place and is focused on the right priorities, accelerating new product sales and accessing new accounts.
On the positive side, our fourth quarter renewal year within EMEA was in line with other regions. However, the renewal portfolio was much lighter in fiscal '11 than the previous year, and will be again next year. And we did not leverage newly acquired technology there successfully as we did in other regions. As I've said, we met the companywide growth targets we indicated at the beginning of the year in spite of the weakness in EMEA. And I am confident that the changes that we made last year was the right ones, and that they will work.
And now, let me turn the call over to Nancy to provide more detail."
262913,129806608,128107,"CA Technologies, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 12, 2011",2011-05-12,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a t",1369,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a table is available at investor.ca.com for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009. The incremental adjustments for the Internet Security Business full year fiscal 2011 are the following: Revenue was reduced by $83 million, operating income decreased by $15 million, earnings per share decreased by $0.02, and cash flow decreased by $4 million.
For the fourth quarter, revenue was reduced by $18 million, operating income decreased by $1 million and earnings per share and cash flow effects were not material. Selling our Internet Security Business is the right thing to do to align our portfolio to our strategy. And we will continue to look for opportunities to rationalize and focus our resources.
Now let us turn to the fourth quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated, and all results are from continuing operations. During the quarter, we closed a five-year renewal deal for approximately $500 million, with a large global IT outsourcer. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew low double digits. Fourth quarter underperformance in EMEA and softness in Japan were offset by growth in each of our other regions. 
Distributed new product sales grew mid-single digits. Driving this, Service Assurance including Nimsoft grew low double digits. Virtualization and service automation sales grew mid-double digits. Service portfolio management grew midteens, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot sales were flat. Mainframe capacity grew 50%, driven in part by two large public sector transactions.
As always, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio fluctuates. While we do expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow steady tailwind, as we cycle through these renewals, we experienced a double-digit decline in mainframe new product sales, which Bill discussed. Excluding the large global IT outsourcer deal we closed in the fourth quarter, renewals were down approximately 15%, more than the 10% we had anticipated at the outset of fiscal 2011. This was primarily due to timing, including a large transaction of over $100 million, which we chose to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Given that we closed the large global IT outsourcer renewal in fiscal year 2011, we currently expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year, and down approximately 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. However, we do not focus on the year-over-year comparisons of bookings, as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We managed the aggregate renewal portfolio to optimize the renewal yield, which was in the low 90% range this quarter.
Even with the expected decrease in renewals, we are confident that this is the portfolio we need to achieve our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We do focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. With our highly ratable model, this is another reason we are confident in our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 4% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $12 million. In constant currency, revenue grew 5% in North America, while international revenue grew 2%. Subscription and maintenance revenue was $970 million, up 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $82 million, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $76 million, up 30% in constant currency and 29% as reported.
Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Please note that our fiscal year 2010 fourth quarter included $50 million in nonrecurring restructuring expense. Non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $356 million, up 28% in constant currency and 26% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32% compared to 26% in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 33% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a $0.01 headwind from currency.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 29% compared to 28% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year. We continue to refine our tax structure, and are pleased with the progress we are making.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which were $634 million, up 1% in constant currency and the flat as reported. Cash flow was positively affected by a decrease of approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $176 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total billings backlog of $5.2 billion was up 11% in constant currency and 14% as reported. DSOs were down year-over-year.
Turning to both fourth quarter and full year GAAP results. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP operating income was $299 million, up 29% in constant currency and 29% as reported. And the GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.37, up 90% in constant currency and 95% as reported.
Full year GAAP operating margin was 28%. Full year GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. While full year GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $1.60, up 12% in constant currency and 10% as reported.
Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 35% compared to 54% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to over $1.6 billion. During the fourth fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of stock for a total of $48 million. Between April 1 and May 6, we accelerated our program, purchasing an incremental 3 million shares of stock for a total of $68 million.
Turning to guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based upon March 31 exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. I would like to highlight that the large global IT outsourcer deal we signed in the fourth quarter renewed the last of our own business model contract. As a result, we will report incremental revenue from the newly signed contracts, but not incremental cash flow as well look at 2012.
Guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range from 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.12 to $2.19. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 11%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. Underlying his guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year, a flat to 1 point improvement over fiscal year 2011.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 492 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 499 million shares.
Finally, we are committed to holding our non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, which is the combination of improving margins in our core businesses, while continuing to make significant investments in our emerging enterprise and emerging market businesses.
With that, I will to the call back over to Bill."

Some of the Mainframe Software Manager our first goal of course, we are encouraged by our competitiveness in the marketplace. As Bill commented, our new product sales around the mainframe was impacted by the renewal portfolio, which was lower in FY '11. And with that said, we saw strong capacity, which I think is encouraging. From what you're seeing, we saw some large transactions during the year. And importantly, we're starting to see momentum in our competitive win back program. We had 15 competitive replacements that went; in and replaced our competitors across the board with our mainframe technology. So I would tell you that we are confident in our competitive position in mainframe. We have pricing as we look in FY '12."

We are encouraged since fiscal year '11, we were able to defer taxes, which is always a good thing. On the fiscal year '12, we'll have a little bit more cash taxes.

A lot of it is driven by the available renewal platform, the renewal portfolio. And we continue to be competitive in that space. We expect that we will grow at or above the market in FY '12."

Before we begin, and as you may have read in the press release this afternoon, Nancy Cooper is retiring. I expect to announce her replacement very soon and she has agreed to stay in her role until I have announced her replacement. On behalf of the CA Technologies team, I thank Nancy for her continued service and her contributions.
And now, let me review our results and outlook. As we said at the beginning of the year, fiscal year 2011 was both a growth and investment year. These investments have driven strength and improvements in many areas. We set out to accomplish a great deal this year, and we did what we set out to do. We also had some challenges in some products and in EMEA. We are addressing them head-on, and are still making good overall progress as a company. And the guidance we are providing this afternoon shows that we expect fiscal year 2012 to be even stronger than 2011. 
Our strategy is the right one, and it's working. That is focusing on mainframe distributed cloud and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Our vendor-agnostic approach is what customers tell me they need and are buying. No one else can claim the breadth of our solutions. We are investing in geographic expansion and in new account acquisition through business partners. Both are gaining traction. In fact, just last week, we announced a strategic initiative with the VCE, the virtual computing environment company. In addition, CA Technologies was named by HP as a Strategic AllianceOne Partner. Our two companies will work together on expanding routes to market and joint development projects. More details will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Last week, we also hosted more than 130 executives from 98 partner organizations worldwide at our Partner Summit in New York City. And what I'm hearing from our partners is they see a new level of commitment and focus on our mutual success. We have effectively integrated our acquisitions, and we are now investing in them to accelerate growth. 
For example, during the fourth quarter, we invested an incremental $14 million or $0.02 of earnings per share. This included almost doubling the number of employees at Nimsoft and integrating new technologies. We combined Inteq service desk with Nimsoft monitoring, which has created the first integrated IT management as a service solution called Nimsoft Unified Manager. We are also of rationalizing our business, including this afternoon's announcement that we've reached an agreement to sell our Internet Security business to Updata Partners. These actions further focus our resources on areas of strategic importance to CA Technologies.
In addition, our focus on improving our management systems have given us the ability to address business opportunities more quickly than even a year ago. These improved execution ability translated into financial results in fiscal year 2011.
Let me summarize our full year results from continuing operations, all of which are within our guidance ranges. Revenue was $4.4 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Approximately half of this revenue growth was organic. We held full gear non-GAAP operating margins flat, while we made significant investments in the business especially in the last quarter.
We grew our non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.92, up 13% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Fiscal year 2011 cash flow benefited from lower year-over-year cash taxes, offset by investments related to our acquisitions. 
Finally, total revenue backlog reached a record $8.8 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Our current revenue backlog grew 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported.
We believe, as stated all year, that current revenue backlog is a positive indicator of our future revenue growth and lays a foundation for fiscal 2012. In fact, our outlook for fiscal 2012 shows even greater revenue growth than last year.
We expect revenue to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. We are committed to holding non-GAAP operating margins at 34%, while investing more in emerging enterprises and markets this year than last. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 6% to 10% in constant currency. Cash flow is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency, reflecting investments in emerging enterprises and markets.
In addition, our board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase, bringing the total available for repurchase to approximately $700 million. We have also announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. And finally, we are in the process of reorganizing our internal management reporting, and will change our segment disclosure in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.  This will provide better visibility to our business and the progress we are making against our strategy. 
From a full year new product perspective, total new product sales and mainframe capacity increased in the low-single digits. I am confident we can do better. Within this, however, we grew our distributed new product portfolio more than 15% year-over-year. This was led by double-digit growth in new product sales of Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, Virtualization and Service Automation and Service Portfolio Management, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, grew high-single digits. These are the areas of our strategic focus for our company. 
This growth in distributed new products this was offset by mainframe new product and capacity sales, which were down approximately 25%. Mainframe performance is linked to the size and customer mix in our renewal portfolio, which fluctuates quarter-to-quarter and a year-to-year. As you know, our renewals were back-end loaded in fiscal 2011. And in the fourth quarter, capacity grew 50% year-over-year, the highest amount in 15 quarters. We are also beginning to see success with our new competitive replacement program, which launched in the second quarter, closing over 15 replacement in the last 9 months of the year.
In fiscal year 2012, we are continuing to focus on delivering innovation, strengthening our sales coverage model and making it even easier for customers to move to our full portfolio of solutions.
This afternoon, we are pleased to announce the addition of Peter Griffiths, who will be joining us at the end of May to lead our Technology and Development Group. Peter brings extensive software development and business management expertise from his roles at IBM, Cognos and Relational Matters. Peter will drive initiatives to enhance our product positioning and thought leadership in the technology community.
From a geographic perspective, full year North American revenue grew 7% year-over-year in constant currency, while EMEA's growth is not as strong as we would like. We knew that a turnaround in this region was going to be slow, but it is growing slower than I expected, and I am not satisfied with that.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are investing in EMEA, changing to go-to-market model and building new channel relationships. These are long-term initiatives, and will take quarters, not months. I am convinced we have the right personnel in place and are focused on the right priorities, accelerating new product sales and accessing new accounts.
On the positive side, our fourth quarter renewal yield in EMEA was in line with other regions. However, the renewal portfolio was much lighter in fiscal '11 than the previous year and will be again next year. And we did not leverage newly acquired technologies as successfully as we did in other regions. 
As I've said, we met the companywide growth targets we indicated at the beginning of the year in spite of the weakness in EMEA. And I am confident that the changes that we made last year was the right ones, and that they will work.
And now, let me turn the call over to Nancy to provide more detail."
262913,129806608,128220,"CA Technologies, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 12, 2011",2011-05-12,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a t",1365,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a table is available at investor.ca.com for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009. The incremental adjustments for the Internet Security Business full year fiscal 2011 are the following: revenue was reduced by $83 million; operating income decreased by $15 million; earnings per share decreased by $0.02; and cash flow decreased by $4 million. For the fourth quarter, revenue was reduced by $18 million, operating income decreased by $1 million and earnings per share and cash flow effects were not material. 
Selling our Internet Security Business is the right thing to do to align our portfolio to our strategy. And we will continue to look for opportunities to rationalize and focus our resources.
Now let us turn to the fourth quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated, and all results are from continuing operations. During the quarter, we closed a 5-year renewal deal for approximately $500 million, with a large global IT outsourcer. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew low-double digits. Fourth quarter underperformance in EMEA and softness in Japan were offset by growth in each of our other regions. 
Distributed new product sales grew mid-single digits. Driving this, Service Assurance including Nimsoft grew low-double digits. Virtualization and Service Automation new sales grew mid-double digits. Service Portfolio Management grew mid-teens, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, sales were flat. Mainframe capacity grew 50%, driven in part by two large public sector transactions.
As always, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio fluctuates, but we do expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow, steady tailwind as we cycle through these renewals. We experienced a double-digit decline in mainframe new product sales, which Bill discussed. 
Excluding the large global IT outsourcer deal we closed in the fourth quarter, renewals were down approximately 15%, more than the 10% we had anticipated at the outset of fiscal 2011. This was primarily due to timing, including a large transaction of over $100 million, which we chose to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Given that we closed the large global IT outsourcer renewal in fiscal year 2011, we currently expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year and down approximately 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. However, we do not focus on the year-over-year comparisons of bookings, as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We managed the aggregate renewal portfolio to optimize the renewal yield, which was in the low 90% range this quarter.
Even with the expected decrease in renewals, we are confident that this is the portfolio we need to achieve our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We do focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. With our highly ratable model, this is another reason we are confident in our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 4% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $12 million. In constant currency, revenue grew 5% in North America, while international revenue grew 2%. Subscription and maintenance revenue was $970 million, up 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $82 million, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $76 million, up 30% in constant currency and 29% as reported.
Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Please note that our fiscal year 2010 fourth quarter included $50 million in nonrecurring restructuring expense. Non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $356 million, up 28% in constant currency and 26% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32% compared to 26% in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 33% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a $0.01 headwind from currency.  Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 29% compared to 28% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year. We continue to refine our tax structure, and are pleased with the progress we are making.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $634 million, up 1% in constant currency and the flat as reported. Cash flow was positively affected by a decrease of approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $176 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total billings backlog of $5.2 billion was up 11% in constant currency and 14% as reported. DSOs were down year-over-year.
Turning to both fourth quarter and full year GAAP results. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP operating income was $299 million, up 29% in constant currency and 29% as reported, and GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.37, up 90% in constant currency and 95% as reported. Full year GAAP operating margin was 28%. Full year GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported, while full year GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $1.60, up 12% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 35% compared to 54% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to over $1.6 billion. During the fourth fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of stock for a total of $48 million. Between April 1 and May 6, we accelerated our program, purchasing an incremental 3 million shares of stock for a total of $68 million.
Turning to guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based upon March 31 exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. I would like to highlight that the large global IT outsourcer deal we signed in the fourth quarter renewed the last of our old-business-model contracts. As a result, we will report incremental revenue from the newly signed contract, but not incremental cash flow as we look at 2012.
Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range from 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.12 to $2.19. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 11%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year, a flat to 1 point improvement over fiscal year 2011. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 492 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 499 million shares.
Finally, we are committed to holding our non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, which is the combination of improving margins in our core businesses, while continuing to make significant investments in our emerging enterprise and emerging market businesses.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

And I think the market did as well, and so, there were some slowing there. But as we came into the fourth quarter, we did see a significant uplift on that. However, even as we talk about that, one of the things you need to recall or remember is that while that capacity growth is growing off of maybe the series of introduction, it's buffered somewhat by our renewal portfolio.

And with that said, we saw strong capacity, which I think is encouraging. For what we're seeing, we saw some large transactions during the year. And importantly, we're starting to see momentum in our competitive win back program. We had 15 competitive replacements where we went in and replaced our competitors across the board with our mainframe technology.

But over the long term, we believe our cash taxes will be a very positive tailwind for CFFO [cash flow from operations] after fiscal year '12. And the last thing is a point, I think it was mentioned on the old-business model that though we're getting more revenues, the cash stays about the same. To put all those three points together, and we believe we have very strong facts for the years going out, and that is why we're confident in increasing our commitment to share repurchase and dividends, which we announced today."

This one we spent a lot of time on ourselves, because it's the decisions we make on how we literally need to run this company taking it forward. There's about 2 points of margin that's tied up in the acquisitions piece last year and this year. So we're driving efficiencies in this business as we do that. The other thing is as we've increased these sales and new products, as you always see in new sales and new technologies entering, they commit it at a little less margin. And so that works in and works through as you go in time. But I think we all expect and do see that those new sales do, in fact, affect the margin piece as we build these new technology. But that's one of the reasons why we really made the announcement. You mentioned the buyback and the dividend increases because we've got a great deal of confidence, we'd returned that to shareholders.

And I'll repeat it, because it's probably worth repeating. We take a look at what we now call for the rest of the world with EMEA out, and whether you look at PNCV [ph] , new sales, even total bookings, which we don't look at that much because we look at revenue backlog. All of those measures are in double digit around the rest of the world with EMEA pulled out. So it demonstrates that, in fact, that the strategy is selling, and it's selling in a double-digit areas. So two things, mainframe and EMEA are the big pieces that make this a little bit harder to see. That's why, Frankie, we're looking forward to the opportunity in July and at the end of the quarter to take you through the segmentation.

Before we begin, and as you may have read in the press release this afternoon, Nancy Cooper is retiring. I expect to announce her replacement very soon and she has agreed to stay in her role until I have announced her replacement. On behalf of the CA Technologies team, I thank Nancy for her continued service and her contributions.
And now, let me review our results and outlook. As we said at the beginning of the year, fiscal year 2011 was both a growth and investment year. These investments have driven strength and improvements in many areas. We set out to accomplish a great deal this year, and we did what we set out to do. We also had some challenges in some products and in EMEA. We are addressing them head-on, and are still making good overall progress as a company. And the guidance we are providing this afternoon shows that we expect fiscal year 2012 to be even stronger than 2011. 
Our strategy is the right one, and it's working. That is focusing on mainframe, distributed, cloud and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Our vendor-agnostic approach is what customers tell me they need and are buying. No one else can claim the breadth of our solutions. We are investing in geographic expansion and in new account acquisition through business partners. Both are gaining traction. In fact, just last week, we announced a strategic initiative with VCE, the virtual computing environment company. In addition, CA Technologies was named by HP as a Strategic AllianceOne Partner. Our two companies will work together on expanding routes to market and joint development projects. More details will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Last week, we also hosted more than 130 executives from 98 partner organizations worldwide at our Partner Summit in New York City. And what I'm hearing from our partners is they see a new level of commitment and focus on our mutual success. We have effectively integrated our acquisitions, and we are now investing in them to accelerate growth. 
For example, during the fourth quarter, we invested an incremental $14 million or $0.02 of earnings per share. This included almost doubling the number of employees at Nimsoft and integrating new technologies. We combined Inteq service desk with Nimsoft monitoring, which has created the first integrated IT management-as-a-service solution called Nimsoft Unified Manager. We are also rationalizing our business, including this afternoon's announcement that we've reached an agreement to sell our Internet Security business to Updata Partners. These actions further focus our resources on areas of strategic importance to CA Technologies.
In addition, our focus on improving our management systems have given us the ability to address business opportunities more quickly than even a year ago. This improved execution ability translated into financial results in fiscal year 2011.
Let me summarize our full year results from continuing operations, all of which are within our guidance ranges. Revenue was $4.4 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Approximately half of this revenue growth was organic. We held full year non-GAAP operating margins flat, while we made significant investments in the business especially in the last quarter.
We grew our non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.92, up 13% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Fiscal year 2011 cash flow benefited from lower year-over-year cash taxes, offset by investments related to our acquisitions. 
Finally, total revenue backlog reached a record $8.8 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Our current revenue backlog grew 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported.
We believe, as we stated all year, that current revenue backlog is a positive indicator of our future revenue growth and lays a foundation for fiscal 2012. In fact, our outlook for fiscal 2012 shows even greater revenue growth than last year.
We expect revenue to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. We are committed to holding non-GAAP operating margins at 34%, while investing more in emerging enterprises and markets this year than last. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 6% to 10% in constant currency. Cash flow is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency, reflecting investments in emerging enterprises and markets.
In addition, our board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase, bringing the total available for repurchase to approximately $700 million. We have also announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. And finally, we are in the process of reorganizing our internal management reporting, and will change our segment disclosure in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.  This will provide better visibility to our business and the progress we are making against our strategy. 
From a full year new product perspective, total new product sales and mainframe capacity increased in the low-single digits. I am confident we can do better. Within this, however, we grew our distributed new product portfolio more than 15% year-over-year. This was led by double-digit growth in new product sales of Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, Virtualization and Service Automation and Service Portfolio Management, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, grew high-single digits. These are the areas of our strategic focus for our company. 
This growth in distributed new product sales was offset by mainframe new product and capacity sales, which were down approximately 25%. Mainframe performance is linked to the size and customer mix in our renewal portfolio, which fluctuates quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. As you know, our renewals were back-end loaded in fiscal 2011. And in the fourth quarter, capacity grew 50% year-over-year, the highest amount in 15 quarters. We are also beginning to see success with our new competitive replacement program, which launched in the second quarter, closing over 15 replacements in the last 9 months of the year.
In fiscal year 2012, we are continuing to focus on delivering new innovation, strengthening our sales coverage model and making it even easier for customers to move to our full portfolio of solutions.
This afternoon, we are pleased to announce the addition of Peter Griffiths, who will be joining us at the end of May to lead our Technology and Development Group. Peter brings extensive software development and business management expertise from his roles at IBM, Cognos and Relational Matters. Peter will drive initiatives to enhance our product positioning and thought leadership in the technology community.
From a geographic perspective, full year North American revenue grew 7% year-over-year in constant currency, while EMEA's growth is not as strong as we would like. We knew that a turnaround in this region was going to be slow, but it is going slower than I expected, and I am not satisfied with that.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are investing in EMEA, changing the go-to-market model and building new channel relationships. These are long-term initiatives, and will take quarters, not months. I am convinced we have the right personnel in place and are focused on the right priorities, accelerating new product sales and accessing new accounts.
On the positive side, our fourth quarter renewal yield in EMEA was in line with other regions. However, the renewal portfolio was much lighter in fiscal '11 than the previous year and will be again next year. And we did not leverage newly acquired technologies as successfully as we did in other regions. 
As I've said, we met the companywide growth targets we indicated at the beginning of the year in spite of the weakness in EMEA. And I am confident that the changes that we made last year were the right ones, and that they will work.
And now, let me turn the call over to Nancy to provide more detail."
262913,129806608,128253,"CA Technologies, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 12, 2011",2011-05-12,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a t",1364,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a table is available at investor.ca.com for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009. The incremental adjustments for the Internet Security Business full year fiscal 2011 are the following: revenue was reduced by $83 million; operating income decreased by $15 million; earnings per share decreased by $0.02; and cash flow decreased by $4 million. For the fourth quarter, revenue was reduced by $18 million, operating income decreased by $1 million and earnings per share and cash flow effects were not material. 
Selling our Internet Security Business is the right thing to do to align our portfolio to our strategy. And we will continue to look for opportunities to rationalize and focus our resources.
Now let us turn to the fourth quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated, and all results are from continuing operations. During the quarter, we closed a 5-year renewal deal for approximately $500 million, with a large global IT outsourcer. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew low-double digits. Fourth quarter underperformance in EMEA and softness in Japan were offset by growth in each of our other regions. 
Distributed new product sales grew mid-single digits. Driving this, Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, grew low-double digits. Virtualization and Service Automation new sales grew mid-double digits. Service Portfolio Management grew mid-teens, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, sales were flat. Mainframe capacity grew 50%, driven in part by two large public sector transactions.
As always, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio fluctuates, but we do expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow, steady tailwind as we cycle through these renewals. We experienced a double-digit decline in mainframe new product sales, which Bill discussed. 
Excluding the large global IT outsourcer deal we closed in the fourth quarter, renewals were down approximately 15%, more than the 10% we had anticipated at the outset of fiscal 2011. This was primarily due to timing, including a large transaction of over $100 million, which we chose to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Given that we closed the large global IT outsourcer renewal in fiscal year 2011, we currently expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year and down approximately 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. However, we do not focus on the year-over-year comparisons of bookings, as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We managed the aggregate renewal portfolio to optimize the renewal yield, which was in the low 90% range this quarter.
Even with the expected decrease in renewals, we are confident that this is the portfolio we need to achieve our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We do focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. With our highly ratable model, this is another reason we are confident in our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 4% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $12 million. In constant currency, revenue grew 5% in North America, while international revenue grew 2%. Subscription and maintenance revenue was $970 million, up 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $82 million, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $76 million, up 30% in constant currency and 29% as reported.
Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Please note that our fiscal year 2010 fourth quarter included $50 million in nonrecurring restructuring expense. Non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $356 million, up 28% in constant currency and 26% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32% compared to 26% in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 33% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a $0.01 headwind from currency.  Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 29% compared to 28% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year. We continue to refine our tax structure, and are pleased with the progress we are making.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $634 million, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Cash flow was positively affected by a decrease of approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $176 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total billings backlog of $5.2 billion was up 11% in constant currency and 14% as reported. DSOs were down year-over-year.
Turning to both fourth quarter and full year GAAP results. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP operating income was $299 million, up 29% in constant currency and 29% as reported, and GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.37, up 90% in constant currency and 95% as reported. Full year GAAP operating margin was 28%. Full year GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported, while full year GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $1.60, up 12% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 35% compared to 54% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to over $1.6 billion. During the fourth fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of stock for a total of $48 million. Between April 1 and May 6, we accelerated our program, purchasing an incremental 3 million shares of stock for a total of $68 million.
Turning to guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based upon March 31 exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. I would like to highlight that the large global IT outsourcer deal we signed in the fourth quarter renewed the last of our old-business-model contracts. As a result, we will report incremental revenue from the newly signed contract, but not incremental cash flow as we look at 2012.
Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.12 to $2.19. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 11%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in the fiscal year, a flat to 1 point improvement over fiscal year 2011. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 492 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 499 million shares.
Finally, we are committed to holding our non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, which is the combination of improving margins in our core businesses, while continuing to make significant investments in our emerging enterprise and emerging market businesses.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

And I think the market did as well, and so, there were some slowing there. But as we came into the fourth quarter, we did see a significant uplift on that.

And we were very encouraged what we saw last September with the new platform announcement. And our investments continue to reinforce to us that this is a platform that will play an important role going forward. So with our Mainframe Software Manager, our first role of course, we are encouraged by our competitiveness in the marketplace. As Bill commented, our new product sales around the mainframe were and are impacted by the available renewal portfolio, which was lower in FY '11. And with that said, we saw strong capacity, which I think is encouraging. For what we're seeing, we saw some large transactions during the year. And importantly, we're starting to see momentum in our competitive win back program. We had 15 competitive replacements where we went in and replaced our competitors across the board with our mainframe technology. So I would tell you that we're confident in our competitive position on mainframe. We held pricing as we move into FY '12."

And so what you see is a buildup in disbursements as we really decide those areas, those you heard Bill mentioned, emerging markets and some emerging enterprises, were really quite great opportunities. Then you heard him mention what's going on in Nimsoft. And so that was -- that will continue in fiscal year '12, and we believe that's absolutely the right thing to do. The second, you saw in fiscal '11, improved cash taxes. We are quite encouraged by our ability to reduce our effective tax rate. This means over time, this will translate into lower cash taxes, but that will be delayed and it will be lumpy. As you saw in both fiscal year '11 and we'll see in fiscal year '12. We are encouraged in fiscal year '11, we were able to defer taxes, which is always a good thing. On fiscal year '12, we'll have a little bit more cashes -- cash taxes. But over the long term, we believe our cash taxes will be a very positive tailwind for CFFO [cash flow from operations] after fiscal year '12. And the last thing is a point, I think it was mentioned on the old-business model, that though we're getting more revenues, the cash stays about the same. To put all those three points together, and we believe we have very strong facts for the years going out, and that is why we're confident in increasing our commitment to share repurchase and dividends, which we announced today."

Well, because today, it seems like the balance is more towards the growth side.

This is one we spent a lot of time on ourselves, because it's the decisions we make on how we literally need to run this company taking it forward. There's about 2 points of margin that's tied up in the acquisitions piece last year and this year. So we're driving efficiencies in this business as we do that. The other thing is as we've increased these sales and new products, as you always see in new sales and new technologies entering, they commit at a little less margin. And so that works in and works through as you go in time. But I think we all expect and do see that those new sales do, in fact, affect the margin piece as we build this new technology. But that's one of the reasons why we really made the announcement. You mentioned the buyback and the dividend increases because we've got a great deal of confidence, we'd returned that to shareholders. But then the second thing that we announced there, I think, is very important. That's why we're going to do the segmentations, start it with first quarter.

Our customers tell us IT has become the primary vehicle that they use to adapt their business to changing market demands and become more competitive. This evolution is being driven by virtualization, cloud implementation and SaaS application, allowing business models to change in days and weeks instead of months and years. While these technologies increase flexibility, they can also introduce significant management complexity. 
18 months ago, we called this evolution and built our strategy around it when many others were asking the question is it real? Now, 18 months later, it's clear. It's real. And the rate and pace of adoption is exceeding the industry estimates. We believe our use of experience and core strength in traditional IT management and security, combined with significant investments in our portfolio, will position us as the standard in the industry. 
Now, let me turn our progress against the strategy with our Quarter 1 results. Our first quarter showed operational improvements, reflected in revenue growth, a 2-point year-over-year improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin and double-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. However, we did not get as fast a start on the year from a revenue perspective as I had expected, particularly outside the Americas. For the quarter's results from continuing operations, revenue grew 4% in constant currency, more than half of which was organic. While we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of 6% to 8% revenue growth in constant currency, we had expected better top line performance in the first quarter. 
We continue to see good revenue growth in North America, up 9% in constant currency. This was offset by our international region, which was down 2% in constant currency. EMEA remains our execution challenge and cost the company approximately 1 point of revenue growth during the quarter. Performance in EMEA continues to vary widely the country and the salesforce continues to use the ELA renewal event to sell new products. 
We have been successful in selling outside the renewal cycle in North America and that is how we have consistently achieved mid to high single digit revenue growth each of the last 7 quarters. We have not yet accomplished that in EMEA. We will change this. Successfully selling outside the renewal cycle in EMEA will be driven by several things, the most important of which are moving additional people with a track record of execution to the region, accelerating the introduction of new products from our acquisitions, adding new sales incentives and changing the leadership. As a result, I recently made the decision to replace our EMEA general manager. We believe this new Executive has the knowledge and experience to unlock the value of our operations in that region. 
The balance of our first quarter results were good. Non-GAAP operating margin was 36%, a 2-point improvement over last year's first quarter. We are carefully managing our cost structure and focusing the portfolio on strategic priorities. Non-GAAP EPS was up 23% in constant currency, driven by operational improvements, a lower year-over-year tax rate and reduced share count. Cash flow was slightly up in constant currency, which keeps us on track to accomplish our full year outlook. This total was affected by $111 million year-over-year increase in cash taxes, which included a significant tax payment during the quarter. 
Finally, current revenue backlog, a good indicator of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth, grew 4% in constant currency year-over-year and 10% as reported. Underlying the performance, total new product sales in mainframe capacity were up in the low teens during the quarter. New mainframe product sales were up more than 15% year-over-year. Mainframe capacity was up slightly year-over-year. As we have said, we continue to expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow, steady tailwind as we cycle through our renewal portfolio. We had good traction with our mainframe competitive replacement program. During the quarter, we closed 11 competitive replacement deals, including Federated Mutual Insurance, a provider of insurance and risk management solutions and Telefónica Brazil, one of the world leaders in telecommunications sector. As a reminder, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio varies and can affect trends in both new product and capacity sales. 
In Enterprise Solutions, new sales were up low teens. Identity and Access Management new product sales, including Arcot, grew more than 70%. Customers making significant purchases in the quarter include Cox Communications, broadband communications and entertainment company and BNP Paribas France, a European leader in global banking and financial services. Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, was up midteens. We added more than 65 new logos to this business, including Oppenheimer Funds. In addition, Nimsoft added more than 45 new logos, including Cervalis, a premiere provider of IT infrastructure solutions and we now have more than 410 Managed Service Provider partners worldwide. 
Virtualization and Automation and Service Portfolio Management were down more than 15%. This performance in the first quarter follows a good finish to last year and we are in the process of rebuilding our pipeline. However, under Virtualization and Automation, there was some strong performance. During the quarter, our automation suite for physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures was up more than 40%. In fact, Logicalis USA, an international provider of integrated information and communications technology solutions and services, selected CA Technologies as its cloud automation and management platform. Next week, we are announcing a number of new updated cloud products and solutions that help our customers more easily use and provide cloud services. Our new solutions will drive cloud computing adoption by improving time-to-market and lowering operational costs. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I would like to review our segment results. I am pleased that our first quarter financial statements provide additional transparency for the company. First, Mainframe solutions revenue was $646 million, up 1% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Mainframe remains a great and profitable business for us, reflecting our 3 decades of market leadership. Mainframe solutions operating margin for the first quarter was 57%, up 3 points from last year's fiscal first quarter. This was driven by revenue growth and continued focus on operational efficiencies in that segment. Our Enterprise Solutions business revenue for the first quarter was $427 million, up 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. We continue to invest significantly in this segment of the business to position the company as the leader in both the hybrid cloud market, as well as midmarket IT management as a service. These investments, both in technology and go to market, are reflected in the 11% operating margin in the fiscal first quarter. While this is a 4-point improvement over last year's operating margin, we recognize it is below industry standard as we have consciously invested 4 percentage points of margin in this segment to accelerate our strategic initiatives. We are also continuously focused on operational efficiency. I would like to note that in the second quarter, we will be incurring GAAP and non-GAAP expense of approximately $35 million to $45 million, in connection with the workforce reduction of up to 500 employees. This action is a continuation of work we are doing to optimize our business by reallocating resources and divesting nonstrategic parts of the business. You will recall that last year, we divested our information governance and Internet security businesses. Now, we are moving resources to align with our strategy, allowing us to intelligently invest in growth technologies and regions. Despite this incremental expense and the expected acquisition of Interactive TKO, we will hold our expectation for fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, with the expectation that this workforce rebalance and other cost efficiencies will allow us to improve operating margin over time. We will discuss this in more detail next week at Investor Day when we provide our multiyear financial outlook. 
Finally, turning to Services, Services revenue was $90 million in the first quarter, up 9% in constant currency and 15% as reported. First quarter Services margin was 2% compared to 5% last year. We saw a more than 50% increase in newly contracted engagements, some of which we staffed with external consultants, which added cost. We run our Services business to delight our customers and enable implementation. 
And now, let me turn the call over to Rich to provide some more detail on the quarter."

Mainframe Solutions include only revenue from mainframe products. Enterprise solutions includes revenue from all other products. Service revenue is from implementation, consulting, education and training services. Segment expense includes direct cost, as well as shared costs, which are allocated based on revenue and expense allocation percentages. Further details are available in today's press release in the footnotes of Table 4 posted to our Investor Relations website. 
Now, let me turn to the remainder of our first quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated and all results are from continuing operations. First quarter renewals were up approximately 15%. This was due primarily to the timing of 2 large deals that closed in the quarter that had been expected to be renewed later in fiscal 2012. And an increase in contracted duration of a few current quarter transactions. We continue to expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year, with second quarter current expected to be down approximately 35% year-over-year. I will talk about the dynamics driving quarterly and annual fluctuation in our renewal portfolio in more detail next week at Investors Day. As a result, we do not focus on year-over-year comparisons of bookings as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We do focus on our renewal yield. This quarter, our renewal yield was uncharacteristically low at just over 80%. We had 2 large deals with contracted renewal rates that were unusually low, reducing the overall average. Excluding these 2 transactions, the renewal yield was in the low 90% range, consistent with previous quarters. 
We also focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.5 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.16 billion and grew 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $45 million. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $417 million, up 15% in constant currency and as reported. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.55, up 23% in constant currency and 22% as reported, including a $0.02 tailwind from currency. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was 31.6%. 
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $143 million, up 2% in constant currency and 17% as reported. This includes a year-over-year increase in cash taxes of $111 million, which while expected, still yields a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of cash tax payments. In addition, cash flow was favorably affected by improved customer collections. Single installment payments were $64 million in the first quarter compared to $90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Total billings backlog was $5.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency and 15% as reported. DSOs were slightly down year-over-year. 
Turning to first quarter GAAP results, first quarter GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income was $228 million, up 38% in constant currency and as reported and GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.45, up 7% in constant currency and 5% as reported. In addition to the items affecting our non-GAAP results, the GAAP results were unfavorably affected primarily by the loss on our hedging program, and to a lesser extent, increased stock-based compensation expense year-over-year. 
Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 31.5%. Now, moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in net cash. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 6.4 million shares of stock for a total of $150 million. This leaves approximately $630 million available under our current authorization. 
Now, let me turn to guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on June 30th exchange rates, includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following and includes the effect of the expected acquisition of Interactive TKO. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.14 to $2.21. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 5% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 489 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 497 million shares. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 34% for fiscal year 2012. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

The primary thing that has driven that lack of performance is the difference between what happened in North America and what's happened there. And that is the freestanding sales, one we're selling outside the ELA renewal. And that hasn't been driven in EMEA the way it has in North America and that has provided a tremendous difference in the performance. We did see some improvement in the quarter in that their bookings were up 40% in the last quarter. We're doing some other things too that I think will drive and give us confidence that we're going to see a pretty significant turnaround there. And that is that we're taking people to that region that have proven performance in marketing in the freestanding environment. We're putting new sales incentives in place and the most important piece is we put a new leader in place. That leader has been chosen. We took a good time to interview and select that leader, unable to announce who it is because he's currently in a position that we can't do that. But we expect him to join the quarter.

Thank you for joining us. Our customers tell us IT has become the primary vehicle that they use to adapt their business to changing market demands and become more competitive. This evolution is being driven",1396,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our customers tell us IT has become the primary vehicle that they use to adapt their business to changing market demands and become more competitive. This evolution is being driven by virtualization, cloud implementation and SaaS applications, allowing business models to change in days and weeks instead of months and years. While these technologies increase flexibility, they can also introduce significant management complexity. 18 months ago, we called this evolution and built our strategy around it when many others were asking the question is it real? Now, 18 months later, it's clear. It's real. And the rate and pace of adoption is exceeding industry estimates. We believe our years of experience and core strength in traditional IT management and security, combined with significant investments in our portfolio, will position us as the standard in the industry.
Now let me turn our progress against this strategy with our Quarter 1 results. Our first quarter showed operational improvements, reflected in revenue growth, a 2-point year-over-year improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin and double-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. However, we did not get as fast a start on the year from a revenue perspective as I had expected, particularly outside the Americas. For the quarter's results from continuing operations, revenue grew 4% in constant currency, more than half of which was organic. While we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of 6% to 8% revenue growth in constant currency, we had expected better top line performance in the first quarter.  We continued to see good revenue growth in North America, up 9% in constant currency. This was offset by our international region, which was down 2% in constant currency. EMEA remains our execution challenge, and cost the company approximately 1 point of revenue growth during the quarter. 
Performance in EMEA continues to vary widely by country, and the sales force continues to use the ELA renewal event to sell new products. We have been successful at selling outside the renewal cycle in North America and that is how we have consistently achieved mid to high single digit revenue growth each of the last 7 quarters. We have not yet accomplished that in EMEA. We will change this. Successfully selling outside the renewal cycle in EMEA will be driven by several things. The most important of which are moving additional people with a track record of execution to the region, accelerating the introduction of new products from our acquisitions, adding new sales incentives, and changing the leadership. As a result, I recently made the decision to replace our EMEA general manager. We believe this new executive has the knowledge and experience to unlock the value of our operations in that region.
The balance of our first quarter results were good. Non-GAAP operating margin was 36%, a 2-point improvement over last year's first quarter. We are carefully managing our cost structure and focusing the portfolio on strategic priorities. Non-GAAP EPS was up 23% in constant currency, driven by operational improvements, a lower year-over-year tax rate and reduced share count. Cash flow was slightly up in constant currency, which keeps us on track to accomplish our full year outlook. This total was affected by $111 million year-over-year increase in cash taxes, which included a significant tax payment during the quarter.
Finally, current revenue backlog, a good indicator of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth, grew 4% in constant currency year-over-year and 10% as reported. Underlying the performance, total new product sales in mainframe capacity were up in the low teens during the quarter. New mainframe product sales were up more than 15% year-over-year. Mainframe capacity was up slightly year-over-year. As we have said, we continue to expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow, steady tailwind as we cycle through our renewal portfolio. We had good traction with our mainframe competitive replacement program. During the quarter we closed 11 competitive replacement deals, including Federated Mutual Insurance, a provider of insurance and risk management solutions and Telefônica Brazil, one of the world leaders in telecommunications sector. As a reminder, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio varies, and can affect trends in both new product and capacity sales. 
In Enterprise Solutions, new sales were up low teens. Identity and Access Management new product sales, including Arcot, grew more than 70%. Customers making significant purchase in the quarter include Cox Communications, a broadband communications and entertainment company and BNP Paribas France, a European leader in global banking and financial services. Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, was up mid-teens. We added more than 65 new logos to this business, including OppenheimerFunds. In addition, Nimsoft added more than 45 new logos, including Cervalis, a premiere provider of IT infrastructure solutions, and we now have more than 410 managed service provider partners worldwide.
Virtualization and Automation and Service Portfolio Management were down more than 15%. This performance in the first quarter follows a good finish to last year and we are in the process of rebuilding our pipeline. However, under Virtualization Automation, there was some strong performance. During the quarter, our automation suite for physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures was up more than 40%. In fact, Logicalis U.S.A., an international provider of integrated information and communications technology solutions and services, selected CA Technologies as its cloud automation and management platform. Next week, we are announcing a number of new updated cloud products and solutions that help our customers more easily use and provide cloud services. Our new solutions will drive cloud computing adoption by improving time-to-market and lowering operational costs.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I would like to review our segment results. I am pleased that our first quarter financial statements provide additional transparency for the company. First, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $646 million, up 1% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Mainframe remains a great and profitable business for us, reflecting our 3 decades of market leadership. Mainframe Solutions operating margin for the first quarter was 57%, up 3 points from last year's fiscal first quarter. This was driven by revenue growth and continued focus on operational efficiencies in that segment. Our Enterprise Solutions business revenue for the first quarter was $427 million, up 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. We continue to invest significantly in this segment of the business to position the company as a leader in both the hybrid cloud market, as well as mid-market IT management as a service. These investments, both in technology and go to market, are reflected in the 11% operating margin in the fiscal first quarter. While this is a 4-point improvement over last year's operating margin, we recognize it is below industry standard as we have consciously invested 4 percentage points of margin in this segment to accelerate our strategic initiatives. We are also continuously focused on operational efficiency. I would like to note that in the second quarter, we will be incurring GAAP and non-GAAP expense of approximately $35 million to $45 million, in connection with the workforce reduction of up to 500 employees. This action is a continuation of work we are doing to optimize our business, by reallocating resources and divesting nonstrategic parts of the business. You will recall that last year, we divested our Information Governance and Internet Security businesses. Now, we are moving resources to align with our strategy, allowing us to intelligently invest in growth technologies and regions. Despite this incremental expense and the expected acquisition of Interactive TKO, we will hold our expectation for fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, with the expectation that this workforce rebalance and other cost efficiencies will allow us to improve operating margin over time. We will discuss this in more detail next week at Investor Day when we provide our multiyear financial outlook.
Finally, turning to Services. Services revenue was $90 million in the first quarter, up 9% in constant currency and 15% as reported. First quarter Services margin was 2% compared to 5% last year. We saw a more than 50% increase in newly contracted engagements, some of which we staffed with external consultants, which added cost. We run our Services business to delight our customers and enable implementation.
And now, let me turn the call over to Rich to provide some more detail on the quarter."
262913,137107928,143563,"CA Technologies, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone.

Mainframe Solutions include only revenue from mainframe products. Enterprise Solutions includes revenue from all other products. Services revenue is from implementation, consulting, education and training services. Segment expense includes direct cost, as well as shared costs, which are allocated based on revenue and expense allocation percentages. Further details are available in today's press release in the footnote of Table 4 posted to our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me turn to the remainder of our first quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated, and all results are from continuing operations. First quarter renewals were up approximately 15%. This was due primarily to the timing of 2 large deals that closed in the quarter that had been expected to be renewed later in fiscal 2012, and an increase in contracted duration of a few current quarter transactions. We continue to expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year, with second quarter currently expected to be down approximately 35% year-over-year. I will talk about the dynamics driving quarterly and annual fluctuation in our renewal portfolio in more detail next week at Investors Day. As a result, we do not focus on year-over-year comparisons of bookings as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We do focus on our renewal yield. This quarter, our renewal yield was uncharacteristically low, at just over 80%. We had 2 large deals with contracted renewal rates that were unusually low, reducing the overall average. Excluding these 2 transactions, the renewal yield was in the low 90% range, consistent with previous quarters. We also focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.5 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.16 billion and grew 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $45 million.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $417 million, up 15% in constant currency and as reported. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.55, up 23% in constant currency and 22% as reported, including a $0.02 tailwind from currency. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was 31.6%.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $143 million, up 2% in constant currency and 17% as reported. This includes a year-over-year increase in cash taxes of $111 million, which while expected, still yields a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of cash tax payments. In addition, cash flow was favorably affected by improved customer collections. Single installment payments were $64 million in the first quarter compared to $90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Total billings backlog was $5.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency and 15% as reported. DSOs were slightly down year-over-year. 
Turning to first quarter GAAP results. First quarter GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income was $228 million, up 38% in constant currency and as reported, and GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.45, up 7% in constant currency and 5% as reported. In addition to the items affecting our non-GAAP results, the GAAP results were unfavorably affected primarily by the loss on our hedging program, and to a lesser extent, increased stock-based compensation expense year-over-year. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 31.5%.
Now, moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in net cash. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 6.4 million shares of stock for a total of $150 million. This leaves approximately $630 million available under our current authorization.
Now, let me turn to guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on June 30th exchange rates, includes a partial hedge of operating income, and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following, and includes the effect of the expected acquisition of Interactive TKO. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.14 to $2.21. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 5% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 489 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 497 million shares. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 34% for fiscal year 2012.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

In that we have spent significant time over the last couple of quarters dealing with that. The primary thing that has driven that lack of performance is the difference between what happened in North America and what's happened there. And that is the freestanding sales when we're selling outside the ELA renewal. And that hasn't been driven in EMEA the way it has in North America and has provided a tremendous difference in the performance. We did see some improvement in the quarter, in that their bookings were up 40% in the last quarter. We're doing some other things too though, that I think will drive and give us confidence that we're going to see a pretty significant turnaround there. And that is that we're taking people to that region that have proven performance in marketing, in the freestanding environment. We're putting new sales incentives in place and the most important piece is we put a new leader in place. That leader has been chosen.

I recognize and appreciate, Bill, you saying upfront it wasn't what you wanted it to be but you also -- I think, Rich said that renewals were up 15% due to a couple of large deals and some longer-term deals. But if renewals were up 15% and annualized subscription and maintenance realized hasn't taken everything but is just about everything, was down 7%. I guess what does that say about new business?

Thank you for joining us. Our customers tell us IT has become the primary vehicle that they use to adapt their business to changing market demands and become more competitive. This evolution is being driven",1396,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our customers tell us IT has become the primary vehicle that they use to adapt their business to changing market demands and become more competitive. This evolution is being driven by virtualization, cloud implementation and SaaS applications, allowing business models to change in days and weeks instead of months and years. While these technologies increase flexibility, they can also introduce significant management complexity. 18 months ago, we called this evolution and built our strategy around it when many others were asking the question is it real? Now, 18 months later, it's clear. It's real. And the rate and pace of adoption is exceeding industry estimates. We believe our years of experience and core strength in traditional IT management and security, combined with significant investments in our portfolio, will position us as the standard in the industry.
Now let me turn our progress against this strategy with our Quarter 1 results. Our first quarter showed operational improvements, reflected in revenue growth, a 2-point year-over-year improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin and double-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. However, we did not get as fast a start on the year from a revenue perspective as I had expected, particularly outside the Americas. For the quarter's results from continuing operations, revenue grew 4% in constant currency, more than half of which was organic. While we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of 6% to 8% revenue growth in constant currency, we had expected better top line performance in the first quarter.  We continued to see good revenue growth in North America, up 9% in constant currency. This was offset by our international region, which was down 2% in constant currency. EMEA remains our execution challenge, and cost the company approximately 1 point of revenue growth during the quarter. 
Performance in EMEA continues to vary widely by country, and the sales force continues to use the ELA renewal event to sell new products. We have been successful at selling outside the renewal cycle in North America and that is how we have consistently achieved mid to high single digit revenue growth each of the last 7 quarters. We have not yet accomplished that in EMEA. We will change this. Successfully selling outside the renewal cycle in EMEA will be driven by several things. The most important of which are moving additional people with a track record of execution to the region, accelerating the introduction of new products from our acquisitions, adding new sales incentives, and changing the leadership. As a result, I recently made the decision to replace our EMEA general manager. We believe this new executive has the knowledge and experience to unlock the value of our operations in that region.
The balance of our first quarter results were good. Non-GAAP operating margin was 36%, a 2-point improvement over last year's first quarter. We are carefully managing our cost structure and focusing the portfolio on strategic priorities. Non-GAAP EPS was up 23% in constant currency, driven by operational improvements, a lower year-over-year tax rate and reduced share count. Cash flow was slightly up in constant currency, which keeps us on track to accomplish our full year outlook. This total was affected by $111 million year-over-year increase in cash taxes, which included a significant tax payment during the quarter.
Finally, current revenue backlog, a good indicator of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth, grew 4% in constant currency year-over-year and 10% as reported. Underlying the performance, total new product sales in mainframe capacity were up in the low teens during the quarter. New mainframe product sales were up more than 15% year-over-year. Mainframe capacity was up slightly year-over-year. As we have said, we continue to expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow, steady tailwind as we cycle through our renewal portfolio. We had good traction with our mainframe competitive replacement program. During the quarter we closed 11 competitive replacement deals, including Federated Mutual Insurance, a provider of insurance and risk management solutions and Telefônica Brazil, one of the world leaders in telecommunications sector. As a reminder, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio varies, and can affect trends in both new product and capacity sales. 
In Enterprise Solutions, new sales were up low teens. Identity and Access Management new product sales, including Arcot, grew more than 70%. Customers making significant purchase in the quarter include Cox Communications, a broadband communications and entertainment company and BNP Paribas France, a European leader in global banking and financial services. Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, was up mid-teens. We added more than 65 new logos to this business, including OppenheimerFunds. In addition, Nimsoft added more than 45 new logos, including Cervalis, a premiere provider of IT infrastructure solutions, and we now have more than 410 managed service provider partners worldwide.
Virtualization and Automation and Service Portfolio Management were down more than 15%. This performance in the first quarter follows a good finish to last year, and we are in the process of rebuilding our pipeline. However, under Virtualization Automation, there was some strong performance. During the quarter, our automation suite for physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures was up more than 40%. In fact, Logicalis U.S.A., an international provider of integrated information and communications technology solutions and services, selected CA Technologies as its cloud automation and management platform. Next week, we are announcing a number of new updated cloud products and solutions that help our customers more easily use and provide cloud services. Our new solutions will drive cloud computing adoption by improving time-to-market and lowering operational costs.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I would like to review our segment results. I am pleased that our first quarter financial statements provide additional transparency for the company. First, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $646 million, up 1% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Mainframe remains a great and profitable business for us, reflecting our 3 decades of market leadership. Mainframe Solutions operating margin for the first quarter was 57%, up 3 points from last year's fiscal first quarter. This was driven by revenue growth and continued focus on operational efficiencies in that segment. Our Enterprise Solutions business revenue for the first quarter was $427 million, up 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. We continue to invest significantly in this segment of the business to position the company as a leader in both the hybrid cloud market, as well as mid-market IT management as a service. These investments, both in technology and go to market, are reflected in the 11% operating margin in the fiscal first quarter. While this is a 4-point improvement over last year's operating margin, we recognize it is below industry standard as we have consciously invested 4 percentage points of margin in this segment to accelerate our strategic initiatives. We are also continuously focused on operational efficiency. I would like to note that in the second quarter, we will be incurring GAAP and non-GAAP expense of approximately $35 million to $45 million, in connection with the workforce reduction of up to 500 employees. This action is a continuation of work we are doing to optimize our business, by reallocating resources and divesting nonstrategic parts of the business. You will recall that last year, we divested our Information Governance and Internet Security businesses. Now, we are moving resources to align with our strategy, allowing us to intelligently invest in growth technologies and regions. Despite this incremental expense and the expected acquisition of Interactive TKO, we will hold our expectation for fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, with the expectation that this workforce rebalance and other cost efficiencies will allow us to improve operating margin over time. We will discuss this in more detail next week at Investor Day when we provide our multiyear financial outlook.
Finally, turning to Services. Services revenue was $90 million in the first quarter, up 9% in constant currency and 15% as reported. First quarter Services margin was 2% compared to 5% last year. We saw a more than 50% increase in newly contracted engagements, some of which we staffed with external consultants, which added cost. We run our Services business to delight our customers and enable implementation.
And now, let me turn the call over to Rich to provide some more detail on the quarter."
262913,137107928,143626,"CA Technologies, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone.

Mainframe Solutions include only revenue from mainframe products. Enterprise Solutions includes revenue from all other products. Services revenue is from implementation, consulting, education and training services. Segment expense includes direct cost, as well as shared costs, which are allocated based on revenue and expense allocation percentages. Further details are available in today's press release in the footnote of Table 4 posted to our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me turn to the remainder of our first quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated, and all results are from continuing operations. First quarter renewals were up approximately 15%. This was due primarily to the timing of 2 large deals that closed in the quarter, but had been expected to be renewed later in fiscal 2012, and an increase in contracted duration of a few current quarter transactions. We continue to expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year, with second quarter currently expected to be down approximately 35% year-over-year. I will talk about the dynamics driving quarterly and annual fluctuation in our renewal portfolio in more detail next week at Investors Day. As a result, we do not focus on year-over-year comparisons of bookings as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We do focus on our renewal yield. This quarter, our renewal yield was uncharacteristically low, at just over 80%. We had 2 large deals with contracted renewal rates that were unusually low, reducing the overall average. Excluding these 2 transactions, the renewal yield was in the low 90% range, consistent with previous quarters. We also focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.5 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.16 billion and grew 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $45 million.
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $417 million, up 15% in constant currency and as reported. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.55, up 23% in constant currency and 22% as reported, including a $0.02 tailwind from currency. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was 31.6%.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $143 million, up 2% in constant currency and 17% as reported. This includes a year-over-year increase in cash taxes of $111 million, which while expected, still yields a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of cash tax payments. In addition, cash flow was favorably affected by improved customer collections. Single installment payments were $64 million in the first quarter compared to $90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Total billings backlog was $5.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency and 15% as reported. DSOs were slightly down year-over-year. 
Turning to first quarter GAAP results. First quarter GAAP operating margin was 29%. GAAP operating income was $228 million, up 3% in constant currency and as reported, and GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.45, up 7% in constant currency and 5% as reported. In addition to the items affecting our non-GAAP results, the GAAP results were unfavorably affected primarily by the loss on our hedging program, and to a lesser extent, increased stock-based compensation expense year-over-year. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 31.5%.
Now, moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in net cash. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 6.4 million shares of stock for a total of $150 million. This leaves approximately $630 million available under our current authorization.
Now, let me turn to guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on June 30 exchange rates, includes a partial hedge of operating income, and updates our expectations for share count. Guidance is the following, and includes the effect of the expected acquisition of Interactive TKO. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.14 to $2.21. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 5% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 489 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 497 million shares. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 34% for fiscal year 2012.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

In that we have spent significant time over the last couple of quarters dealing with that. The primary thing that has driven that lack of performance is the difference between what's happened in North America and what's happened there. And that is the freestanding sales when we're selling outside the ELA renewal. And that hasn't been driven in EMEA the way it has in North America and has provided a tremendous difference in the performance. We did see some improvement in the quarter, in that their bookings were up 40% in the last quarter. We're doing some other things too though, that I think will drive and give us confidence that we're going to see a pretty significant turnaround there.

That's why we put the charge at both GAAP a non-GAAP because it's a standard way of business for us. We continue to optimize this business and we'll continue to do that."

I would like to start this afternoon with a summary of our second quarter results and update to our full year guidance and a review of our execution priorities for the back half of the year.In the second q",1043,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start this afternoon with a summary of our second quarter results and update to our full year guidance and a review of our execution priorities for the back half of the year.
In the second quarter, we continue to expand our topline and improve our bottom line. As a reminder, our second quarter results reflects investments in the business, including a $44 million charge for our workforce reduction to better align CA Technologies' resources with our market opportunity. We are investing in new technologies and acquiring new customers. 
During the quarter, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Just over 3 points of this constant currency growth was organic. Mainframe Solutions grew 2% in constant currency and 7% as reported, while our Enterprise Solutions grew 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. Including the $44 million expense, non-GAAP earnings per share decreased 1% in constant currency and increased 6% as reported. Cash flow from operations grew 37% in cost of currency and 47% as reported. And finally, current revenue backlog, a good indicator of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth, grew 30% in constant currency and 4% as reported. Full year guidance provided this afternoon factors in both our operational performance for the first half of the year including new product sales, which did not meet our expectations and a cautious view on macroeconomic conditions.
Revenue is now expected to grow 5% to 6% in constant currency, updated from 6% to 8%. This is in line with our multiyear guidance of mid-single-digit growth through fiscal 2015. We are also able to bring up the bottom end of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range, the result of ongoing expense controls and share repurchases. Non-GAAP earnings per share is now expected to grow 7% to 10% in constant currency, updated from 6% to 10%. We are reaffirming the expectations for cash flow from operations, and are committed to maintaining our 34% non-GAAP operating margin expectations for the full year.
As our year guidance of 100 basis points of margin expansion over the next 3 years indicates, we carefully balance a need to invest in the future with operational improvement. With respect to our capital structure, we accelerated our repurchase program, buying approximately 200 million worth of shares during the quarter. We also purchased an incremental $48 million worth of shares between October 31 and last Friday. 
Management and the Board of Directors continue to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and enhance our competitive positioning. As we said at our Analyst Day in July, our focus is business execution and management of the full range of our assets, including talent, intellectual property and financial resources to enhance our competitive position and drive total shareholder return. 
While we delivered a balanced performance in the first half of the year, there are areas where I am not satisfied yet. Essentially, it is about driving new product sales and improving sales productivity. This plays out in 3 ways: Expanding our product penetration, improving execution in EMEA and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. Each of these actions is designed to better address the demand we see in the market, and accelerate new product sales. 
As our guidance indicates, we expect to make these midyear adjustments within our current fiscal year 2012 expense plan. 
First, while we are improving our ability to sell the value of our software outside the renewal process, particularly to our 1,000 largest accounts, it is clear that there is demand for our solutions that we do not reach today. As we have said, the next step for CA Technologies is acquisition of new customers. Since the beginning of the year, we have been focused on expanding the reach of our sales force. As part of this effort, and beginning in the third quarter, we are rebalancing our sales force to add approximately 300 new quota carrying sales reps. These incremental reps will be dedicated to and compensated for selling products to new customers.
Second, EMEA continues to be work in progress, made more challenging by the macroeconomic climate. Our EMEA President and Regional Executive, Marco, is establishing a platform from which we can grow. We have other resources to this team to bring more discipline to the renewals process and pipeline management, which we spoke about last quarter. At the same time, we are remapping our EMEA sales coverage, favoring countries with the most resilient IT spending and where we can profitably acquire new customers. All of these changes are designed to accelerate new you product sales and improve account your penetration.
Finally, we remain focused on driving performance was a part of our technology. We saw some good momentum in the second quarter. Nimsoft added 65 new logos. Arcot currently have 116 million identities under management. Base Technologies, our public sector services acquisition, delivered its largest booking quarter to date. And AppLogic closed its largest 7-figure transaction to date. Despite these successes, we know we need to do more, particularly outside the U.S. 
In addition to the new quota-carrying reps, we're continuing to invest. The equivalent of 5 points of Enterprise Solutions segment margin to build out our indirect sales channel, SaaS capabilities and international presence. And we are seeing traction in the Council like JVS in Japan and hosting in Canada. Both of which broadened Nimsoft during the quarter. I continue to hear first hand from customers and partners like these that the opportunity we see the market is there. 
During the quarter, I traveled extensively, visiting with customers and partners around the world. In addition to dozens of one-on-one meetings, we hosted customers at CIO events in Asia and partners representing almost every route to market in EMEA. They confirmed that they are looking to CA Technologies to manage their IT across technology platforms and environments, drive the implementation of new technology and help them gain greater value for their existing IT investments. Helping our customers achieve these goals is the basis of our strategy and fundamental to our success going forward. Now let me turn the call over to Rich."
262913,141401418,178562,"CA Technologies, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Turning to our second quarter results. Please note that our growth rates are yearly unless otherwise indicated, and all results from are from continuing operations. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion and grew 5% at constant cu",993,"Thank you, Bill. Turning to our second quarter results. Please note that our growth rates are yearly unless otherwise indicated, and all results from are from continuing operations. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion and grew 5% at constant currency and 10% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $50 million. 
From a segment perspective, the solutions revenue was $655 million, up 2% in constant currency and 7% as reported. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue for the fiscal second quarter was $449 million, up 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. Services revenue was $96 million in the second quarter, up 16% in constant currency and 22% as reported. 
Underlying these results, total new capacity and product sales were down high single digits. In mainframe, new capacity sales more than doubled, while new product sales were down approximately 10%. The new IBM mainframe has bring increased attention to the platform and served  as a slow steady tailwind to CA Technologies. Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down just over 20%. This was largely driven by a difficult year-over-year compare and shorter duration of maintenance associated with our new product sales. Service Assurance and virtualization and automation declined, while Identity and Access Management grew. As Bill said, we are taking action to improve new product sales. 
Finally, service engagements grew both sequentially and year-over-year. On the renewal side, second quarter renewals came in better than anticipated in July, down approximately 5% year-over-year, not 35%. This is primarily driven by timing including alleged have been in contact which renewed a quarter early. We had good renewal pricing this quarter. Our renewal yield was in the low 90s, and we did not see Mr. Teacher duration. We now expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that our fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a significant headwind due to more than 500 million system integrated contract signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Moving at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 4% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 4% in constant currency and as reported. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interests and taxes was $378 million, down 7% in constant currency and 2% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, including $44 million of expense related to our second quarter workforce reduction of 400 employees. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Operating margins for the mainframe solution was 53%, 56% excluding the workforce reduction. Operating margins for the Enterprise Solutions was 6%, 10% excluding the workforce reduction. This includes 5 points of continued investment in building our indirect sales channel, SaaS capabilities and international presence. 
Finally, operating margins for services was 4%, 5% excluding the workforce reduction. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, down 1% in constant currency and up 6% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.03 tailwind from currency. 
This quarter, EPS benefited from operational improvements, as well as our stock repurchase program, which accelerated during the quarter, partially offset by the $44 million workforce reduction which equates to $0.06. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 was 31.5%.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $190 million, up 37% in constant currency and 47% as reported. Cash flow is driven by the topline growth and year-over-year decrease in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $100 million in the second quarter compared to $124 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 8% in constant currency and 7% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat during the year.
Moving to the second quarter GAAP results. Quarter operating margin before interest and tax was 28%. GAAP operating income was $333 million, down 6% in constant currency and up 10% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 7% in constant currency and up 9% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in net cash. Within July 1 and October 31, we purchased approximately 12 million shares of stock for a total of approximately 240 million. This leaves approximately 384 million available under our current authorization.
Now let me turn to guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on September 30 exchange rates, includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. As bill mentioned in his remarks, we revised guidance this afternoon reflects first half underperformance of new product sales and the cautious view of the global macroeconomic environment. Guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 5% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.18. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in the range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $.78 to $1.83. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% at constant currency. This translates reported cash from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 million. Underwriting this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 478 million shares outstanding and our weighted average diluted share count of approximately 491 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 34% for fiscal year 2012. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

And then frankly, to wrap up, we're confident in the second half performance and looking forward to wrap this year e up. Thanks to all of you for joining us, and we'll talk to you again."

I would like to start this afternoon with a summary of our second quarter results, an update to our full year guidance and a review of our execution priorities for the back half of the year.In the second q",1046,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start this afternoon with a summary of our second quarter results, an update to our full year guidance and a review of our execution priorities for the back half of the year.
In the second quarter, we continued to expand our top line and improve our bottom line. As a reminder, our second quarter results reflects investments in the business, including a $44 million charge for our workforce reduction to better align CA Technologies resources with our market opportunity. We are investing in new technologies and acquiring new customers. 
During the quarter, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Just over 3 points of this constant currency growth was organic. Mainframe Solutions grew 2% in constant currency and 7% as reported, while our Enterprise Solutions grew 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. Including the $44 million expense, non-GAAP earnings per share decreased 1% in constant currency and increased 6% as reported. 
Cash flow from operations grew 37% in cost of currency and 47% as reported. And finally, current revenue backlog, a good indicator of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth, grew 3% in constant currency and 4% as reported. 
Full year guidance provided this afternoon factors in both our operational performance for the first half of the year, including new product sales which did not meet our expectations and a cautious view on macroeconomic conditions.
Revenue is now expected to grow 5% to 6% in constant currency, updated from 6% to 8%. This is in line with our multi-year guidance of mid-single-digit growth through fiscal 2015. We were also able to bring up the bottom end of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range, the result of ongoing expense controls and share repurchases. Non-GAAP earnings per share is now expected to grow 7% to 10% in constant currency, updated from 6% to 10%. 
We are reaffirming the expectations for cash flow from operations and are committed to maintaining our 34% non-GAAP operating margin expectations for the full year. As our multi-year guidance of 100 basis points of margin expansion over the next 3 years indicates, we carefully balance the need to invest in the future with operational improvement. 
With respect to our capital structure, we accelerated our repurchase program, buying approximately $200 million worth of shares during the quarter. We also purchased an incremental $48 million worth of shares between October 1 and last Friday. 
Management and the Board of Directors continue to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and enhance our competitive positioning. As we said at our Analyst Day in July, our focus is business execution and management of the full range of our assets, including talent, intellectual property and financial resources to enhance our competitive position and drive total shareholder return. 
While we delivered a balanced performance in the first half of the year, there are areas where I am not satisfied yet. Essentially, it is about driving new product sales and improving sales productivity. This plays out in 3 ways: expanding our product penetration; improving execution in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. Each of these actions is designed to better address the demand we see in the market and accelerate new product sales. 
As our guidance indicates, we expect to make these midyear adjustments within our current fiscal year 2012 expense plan. 
First, while we are improving our ability to sell the value of our software outside the renewal process, particularly to our 1,000 largest accounts, it is clear that there is demand for our solutions that we do not reach today. As we have said, the next step for CA Technologies is acquisition of new customers. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have been focused on expanding the reach of our sales force. As part of this effort, beginning in the third quarter, we are rebalancing our sales force to add approximately 300 new quota-carrying sales reps. These incremental reps will be dedicated to and compensated for selling products to new customers.
Second, EMEA continues to be a work in progress, made more challenging by the macroeconomic climate. Our EMEA President and Regional Executive, Marco Comastri, is establishing a platform from which we can grow. We have added resources to his team to bring more discipline to our renewals process and pipeline management, which we spoke about last quarter. 
At the same time, we are remapping our EMEA sales coverage, favoring countries with the most resilient IT spending and where we can profitably acquire new customers. All of these changes are designed to accelerate new you product sales and improve account penetration.
Finally, we remain focused on driving performance of our acquired technology. We saw some good momentum in the second quarter. Nimsoft added 65 new logos. Arcot currently has more than 160 million identities under management. Base Technologies, our public sector services acquisition, delivered its largest booking quarter to date. And AppLogic closed its largest 7-figure transaction to date. Despite these successes, we know we need to do more, particularly outside the U.S.
In addition to the new quota-carrying reps, we continue to invest the equivalent of 5 points of Enterprise Solutions segment margin; to build out our indirect sales channel, SaaS capabilities and international presence; and we are seeing traction in the accounts like JBS in Japan and PEER 1 Hosting in Canada, both of which bought Nimsoft during the quarter. I continue to hear first hand from customers and partners like these that the opportunity we see in the market is there.
During the quarter, I traveled extensively, visiting with customers and partners around the world. In addition to dozens of one-on-one meetings, we hosted customers at CIO events in Asia and partners representing almost every route to market in EMEA. They confirmed that they are looking to CA Technologies to manage their IT across technology platforms and environments, drive the implementation of new technology and help them gain greater value for their existing IT investments.
Helping our customers achieve these goals is the basis of our strategy and fundamental to our success going forward. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rich."
262913,141401418,178806,"CA Technologies, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Turning to our second quarter results. Please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated, and all results from are from continuing operations. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion and grew 5% at c",996,"Thank you, Bill. Turning to our second quarter results. Please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated, and all results from are from continuing operations. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion and grew 5% at constant currency and 10% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $50 million.
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $655 million, up 2% in constant currency and 7% as reported. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue for the fiscal second quarter was $449 million, up 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. Services revenue was $96 million in the second quarter, up 16% in constant currency and 22% as reported. 
Underlying these results, total new capacity and product sales were down high single digits. In Mainframe, new capacity sales more than doubled, while new product sales were down approximately 10%. The new IBM mainframe has bring increased attention to the platform and should served as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.
Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down just over 20%. This was largely driven by a difficult year-over-year compare and shorter duration of maintenance associated with our new product sales. 
Service Assurance and Virtualization and Automation declined, while Identity and Access Management grew. As Bill said, we are taking action to improve new product sales.
Finally, service engagements grew both sequentially and year-over-year. On the renewal side, second quarter renewals came in better than anticipated in July, down approximately 5% year-over-year, not 35%. This variance was primarily driven by timing, including a large government contract which renewed a quarter early. We had good renewal pricing this quarter. Our renewal yield was in the low 90s, and we did not see material change in duration.
We now expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that our fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a significant headwind due to more than $500 million system integrator contract signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 4% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 4% in constant currency and as reported. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $378 million, down 7% in constant currency and 2% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, including $44 million of expense related to our second quarter workforce reduction of 400 employees. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. 
Operating margins for the Mainframe Solutions was 53%, 56% excluding the workforce reduction. Operating margins for the Enterprise Solutions was 6%, 10% excluding the workforce reduction. This includes 5 points of continued investment in building out our indirect sales channel, SaaS capabilities and international presence. 
Finally, operating margin for Services was 4%, 5% excluding the workforce reduction. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, down 1% in constant currency and up 6% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.03 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from operational improvements, as well as our stock repurchase program which accelerated during the quarter, partially offset by the $44 million workforce reduction which equates to $0.06. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 was 31.5%.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $190 million, up 37% in constant currency and 47% as reported. Cash flow is driven by the top line growth and year-over-year decrease in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $100 million in the second quarter compared to $124 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 8% in constant currency and 7% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.
Moving to the second quarter GAAP results. Second quarter operating margin before interest and tax was 28%. GAAP operating income was $333 million, down 6% in constant currency and up 10% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 7% in constant currency and up 9% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in net cash. Between July 1 and October 21, we purchased approximately 12 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $248 million. This leaves approximately $384 million available under our current authorization.
Now let me turn to guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on September 30 exchange rates, includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. As Bill mentioned in his remarks, revised guidance this afternoon reflects first half underperformance in new product sales and a cautious view of the global macroeconomic environment. 
Guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be in a range of 5% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.18. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.83. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 478 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 491 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 34% for fiscal year 2012. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

So that says several months shorter just on an average. You're correct on the overall renewal portfolio, which we were happy with, the mid-90 -- or let's just say low 90 renewal rate. They were slightly up about 1/10 of a year. So call that 2 months on average. So I think we're happy to see both those clear.

And the second question is relating to operating expenses or I should say, it's -- so you've given that operating expenses were -- before interest and taxes were up 11% in constant currency and 10% as reported. But operating income before interest and taxes were down 6% in constant currency but up 10% as reported. That was in the write-up. So 6% down and 10% up.

And so that's a new additional one. It's a transition I spoke of about a minute ago. In addition to that in Europe, with Marco on the ground there, asking the kinds of questions as he's looking at the things he's looking at, we deployed additional resource there from the whole process of how we are selling the value into the accounts and the things that we do to sell the solutions into the accounts to give more discipline around that. You may recall in previous quarters, we said that, in fact, we hadn't shifted there as fast in EMEA as we had in North America. We put additional resource and skills in place, which we said we were going to do. We did that, and that's in place to do that. Rich, take the rest."

I would like to start this afternoon with a summary of our second quarter results, an update to our full year guidance and a review of our execution priorities for the back half of the year.
In the second quarter, we continued to expand our top line and improve our bottom line. As a reminder, our second quarter results reflects investments in the business, including a $44 million charge for our workforce reduction to better align CA Technologies resources with our market opportunity. We are investing in new technologies and acquiring new customers. 
During the quarter, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Just over 3 points of this constant currency growth was organic. Mainframe Solutions grew 2% in constant currency and 7% as reported, while our Enterprise Solutions grew 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. Including the $44 million expense, non-GAAP earnings per share decreased 1% in constant currency and increased 6% as reported. 
Cash flow from operations grew 37% in cost of currency and 47% as reported. And finally, current revenue backlog, a good indicator of our expected subscription and maintenance revenue growth, grew 3% in constant currency and 4% as reported. 
Full year guidance provided this afternoon factors in both our operational performance for the first half of the year, including new product sales which did not meet our expectations and a cautious view on macroeconomic conditions.
Revenue is now expected to grow 5% to 6% in constant currency, updated from 6% to 8%. This is in line with our multi-year guidance of mid-single-digit growth through fiscal 2015. We were also able to bring up the bottom end of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range, the result of ongoing expense controls and share repurchases. Non-GAAP earnings per share is now expected to grow 7% to 10% in constant currency, updated from 6% to 10%. 
We are reaffirming the expectations for cash flow from operations and are committed to maintaining our 34% non-GAAP operating margin expectations for the full year. As our multi-year guidance of 100 basis points of margin expansion over the next 3 years indicates, we carefully balance the need to invest in the future with operational improvement. 
With respect to our capital structure, we accelerated our repurchase program, buying approximately $200 million worth of shares during the quarter. We also purchased an incremental $48 million worth of shares between October 1 and last Friday. 
Management and the Board of Directors continue to evaluate ways to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining the financial flexibility we need to build our business and enhance our competitive positioning. As we said at our Analyst Day in July, our focus is business execution and management of the full range of our assets, including talent, intellectual property and financial resources to enhance our competitive position and drive total shareholder return. 
While we delivered a balanced performance in the first half of the year, there are areas where I am not satisfied yet. Essentially, it is about driving new product sales and improving sales productivity. This plays out in 3 ways: expanding our product penetration; improving execution in EMEA; and driving consistent performance out of our acquisitions. Each of these actions is designed to better address the demand we see in the market and accelerate new product sales. 
As our guidance indicates, we expect to make these midyear adjustments within our current fiscal year 2012 expense plan. 
First, while we are improving our ability to sell the value of our software outside the renewal process, particularly to our 1,000 largest accounts, it is clear that there is demand for our solutions that we do not reach today. As we have said, the next step for CA Technologies is acquisition of new customers. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have been focused on expanding the reach of our sales force. As part of this effort, beginning in the third quarter, we are rebalancing our sales force to add approximately 300 new quota-carrying sales reps. These incremental reps will be dedicated to and compensated for selling products to new customers.
Second, EMEA continues to be a work in progress, made more challenging by the macroeconomic climate. Our EMEA President and Regional Executive, Marco Comastri, is establishing a platform from which we can grow. We have added resources to his team to bring more discipline to our renewals process and pipeline management, which we spoke about last quarter. 
At the same time, we are remapping our EMEA sales coverage, favoring countries with the most resilient IT spending and where we can profitably acquire new customers. All of these changes are designed to accelerate new you product sales and improve account penetration.
Finally, we remain focused on driving performance of our acquired technology. We saw some good momentum in the second quarter. Nimsoft added 65 new logos. Arcot currently has more than 160 million identities under management. Base Technologies, our public sector services acquisition, delivered its largest booking quarter to date. And AppLogic closed its largest 7-figure transaction to date. Despite these successes, we know we need to do more, particularly outside the U.S.
In addition to the new quota-carrying reps, we continue to invest the equivalent of 5 points of Enterprise Solutions segment margin; to build out our indirect sales channel, SaaS capabilities and international presence; and we are seeing traction in the accounts like JBS in Japan and PEER 1 Hosting in Canada, both of which bought Nimsoft during the quarter. I continue to hear first hand from customers and partners like these that the opportunity we see in the market is there.
During the quarter, I traveled extensively, visiting with customers and partners around the world. In addition to dozens of one-on-one meetings, we hosted customers at CIO events in Asia, and partners representing almost every route to market in EMEA. They confirmed that they are looking to CA Technologies to manage their IT across technology platforms and environments, drive the implementation of new technology and help them gain greater value for their existing IT investments.
Helping our customers achieve these goals is the basis of our strategy and fundamental to our success going forward. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rich."

Please note that our growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated, and all results from are from continuing operations. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion and grew 5% at constant currency and 10% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $50 million.
From a segment perspective, Mainframe Solutions revenue was $655 million, up 2% in constant currency and 7% as reported. Our Enterprise Solutions revenue for the fiscal second quarter was $449 million, up 9% in constant currency and 14% as reported. Services revenue was $96 million in the second quarter, up 16% in constant currency and 22% as reported. 
Underlying these results, total new capacity and product sales were down high single digits. In Mainframe, new capacity sales more than doubled, while new product sales were down approximately 10%. The new IBM mainframe has -- brings increased attention to the platform and should served as a slow, steady tailwind to CA Technologies.
Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down just over 20%. This was largely driven by a difficult year-over-year compare and shorter duration of maintenance associated with our new product sales. 
Service Assurance and Virtualization and Automation declined, while Identity and Access Management grew. As Bill said, we are taking action to improve new product sales.
Finally, service engagements grew both sequentially and year-over-year. On the renewal side, second quarter renewals came in better than anticipated in July, down approximately 5% year-over-year, not 35%. This variance was primarily driven by timing, including a large government contract which renewed a quarter early. We had good renewal pricing this quarter. Our renewal yield was in the low 90s, and we did not see material change in duration.
We now expect the 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 15% year-over-year. For modeling purposes, please note that our fourth quarter 2012 renewals face a significant headwind due to more than $500 million system integrator contract signed last year in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at revenue backlog. Current revenue backlog was $3.5 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 4% as reported. Total revenue backlog was $8.1 billion, up 4% in constant currency and as reported. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $378 million, down 7% in constant currency and 2% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, including $44 million of expense related to our second quarter workforce reduction of 400 employees. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. 
Operating margins for the Mainframe Solutions was 53%, 56% excluding the workforce reduction. Operating margins for the Enterprise Solutions was 6%, 10% excluding the workforce reduction. This includes 5 points of continued investment in building out our indirect sales channel, SaaS capabilities and international presence. 
Finally, operating margin for Services was 4%, 5% excluding the workforce reduction. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, down 1% in constant currency and up 6% as reported, including a year-over-year $0.03 tailwind from currency. This quarter, EPS benefited from operational improvements, as well as our stock repurchase program which accelerated during the quarter, partially offset by the $44 million workforce reduction which equates to $0.06. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 was 31.5%.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $190 million, up 37% in constant currency and 47% as reported. Cash flow is driven by the top line growth and year-over-year decrease in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $100 million in the second quarter compared to $124 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Total billings backlog of $5 billion was up 8% in constant currency and 7% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year-over-year.
Moving to the second quarter GAAP results. Second quarter operating margin before interest and tax was 28%. GAAP operating income was $333 million, down 6% in constant currency and up 10% as reported. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 7% in constant currency and up 9% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8%.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in net cash. Between July 1 and October 21, we purchased approximately 12 million shares of stock for a total of approximately $248 million. This leaves approximately $384 million available under our current authorization.
Now let me turn to guidance. As has been our practice, guidance is based on September 30 exchange rates, includes a partial hedge of operating income and updates our expectations for share count. As Bill mentioned in his remarks, revised guidance this afternoon reflects first half underperformance in new product sales and a cautious view of the global macroeconomic environment. 
Guidance is the following: Total revenue growth is now expected to be in a range of 5% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 7% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.18. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is now expected to be in a range of 6% to 9%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.83. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash from operations of $1.44 billion to $1.47 billion. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in this fiscal year. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 478 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 491 million shares. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 34% for fiscal year 2012. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

While we remain convinced that our strategic direction is the right one, I am mindful of making the right choices to maximize total shareholder return. As we told you at Analyst Day in July, this is an ongoing process, but one that we expect to update you on during our fiscal fourth quarter. 
Our principles are basic: continue to grow healthy core businesses; invest in strategic opportunities to position CA Technologies for the future; continue to shrink or disinvest non-core businesses; and return cash to shareholders.
On November 13, we will kick off CA World in Las Vegas. This is our annual user conference where we expect to host about 5,000 customers and partners. During World, we plan to share our strategic direction and the new products announcements. We hope to see you there.

So that says several months shorter just on an average. You're correct on the overall renewal portfolio, which we were happy with, the mid-90 -- or let's just say low 90 renewal rate. They were slightly up about 1/10 of a year. So call that 2 months on average. So I think we're happy to see both those clear.

In addition to that in Europe, with Marco on the ground there, asking the kinds of questions as he's looking at the things he's looking at, we deployed additional resource there from the whole process of how we are selling the value into the accounts and the things that we do to sell the solutions into the accounts to give more discipline around that.

Before we begin, and as you may have read in the press release this afternoon, Nancy Cooper is retiring. I expect to announce her replacement very soon and she has agreed to stay in her role until I have announced her replacement. On behalf of the CA Technologies team, I thank Nancy for her continued service and her contributions.
And now, let me review our results and outlook. As we said at the beginning of the year, fiscal year 2011 was both a growth and investment year. These investments have driven strength and improvements in many areas. We set out to accomplish a great deal this year, and we did what we set out to do. We also had some challenges in some products and in EMEA. We are addressing them head-on, and are still making good overall progress as a company. And the guidance we are providing this afternoon shows that we expect fiscal year 2012 to be even stronger than 2011. 
Our strategy is the right one, and it's working. That is focusing on mainframe, distributed, cloud and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Our vendor-agnostic approach is what customers tell me they need and are buying. No one else can claim the breadth of our solutions. We are investing in geographic expansion and in new account acquisition through business partners. Both are gaining traction. In fact, just last week, we announced a strategic initiative with VCE, the virtual computing environment company. In addition, CA Technologies was named by HP as a Strategic AllianceOne Partner. Our two companies will work together on expanding routes to market and joint development projects. More details will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Last week, we also hosted more than 130 executives from 98 partner organizations worldwide at our Partner Summit in New York City. And what I'm hearing from our partners is they see a new level of commitment and focus on our mutual success. We have effectively integrated our acquisitions, and we are now investing in them to accelerate growth. 
For example, during the fourth quarter, we invested an incremental $14 million or $0.02 of earnings per share. This included almost doubling the number of employees at Nimsoft and integrating new technologies. We combined Inteq service desk with Nimsoft monitoring, which has created the first integrated IT management-as-a-service solution called Nimsoft Unified Manager. We are also rationalizing our business, including this afternoon's announcement that we've reached an agreement to sell our Internet Security business to Updata Partners. These actions further focus our resources on areas of strategic importance to CA Technologies.
In addition, our focus on improving our management systems have given us the ability to address business opportunities more quickly than even a year ago. This improved execution ability translated into financial results in fiscal year 2011.
Let me summarize our full year results from continuing operations, all of which are within our guidance ranges. Revenue was $4.4 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Approximately half of this revenue growth was organic. We held full year non-GAAP operating margins flat, while we made significant investments in the business especially in the last quarter.
We grew our non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.92, up 13% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Fiscal year 2011 cash flow benefited from lower year-over-year cash taxes, offset by investments related to our acquisitions. 
Finally, total revenue backlog reached a record $8.8 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Our current revenue backlog grew 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported.
We believe, as we stated all year, that current revenue backlog is a positive indicator of our future revenue growth and lays a foundation for fiscal 2012. In fact, our outlook for fiscal 2012 shows even greater revenue growth than last year.
We expect revenue to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. We are committed to holding non-GAAP operating margins at 34%, while investing more in emerging enterprises and markets this year than last. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 6% to 10% in constant currency. Cash flow is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency, reflecting investments in emerging enterprises and markets.
In addition, our board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase, bringing the total available for repurchase to approximately $700 million. We have also announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. And finally, we are in the process of reorganizing our internal management reporting, and will change our segment disclosure in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.  This will provide better visibility to our business and the progress we are making against our strategy. 
From a full year new product perspective, total new product sales and mainframe capacity increased in the low-single digits. I am confident we can do better. Within this, however, we grew our distributed new product portfolio more than 15% year-over-year. This was led by double-digit growth in new product sales of Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, Virtualization and Service Automation and Service Portfolio Management, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, grew high-single digits. These are the areas of our strategic focus for our company. 
This growth in distributed new product sales was offset by mainframe new product and capacity sales, which were down approximately 25%. Mainframe performance is linked to the size and customer mix in our renewal portfolio, which fluctuates quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. As you know, our renewals were back-end loaded in fiscal 2011. And in the fourth quarter, capacity grew 50% year-over-year, the highest amount in 15 quarters. We are also beginning to see success with our new competitive replacement program, which launched in the second quarter, closing over 15 replacements in the last 9 months of the year.
In fiscal year 2012, we are continuing to focus on delivering new innovation, strengthening our sales coverage model and making it even easier for customers to move to our full portfolio of solutions.
This afternoon, we are pleased to announce the addition of Peter Griffiths, who will be joining us at the end of May to lead our Technology and Development Group. Peter brings extensive software development and business management expertise from his roles at IBM, Cognos and Relational Matters. Peter will drive initiatives to enhance our product positioning and thought leadership in the technology community.
From a geographic perspective, full year North American revenue grew 7% year-over-year in constant currency, while EMEA's growth is not as strong as we would like. We knew that a turnaround in this region was going to be slow, but it is going slower than I expected, and I am not satisfied with that.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are investing in EMEA, changing the go-to-market model and building new channel relationships. These are long-term initiatives, and will take quarters, not months. I am convinced we have the right personnel in place and are focused on the right priorities, accelerating new product sales and accessing new accounts.
On the positive side, our fourth quarter renewal yield in EMEA was in line with other regions. However, the renewal portfolio was much lighter in fiscal '11 than the previous year and will be again next year. And we did not leverage newly acquired technologies as successfully as we did in other regions. 
As I've said, we met the companywide growth targets we indicated at the beginning of the year in spite of the weakness in EMEA. And I am confident that the changes that we made last year were the right ones, and that they will work.
And now, let me turn the call over to Nancy to provide more detail."
262913,129806608,2482947,"CA Technologies, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 12, 2011",2011-05-12,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a t",1364,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a table is available at investor.ca.com for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009. The incremental adjustments for the Internet Security Business full year fiscal 2011 are the following: revenue was reduced by $83 million; operating income decreased by $15 million; earnings per share decreased by $0.02; and cash flow decreased by $4 million. For the fourth quarter, revenue was reduced by $18 million, operating income decreased by $1 million and earnings per share and cash flow effects were not material. 
Selling our Internet Security Business is the right thing to do to align our portfolio to our strategy. And we will continue to look for opportunities to rationalize and focus our resources.
Now let us turn to the fourth quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated, and all results are from continuing operations. During the quarter, we closed a 5-year renewal deal for approximately $500 million, with a large global IT outsourcer. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew low-double digits. Fourth quarter underperformance in EMEA and softness in Japan were offset by growth in each of our other regions. 
Distributed new product sales grew mid-single digits. Driving this, Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, grew low-double digits. Virtualization and Service Automation new sales grew mid-double digits. Service Portfolio Management grew mid-teens, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, sales were flat. Mainframe capacity grew 50%, driven in part by two large public sector transactions.
As always, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio fluctuates, but we do expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow, steady tailwind as we cycle through these renewals. We experienced a double-digit decline in mainframe new product sales, which Bill discussed. 
Excluding the large global IT outsourcer deal we closed in the fourth quarter, renewals were down approximately 15%, more than the 10% we had anticipated at the outset of fiscal 2011. This was primarily due to timing, including a large transaction of over $100 million, which we chose to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Given that we closed the large global IT outsourcer renewal in fiscal year 2011, we currently expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year and down approximately 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. However, we do not focus on the year-over-year comparisons of bookings, as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We managed the aggregate renewal portfolio to optimize the renewal yield, which was in the low 90% range this quarter.
Even with the expected decrease in renewals, we are confident that this is the portfolio we need to achieve our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We do focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. With our highly ratable model, this is another reason we are confident in our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 4% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $12 million. In constant currency, revenue grew 5% in North America, while international revenue grew 2%. Subscription and maintenance revenue was $970 million, up 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $82 million, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $76 million, up 30% in constant currency and 29% as reported.
Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Please note that our fiscal year 2010 fourth quarter included $50 million in nonrecurring restructuring expense. Non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $356 million, up 28% in constant currency and 26% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32% compared to 26% in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 33% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a $0.01 headwind from currency.  Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 29% compared to 28% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year. We continue to refine our tax structure, and are pleased with the progress we are making.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $634 million, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Cash flow was positively affected by a decrease of approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $176 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total billings backlog of $5.2 billion was up 11% in constant currency and 14% as reported. DSOs were down year-over-year.
Turning to both fourth quarter and full year GAAP results. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP operating income was $299 million, up 29% in constant currency and 29% as reported, and GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.37, up 90% in constant currency and 95% as reported. Full year GAAP operating margin was 28%. Full year GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported, while full year GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $1.60, up 12% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 35% compared to 54% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to over $1.6 billion. During the fourth fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of stock for a total of $48 million. Between April 1 and May 6, we accelerated our program, purchasing an incremental 3 million shares of stock for a total of $68 million.
Turning to guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based upon March 31 exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. I would like to highlight that the large global IT outsourcer deal we signed in the fourth quarter renewed the last of our old-business-model contracts. As a result, we will report incremental revenue from the newly signed contract, but not incremental cash flow as we look at 2012.
Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.12 to $2.19. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 11%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in the fiscal year, a flat to 1 point improvement over fiscal year 2011. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 492 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 499 million shares.
Finally, we are committed to holding our non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, which is the combination of improving margins in our core businesses, while continuing to make significant investments in our emerging enterprise and emerging market businesses.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

And I think the market did as well, and so, there were some slowing there. But as we came into the fourth quarter, we did see a significant uplift on that. However, even as we talk about that, one of the things you need to recall or remember is that while that capacity growth is growing off of maybe the zSeries introduction, it's buffered somewhat by our renewal portfolio.

And we were very encouraged what we saw last September with the new platform announcement. And our investments continue to reinforce to us that this is a platform that will play an important role going forward. So with our Mainframe Software Manager, our first role of course, we are encouraged by our competitiveness in the marketplace. As Bill commented, our new product sales around the mainframe were and are impacted by the available renewal portfolio, which was lower in FY '11. And with that said, we saw strong capacity, which I think is encouraging. For what we're seeing, we saw some large transactions during the year. And importantly, we're starting to see momentum in our competitive win back program. We had 15 competitive replacements where we went in and replaced our competitors across the board with our mainframe technology.

Focus for year '11 and fiscal year '12 were really investment years. And so what you see is a buildup in disbursements as we really decide those areas, those you heard Bill mentioned, emerging markets and some emerging enterprises, were really quite great opportunities. Then you heard him mention what's going on in Nimsoft. And so that was -- that will continue in fiscal year '12, and we believe that's absolutely the right thing to do. The second, you saw in fiscal '11, improved cash taxes. We are quite encouraged by our ability to reduce our effective tax rate. This means over time, this will translate into lower cash taxes, but that will be delayed and it will be lumpy. As you saw in both fiscal year '11 and we'll see in fiscal year '12. We are encouraged in fiscal year '11, we were able to defer taxes, which is always a good thing. On fiscal year '12, we'll have a little bit more cashes -- cash taxes. But over the long term, we believe our cash taxes will be a very positive tailwind for CFFO [cash flow from operations] after fiscal year '12. And the last thing is a point, I think it was mentioned on the old-business model, that though we're getting more revenues, the cash stays about the same. To put all those three points together, and we believe we have very strong facts for the years going out, and that is why we're confident in increasing our commitment to share repurchase and dividends, which we announced today."

This is one we spent a lot of time on ourselves, because it's the decisions we make on how we literally need to run this company taking it forward. There's about 2 points of margin that's tied up in the acquisitions piece last year and this year. So we're driving efficiencies in this business as we do that. The other thing is as we've increased these sales and new products, as you always see in new sales and new technologies entering, they commit at a little less margin. And so that works in and works through as you go in time. But I think we all expect and do see that those new sales do, in fact, affect the margin piece as we build this new technology. But that's one of the reasons why we really made the announcement. You mentioned the buyback and the dividend increases because we've got a great deal of confidence, we'd returned that to shareholders. But then the second thing that we announced there, I think, is very important. That's why we're going to do the segmentations, start it with first quarter. It's going to give you a better look inside of this company so that you can see what we're seeing, because I thought -- apparently, now you'll start seeing it in the first quarter."

We continue to invest in our new Mainframe Software Manager applications, our course rolls. We announced our DB2 roll towards the end of last year.

More than that, I have learned last year that I can't guide changed quarter, but we are managing these renewal portfolio to good transactions for our customers and appropriate yields, renewal yields for ourselves.

Before we begin, and as you may have read in the press release this afternoon, Nancy Cooper is retiring. I expect to announce her replacement very soon and she has agreed to stay in her role until I have announced her replacement. On behalf of the CA Technologies team, I thank Nancy for her continued service and her contributions.
And now, let me review our results and outlook. As we said at the beginning of the year, fiscal year 2011 was both a growth and investment year. These investments have driven strength and improvements in many areas. We set out to accomplish a great deal this year, and we did what we set out to do. We also had some challenges in some products and in EMEA. We are addressing them head-on, and are still making good overall progress as a company. And the guidance we are providing this afternoon shows that we expect fiscal year 2012 to be even stronger than 2011. 
Our strategy is the right one, and it's working. That is focusing on mainframe, distributed, cloud and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Our vendor-agnostic approach is what customers tell me they need and are buying. No one else can claim the breadth of our solutions. We are investing in geographic expansion and in new account acquisition through business partners. Both are gaining traction. In fact, just last week, we announced a strategic initiative with VCE, the virtual computing environment company. In addition, CA Technologies was named by HP as a Strategic AllianceOne Partner. Our two companies will work together on expanding routes to market and joint development projects. More details will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Last week, we also hosted more than 130 executives from 98 partner organizations worldwide at our Partner Summit in New York City. And what I'm hearing from our partners is they see a new level of commitment and focus on our mutual success. We have effectively integrated our acquisitions, and we are now investing in them to accelerate growth. 
For example, during the fourth quarter, we invested an incremental $14 million or $0.02 of earnings per share. This included almost doubling the number of employees at Nimsoft and integrating new technologies. We combined Inteq service desk with Nimsoft monitoring, which has created the first integrated IT management-as-a-service solution called Nimsoft Unified Manager. We are also rationalizing our business, including this afternoon's announcement that we've reached an agreement to sell our Internet Security business to Updata Partners. These actions further focus our resources on areas of strategic importance to CA Technologies.
In addition, our focus on improving our management systems have given us the ability to address business opportunities more quickly than even a year ago. This improved execution ability translated into financial results in fiscal year 2011.
Let me summarize our full year results from continuing operations, all of which are within our guidance ranges. Revenue was $4.4 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 5% as reported. Approximately half of this revenue growth was organic. We held full year non-GAAP operating margins flat, while we made significant investments in the business especially in the last quarter.
We grew our non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.92, up 13% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Fiscal year 2011 cash flow benefited from lower year-over-year cash taxes, offset by investments related to our acquisitions. 
Finally, total revenue backlog reached a record $8.8 billion, up 6% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Our current revenue backlog grew 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported.
We believe, as we stated all year, that current revenue backlog is a positive indicator of our future revenue growth and lays a foundation for fiscal 2012. In fact, our outlook for fiscal 2012 shows even greater revenue growth than last year.
We expect revenue to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. We are committed to holding non-GAAP operating margins at 34%, while investing more in emerging enterprises and markets this year than last. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 6% to 10% in constant currency. Cash flow is expected to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency, reflecting investments in emerging enterprises and markets.
In addition, our board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase, bringing the total available for repurchase to approximately $700 million. We have also announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. And finally, we are in the process of reorganizing our internal management reporting, and will change our segment disclosure in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.  This will provide better visibility to our business and the progress we are making against our strategy. 
From a full year new product perspective, total new product sales and mainframe capacity increased in the low-single digits. I am confident we can do better. Within this, however, we grew our distributed new product portfolio more than 15% year-over-year. This was led by double-digit growth in new product sales of Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, Virtualization and Service Automation and Service Portfolio Management, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, grew high-single digits. These are the areas of our strategic focus for our company. 
This growth in distributed new product sales was offset by mainframe new product and capacity sales, which were down approximately 25%. Mainframe performance is linked to the size and customer mix in our renewal portfolio, which fluctuates quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. As you know, our renewals were back-end loaded in fiscal 2011. And in the fourth quarter, capacity grew 50% year-over-year, the highest amount in 15 quarters. We are also beginning to see success with our new competitive replacement program, which launched in the second quarter, closing over 15 replacements in the last 9 months of the year.
In fiscal year 2012, we are continuing to focus on delivering new innovation, strengthening our sales coverage model and making it even easier for customers to move to our full portfolio of solutions.
This afternoon, we are pleased to announce the addition of Peter Griffiths, who will be joining us at the end of May to lead our Technology and Development Group. Peter brings extensive software development and business management expertise from his roles at IBM, Cognos and Relational Matters. Peter will drive initiatives to enhance our product positioning and thought leadership in the technology community.
From a geographic perspective, full year North American revenue grew 7% year-over-year in constant currency, while EMEA's growth is not as strong as we would like. We knew that a turnaround in this region was going to be slow, but it is going slower than I expected, and I am not satisfied with that.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are investing in EMEA, changing the go-to-market model and building new channel relationships. These are long-term initiatives, and will take quarters, not months. I am convinced we have the right personnel in place and are focused on the right priorities, accelerating new product sales and accessing new accounts.
On the positive side, our fourth quarter renewal yield in EMEA was in line with other regions. However, the renewal portfolio was much lighter in fiscal '11 than the previous year and will be again next year. And we did not leverage newly acquired technologies as successfully as we did in other regions. 
As I've said, we met the companywide growth targets we indicated at the beginning of the year in spite of the weakness in EMEA. And I am confident that the changes that we made last year were the right ones, and that they will work.
And now, let me turn the call over to Nancy to provide more detail."
262913,129806608,2482950,"CA Technologies, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 12, 2011",2011-05-12,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we announced an agreement to sell our Internet Security Business. This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results.

This is reflected as discontinued operations in this afternoon's financial results. To help you understand the effect of our discontinued operations, a table is available at investor.ca.com for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009. The incremental adjustments for the Internet Security Business full year fiscal 2011 are the following: revenue was reduced by $83 million; operating income decreased by $15 million; earnings per share decreased by $0.02; and cash flow decreased by $4 million. For the fourth quarter, revenue was reduced by $18 million, operating income decreased by $1 million and earnings per share and cash flow effects were not material. 
Selling our Internet Security Business is the right thing to do to align our portfolio to our strategy. And we will continue to look for opportunities to rationalize and focus our resources.
Now let us turn to the fourth quarter results. Please note that all our growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated, and all results are from continuing operations. During the quarter, we closed a 5-year renewal deal for approximately $500 million, with a large global IT outsourcer. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew low-double digits. Fourth quarter underperformance in EMEA and softness in Japan were offset by growth in each of our other regions. 
Distributed new product sales grew mid-single digits. Driving this, Service Assurance, including Nimsoft, grew low-double digits. Virtualization and Service Automation new sales grew mid-double digits. Service Portfolio Management grew mid-teens, while Identity and Access Management, including Arcot, sales were flat. Mainframe capacity grew 50%, driven in part by two large public sector transactions.
As always, the size and timing of the underlying renewal portfolio fluctuates, but we do expect the new IBM mainframe to be a slow, steady tailwind as we cycle through these renewals. We experienced a double-digit decline in mainframe new product sales, which Bill discussed. 
Excluding the large global IT outsourcer deal we closed in the fourth quarter, renewals were down approximately 15%, more than the 10% we had anticipated at the outset of fiscal 2011. This was primarily due to timing, including a large transaction of over $100 million, which we chose to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Given that we closed the large global IT outsourcer renewal in fiscal year 2011, we currently expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be down approximately 20% year-over-year and down approximately 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. However, we do not focus on the year-over-year comparisons of bookings, as they are not indicative of the overall health of our business. We managed the aggregate renewal portfolio to optimize the renewal yield, which was in the low 90% range this quarter.
Even with the expected decrease in renewals, we are confident that this is the portfolio we need to achieve our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We do focus on current revenue backlog, which was $3.7 billion, up 5% in constant currency and 7% as reported. With our highly ratable model, this is another reason we are confident in our fiscal year 2012 revenue guidance.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and grew 4% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $12 million. In constant currency, revenue grew 5% in North America, while international revenue grew 2%. Subscription and maintenance revenue was $970 million, up 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $82 million, up 6% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $76 million, up 30% in constant currency and 29% as reported.
Now let me turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Please note that our fiscal year 2010 fourth quarter included $50 million in nonrecurring restructuring expense. Non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $356 million, up 28% in constant currency and 26% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 32% compared to 26% in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48, up 33% in constant currency and 30% as reported, including a $0.01 headwind from currency.  Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 29% compared to 28% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year. We continue to refine our tax structure, and are pleased with the progress we are making.
Turning to cash flow from operations in the quarter, which was $634 million, up 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Cash flow was positively affected by a decrease of approximately $70 million in cash taxes. Single installment payments were $176 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Total billings backlog of $5.2 billion was up 11% in constant currency and 14% as reported. DSOs were down year-over-year.
Turning to both fourth quarter and full year GAAP results. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP operating income was $299 million, up 29% in constant currency and 29% as reported, and GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $0.37, up 90% in constant currency and 95% as reported. Full year GAAP operating margin was 28%. Full year GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported, while full year GAAP earnings per diluted common share was $1.60, up 12% in constant currency and 10% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 35% compared to 54% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 32% compared to 34% last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to over $1.6 billion. During the fourth fiscal quarter, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of stock for a total of $48 million. Between April 1 and May 6, we accelerated our program, purchasing an incremental 3 million shares of stock for a total of $68 million.
Turning to guidance. As been our practice, guidance is based upon March 31 exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. I would like to highlight that the large global IT outsourcer deal we signed in the fourth quarter renewed the last of our old-business-model contracts. As a result, we will report incremental revenue from the newly signed contract, but not incremental cash flow as we look at 2012.
Guidance is the following. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.12 to $2.19. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 6% to 11%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.86. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 3% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 31% to 32% in the fiscal year, a flat to 1 point improvement over fiscal year 2011. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 492 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 499 million shares.
Finally, we are committed to holding our non-GAAP operating margin at 34%, which is the combination of improving margins in our core businesses, while continuing to make significant investments in our emerging enterprise and emerging market businesses.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Bill."

And with that said, we saw strong capacity, which I think is encouraging. For what we're seeing, we saw some large transactions during the year. And importantly, we're starting to see momentum in our competitive win back program.

Focus for year '11 and fiscal year '12 were really investment years. And so what you see is a buildup in disbursements as we really decide those areas, those you heard Bill mentioned, emerging markets and some emerging enterprises, were really quite great opportunities. Then you heard him mention what's going on in Nimsoft. And so that was -- that will continue in fiscal year '12, and we believe that's absolutely the right thing to do. The second, you saw in fiscal '11, improved cash taxes. We are quite encouraged by our ability to reduce our effective tax rate. This means over time, this will translate into lower cash taxes, but that will be delayed and it will be lumpy. As you saw in both fiscal year '11 and we'll see in fiscal year '12. We are encouraged in fiscal year '11, we were able to defer taxes, which is always a good thing. On fiscal year '12, we'll have a little bit more cashes -- cash taxes. But over the long term, we believe our cash taxes will be a very positive tailwind for CFFO [cash flow from operations] after fiscal year '12. And the last thing is a point, I think it was mentioned on the old-business model, that though we're getting more revenues, the cash stays about the same. To put all those three points together, and we believe we have very strong facts for the years going out, and that is why we're confident in increasing our commitment to share repurchase and dividends, which we announced today."

The other thing is as we've increased these sales and new products, as you always see in new sales and new technologies entering, they commit at a little less margin. And so that works in and works through as you go in time. But I think we all expect and do see that those new sales do, in fact, affect the margin piece as we build this new technology.

The other thing I'd ask you to think about is we did 5-or-more year renewals in fiscal year '08 and '09. So basically, we've changed the shape of our available renewal inventory and moved it out into more of the fiscal year '14-and-out timeframe. More than that, I have learned last year that I can't guide changed quarter, but we are managing these renewal portfolio to good transactions for our customers and appropriate yields, renewal yields for ourselves. And that will move renewal either in, because the customer wants it, or out, because it's better for us to negotiate that way. We are highly encouraged by our revenue backlog, which has a 6% growth and a 5% constant currency growth in the current portion."

All of those measures are in double digit around the rest of the world with EMEA pulled out. So it demonstrates that, in fact, that the strategy is selling, and it's selling in a double-digit areas.
