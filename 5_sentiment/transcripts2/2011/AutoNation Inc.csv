Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 for the fourth quarter, a 55% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.29 for the same period in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2010 r",343,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 for the fourth quarter, a 55% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.29 for the same period in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.2 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 16%, driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail sales increased 6% based on CNW Research Data. 
In comparison, during the same period, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 15% or 12% on a same-store basis. 
For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.56 was a record, up 36% over prior year. Revenue for the full year was up 17% over prior year. This morning, we reported our January new vehicle retail sales which increased 24% continuing to demonstrate that the auto industry recovery is solidly underway. The January seasonally adjusted annual rate was $12,600,000, which was the highest since Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September of '08 excluding Cash for Clunkers. 
We continue to see strength in Domestic sales which were up 40%. Imports increased 23% and Premium Luxury was up 5%. During the downturn, our aggressive cost reduction in Asset Management strategies resulted in a lower cost structure and more efficient inventory management. We continue to invest in our stores and in our share service center, where we centralized our store level accounting and administrative activities. We also selectively added to our portfolio by acquiring several new stores, including our announcement today that we've entered into an agreement to acquire one of the country's largest Toyota store Ft. Myers to Florida on the West Coast of Florida. 
AutoNation has an optimal brand and market mix that positions us for strong performance in new vehicle sales as the market rebounds. We have been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform in what we expect to be a multiyear recovery in auto retail. Thank you very much. 
Turning it over to Mr. Short."

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $68 million or $0.45 per share versus $50 million or $0.29 per share during the fourth quarter of 2009, a 55% impro",732,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $68 million or $0.45 per share versus $50 million or $0.29 per share during the fourth quarter of 2009, a 55% improvement on a per-share basis. 
During the third quarter of 2010 conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $20 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the next two to three quarters, primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previous sold. 
In Q4, operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $11.8 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize an additional favorable impact of approximately $9 million in operating income related to these incentives over the next two quarters. 
Our fourth quarter 2009 results excluding the favorable tax adjustment of $12.7 million or $0.07 per share and there were no adjusting items in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $1.56 compared to $1.15 in the prior year. The adjustments to net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased $452.2 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved $71.4 million or 15%, while SG&A was up $32.5 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.1% for the quarter. This benefited from an improved gross profit due to the manufacturer incentives previously mentioned. Excluding that impact, SG&A's percentage of gross profit would have been in line with third quarter of 2010 and approximately 240 basis points lower than Q4 of prior year. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $2.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.5 million from the $4.3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of last year due primarily to higher average floorplan balances during the quarter. 
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from the $10.2 million we reported in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to our refinancing which closed in April 2010. Our percentage of fixed rate debt was 33% prior to insurance compared to 47% at the end of the fourth quarter. Refinancing also increased the pricing under our revolver and term loan facilities from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points. 
During the quarter, we paid down $30 million under our revolving credit facility resulting in $180 million of outstanding borrowings on our revolver at the end of the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.349 billion, an increase of $236 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 but a decrease of $32 million compared with the third quarter of 2010. 
LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $41 million or 37.7%. This reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 731,000 shares or $17 million at an average price of $23.38. For the full year, we repurchased 26.6 million shares for $524 million at an average price of $19.70. We ended the fourth quarter with 148.4 million shares outstanding and $233 million of Board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter excluding operating lease buyouts was $72.7 million, resulting in full year 2010 capital expenditures of $150 million net of operating lease buyouts as we continue to invest in our facilities. For 2011, we expect CapEx to be approximately $140 million excluding proceeds from remaining asset sales. 
Floorplan debt was approximately $1.9 billion at quarter end, up approximately $233 million from September 30, 2010 and in line with inventory levels. Our balance sheet continues to be industry-leading and we remained well within the limits of our financial covenants. 
Our leverage ratio was 2.41x at the end of the quarter compared to the limit of 3.25x. Our quarter end cash balance was $95 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in healthy total liquidity of over $550 million at the end of December. 
Our cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet and streamlined cost structure, positioned the company to continue to benefit from the improving SAR and to maximize the value of the company and shareholder returns. 
Let me now turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,118705130,98624,"AutoNation Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our entire team is committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers. And in 2010, we did just that. We are very proud of our strong operating results for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2010",1146,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our entire team is committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers. And in 2010, we did just that. We are very proud of our strong operating results for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 that netted an impressive 4.1% operating margin for the quarter and an industry-leading 4% operating margin for the full year. Our performance was achieved with elite levels of CSI, increased associate productivity and the lowest associate turnover in the company's history. 
In the quarter, we grew new vehicle unit volume 15% on a total store basis and 12% for same stores comparing favorably to the industry, which according to CNW, was up 6%. Performance was also impressive for used vehicles where in the quarter we achieved growth of 21% for total stores and 19% for same stores. Contributing to the lift in volume was strong performances in our three largest states of California, Texas and Florida, where our brand mix, locations and operating teams execution were a clear benefit. 
Looking at segment performance. At $122 million total segment income for the fourth quarter grew 42% or $36 million compared to the period a year ago. Segment income for the Domestic segment increased $13 million or 55% to $37 million. Premium Luxury increased $17 million or 36% to $66 million and Import segment income increased $5 million or 11% to $46 million. For the full year 2010, total segment income of $454 million was up $82 million or 22% compared to 2009 with year-over-year growth in all three segments.  As I continue my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. 
In the fourth quarter, AutoNation retailed 52,000 new vehicles, an increase of 5,500 units or 12% compared to the period a year ago. The Domestic segment accounted for just over half of the unit increase driven primarily by Ford where new units sold increased 30%. The Import segment accounted for about 40% of the new unit increase and Premium Luxury accounted for the balance of the increase in volume. 
Gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $129 or 6% to $2,416 per vehicle compared to the period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points to 7.2%. 
Excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, in the quarter, gross profit per new vehicle retail was $2,163 of $124 or 5%. And gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 50 basis points to 6.4%. We attribute this primarily to year-over-year margin compression in the Import segment due in part to increased inventory compared to the post-Cash for Clunkers period a year ago where Import inventory depleted. 
Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, again excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, we were pleased to increase PBR by $168 or 8% with all three segments contributing to the growth. At December 31, our new vehicle day supply was 63 days comparing favorably to the industry at 68 days. And with 48,500 units, our year-end inventory represented what we consider a more normalized level. 
Turning to used vehicles. We delivered a strong 19% growth in used units retail for both the quarter and the full year. Focusing on Q4, retail used vehicle revenue was up 22% on the sale of 38,000 used vehicles with revenue per vehicle up 2% to 17,500. 
Gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,572 increased $80 or 5% with gross profit as a percent of revenue increasing 20 basis points compared to the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.74, up from 0.70 a year ago. And at December 31, our used vehicle day supply was 42 days. 
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value Vehicle Outlets or VVOs, where to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand, we are retailing value-priced vehicles that we would've traditionally wholesaled. In the fourth quarter, VVO sales accounted for 6% of our used vehicle volume and an average selling price of $7,800. Today, we have 19 VVO locations in operation with five more scheduled to open in the third quarter. 
Our Parts, Service and Collision business drove growth both in revenue and gross profit in the quarter. Revenue of $546 million represented an increase of $32 million or 6% with customer pay revenue, warranty and internal all contributing factors. We were very pleased to recognize a 4% increase in customer pay revenue compared to the period a year ago, our strongest performance in three years, as well as an 8% increase in warranty and a 19% increase in internal. 
Service, Parts and Collision Q4 gross profit of $236 million increased $11 million or 5% compared to a year ago, driven by an 11% increase in warranty related to large-scale recalls that were announced earlier in the year and a 13% increase in internal. 
Our FNI team turned in strong results with FNI gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,164, an increase of $36 or 3% compared to a year ago. Our preferred lender network OEM service contract alliances, strong product penetration and strong store-level execution continue to drive our performance in FNI. 
In the quarter, we relocated Mercedes-Benz of Miami, Mercedes-Benz of Southbay in Southern California and BMW Mini of Dallas to brand-new, large facilities. We also opened Peoria, a flagship Audi store in Addpoint in Peoria, Arizona. At December 31, our store portfolio was 206 stores and 242 franchises in 15 states. 
To reconcile the account at the end of Q3 during the fourth quarter, we divested one store with three franchises and terminated seven Pontiac franchises. These actions represented a combined annual revenue run rate of $77 million. And as you now know, we have an agreement to acquire Ft. Myers Toyota on the West Coast of Florida, the 35th largest Toyota store in the nation in 2010, ranked by new vehicle unit sales. We expect this transaction to be completed by the end of the first quarter and look forward to welcoming the store to AutoNation and our Florida region. 
I'd like to note that we have 16 major facility projects slated for completion this year. Six are new stores needed for digital points awarded to us by manufacturers and the remaining 10 will significantly upgrade existing stores or de-greenfield sites. 
Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria. 
In closing, we are very proud of our performance in 2010 and thank each of our 19,000 associates for their contributions. Our formula for success remains continuous improvement of our best practice processes, intense focus on retaining our low-cost base and investing and training and developing our people. We believe these efforts and our store portfolio position us well to take advantage of the improving market. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson"

Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 for the fourth quarter, a 55% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.29 for the same period in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2010 r",343,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 for the fourth quarter, a 55% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.29 for the same period in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.2 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 16%, driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail sales increased 6% based on CNW Research Data. 
In comparison, during the same period, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 15% or 12% on a same-store basis. 
For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.56 was a record, up 36% over prior year. Revenue for the full year was up 17% over prior year. This morning, we reported our January new vehicle retail sales, which increased 24% continuing to demonstrate that the auto industry recovery is solidly underway. The January seasonally adjusted annual rate was $12,600,000, which was the highest since Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September of '08 excluding Cash for Clunkers. 
We continue to see strength in Domestic sales, which were up 40%; Imports increased 23%; and Premium Luxury was up 5%. During the downturn, our aggressive cost reduction in asset management strategies resulted in a lower cost structure and more efficient inventory management. We continue to invest in our stores and in our share service center, where we centralized our store level accounting and administrative activities. We also selectively added to our portfolio by acquiring several new stores, including our announcement today that we've entered into an agreement to acquire one of the country's largest Toyota store, Fort. Myers Toyota on the West Coast of Florida. 
AutoNation has an optimal brand and market mix that positions us for a strong performance in new vehicle sales as the market rebounds. We have been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform in what we expect to be a multiyear recovery in auto retail. Thank you very much. 
Turning it over to Mr. Short."
112302,118705130,98914,"AutoNation Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $68 million or $0.45 per share versus $50 million or $0.29 per share during the fourth quarter of 2009, a 55% improveme",729,"Thanks, Mike, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $68 million or $0.45 per share versus $50 million or $0.29 per share during the fourth quarter of 2009, a 55% improvement on a per-share basis. 
During the third quarter of 2010 conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $20 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the next two to three quarters, primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previously sold. 
In Q4, operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $11.8 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize an additional favorable impact of approximately $9 million in operating income related to these incentives over the next two quarters. 
Our fourth quarter 2009 results excluding the favorable tax adjustment of $12.7 million or $0.07 per share and there were no adjusting items in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $1.56 compared to $1.15 in the prior year. Adjustments to net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased $452.2 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved $71.4 million or 15%, while SG&A was up $32.5 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.1% for the quarter. This benefited from an improved gross profit due to the manufacture incentives previously mentioned. Excluding that impact, SG&A as percentage of gross profit would have been in line with third quarter of 2010 and approximately 240 basis points lower than Q4 of prior year. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $2.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.5 million from the $4.3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of last year, due primarily to higher average floorplan balances during the quarter. 
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from the $10.2 million we reported in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to our refinancing which closed in April 2010. Our percentage of fixed rate debt was 33% prior to insurance compared to 47% at the end of the fourth quarter. Refinancing also increased the pricing under our revolver and term loan facilities from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points. 
During the quarter, we paid down $30 million under our revolving credit facility resulting in $180 million of outstanding borrowings on our revolver at the end of the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.349 billion, an increase of $236 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, but a decrease of $32 million compared with the third quarter of 2010. 
LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $41 million or 37.7%. This reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 731,000 shares or $17 million at an average price of $23.38. For the full year, we repurchased 26.6 million shares for $524 million at an average price of $19.70. We ended the fourth quarter with 148.4 million shares outstanding and $233 million of Board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter excluding operating lease buy-outs were $72.7 million, resulting in full-year 2010 capital expenditures of $150 million net of operating lease buy-outs as we continue to invest in our facilities. For 2011, we expect CapEx to be approximately $140 million, excluding proceeds from remaining asset sales. 
Floorplan debt was approximately $1.9 billion at quarter end, up approximately $233 million from September 30, 2010 and in line with inventory levels. Our balance sheet continues to be industry-leading and we remained well within the limits of our financial covenants. 
Our leverage ratio was 2.41x at the end of the quarter compared to the limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $95 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in healthy total liquidity of over $550 million at the end of December. 
Our cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet and streamlined cost structure, positioned the company to continue to benefit from the improving SAAR and to maximize the value of the company and shareholder returns. 
Let me now turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,118705130,98914,"AutoNation Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our entire team is committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers. And in 2010, we did just that. We are very proud of our strong operating results for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2010",1150,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our entire team is committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers. And in 2010, we did just that. We are very proud of our strong operating results for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2010 that netted an impressive 4.1% operating margin for the quarter and an industry-leading 4% operating margin for the full year. Our performance was achieved with elite levels of CSI, increased associate productivity and the lowest associate turnover in the company's history. 
In the quarter, we grew new vehicle unit volume 15% on a total store basis and 12% for same stores comparing favorably to the industry, which according to CNW, was up 6%. Performance was also impressive for used vehicles, where in the quarter we achieved growth of 21% for total stores and 19% for same stores. Contributing to the lift in volume was strong performances in our three largest states of California, Texas and Florida, where our brand mix, locations and operating teams execution were a clear benefit. 
Looking at segment performance. At $122 million, total segment income for the fourth quarter grew 42% or $36 million compared to the period a year ago. Segment income for the Domestic segment increased $13 million or 55% to $37 million. Premium Luxury increased $17 million or 36% to $66 million, and Import segment income increased $5 million or 11% to $46 million. For the full-year 2010, total segment income of $454 million was up $82 million or 22% compared to 2009, with year over year growth in all three segments. As I continue my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. 
In the fourth quarter, AutoNation retailed 52,000 new vehicles, an increase of 5,500 units or 12% compared to the period a year ago. The Domestic segment accounted for just over half of the unit increase driven primarily by Ford, where new units sold increased 30%. The Import segment accounted for about 40% of the new unit increase and Premium Luxury accounted for the balance of the increase in volume. 
Gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $129 or 6% to $2,416 per vehicle compared to the period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points to 7.2%. 
Excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, in the quarter, gross profit per new vehicle retail was $2,163, up $124 or 5%. And gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 50 basis points to 6.4%. We attribute this primarily to year-over-year margin compression in the Import segment, due in part to increased inventory compared to the post-Cash for Clunkers period a year ago where Import inventory was depleted. 
Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, again excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, we were pleased to increase PVR by $168 or 8% with all three segments contributing to the growth. At December 31, our new vehicle day supply was 63 days comparing favorably to the industry at 68 days. And with 48,500 units, our year-end inventory represented what we consider a more normalized level. 
Turning to used vehicles. We delivered a strong 19% growth in used units retail for both the quarter and the full year. Focusing on Q4, retail used vehicle revenue was up 22% on the sale of 38,000 used vehicles with revenue per vehicle up 2% to 17,500. 
Gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,572 increased $80 or 5% with gross profit as a percent of revenue increasing 20 basis points compared to the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.74, up from 0.70 a year ago. And at December 31, our used vehicle day supply was 42 days. 
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value Vehicle Outlets or VVOs, where to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand, we are retailing value-priced vehicles that we would've traditionally wholesaled. In the fourth quarter, VVO sales accounted for 6% of our used vehicle volume in an average selling price of $7,800. Today, we have 19 VVO locations in operation with five more scheduled to open in the current quarter. 
Our Parts, Service and Collision business drove growth in both revenue and gross profit in the quarter. Revenue of $546 million represented an increase of $32 million or 6% with customer pay revenue, warranty and internal all contributing factors. We were very pleased to recognize a 4% increase in customer pay revenue compared to the period a year ago, our strongest performance in three years, as well as an 8% increase in warranty and a 19% increase in internal. 
Service, Parts and Collision Q4 gross profit of $236 million increased $11 million or 5% compared to a year ago, driven by an 11% increase in warranty related to large-scale recalls that were announced earlier in the year and a 13% increase in internal. 
Our F&I team turned in strong results with F&I gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,164, an increase of $36 or 3% compared to a year ago. Our preferred lender network, OEM service contract alliances, strong product penetration and strong store-level execution continue to drive our performance in F&I. 
In the quarter, we relocated Mercedes-Benz of Miami, Mercedes-Benz of Southbay in Southern California and BMW Mini of Dallas to brand-new, large facilities. We also opened Audi Peoria, a flagship Audi store in Addpoint [ph] in Peoria, Arizona. At December 31, our store portfolio was 206 stores and 242 franchises in 15 states. 
To reconcile the account at the end of Q3 during the fourth quarter, we divested one store with three franchises and terminated seven Pontiac franchises. These actions represented a combined annual revenue run rate of $77 million. And as you now know, we have an agreement to acquire Fort. Myers Toyota on the West Coast of Florida, the 35th largest Toyota store in the nation in 2010, ranked by new vehicle unit sales. We expect this transaction to be completed by the end of the first quarter and look forward to welcoming the store to AutoNation and our Florida region. 
I'd like to note that we have 16 major facility projects slated for completion this year. Six are new stores needed for additional points awarded to us by manufacturers and the remaining 10 will significantly upgrade existing stores or via greenfield sites. 
Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria. 
In closing, we are very proud of our performance in 2010 and thank each of our 19,000 associates for their contributions. Our formula for success remains continuous improvement of our best practice processes, intense focus on retaining our low-cost base and investing in training and developing our people. We believe these efforts and our store portfolio position us well to take advantage of the improving market. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson"

Today, we reported adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 for the fourth quarter, a 55% increase on a per share basis as compared to $0.29 for the same period in the prior year.
Fourth quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.2 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 16% driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the fourth quarter, total US industry new vehicle retail sales increased 6%, based on CNW Research Data. In comparison during the same period, AutoNation’s new vehicle unit sales increased 15% or 12% on the same store basis. For the full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.56 was a record up 36% over prior year. Revenue for the full year was up 17% over prior year.
This morning we reported our January new vehicle retail sales which increased 24% continuing to demonstrate at the auto industry recovery is solidly underway. The January seasonally adjusted annual rate was $12,600,000 which was a highest since Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September of ’08 excluding cash for [indiscernible]. We continue to see strength in domestic sales which were up 40% in imports increased 23% and premium luxury was up 5%.
During the downturn our aggressive cost reduction and asset management strategies resulted in a lower cost structure of more recession inventory management. We continue to invest in our stores and our share service center where we centralized our store level accounting administrative activities. We also selectively added to our portfolio by acquiring several new stores including our announcement today that we’ve entered in to an agreement to acquire one of the country’s largest Toyota store Ft. Myers Toyota on the west coast of Florida.
AutoNation has an optimal brand and market mix that position us we’re strong performance in new vehicle sales as the market rebound. We have been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform in what we expect to be a multiyear recovery in auto retail.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the fourth quarter reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $68 million, or $0.45 per share, versus $50 million or $0.29 per share during the fourth quarter of 2009, a 55% improvement on a per share basis.
During third quarter 2010 conference call we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $20 million in performance based manufacturer incentives over the next two to three quarters. Primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold.
In Q4 operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $11.8 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize an additional favorable impact of approximately $9 million in operating income related to these incentives over the next two quarters.
Our fourth quarter 2009 results excluded the favorable tax adjustment of $12.7 million or $0.07 per share and there are no adjusting items in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year our adjusted EPS was $1.56 compared to a $1.15 in the prior year. Adjustments for that the net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release.
Fourth quarter revenue increased $452.2 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved $71.4 million or 15%, while SG&A was up $32.5 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.1% for the quarter, this benefited from an improved gross profit due to manufacturer incentives previously mentioned. Excluding that impact SG&A as a percentage of gross profit would have been in line with third quarter of 2010 an approximately 240 basis points lower than Q4 of prior year.
Net new vehicle floor plan was a benefit of $2.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.5 million from $4.3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of last year due primarily to higher average floor plan balances during the quarter.
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from the $10.2 million we reported in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to our refinancing which closed in April 2010.
Our percentage of fixed rate debt was 33% prior to issuance compared to 47% at the end of the fourth quarter. Refinancing also increase the pricing under our revolver and term loan facilities from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points.
During the quarter paid down $30 million under our revolving credit facility resulting in $118 million of outstanding borrowings on our revolver at the end of the fourth quarter.
Our fourth quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.349 billion an increase of $236 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, but a decrease of $32 million compared with the third quarter of 2010. LIBOR rates are relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.
Provision for income tax in the quarter was $41 million or 37.7% this reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 731,000 shares for $17 million at an average price of $23.38. For the full year we repurchased 26.6 million shares for $524 million at an average price of $19.70.
We ended the fourth quarter with the 148.4 million shares outstanding and $233 million of bond authorization remaining for future share repurchases.
Capital expenditures for the quarter excluding operating lease buy-outs were $72.7 million resulting in full year 2010 capital expenditures of $150 million net of operating lease buy-outs as we continue to invest in our facilities.
For 2011 we expect CapEx to be approximately $140 million excluding proceeds from related asset sales. Floor plan that was approximately $1.9 billion at quarter end up approximately $233 million from September 30, 2010, and in line with inventory levels.
Our balance sheet continues to be industry leading and we remain well within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio was 2.41 times at the end of the quarter compared to the limit of 3.25 times. Our quarter end cash balance was $95 million which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in healthy total liquidity of over $550 million at the end of December.
Our cash flow generation combined with our strong balance sheet and streamline cost structure position the company to continue to benefit from the improving are to maximize the value of the company and shareholders returns.

Our entire team is committed outperforming the market the economy recovers and in 2010 we did that just that. We are very proud of our strong operating results for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 that netted in an impressive 4.1% operating margin for the quarter and an industry leading 4% operating margin for the full year.
Our performance was achieve with elite levels of CSI, increased associate productivity in the lowest associate turnover in the company’s history. In the quarter, we grew new vehicle unit volume 15% on a total store basis and12% for same store comparing favorably to the industry which according to CNW was up 6%. Performance was also impressive for used vehicles we are in the quarter we achieved growth of 21% for total stores and 19% for same stores.
Contributing to the lift in volume was strong performances in our three largest states of California, Texas and Florida. Where our brand mix, locations and operating teams execution were a clear benefit.
Looking at segment performance, we did $122 million total segment income for the fourth quarter grew 42% or $36 million compared to the period year ago. Segment income for the domestic segment increased $30 million or 55% to $37 million premium luxury increased $70 million or 36% to $66 million, and import segment income increased $5 million or 11% to $46 million. For the full year 2010 total segment income of $454 million was up $82 million or 22% compared to 2009 with year-over-year growth in all three segments.
As I continue, my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. In the fourth quarter AutoNation retailed 52,000 new vehicles, an increase of 5,500 units or 12% compared to the period of a year-ago, the domestic segment accounted for just over half of the unit increase driven primarily by Ford where new unit sold increased 30%. The import segment accounted for about 40% of the new unit increase and premium luxury accounted for the balance of the increase in volume.
Gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $129 or 6% to $2,416 per vehicle compared to the period of a year-ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points to 7.2%. Excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives in the quarter gross profit for new vehicle retail was $2,163 up $124 or 5%. And gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 50 basis points to 6.4%. We attribute primarily to year-over-year margin compression in the import segment due in part to increased inventory compared to the post cash for clunkers period a year-ago where import inventory was completed.
Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4 again, excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives we are pleased to increase PVR by $168 or 8% with all three segments contributing to the growth. At December 31st our new vehicle day supply was 63 days comparing favorably to the industry at 68 days and with 48,500 units are yearend inventory represented what we consider a more normalized level.
Turing to used vehicles we delivered a strong 19% growth in the used units retail for both quarter and the full year, focusing on Q4 retail used vehicle was up 22% on the sale of 38,000 used vehicles with revenue per vehicle up 2% to 17,500.
Gross profit for vehicle retail of $1,572 increased $80 or 5% which gross profit as a percent of revenue increasing 20 basis points compared to the period a year-ago.
Our used to new ratio in the question was 0.74 up from 0.70 a year-ago and at December 31st our used vehicle day supply was 42 days. I would like to provide a quick update on our value vehicle outlets or VVOs where to address industry supply constrains and meet market demand we are retailing value priced vehicles that we would have traditionally wholesale.
In the fourth quarter VVO sales accounted for 6% of our used vehicle volume a then average selling price of $7,800. Today we have 19 VVO locations in operation we have five more schedule to open in the current quarter.
Our part service and collision business drove growth in both revenue and gross profit in the quarter revenue up $546 million represented an increase of $32 million or 6% with customer pay revenue warranty and internal all contributing factors. We are very pleased to recognize a 4% increase in customer pay revenue compared to the period a year-ago our strongest performance in three years. As well as an 8% increase in warranty and a 19% increase internal.
Service parts and collision Q4 gross profit of $236 million increased $11 million or 5% compared to a year-ago driven by an 11% increase in warranty related the large scale recalls that we’re announced earlier in the year and a 13% increase internal.
Our F&I team turned in strong results with F&I gross profit for vehicle retail of $1,164 an increase of $36 or 3% compared to a year-ago. Our preferred lender network OEMs service contract alliances strong product penetration and strong store level execution continue to drive our performance in F&I.
In the quarter we relocated Mercedes Benz of Miami, Mercedes Benz of South Bay in Southern California, and BMW MINI of Dallas to brand-new large facility. We also open Audi Peoria a lightship Audi store in [indiscernible] Peoria Arizona.
At December 31, our store portfolio was 206 stores and 242 franchises in 15 states. To reconcile the accounted at the end of Q3 during the fourth quarter we divested one store and three franchises and terminated seven [indiscernible] franchises.
This action represented a combined annual revenue run rate of 77 million and as now you know we have an agreement to acquire Ft. Myers Toyota on the west coast of Florida the 35 largest Toyota store in nation in 2010 ranked by new vehicle unit sales. We expect this transition to be completed by the end of the first quarter and look forward to welcoming this store to AutoNation and to our Florida region.
I like to note that we have 16 major facility projects waited for completion this year, six are new stores needed for additional points awarded to us by manufacturers and the remaining 10 will significantly upgrade existing stores or be Greenfield sites. Looking ahead we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria.
Inclosing we are very proud of our performance in 2010 and thank each of our 19,000 associates for their contributions, our formula for success remains continues improvement of our best practice processes, intense focus on retaining our low cost base and investment and training and developing our people. We believe these efforts and our store portfolio position us well to take advantage of an improving market.
With that I’ll turn the call over back to Mike Jackson.

I think made one a regular basis, with Alan, Ackerson and Sergio and this is the most remarkable thing I see at the top of these companies, there were feeling of never again, these are smartweed businessman they were in this together return on the capital, and produce sustainable profits and they know they have to produce vehicle the people actually want to buy for that to happen.

Mike Jackson
I think in terms of the overall cost structure. We did a lot of heavy lifting in the end of ’07 and early ’08 timeframe to take out the structural of cost. We [indiscernible] invest in productivity enhancing initiatives our share service center being probably the best example of that. And we’re going to continue to do that. So overtime we look for continued opting leverage in the business. We have an SG&A as percentage of gross profit below 70% at point in the past and there is easy go for us out there in the future.

Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 for the fourth quarter, a 55% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.29 for the same period in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.2 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 16%, driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail sales increased 6% based on CNW Research Data. 
In comparison, during the same period, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 15% or 12% on a same-store basis. 
For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.56 was a record, up 36% over prior year. Revenue for the full year was up 17% over prior year. This morning, we reported our January new vehicle retail sales, which increased 24%, continuing to demonstrate that the auto industry recovery is solidly underway. The January seasonally adjusted annual rate was $12,600,000, which was the highest since Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September of '08 excluding Cash for Clunkers. 
We continue to see strength in Domestic sales, which were up 40%; Imports increased 23%; and Premium Luxury was up 5%. During the downturn, our aggressive cost reduction in asset management strategies resulted in a lower cost structure and more efficient inventory management. We continue to invest in our stores and in our share service center, where we centralized our store level accounting and administrative activities. We also selectively added to our portfolio by acquiring several new stores, including our announcement today that we've entered into an agreement to acquire one of the country's largest Toyota store, Fort Myers Toyota on the West Coast of Florida.
AutoNation has an optimal brand and market mix that positions us for a strong performance in new vehicle sales as the market rebounds. We have been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform in what we expect to be a multiyear recovery in auto retail. Thank you very much.

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $68 million or $0.45 per share versus $50 million or $0.29 per share during the fourth quarter of 2009, a 55% improvement on a per-share basis. 
During the third quarter of 2010 conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $20 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the next two to three quarters, primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previously sold. 
In Q4, operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $11.8 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize an additional favorable impact of approximately $9 million in operating income related to these incentives over the next two quarters. 
Our fourth quarter 2009 results excluding the favorable tax adjustment of $12.7 million or $0.07 per share, and there were no adjusting items in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $1.56 compared to $1.15 in the prior year. Adjustments to net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased $452.2 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved $71.4 million or 15%, while SG&A was up $32.5 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.1% for the quarter. This benefited from an improved gross profit due to the manufacture incentives previously mentioned. Excluding that impact, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit would have been in line with third quarter of 2010 and approximately 240 basis points lower than Q4 of prior year.
Net new vehicle floor plan was a benefit of $2.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.5 million from the $4.3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of last year, due primarily to higher average floor plan balances during the quarter. 
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from the $10.2 million we reported in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to our refinancing which closed in April 2010. Our percentage of fixed rate debt was 33% prior to insurance compared to 47% at the end of the fourth quarter. Refinancing also increased the pricing under our revolver and term loan facilities from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points. 
During the quarter, we paid down $30 million under our revolving credit facility resulting in $180 million of outstanding borrowings on our revolver at the end of the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.349 billion, an increase of $236 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, but a decrease of $32 million compared with the third quarter of 2010. 
LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $41 million or 37.7%. This reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 731,000 shares or $17 million at an average price of $23.38. For the full year, we repurchased 26.6 million shares for $524 million at an average price of $19.70. We ended the fourth quarter with 148.4 million shares outstanding and $233 million of Board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter excluding operating lease buy-outs were $72.7 million, resulting in full-year 2010 capital expenditures of $150 million net of operating lease buy-outs as we continue to invest in our facilities. For 2011, we expect CapEx to be approximately $140 million, excluding proceeds from remaining asset sales. 
Floor plan debt was approximately $1.9 billion at quarter end, up approximately $233 million from September 30, 2010 and in line with inventory levels. Our balance sheet continues to be industry-leading and we remained well within the limits of our financial covenants. 
Our leverage ratio was 2.41x at the end of the quarter compared to the limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $95 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in healthy total liquidity of over $550 million at the end of December. 
Our cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet and streamlined cost structure, positioned the company to continue to benefit from the improving SAAR and to maximize the value of the company and shareholder returns.

Our entire team is committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers. And in 2010, we did just that. We are very proud of our strong operating results for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2010",1150,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our entire team is committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers. And in 2010, we did just that. We are very proud of our strong operating results for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2010 that netted an impressive 4.1% operating margin for the quarter and an industry-leading 4% operating margin for the full year. Our performance was achieved with elite levels of CSI, increased associate productivity and the lowest associate turnover in the company's history. 
In the quarter, we grew new vehicle unit volume 15% on a total store basis and 12% for same stores comparing favorably to the industry, which according to CNW, was up 6%. Performance was also impressive for used vehicles, where in the quarter we achieved growth of 21% for total stores and 19% for same stores. Contributing to the lift in volume was strong performances in our three largest states of California, Texas and Florida, where our brand mix, locations and operating teams execution were a clear benefit. 
Looking at segment performance. At $122 million, total segment income for the fourth quarter grew 42% or $36 million compared to the period a year ago. Segment income for the Domestic segment increased $13 million or 55% to $37 million. Premium Luxury increased $17 million or 36% to $66 million, and Import segment income increased $5 million or 11% to $46 million. For the full-year 2010, total segment income of $454 million was up $82 million or 22% compared to 2009, with year-over-year growth in all three segments. As I continue my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. 
In the fourth quarter, AutoNation retailed 52,000 new vehicles, an increase of 5,500 units or 12% compared to the period a year ago. The Domestic segment accounted for just over half of the unit increase driven primarily by Ford, where new units sold increased 30%. The Import segment accounted for about 40% of the new unit increase and Premium Luxury accounted for the balance of the increase in volume. 
Gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $129 or 6% to $2,416 per vehicle compared to the period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points to 7.2%. 
Excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, in the quarter, gross profit per new vehicle retail was $2,163, up $124 or 5%. And gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 50 basis points to 6.4%. We attribute this primarily to year-over-year margin compression in the Import segment, due in part to increased inventory compared to the post-Cash for Clunkers period a year ago where Import inventory was depleted. 
Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, again excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, we were pleased to increase PVR by $168 or 8% with all three segments contributing to the growth. At December 31, our new vehicle day supply was 63 days comparing favorably to the industry at 68 days. And with 48,500 units, our year-end inventory represented what we consider a more normalized level. 
Turning to used vehicles. We delivered a strong 19% growth in used units retail for both the quarter and the full year. Focusing on Q4, retail used vehicle revenue was up 22% on the sale of 38,000 used vehicles with revenue per vehicle up 2% to 17,500. 
Gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,572 increased $80 or 5% with gross profit as a percent of revenue increasing 20 basis points compared to the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.74, up from 0.70 a year ago. And at December 31, our used vehicle day supply was 42 days. 
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value Vehicle Outlets or VVOs, where to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand, we are retailing value-priced vehicles that we would've traditionally wholesaled. In the fourth quarter, VVO sales accounted for 6% of our used vehicle volume in an average selling price of $7,800. Today, we have 19 VVO locations in operation with five more scheduled to open in the current quarter.
Our Parts, Service and Collision business drove growth in both revenue and gross profit in the quarter. Revenue of $546 million represented an increase of $32 million or 6% with customer pay revenue, warranty and internal all contributing factors. We were very pleased to recognize a 4% increase in customer pay revenue compared to the period a year ago, our strongest performance in three years, as well as an 8% increase in warranty and a 19% increase in internal. 
Service, Parts and Collision Q4 gross profit of $236 million increased $11 million or 5% compared to a year ago, driven by an 11% increase in warranty related to large-scale recalls that were announced earlier in the year and a 13% increase in internal. 
Our F&I team turned in strong results with F&I gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,164, an increase of $36 or 3% compared to a year ago. Our preferred lender network, OEM service contract alliances, strong product penetration and strong store-level execution continue to drive our performance in F&I.
In the quarter, we relocated Mercedes-Benz of Miami, Mercedes-Benz of South Bay in Southern California and BMW & MINI of Dallas to brand-new, large facilities. We also opened Audi Peoria, a flagship Audi store and add point in Peoria, Arizona. At December 31, our store portfolio was 206 stores and 242 franchises in 15 states. 
To reconcile the account at the end of Q3 during the fourth quarter, we divested one store with three franchises and terminated seven Pontiac franchises. These actions represented a combined annual revenue run rate of $77 million. And as you now know, we have an agreement to acquire Fort Myers Toyota on the West Coast of Florida, the 35th largest Toyota store in the nation in 2010, ranked by new vehicle unit sales. We expect this transaction to be completed by the end of the first quarter and look forward to welcoming the store to AutoNation and our Florida region. 
I'd like to note that we have 16 major facility projects slated for completion this year. Six are new stores needed for additional points awarded to us by manufacturers and the remaining 10 will significantly upgrade existing stores or be greenfield sites. 
Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria. 
In closing, we are very proud of our performance in 2010 and thank each of our 19,000 associates for their contributions. Our formula for success remains continuous improvement of our best practice processes, intense focus on retaining our low-cost base and investing in training and developing our people. We believe these efforts and our store portfolio position us well to take advantage of an improving market.

Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 for the fourth quarter, a 55% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.29 for the same period in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.2 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 16%, driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail sales increased 6% based on CNW Research Data. In comparison, during the same period, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 15% or 12% on a same-store basis. 
For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.56 was a record, up 36% over prior year. Revenue for the full year was up 17% over prior year. This morning, we reported our January new vehicle retail sales, which increased 24%, continuing to demonstrate that the auto industry recovery is solidly underway. The January seasonally adjusted annual rate was $12,600,000, which was the highest since Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September of '08 excluding Cash for Clunkers. We continue to see strength in Domestic sales, which were up 40%; Imports increased 23%; and Premium Luxury was up 5%. 
During the downturn, our aggressive cost reduction and asset management strategies resulted in a lower cost structure and more efficient inventory management. We continue to invest in our stores and in our Shared Service Center, where we centralized our store level accounting and administrative activities. We also selectively added to our portfolio by acquiring several new stores, including our announcement today that we've entered into an agreement to acquire one of the country's largest Toyota store, Ft. Myers Toyota on the West Coast of Florida. 
AutoNation has an optimal brand and market mix that positions us for a strong performance in new vehicle sales as the market rebounds. We have been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform in what we expect to be a multiyear recovery in auto retail. 
Thank you very much. Turning it over to Mr. Short."

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $68 million or $0.45 per share versus $50 million or $0.29 per share during the fourth quarter of 2009, a 55% improvement on a per-share basis. 
During the third quarter 2010 conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $20 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the next two to three quarters, primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previously sold. In Q4, operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $11.8 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize an additional favorable impact of approximately $9 million in operating income related to these incentives over the next two quarters. 
Our fourth quarter 2009 results excluding the favorable tax adjustment of $12.7 million or $0.07 per share, and there were no adjusting items in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $1.56 compared to $1.15 in the prior year. Adjustments to net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased $452.2 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved $71.4 million or 15%, while SG&A was up $32.5 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.1% for the quarter. This benefited from an improved gross profit due to the manufacture incentives previously mentioned. Excluding that impact, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit would have been in line with third quarter of 2010 and approximately 240 basis points lower than Q4 of prior year. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $2.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.5 million from the $4.3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of last year, due primarily to higher average floorplan balances during the quarter. Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from the $10.2 million we reported in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to our refinancing which closed in April 2010. 
Our percentage of fixed rate debt was 33% prior to insurance compared to 47% at the end of the fourth quarter. Refinancing also increased the pricing under our revolver and term loan facilities from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points. 
During the quarter, we paid down $30 million under our revolving credit facility resulting in $180 million of outstanding borrowings on our revolver at the end of the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.349 billion, an increase of $236 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, but a decrease of $32 million compared with the third quarter of 2010. LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. 
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $41 million or 37.7%. This reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 731,000 shares for $17 million at an average price of $23.38. For the full year, we repurchased 26.6 million shares for $524 million at an average price of $19.70. We ended the fourth quarter with 148.4 million shares outstanding and $233 million of board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter excluding operating lease buy-outs were $72.7 million, resulting in full-year 2010 capital expenditures of $150 million net of operating lease buy-outs as we continue to invest in our facilities. 
For 2011, we expect CapEx to be approximately $140 million, excluding proceeds from related asset sales. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.9 billion at quarter end, up approximately $233 million from September 30, 2010 and in line with inventory levels. Our balance sheet continues to be industry-leading and we remain well within the limits of our financial covenants. 
Our leverage ratio was 2.41x at the end of the quarter compared to the limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $95 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in healthy total liquidity of over $550 million at the end of December. Our cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet and streamlined cost structure, positioned the company to continue to benefit from the improving SAAR and to maximize the value of the company and shareholder returns.

Our performance was achieved with elite levels of CSI, increased associate productivity and the lowest associate turnover in the company's history. 
In the quarter, we grew new vehicle unit volume 15% on a total store basis and 12% for same stores comparing favorably to the industry, which according to CNW, was up 6%. Performance was also impressive for used vehicles, where in the quarter we achieved growth of 21% for total stores and 19% for same stores. Contributing to the lift in volume was strong performances in our three largest states of California, Texas and Florida, where our brand mix, locations and operating teams execution were a clear benefit. 
Looking at segment performance. At $122 million, total segment income for the fourth quarter grew 42% or $36 million compared to the period a year ago. Segment income for the Domestic segment increased $13 million or 55% to $37 million. Premium Luxury increased $17 million or 36% to $66 million, and Import segment income increased $5 million or 11% to $46 million.

In the fourth quarter, AutoNation retailed 52,000 new vehicles, an increase of 5,500 units or 12% compared to the period a year ago. The Domestic segment accounted for just over half of the unit increase driven primarily by Ford, where new units sold increased 30%. The Import segment accounted for about 40% of the new unit increase and Premium Luxury accounted for the balance of the increase in volume. 
Gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $129 or 6% to $2,416 per vehicle compared to the period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points to 7.2%. Excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, in the quarter, gross profit per new vehicle retail was $2,163, up $124 or 5%. And gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 50 basis points to 6.4%. We attribute this primarily to year-over-year margin compression in the Import segment, due in part to increased inventory compared to the post-Cash for Clunkers period a year ago where Import inventory was depleted. 
Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, again excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, we were pleased to increase PVR by $168 or 8% with all three segments contributing to the growth. At December 31, our new vehicle day supply was 63 days comparing favorably to the industry at 68 days. And with 48,500 units, our year-end inventory represented what we consider a more normalized level. 
Turning to used vehicles. We delivered a strong 19% growth in used units retail for both the quarter and the full year. Focusing on Q4, retail used vehicle revenue was up 22% on the sale of 38,000 used vehicles with revenue per vehicle up 2% to 17,500. Gross profit per vehicle retail of $1,572 increased $80 or 5% with gross profit as a percent of revenue increasing 20 basis points compared to the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.74, up from 0.70 a year ago. And at December 31, our used vehicle day supply was 42 days. 
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value Vehicle Outlets or VVOs, where to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand, we are retailing value-priced vehicles that we would've traditionally wholesaled. In the fourth quarter, VVO sales accounted for 6% of our used vehicle volume at an average selling price of $7,800. Today, we have 19 VVO locations in operation with five more scheduled to open in the current quarter. 
Our Parts, Service and Collision business drove growth in both revenue and gross profit in the quarter. Revenue of $546 million represented an increase of $32 million or 6% with customer pay revenue, warranty and internal all contributing factors. We were very pleased to recognize a 4% increase in customer pay revenue compared to the period a year ago, our strongest performance in three years, as well as an 8% increase in warranty and a 19% increase in internal. Service, Parts and Collision Q4 gross profit of $236 million increased $11 million or 5% compared to a year ago, driven by an 11% increase in warranty related to large-scale recalls that were announced earlier in the year and a 13% increase in internal. 
Our F&I team turned in strong results with F&I gross profit per vehicle retailed of $1,164, an increase of $36 or 3% compared to a year ago. Our preferred lender network, OEM service contract alliances, strong product penetration and strong store-level execution continue to drive our performance in F&I. 
In the quarter, we relocated Mercedes-Benz of Miami, Mercedes-Benz of South Bay in Southern California and BMW & MINI of Dallas to brand-new, large facilities. We also opened Audi of Peoria, a flagship Audi store and add point in Peoria, Arizona. At December 31, our store portfolio was 206 stores and 242 franchises in 15 states. 
To reconcile the account at the end of Q3 during the fourth quarter, we divested one store with three franchises and terminated seven Pontiac franchises. These actions represented a combined annual revenue run rate of $77 million. And as you now know, we have an agreement to acquire Ft. Myers Toyota on the West Coast of Florida, the 35th largest Toyota store in the nation in 2010, ranked by new vehicle unit sales. We expect this transaction to be completed by the end of the first quarter and look forward to welcoming the store to AutoNation and our Florida region. 
I'd like to note that we have 16 major facility projects slated for completion this year. Six are new stores needed for additional points awarded to us by manufacturers and the remaining 10 will significantly upgrade existing stores or be greenfield sites. Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria. 
In closing, we are very proud of our performance in 2010 and thank each of our 19,000 associates for their contributions. Our formula for success remains continuous improvement of our best practice processes, intense focus on retaining our low-cost base and investing in training and developing our people. We believe these efforts and our store portfolio position us well to take advantage of an improving market. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

And the warranty is a little bit of a wild card because there was a fair amount of recalls, especially on the Toyota-Lexus side that were certainly an influence in the warranty.

As soon as we saw that the worst was over, that would have been June of '09, we switched from defense to offense, where our risk profile changed on every category, from inventory levels to marketing to initiatives. And that combined with throughout that period we always invested in our initiatives, around process and technology. But if you combine the power of those initiatives now with a lean-forward posture, you could see the payoff. So Mr. Maroone, what would you like to add?"

I'm just trying to understand, are you seeing these incentives at the dealer level as really a net change or increase in incentive spending by the automakers? Or are they just refocusing and re-shifting their olds or their previous incentive dollars around and more effectively advertising those?

The only incentive that we dislike intensely are stair-step programs, which create a lot of chaos and mistrust in the marketplace and really don't have a place in today's Internet world, where basically with stair-steps you're telling the customer unless they shop to death, they may not find where the stair-step is heading and that has no place in today's marketplace.

Gross profit for all of our major categories improved compared to the first quarter of 2010 and our expense structure remained very disciplined. 
First quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.3 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 17% driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the first quarter, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 23% or 20% on a same-store basis, which were in line with the industry according to CNW Research Data. 
In March, we began to see a mixshift with consumers gradually moving to mid-size and small vehicles as gas prices increase, fuel efficiencies has written on the consumer consideration shopping list and is now in the top 10 according to CNW.
We are, of course, supportive of the efforts of our Japanese base partners as they worked hard to rebuild and begin production and bring it back online. To support the recovery efforts, AutoNation has made a donation of $100,000 to the American Red Cross. While the underlying recovery in consumer demand for autos remains on track in the United States due to Japanese supply constraints throughout the remainder of 2011, we are reducing our planning assumptions for the 2011 full year U.S. industry sales to mid-12 million new vehicle units. 
Based on current information, we see significant reductions in vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers through year end with a resumption of normal shipment level in early 2012. I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the first quarter we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million or $0.46 per share versus $58.8 billion or $0.34 per share during the first quarter of 2010, a 35% improvement on a per-share basis. During our fourth quarter conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $9 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the following 2 quarters primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previously sold. 
Our first quarter gross profit and operating income were favorably impacted by $4.6 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize approximately $4.5 million in operating income related to these incentives in the second quarter of 2011.
First quarter revenue increased $474.5 million or 17% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved by $57.8 million or 11%, while SG&A was up $34.3 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.0% for the quarter. Excluding the benefit from the manufacturer incentives previously mentioned, it would have been 72.6%. This represents an improvement of over 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2010 and it also represents over 100 basis points sequential improvement, excluding the benefit from the incentives in both quarters. 
Although we achieved strong SG&A performance to date, there's are further long-term benefit to begin as we focus on technology and process improvements in our stores and in our shared service centers, as well as centralized procurement initiatives. 
Our scale and centralization efforts to date uniquely position us to take these next steps in SG&A improvements. 
Net new vehicles floor plan was a benefit of $4.7 million for the quarter, an improvement of $1.4 million compared to the $3.3 million benefit in the first quarter of 2010 due to an increase in corporate assistance as a result of higher new vehicle sales. Partially offset by an increase in Incorporate interest expense due to higher average point balances during the quarter. Non vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million up for the quarter, up from the $9 million reported in the first quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels and increased percentage of fixed rate debt and increase spreads related to our refinancing in April of 2010.
During the quarter, we paid down $15 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $165 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of the first quarter. Our first quarter non vehicle debt balance was $1.34 billion, an increase of $226 million compared to the first quarter of 2010, but a decrease of $11.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $44.2 million or 38.6%. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $59 million at an average price of $32.84 per share. We ended the first quarter with 148.6 million shares outstanding and a $174 million board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
During the quarter, as previously disclosed, we acquired a Toyota store in the Fort Myers market for approximately $64 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $25 million and our CapEx estimate for the year remains at $140 million net of proceeds from related asset sales. 
Floor plan debt was approximately $1.65 billion at quarter end, down approximately $214 million from December 1 2010 in-line with inventory levels. We remain within the limits of our financial covenants with the leverage ratio of 2.27x at the end of the quarter. Our indebtedness number in this calculation is not on a net debt basis if we had applied the cash of our balance sheet plus cash available from used inventory flowing. To reduce debt, we would have lower the ratio to 2.0x compared to the limit of 3.25x. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $84 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in strong total liquidity of approximately $570 million at the end of March. The strength of our balance sheet and the discipline of our cost structure will enable us to manage through the challenges presented by the Japanese product constraints. We are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business and capitalize on the long-term recovery in the automotive market. Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,128980848,117467,"AutoNation Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our Associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by str",1325,"Thanks, Mike and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our Associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. 
Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by strong year-over-year increases in new and used unit volume, making this the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for total retail volume. Revenue in total gross profit increased in all areas of our business and recorded an impressive operating margin of 4.2%.
Turning to detailed results. I'll begin with our segment performance. At $129 million, total segment income for the first quarter grew 22% or $23 million compared to the period a year ago with increases in all 3 segments as follows: Domestic segment income increased 34% to $43 million; Premium Luxury increased 18% to $55 million; and Import Segment income increased 15% to $58 million. As I continue my comments, we'll be in a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. 
During the first quarter, AutoNation retailed 54,200 new vehicles, an increase of 8,900 units or 20% compared to the period a year ago. First quarter new vehicle same-store revenue increased $286 million or 20% to $1.75 billion on increased volume, driven by stronger customer demand. 
A $2,266 gross profit for new vehicle retail was relatively flat compared to the period a year ago and gross profit as a percent of revenue of 7% was off by 10 basis points. This was driven by a decline in margins of the Import Segment due to the competitive environment, which was partially offset by the recognition of special performance-based manufacturing incentives which we discussed on our previous call. 
Excluding the $4.6 million of special performance-based manufacturing incentives in the quarter, gross profit for new vehicle retail was $2,181, a reduction of $91 or 4% and gross profit as a percent of revenue was 6.8%. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, again excluding the special performance-based manufacture incentives, we saw an improvement in the gross profit for new vehicle retail at $18. 
At March 31, new vehicle days supply was 50 days or 40,800 units compared to 51 days a year ago and 63 days at December 31.
Next, used vehicles, where we're very pleased with our results. AutoNation retailed 41,300 used vehicles in the quarter, which drove a unit volume increase of 10% compared to the period a year ago and a used to new ratio of 0.76:1. 
As tight inventories and increasing demand moved prices higher, same-store retail used revenue was up 11% to $714 million and revenue per used vehicle retail of $17,300 increase $224 compared to the period a year ago. Same-store use vehicle gross profit of $73 million reflected an increase of 15% while gross profit per used vehicle retailed at $1,750, grew $78 or 5% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue at 10.1% grew 30 basis points.
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value Vehicles Outlet, an initiatives in its early stages to retail value priced vehicles that we would have traditionally wholesaled. Today, we have 22 locations in operation, with 6 more planned by the end of Q3. We are very pleased with the continued growth of this program, which is an important part of our strategy to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand. 
Another important component is winning more trades, which we addressed by viewing every customer visit as a trade opportunity and ensuring our appraisal process that actively involves the customer is consistently executed. I'll also note that in the quarter, we moved nearly 12,000 used vehicles from originating stores to a more optimal location relative to turn and PVR. 
In continued experience, good success that retail with this program. At March 31, used vehicle days supply was 42 days in line with our adjusted targeted days supply.
For parts, service and collision compared to the period, compared to the quarter a year ago, same-store revenue of $557 million increased $19 million or 4%. We are very pleased to deliver another solid performance on the customer pay side where customer pay revenue grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter and was up 4% year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. 
We had attribute the upward trend in customer pay revenue to improving market conditions and better execution in the service drive. Parts, service and collision gross profit of $239 million was up $2 million or 1% compared to a year ago, and the quarter increases of 2% in customer pay service gross and a 7% increase in internal gross, more than offset a 4% decline in warranty gross. 
Gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 120 basis points to 42.9% compared to a year-ago. we attribute this to a shift in mix toward internal as well as a shift within customer pay resulting from our initiatives to grow tires and maintenance to drive customer retention. I'll also note that the warranty comp in a period a year ago included the Toyota recalls.
Turning to F&I. Gross profit for vehicle retail of $1,137 remains strong but up slightly versus a year ago with improvements in the rate of product commissions, offset by product chargebacks and lower retrospective commission on vehicle service contract programs. 
The credit environment was again favorable compared to a year ago and stable sequentially. In the quarter, we noted key non prime and sub prime lenders were buying deeper year-over-year. 
At March 31, our store portfolio stood at 209 stores and 243 franchises, representing 31 brands in 15 states. Changes from our Q4 2010 call are the completion of the acquisition of Ft. Myers Toyota and the separation of franchises at 2 locations. One where we separated Mini from BMW Northern California, and the other where we separated Mitsubishi from Chevrolet in Houston. We remain confident regarding the long term outlook for our business and are continuing to invest in our future growth. 
Year-to-date, we've completed 8 of 16 major facility projects slated for 2011. We've opened 2 brand new state-of-the-art ad points for Mercedes Benz at Stanford and Central Florida, and Mercedes Benz of Coconut Creek in South Florida. Relocations to new ground up facilities include Leaseburg Honda, now called Honda of Dallas, Team Hyundai of Mall of Georgia and Mercedes Benz of Sarasota. 
We opened Fiat South Bay in Southern California after renovating an existing vacant facility and completed the extensive renovation of Mercedes Benz of Orlando and Mercedes Benz of Westmont in the Chicago market.
Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunity that meet our market, brand and return on investment criteria. Before I close, I'd like to touch on how we are addressing the reduction in Japanese production. We've implemented a substantial number of tactical moves to address potential impacts with the goal of maximizing our inventories and optimizing gross. 
Our revised operating plan includes benchmarking and tactical adjustments of market pricing in new and used vehicles, increased acquisition of used inventory outside of auctions, a significant marketing shift to promote our broad selection of domestic and used inventory, as well as our fixed operation business and an aggressive management of variable expenses. With the full extent of the industry impact not yet known, we believe that our disciplined approach coupled with an operating model that's diversified by brand, geography and revenue stream, positions us well to successfully navigate the anticipated disruption.
In closing, in the quarter, AutoNation continue to drive topline growth and margin growth as well as delivered a record EPS in the first quarter in an industry selling rate of 13 million units. We did it with low associate turnover, high customer satisfaction, an disciplined cost structure and a 1 team, 1 goal spirit. I'd like to thank our Associates and share that we are very optimistic about the future of our company. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

As of March 1, Japanese had very good inventories in the U.S. around 6,000 units on the ground and we had an excellent pipeline coming from Japan and parts going to the U.S. factories to continue production. So that really says that you have a good supply. Through April and May, you'll begin to see the first sign of disruption. I think then, the Japanese dealers are very skilled at working with lower inventories, they've done it for years so there can be significant inventory reduction before there is a meaningful impact on sales. But I think May, June, you'll begin to see a few of the disruption of the production and certainly July, there will be meaningful shortages of Japanese products. I think on the front end growth is and margins, we fully expected in the journey back to 16 million units and with increasing demand that we would be able to improve those margins in that journey. And I certainly believe in this period here, where there's going to be a significant differential between demand and supply, you will see improvement in front end margins. Maroone, maybe you can add to that."

And I think in Mike and I's 40 years of experience in this business, I don't think I've ever said that in the auto industry. So this is an unprecedented supply restraint and to continued the conversation in all our discussion with the domestic and the German, there's a sense that they're working hard to maintain their original production plant, but they have given us no indication yet that they are able to increase production beyond the original plant but they are dealing with part supply issues from the Japanese also. So it's really a supply constrained situation. So I'm not sure the availability is going -- at the Domestic, its going to be able to breach the gap with the shortage of the Japanese and the total year. So it's clearly going to be a margin situation. I will say though in principle, the Domestic have a much more attractive offering than they did 5 to 10 years ago, both from design, quality and certainly from fuel efficiency. So they're well positioned to be attractive to the Japanese traffic. And I think you'll have a compelling offer for them. But how much of that can really occur? I can't say. And that's the reason why we reduced our forecast for our industry sales to the mid-12 million. From today's perspective, I just don't see where the production is to support something higher than that."

Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.46 for the first quarter, a 35% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.34 for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit for all of our major categories improved compared to the first quarter of 2010 and our expense structure remained very disciplined. 
First quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.3 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 17% driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the first quarter, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 23%, or 20% on a same-store basis, which were in line with the industry according to CNW Research Data. 
In March, we began to see a mix shift, with consumers gradually moving to mid-size and small vehicles as gas prices increase, fuel efficiency has written on the consumer consideration shopping list and is now in the top 10 according to CNW.
We are, of course, supportive of the efforts of our Japanese-based partners as they work tirelessly to rebuild and begin production and bring it back online. To support the recovery efforts, AutoNation has made a donation of $100,000 to the American Red Cross. While the underlying recovery in consumer demand for autos remains on track in the United States due to Japanese supply constraints throughout the remainder of 2011, we are reducing our planning assumption for the 2011 full year U.S. industry sales to mid-12 million new vehicle units. 
Based on current information, we see significant reductions in vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers through year end with the resumption of normal shipment level in early 2012.

During our fourth quarter conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $9 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the following 2 quarters, primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previously sold. 
Our first quarter gross profit and operating income were favorably impacted by $4.6 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize approximately $4.5 million in operating income related to these incentives in the second quarter of 2011.
First quarter revenue increased $474.5 million or 17% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved by $57.8 million or 11%, while SG&A was up $34.3 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.0% for the quarter. Excluding the benefit from the manufacturer incentives previously mentioned, it would have been 72.6%. This represents an improvement of over 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2010, it also represents over 100 basis points sequential improvement, excluding the benefit from the incentives in both quarters. 
Although we achieved strong SG&A performance to date, there's still further long-term benefit to be gained as we focus on technology and process improvements in our stores and in our Shared Service Center, as well as centralized procurement initiatives. Our scale and centralization efforts to date uniquely position us to take these next steps in SG&A improvements. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $4.7 million for the quarter, an improvement of $1.4 million compared to the $3.3 million benefit in the first quarter of 2010 due to an increase in floorplan assistance as a result of higher new vehicle sales, partially offset by an increase in floorplan interest expense due to higher average floorplan balances during the quarter. Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from $9 million we reported in the first quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels and increased percentage of fixed rate debt and increased spreads related to our refinancing in April of 2010.
During the quarter, we paid down $15 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $165 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of the first quarter. Our first quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.34 billion, an increase of $226 million compared to the first quarter of 2010, but a decrease of $11.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared with the first quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $44.2 million or 38.6%. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $59 million at an average price of $32.84 per share. We ended the first quarter with 148.6 million shares outstanding and a $174 million Board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
During the quarter, as previously disclosed, we acquired a Toyota store in the Fort Myers market for approximately $64 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $25 million, and our CapEx estimate for the year remains at $140 million net of proceeds from related asset sales. 
Floorplan debt was approximately $1.65 billion at quarter end, down approximately $214 million from December 31, 2010 in-line with inventory levels. We remain within the limits of our financial covenants with the leverage ratio of 2.27x at the end of the quarter. Our indebtedness number in this calculation is not on a net debt basis if we had applied the cash of our balance sheet plus cash available from used inventory flooring to a reduce debt, we would have lowered the ratio to 2.0x compared to the limit of 3.25x. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $84 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in strong total liquidity of approximately $570 million at the end of March. The strength of our balance sheet and the discipline of our cost structure will enable us to manage through the challenges presented by the Japanese product constraints. We are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business and capitalize on the long-term recovery in the automotive market. Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,128980848,117543,"AutoNation Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by st",1309,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. 
Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by strong year-over-year increases in new and used unit volume, making this the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for total retail volume. Revenue and total gross profit increased in all areas of our business, and we recorded an impressive operating margin of 4.2%.
Turning to detailed results. I'll begin with our segment performance. At $129 million, total segment income for the first quarter grew 22% or $23 million compared to the period a year ago with increases in all 3 segments as follows: Domestic segment income increased 34% to $43 million; Premium Luxury increased 18% to $55 million; and Import Segment income increased 15% to $58 million. As I continue my comments, we'll be in a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. 
During the first quarter, AutoNation retailed 54,200 new vehicles, an increase of 8,900 units or 20% compared to the period a year ago. First quarter new vehicle same-store revenue increased $286 million, or 20%, to $1.75 billion on increased volume, driven by stronger customer demand. 
A $2,266 gross profit per new vehicle retailed was relatively flat compared to the period a year ago, and gross profit as a percent of revenue of 7% was off by 10 basis points. This was driven by a decline in margins of the Import Segment due to the competitive environment, which was partially offset by the recognition of special performance-based manufacturer incentives which we discussed on our previous call. 
Excluding the $4.6 million of special performance-based manufacturer incentives in the quarter, gross profit per new vehicle retailed was $2,181, a reduction of $91 or 4%, and gross profit as a percent of revenue was 6.8%. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, again excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, we saw an improvement in the gross profit per new vehicle retailed of $18. 
At March 31, new vehicle days supply was 50 days or 40,800 units compared to 51 days a year ago and 63 days at December 31.
Next, used vehicles, where we're very pleased with our results. AutoNation retailed 41,300 used vehicles in the quarter, which drove a unit volume increase of 10% compared to the period a year ago and a used-to-new ratio of 0.76:1. 
As tight inventories and increasing demand move prices higher, same-store retail used revenue was up 11% to $714 million, and revenue per used vehicle retailed of $17,300 increased $224 compared to the period a year ago. Same-store used vehicle gross profit of $73 million reflected an increase of 15%, while gross profit per used vehicle retailed at $1,757 grew $78, or 5%, compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue at 10.1% grew 30 basis points.
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value Vehicles Outlet, an initiative in its early stages to retail value-priced vehicles that we would have traditionally wholesaled. Today, we have 22 locations in operation, with 6 more planned by the end of Q3. We are very pleased with the continued growth of this program, which is an important part of our strategy to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand. 
Another important component is winning more trades, which we addressed by viewing every customer visit as a trade opportunity and ensuring our appraisal process that actively involves the customer is consistently executed. I'll also note that in the quarter, we moved nearly 12,000 used vehicles from originating stores to a more optimal location relative to turn and PVR [per vehicle retailed]. In continued experience, good success at retail with this program. At March 31, used vehicle days supply was 42 days in line with our adjusted targeted days supply.
For parts, service and collision compared to the period -- compared to the quarter a year ago, same-store revenue of $557 million increased $19 million or 4%. We are very pleased to deliver another solid performance on the customer pay side, where customer pay revenue grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, and was up 4% year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. 
We attribute the upward trend in customer pay revenue to improving market conditions and better execution in the service drive. Parts, service and collision gross profit of $239 million was up $2 million or 1% compared to a year ago. In the quarter, increases of 2% in customer pay service gross and a 7% increase in internal gross, more than offset a 4% decline in warranty gross. 
Gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 120 basis points to 42.9% compared to a year-ago. we attribute this to a shift in mix toward internal as well as a shift within customer pay resulting from our initiatives to grow tires and maintenance to drive customer retention. I'll also note that the warranty comp in a period a year ago included the Toyota recalls.
Turning to F&I. Gross profit per vehicle retailed of $1,137 remain strong but up slightly versus a year ago, with improvements in the rate of product commissions, offset by product chargebacks and lower retrospective commissions on vehicle service contract programs. The credit environment was again favorable compared to a year ago and stable sequentially. In the quarter, we noted key non-prime and sub-prime lenders were buying deeper year-over-year. 
At March 31, our store portfolio stood at 209 stores and 243 franchises, representing 31 brands and 15 states. Changes from our Q4 2010 call are the completion of the acquisition of Ft. Myers Toyota and the separation of franchises at 2 locations. One where we separated MINI from BMW Northern California, and the other where we separated Mitsubishi from Chevrolet in Houston. We remain confident regarding the long-term-outlook for our business and are continuing to invest in our future growth. 
Year-to-date, we've completed 8 of 16 major facility projects slated for 2011. We've opened 2 brand new state-of-the-art ad points, Mercedes-Benz at Stanford and Central Florida, and Mercedes-Benz of Coconut Creek in South Florida. Relocations to new ground up facilities include Leesburg Honda, now called Honda of Dulles, Team Hyundai of Mall of Georgia and Mercedes-Benz of Sarasota. 
We opened Fiat South Bay in Southern California after renovating an existing vacant facility, and completed the extensive renovation of Mercedes-Benz of Orlando and Mercedes-Benz of Westmont in the Chicago market.
Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market, brand and return-on-investment criteria. 
Before I close, I'd like to touch on how we're addressing the reduction in Japanese production. We've implemented a substantial number of tactical moves to address potential impacts with the goal of maximizing our inventories and optimizing gross. 
Our revised operating plan includes: benchmarking and tactical adjustments of market pricing in new and used vehicles; increased acquisition of used inventory outside of auctions; a significant marketing shift to promote our broad selection of domestic and used inventory, as well as our fixed operation business; and an aggressive management of variable expenses. With the full extent of the industry impact not yet known, we believe that our disciplined approach coupled with an operating model that's diversified by brand, geography and revenue stream, positions us well to successfully navigate the anticipated disruption.
In closing, in the quarter, AutoNation continue to drive topline growth and margin growth as well as delivered a record EPS in the first quarter and an industry selling rate of 13 million units. We did it with low associate turnover, high customer satisfaction, a disciplined cost structure and a 1-team-1-goal spirit. I'd like to thank our associates and share that we're very optimistic about the future of our company. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

As of March 1, the Japanese had very good inventories in the U.S. around 600,000 units on the ground, and we had an excellent pipeline coming from Japan and parts going to the U.S. factories to continue production. So that really says you have a good supply. Through April and May, you will begin to see the first sign of disruption. I think then, the Japanese dealers are very skilled at working with lower inventories, they've done it for years so there can be significant inventory reduction before there is a meaningful impact on sales. But I think May, June, you begin to feel the disruption on the production. And certainly July, there will be meaningful shortages of Japanese products. I think on the front-end grosses and margins, we fully expected in the journey back to 16 million units and with increasing demand that we would be able to improve those margins in that journey. And I certainly believe in this period here, where there's going to be a significant differential between demand and supply, you will see improvement in front end margins. Mike Maroone, maybe you can add to that."

And I think in Mike and I's 40 years experience in this business, I don't think I've ever said that in the auto industry. So this is an unprecedented supply restraint and to continue the conversation, in all our discussion with the domestic and the German, there is a sense that they're working hard to maintain their original production plans, but they have given us no indication yet that they're able to increase production beyond the original plans, that they are dealing with part supply issues from the Japanese also. So it's really a supply constrained situation. So I'm not sure the availability is going, at the domestic, it is going to be able to bridge the gap with the shortage of the Japanese in the total year. So it's clearly going to be a margin situation. I will say though in principle, the domestic have a much more attractive offering than they did 5 to 10 years ago, both from design, quality and certainly, from fuel efficiency. So they're well positioned to be attractive to Japanese traffic, and I think you'll have a compelling offer for them. But how much of that can really occur? I can't say. And that's the reason why we reduced our forecast for our industry sales to the mid-12 million.

Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.46 for the first quarter, a 35% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.34 for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit for all of our major categories improved compared to the first quarter of 2010 and our expense structure remained very disciplined. 
First quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.3 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 17% driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the first quarter, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 23%, or 20% on a same-store basis, which were in line with the industry according to CNW Research Data. 
In March, we began to see a mix shift, with consumers gradually moving to mid-size and small vehicles as gas prices increase, fuel efficiency has written on the consumer consideration shopping list and is now in the top 10 according to CNW.
We are, of course, supportive of the efforts of our Japanese-based partners as they work tirelessly to rebuild and begin production and bring it back online. To support the recovery efforts, AutoNation has made a donation of $100,000 to the American Red Cross. While the underlying recovery in consumer demand for autos remains on track in the United States due to Japanese supply constraints throughout the remainder of 2011, we are reducing our planning assumption for the 2011 full year U.S. industry sales to mid-12 million new vehicle units. 
Based on current information, we see significant reductions in vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers through year end with the resumption of normal shipment level in early 2012. 
I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."
112302,128980848,117629,"AutoNation Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million, or $0.46 per share, versus $58.8 billion, or $0.34 per share, during the first quarter of 2010, a 35% improveme",736,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million, or $0.46 per share, versus $58.8 billion, or $0.34 per share, during the first quarter of 2010, a 35% improvement on a per-share basis. During our fourth quarter conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $9 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the following two quarters, primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previously sold. 
Our first quarter gross profit and operating income were favorably impacted by $4.6 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize approximately $4.5 million in operating income related to these incentives in the second quarter of 2011.
First quarter revenue increased $474.5 million or 17% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved by $57.8 million or 11%, while SG&A was up $34.3 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.0% for the quarter. Excluding the benefit from the manufacturer incentives previously mentioned, it would have been 72.6%. This represents an improvement of over 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2010, it also represents over 100 basis points sequential improvement, excluding the benefit from the incentives in both quarters. 
Although we’ve achieved strong SG&A performance to date, there's still further long-term benefit to be gained as we focus on technology and process improvements in our stores and in our Shared Service Center, as well as centralized procurement initiatives. Our scale and centralization efforts to date uniquely position us to take these next steps in SG&A improvements. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $4.7 million for the quarter, an improvement of $1.4 million compared to the $3.3 million benefit in the first quarter of 2010, due to an increase in floorplan assistance as a result of higher new vehicle sales, partially offset by an increase in floorplan interest expense due to higher average floorplan balances during the quarter. Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from $9 million we reported in the first quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels and increased percentage of fixed rate debt and increased spreads related to our refinancing in April of 2010.
During the quarter, we paid down $15 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $165 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of the first quarter. Our first quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.34 billion, an increase of $226 million compared to the first quarter of 2010, but a decrease of $11.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared with the first quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $44.2 million or 38.6%. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $59 million at an average price of $32.84 per share. We ended the first quarter with 148.6 million shares outstanding and a $174 million Board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
During the quarter, as previously disclosed, we acquired a Toyota store in the Fort Myers market for approximately $64 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $25 million, and our CapEx estimate for the year remains at $140 million net of proceeds from related asset sales. 
Floorplan debt was approximately $1.65 billion at quarter end, down approximately $214 million from December 31, 2010 in-line with inventory levels. We remain within the limits of our financial covenants with the leverage ratio of 2.27x at the end of the quarter. Our indebtedness number in this calculation is not on a net debt basis, if we had applied the cash of our balance sheet plus cash available from used inventory flooring to a reduce debt, we would have lowered the ratio to 2.0x compared to the limit of 3.25x. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $84 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in strong total liquidity of approximately $570 million at the end of March. The strength of our balance sheet and the discipline of our cost structure will enable us to manage through the challenges presented by the Japanese product constraints. We are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business and capitalize on the long-term recovery in the automotive market. Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,128980848,117629,"AutoNation Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by st",1309,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. 
Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by strong year-over-year increases in new and used unit volume, making this the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for total retail volume. Revenue and total gross profit increased in all areas of our business, and we recorded an impressive operating margin of 4.2%.
Turning to detailed results. I'll begin with our segment performance. At $129 million, total segment income for the first quarter grew 22% or $23 million compared to the period a year ago with increases in all three segments as follows: Domestic segment income increased 34% to $43 million; Premium Luxury increased 18% to $55 million; and Import segment income increased 15% to $58 million. As I continue my comments, we'll be in a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. 
During the first quarter, AutoNation retailed 54,200 new vehicles, an increase of 8,900 units or 20% compared to the period a year ago. First quarter new vehicle same-store revenue increased $286 million, or 20%, to $1.75 billion on increased volume, driven by stronger customer demand. 
A $2,266 gross profit per new vehicle retail was relatively flat compared to the period a year ago, and gross profit as a percent of revenue of 7% was off by 10 basis points. This was driven by a decline in margins of the Import segment due to the competitive environment, which was partially offset by the recognition of special performance-based manufacturer incentives which we discussed on our previous call. 
Excluding the $4.6 million of special performance-based manufacturer incentives in the quarter, gross profit per new vehicle retailed was $2,181, a reduction of $91 or 4%, and gross profit as a percent of revenue was 6.8%. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, again excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, we saw an improvement in the gross profit per new vehicle retailed of $18. 
At March 31, new vehicle days supply was 50 days or 40,800 units compared to 51 days a year ago and 63 days at December 31.
Next, used vehicles, where we're very pleased with our results. AutoNation retailed 41,300 used vehicles in the quarter, which drove a unit volume increase of 10% compared to the period a year ago and a used-to-new ratio of 0.76:1. 
As tight inventories and increasing demand move prices higher, same-store retail used revenue was up 11% to $714 million, and revenue per used vehicle retailed of $17,300 increased $224 compared to the period a year ago. Same-store used vehicle gross profit of $73 million reflected an increase of 15%, while gross profit per used vehicle retailed at $1,757 grew $78, or 5%, compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue at 10.1% grew 30 basis points.
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value VehiclesOutlets, an initiative in its early stages to retail value-priced vehicles that we would have traditionally wholesaled. Today, we have 22 locations in operation, with 6 more planned by the end of Q3. We are very pleased with the continued growth of this program, which is an important part of our strategy to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand. 
Another important component is winning more trades, which we addressed by viewing every customer visit as a trade opportunity and ensuring our appraisal process that actively involves the customer is consistently executed. I'll also note that in the quarter, we moved nearly 12,000 used vehicles from originating stores to a more optimal location relative to turn and PVR [per vehicle retailed]. In continued experience, good success at retail with this program. At March 31, used vehicle days supply was 42 days in line with our adjusted targeted days supply.
For parts, service and collision compared to the period -- compared to the quarter a year ago, same-store revenue of $557 million increased $19 million or 4%. We are very pleased to deliver another solid performance on the customer pay side, where customer pay revenue grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, and was up 4% year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. 
We attribute the upward trend in customer pay revenue to improving market conditions and better execution in the service drive. Parts, service and collision gross profit of $239 million was up $2 million or 1% compared to a year ago. In the quarter, increases of 2% in customer pay service gross and a 7% increase in internal gross, more than offset a 4% decline in warranty gross. 
Gross profit as a percent of revenue was off 120 basis points to 42.9% compared to a year-ago. We attribute this to a shift in mix toward internal as well as a shift within customer pay resulting from our initiatives to grow tires and maintenance to drive customer retention. I'll also note that the warranty comp in a period a year ago included the Toyota recalls.
Turning to F&I. Gross profit per vehicle retailed of $1,137 remain strong but up slightly versus a year ago, with improvements in the rate of product commissions, offset by product chargebacks and lower retrospective commissions on vehicle service contract programs. The credit environment was again favorable compared to a year ago and stable sequentially. In the quarter, we noted key non-prime and sub-prime lenders were buying deeper year-over-year. 
At March 31, our store portfolio stood at 209 stores and 243 franchises, representing 31 brands and 15 states. Changes from our Q4 2010 call are the completion of the acquisition of Ft. Myers Toyota and the separation of franchises at two locations. One where we separated MINI from BMW in Northern California, and the other where we separated Mitsubishi from Chevrolet in Houston. We remain confident regarding the long-term-outlook for our business and are continuing to invest in our future growth. 
Year-to-date, we've completed 8 of 16 major facility projects slated for 2011. We've opened 2 brand new state-of-the-art ad points, Mercedes-Benz of Stanford and Central Florida, and Mercedes-Benz of Coconut Creek in South Florida. Relocations to new ground up facilities include Leesburg Honda, now called Honda of Dulles, Team Hyundai of Mall of Georgia and Mercedes-Benz of Sarasota. 
We opened Fiat South Bay in Southern California after renovating an existing vacant facility, and completed the extensive renovation of Mercedes-Benz of Orlando and Mercedes-Benz of Westmont in the Chicago market.
Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market, brand and return-on-investment criteria. 
Before I close, I'd like to touch on how we're addressing the reduction in Japanese production. We've implemented a substantial number of tactical moves to address potential impacts with the goal of maximizing our inventories and optimizing gross. 
Our revised operating plan includes: benchmarking and tactical adjustments of market pricing in new and used vehicles; increased acquisition of used inventory outside of auctions; a significant marketing shift to promote our broad selection of domestic and used inventory, as well as our fixed operation business; and an aggressive management of variable expenses. With the full extent of the industry impact not yet known, we believe that our disciplined approach coupled with an operating model that's diversified by brand, geography and revenue stream, positions us well to successfully navigate the anticipated disruption.
In closing, in the quarter, AutoNation continue to drive top-line growth and margin growth as well as delivered a record EPS in the first quarter and an industry selling rate of 13 million units. We did it with low associate turnover, high customer satisfaction, a disciplined cost structure and a 1-team-1-goal spirit. I'd like to thank our associates and share that we're very optimistic about the future of our company. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

As of March 1, the Japanese had very good inventories in the U.S. around 600,000 units on the ground, and we had an excellent pipeline coming from Japan and parts going to the U.S. factories to continue production. So that really says you have a good supply. Through April and May, you will begin to see the first sign of disruption. I think then, the Japanese dealers are very skilled at working with lower inventories, they've done it for years so there can be significant inventory reduction before there is a meaningful impact on sales. But I think May, June, you begin to feel the disruption on the production. And certainly July, there will be meaningful shortages of Japanese products. I think on the front-end grosses and margins, we fully expected in the journey back to 16 million units and with increasing demand that we would be able to improve those margins in that journey. And I certainly believe in this period here, where there's going to be a significant differential between demand and supply, you will see improvement in front end margins. Maroone, maybe you can add to that."

And I think in Mike and I's 40 years experience in this business, I don't think I've ever said that in the auto industry. So this is an unprecedented supply restraint and to continue the conversation, in all our discussion with the domestic and the German, there is a sense that they're working hard to maintain their original production plans, but they have given us no indication yet that they're able to increase production beyond the original plans, that they are dealing with part supply issues from the Japanese also. 
So it's really a supply constrained situation. So I'm not sure the availability is going, at the domestic, it is going to be able to bridge the gap with the shortage of the Japanese in the total year. So it's clearly going to be a margin situation. I will say though in principle, the domestics have a much more attractive offering than they did five to 10 years ago, both from design, quality and certainly, from fuel efficiency. So they're well positioned to be attractive to Japanese traffic, and I think you'll have a compelling offer for them. But how much of that can really occur? I can't say. And that's the reason why we reduced our forecast for our industry sales to the mid-12 million.

So it really is a different game. And there's no question that the domestics will gain share this year. We're saying the pie is going to be smaller because of production constraints, the big production constraints are with the Japanese. The domestics have confirmed that they'll hit their original production plans with the content and configuration issues but they'll hit the original production plan, so they will take share. So I think the door is open. What we haven't heard from the domestics though is any statement or any indication that they're able to increase production beyond original plan. So that's where the situation sits at the moment. If they are ultimately able to do that as things develop, then I think the door is open for an even larger share step by the domestics.

So far, we've seen a migration towards fuel efficiency that can be exemplified by the fact that the split between cars and trucks was 50-50 for us in January, it moved to 52% February, 55% in March. That is not comparable to what happened in the '08 where it spiked over 60% in a very short period of time. We have not seen a significant impact on trading values or residual values of trucks or large cars as we did in '08 where those vehicles took a 15% to 20% hit. And I think the number where people really overact or panic or freak out is indeed higher than $4 a gallon, it's probably $4.50 to $5 a gallon, something like that. So it's a very manageable situation at the moment. Industry is much better prepared. Every manufacturer is there with fuel-efficient vehicles. Inventories are balanced. So it's a very orderly transition towards fuel efficiency and we probably have another $0.50 to a gallon to go to get something -- $1 a gallon to get something that would be comparable to '08."

Today we reported record adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.46 for the first quarter, a 35% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.34 for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit for all of our major categories improved compared to the first quarter of 2010 and our expense structure remained very disciplined. 
First quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.3 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 17% driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the first quarter, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 23%, or 20% on a same-store basis, which were in line with the industry according to CNW Research Data. 
In March, we began to see a mix shift, with consumers gradually moving to mid-size and small vehicles as gas prices increase, fuel efficiency has written on the consumer consideration shopping list and is now in the top 10 according to CNW.
We are, of course, supportive of the efforts of our Japanese-based partners as they work tirelessly to rebuild and begin production and bring it back online. To support the recovery efforts, AutoNation has made a donation of $100,000 to the American Red Cross. While the underlying recovery in consumer demand for autos remains on track in the United States due to Japanese supply constraints throughout the remainder of 2011, we are reducing our planning assumption for the 2011 full year U.S. industry sales to mid-12 million new vehicle units. 
Based on current information, we see significant reductions in vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers through year end with the resumption of normal shipment level in early 2012. 
I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million, or $0.46 per share, versus $58.8 billion, or $0.34 per share, during the first quarter of 2010, a 35% improveme",736,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million, or $0.46 per share, versus $58.8 billion, or $0.34 per share, during the first quarter of 2010, a 35% improvement on a per-share basis. During our fourth quarter conference call, we mentioned that we expected to earn approximately $9 million in performance-based manufacturer incentives over the following 2 quarters, primarily related to Premium Luxury vehicles previously sold. 
Our first quarter gross profit and operating income were favorably impacted by $4.6 million due to the recognition of these incentives. We expect to recognize approximately $4.5 million in operating income related to these incentives in the second quarter of 2011.
First quarter revenue increased $474.5 million or 17% compared to the prior year. Gross profit improved by $57.8 million or 11%, while SG&A was up $34.3 million or 9% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 72.0% for the quarter. Excluding the benefit from the manufacturer incentives previously mentioned, it would have been 72.6%. This represents an improvement of over 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2010, it also represents over 100 basis points sequential improvement, excluding the benefit from the incentives in both quarters. 
Although we’ve achieved strong SG&A performance to date, there's still further long-term benefit to be gained as we focus on technology and process improvements in our stores and in our Shared Service Center, as well as centralized procurement initiatives. Our scale and centralization efforts to date uniquely position us to take these next steps in SG&A improvements. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $4.7 million for the quarter, an improvement of $1.4 million compared to the $3.3 million benefit in the first quarter of 2010, due to an increase in floorplan assistance as a result of higher new vehicle sales, partially offset by an increase in floorplan interest expense due to higher average floorplan balances during the quarter. Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, up from $9 million we reported in the first quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels and increased percentage of fixed rate debt and increased spreads related to our refinancing in April of 2010.
During the quarter, we paid down $15 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $165 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of the first quarter. Our first quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.34 billion, an increase of $226 million compared to the first quarter of 2010, but a decrease of $11.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. 
LIBOR rates were relatively flat compared with the first quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $44.2 million or 38.6%. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $59 million at an average price of $32.84 per share. We ended the first quarter with 148.6 million shares outstanding and a $174 million Board authorization remaining for future share repurchases. 
During the quarter, as previously disclosed, we acquired a Toyota store in the Fort Myers market for approximately $64 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $25 million, and our CapEx estimate for the year remains at $140 million net of proceeds from related asset sales. 
Floorplan debt was approximately $1.65 billion at quarter end, down approximately $214 million from December 31, 2010 in-line with inventory levels. We remain within the limits of our financial covenants with the leverage ratio of 2.27x at the end of the quarter. Our indebtedness number in this calculation is not on a net debt basis, if we had applied the cash of our balance sheet plus cash available from used inventory flooring to a reduce debt, we would have lowered the ratio to 2.0x compared to the limit of 3.25x. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $84 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in strong total liquidity of approximately $570 million at the end of March. The strength of our balance sheet and the discipline of our cost structure will enable us to manage through the challenges presented by the Japanese product constraints. We are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business and capitalize on the long-term recovery in the automotive market. Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,128980848,117811,"AutoNation Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by st",1309,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. AutoNation delivered a strong performance in the quarter and I'll start by thanking our associates for their commitment and dedication in making it happen. 
Customers were in the market and we were ready as evidenced by strong year-over-year increases in new and used unit volume, making this the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for total retail volume. Revenue and total gross profit increased in all areas of our business, and we recorded an impressive operating margin of 4.2%.
Turning to detailed results. I'll begin with our segment performance. At $129 million, total segment income for the first quarter grew 22% or $23 million compared to the period a year ago with increases in all 3 segments as follows: Domestic segment income increased 34% to $43 million; Premium Luxury increased 18% to $55 million; and Import segment income increased 15% to $58 million. As I continue my comments, we'll be in a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. 
During the first quarter, AutoNation retailed 54,200 new vehicles, an increase of 8,900 units or 20% compared to the period a year ago. First quarter new vehicle same-store revenue increased $286 million, or 20%, to $1.75 billion on increased volume, driven by stronger customer demand. 
A $2,266 gross profit per new vehicle retail was relatively flat compared to the period a year ago, and gross profit as a percent of revenue of 7% was off by 10 basis points. This was driven by a decline in margins of the Import segment due to the competitive environment, which was partially offset by the recognition of special performance-based manufacturer incentives which we discussed on our previous call. 
Excluding the $4.6 million of special performance-based manufacturer incentives in the quarter, gross profit per new vehicle retailed was $2,181, a reduction of $91 or 4%, and gross profit as a percent of revenue was 6.8%. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, again excluding the special performance-based manufacturer incentives, we saw an improvement in the gross profit per new vehicle retailed of $18. 
At March 31, new vehicle days supply was 50 days or 40,800 units compared to 51 days a year ago and 63 days at December 31.
Next, used vehicles, where we're very pleased with our results. AutoNation retailed 41,300 used vehicles in the quarter, which drove a unit volume increase of 10% compared to the period a year ago and a used-to-new ratio of 0.76:1. 
As tight inventories and increasing demand move prices higher, same-store retail used revenue was up 11% to $714 million, and revenue per used vehicle retailed of $17,300 increased $224 compared to the period a year ago. Same-store used vehicle gross profit of $73 million reflected an increase of 15%, while gross profit per used vehicle retailed at $1,757 grew $78, or 5%, compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue at 10.1% grew 30 basis points.
I'd like to provide a quick update on our Value VehiclesOutlets, an initiative in its early stages to retail value-priced vehicles that we would have traditionally wholesaled. Today, we have 22 locations in operation, with 6 more planned by the end of Q3. We are very pleased with the continued growth of this program, which is an important part of our strategy to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand. 
Another important component is winning more trades, which we addressed by viewing every customer visit as a trade opportunity and ensuring our appraisal process that actively involves the customer is consistently executed. I'll also note that in the quarter, we moved nearly 12,000 used vehicles from originating stores to a more optimal location relative to turn and PVR [per vehicle retailed]. In continued experience, good success at retail with this program. At March 31, used vehicle days supply was 42 days in line with our adjusted targeted days supply.
For parts, service and collision compared to the period -- compared to the quarter a year ago, same-store revenue of $557 million increased $19 million or 4%. We are very pleased to deliver another solid performance on the customer pay side, where customer pay revenue grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, and was up 4% year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. 
We attribute the upward trend in customer pay revenue to improving market conditions and better execution in the service drive. Parts, service and collision gross profit of $239 million was up $2 million or 1% compared to a year ago. In the quarter, increases of 2% in customer pay service gross and a 7% increase in internal gross, more than offset a 4% decline in warranty gross. 
Gross profit as a percent of revenue was off 120 basis points to 42.9% compared to a year-ago. We attribute this to a shift in mix toward internal as well as a shift within customer pay resulting from our initiatives to grow tires and maintenance to drive customer retention. I'll also note that the warranty comp in a period a year ago included the Toyota recalls.
Turning to F&I. Gross profit per vehicle retailed of $1,137 remain strong but up slightly versus a year ago, with improvements in the rate of product commissions, offset by product chargebacks and lower retrospective commissions on vehicle service contract programs. The credit environment was again favorable compared to a year ago and stable sequentially. In the quarter, we noted key non-prime and sub-prime lenders were buying deeper year-over-year. 
At March 31, our store portfolio stood at 209 stores and 243 franchises, representing 31 brands and 15 states. Changes from our Q4 2010 call are the completion of the acquisition of Ft. Myers Toyota and the separation of franchises at 2 locations. One where we separated MINI from BMW in Northern California, and the other where we separated Mitsubishi from Chevrolet in Houston. We remain confident regarding the long-term-outlook for our business and are continuing to invest in our future growth. 
Year-to-date, we've completed 8 of 16 major facility projects slated for 2011. We've opened 2 brand new state-of-the-art ad points, Mercedes-Benz of Stanford and Central Florida, and Mercedes-Benz of Coconut Creek in South Florida. Relocations to new ground up facilities include Leesburg Honda, now called Honda of Dulles, Team Hyundai of Mall of Georgia and Mercedes-Benz of Sarasota. 
We opened Fiat South Bay in Southern California after renovating an existing vacant facility, and completed the extensive renovation of Mercedes-Benz of Orlando and Mercedes-Benz of Westmont in the Chicago market.
Looking ahead, we continue to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market, brand and return-on-investment criteria. 
Before I close, I'd like to touch on how we're addressing the reduction in Japanese production. We've implemented a substantial number of tactical moves to address potential impacts with the goal of maximizing our inventories and optimizing gross. 
Our revised operating plan includes: benchmarking and tactical adjustments of market pricing in new and used vehicles; increased acquisition of used inventory outside of auctions; a significant marketing shift to promote our broad selection of domestic and used inventory, as well as our fixed operation business; and an aggressive management of variable expenses. With the full extent of the industry impact not yet known, we believe that our disciplined approach coupled with an operating model that's diversified by brand, geography and revenue stream, positions us well to successfully navigate the anticipated disruption.
In closing, in the quarter, AutoNation continue to drive top-line growth and margin growth as well as delivered a record EPS in the first quarter and an industry selling rate of 13 million units. We did it with low associate turnover, high customer satisfaction, a disciplined cost structure and a 1-team-1-goal spirit. I'd like to thank our associates and share that we're very optimistic about the future of our company. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

So that really says you have a good supply. Through April and May, you will begin to see the first sign of disruption. I think then, the Japanese dealers are very skilled at working with lower inventories, they've done it for years so there can be significant inventory reduction before there is a meaningful impact on sales. But I think May, June, you begin to feel the disruption on the production. And certainly July, there will be meaningful shortages of Japanese products. I think on the front-end grosses and margins, we fully expected in the journey back to 16 million units and with increasing demand that we would be able to improve those margins in that journey. And I certainly believe in this period here, where there's going to be a significant differential between demand and supply, you will see improvement in front end margins.

And I think in Mike and I's 40 years experience in this business, I don't think I've ever said that in the auto industry. So this is an unprecedented supply restraint and to continue the conversation, in all our discussion with the domestic and the German, there is a sense that they're working hard to maintain their original production plans, but they have given us no indication yet that they're able to increase production beyond the original plans, that they are dealing with part supply issues from the Japanese also. 
So it's really a supply constrained situation. So I'm not sure the availability is going, at the domestic, it is going to be able to bridge the gap with the shortage of the Japanese in the total year. So it's clearly going to be a margin situation. I will say though in principle, the domestics have a much more attractive offering than they did 5 to 10 years ago, both from design, quality and certainly, from fuel efficiency. So they're well positioned to be attractive to Japanese traffic, and I think you'll have a compelling offer for them. But how much of that can really occur? I can't say. And that's the reason why we reduced our forecast for our industry sales to the mid-12 million.

Our goal is to gain supply at the doors, as we call it in our dealerships, to try and win more appraisals. We're aggressively going after every single appraisal. I don't think our business model is just standing at the auction and buying a large numbers of vehicle. So I think there is opportunity. Certainly, the prices are strong. We've changed a number of our policies, aging and wholesale, and are really trying to get our inventories up, which we've done successfully.

We're saying the pie is going to be smaller because of production constraints, the big production constraints are with the Japanese. The domestics have confirmed that they'll hit their original production plans with the content and configuration issues but they'll hit the original production plan, so they will take share.

We have not seen a significant impact on trading values or residual values of trucks or large cars as we did in '08 where those vehicles took a 15% to 20% hit. And I think the number where people really overact or panic or freak out is indeed higher than $4 a gallon, it's probably $4.50 to $5 a gallon, something like that. So it's a very manageable situation at the moment. Industry is much better prepared. Every manufacturer is there with fuel-efficient vehicles. Inventories are balanced.

Today we reported record earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.49 for the second quarter, a 29% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.38 adjusted EPS for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit for all our major categories, new use, financial assurance of parts and service, improved compared to the second quarter of 2010 and our expense structure remained very disciplined.
Second quarter, 2011 revenue totaled $3.3 billion compared to $3.1 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 8%, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle averages retail selling prices based on CNW Research Data. In the second quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales decreased 2%. In the second quarter, AutoNation's total new vehicle unit sales were flat and on a same-store basis, declined 4%. This quarter once again demonstrated that our diversified business model is the right strategy as well as our ability to rapidly adopt to change and execute effectively in a changing market place. In light of the Japanese supply constraint, we have just berated operating plan to optimize our inventories and maximize gross profit. We drove impressive results in the second quarter, increasing total gross profit by 10% over the prior year due to an increase in gross profit on both new and used vehicles. On a per vehicle basis, gross profit increased 26% for new and 11% for used. We applaud the efforts of our Japanese based partner as they work nonstop to rebuild and bring production back online. We estimate that the vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers were approximately 40% below planned levels in the second quarter and that by September they will be approximately 10% to 15% below planned levels. While improved supply environment may mitigate the peak that import PVR experienced in the second quarter, we expect that import margins will remain strong in the third quarter. We expect the new vehicle sales environment will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter of 2011. I now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $73.3 billion or $0.49 per share versus adjusted net income of $62.1 billion or $0.38 per share during the second quarter of 2010, a 29% improvement on a per-share basis. Our second quarter prior year results exclude $12.1 million after tax or $0.07 per share of expenses related to debt financing cost. There were no adjustments to net income in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted to income are included in the reconciliation provided in our press release. During our last quarterly conference call, we indicated we expected to recognize approximately $4.5 million of operating income in the second quarter related to performance-based manufacturer incentives on premium luxury vehicles previously sold. Due to delays in construction projects, the favorable impact of second quarter gross profit and operating income was only $1.4 million. We expect to recognize the remaining incentives under this program in the second half of 2011. Second quarter revenue increased to $32 million or 8% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved by $54.1 million or 10% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.6% for the quarter and this represents 80 basis points sequential improvement excluding to benefit from the premium luxury performance incentives in both quarters. We achieved this improvement despite approximately $5 million or $0.02 per share in cost related to hail storms which impacted some of our stores in several states during the quarter. This SG&A results were achieved in the quarter with a sale of approximately 12 million units, highlighting the current benefits of Shared Service Center and low-cost platform. The last time our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was below 72% was in the third quarter of 2007 which is prior to the recession. Our cost structure and further benefit as we continue to implement best practices and technology tools and as volume fully recovers.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $3.4 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the $4.7 million benefit in the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher corporate interest expense driven by higher inventory levels compared to the prior year period. Nonvehicle interest expense was $15.9 million for the quarter, an increase from the $14.7 million we reported in the second quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels and increased spreads related due to our refinancing in April of 2010. During the quarter, we borrowed $110 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $275 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of June. Our second quarter nonvehicle debt balance was $1.45 billion, an increase of $77.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. LIBOR rates were 11 basis points lower than average compared to the second quarter of 2010. Provision for income tax for the quarter was $45.1 billion or 38.1%. During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 3.4 million shares for $110.9 million at an average balance of $33.04 per share. We ended the second quarter with 145.7 million shares outstanding. In May, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million under our existing share repurchase program and at the end of June, $314 million dollars of authorization was remaining for future share repurchases.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million. Our CapEx estimate for the year remains at approximately $140 million net of proceeds from rated asset sales. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.67 billion at quarter end, an increase of approximately $21 million from March 31, 2011 in line with inventory levels. Last week, Standard & Poor's upgraded AutoNation's corporate credit rating to investment grade as a reflection of our strong operating execution, diversified business model and disciplined financial management. Our robust balance sheet continues to be industry-leading and we will remain well within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio at June 30 was 2.39x or 2.1x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability compared to the limit of 3.25x. Our quarter end cash balance was $82 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in a healthy total liquidity of approximately $482 million at the end of June. We again demonstrated the agility of the RO retail model in our leadership position as we navigate successfully through the Japanese supply destroys. We continue to operate a business with a solid balance sheet and strong cash flow generation and remain focused on actively allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns. Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating, Mike Maroone"

We're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the resiliency of our strategic operating model coupled with strong operating execution allowed us to remain nimble and manage through the Japanese product disruption, to deliver revenue and both profit increases in all areas of our business along with an impressive operating margin of 4.3%.
Turning to detailed results. I'll begin with our segment performance. At $134 million, total segment income for the second quarter grew 50% or $17 million compared to the period a year ago with increases across all 3 segments. I'll note that $66 million is the Import segment income increased $30 million or 25% driven in large part by increase in new vehicle gross profit. It was a result of intense efforts to optimize our Import segment inventory in response to the supply constraints. As I continue my comments, will be in same-store basis unless noted otherwise. AutoNation retail 50,000 new vehicles in the second quarter, 4% for same stores compared to the period a year ago
Unit increases in Domestic and Premium Luxury were offset by import volume declines from limited supply. For total stores AutoNation was flat year-over-year compared to the industry being down a 2% at retail according to CNW. Looking at various geographies relative to retail volume, Texas continues to be our strongest market while markets in California and Florida are experiencing a more uneven recovery. New vehicles same-store revenue increased $33 billion or 2% to $1.7 billion driven by increased revenue per vehicle retail, particularly on imports due to supply and demand as well as increase for both domestic and Premium Luxury units sold. Gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $543 or 26% to $2,642 with increases in all 3 segments as follows. Imports increased $676, Premium Luxury was up $538, domestic, up $107. Significant contributing factor to gross profit PVR lift was a solid technical plan implanted across the enterprise for domestic import Premium Luxury segment with particular focus on optimizing the Japanese brand inventory while maximizing gross. This included developing a proprietary web-based pricing tool to capture various market pricing metrics and establish target and floor prices for each model in every brand. We're adjusting both new and unused prices to optimize traffic in sales. New vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 120 basis points to 7.8%. At June 30, new vehicle days supply was 59 day or 38,900 units compared to 55 days and 37,500 units a year ago.
Turning to used vehicles. AutoNation retailed 42,000 used vehicles in the quarter, a 3% increase compared to period a year ago. Our new to used ratio was 0.83:1. In the quarter, same-store retail used vehicle revenue of $766 million rose 9% year-over-year and revenue per used vehicle retailed at $18,400 dollars increased 6% or $1,004 compared to the period a year ago. Steady demand and continued tight inventory availability for the industry kept used prices high in the quarter. Same-store used vehicle gross profit is $75 billion reflected an increase of 14% while gross profit per vehicle retailed at $1,800 grew $174 or 11% compared to the period a year ago, both driven in large part by demand in the Import segment where some new vehicles intenders moved to used vehicles. Used vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue at 9.8% grew 40 basis points. At June 30, used vehicle days supply was 47 days compared to 44 a year ago and 42 days at March 31. During the quarter, we ramped up our used vehicle inventory with a time line on the Japanese disruption the new vehicle inventory was anticipated to be longer. We are now prudently working through that inventory to reduce our used day supply to better prepare for seasonal pricing adjustments.
Two final items I'll mentioned relative to used vehicles
First during the quarter, we've moved 10,500 used vehicles from their originating stores the stores where they should have quick return time and higher PVRs. Second, we now have 26 Value Vehicle Outlets in operation with 3 more scheduled to open in the third quarter. we created the Value Vehicles Outlets to retail value priced vehicle that we would have traditionally wholesale. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing growth of this program, which is an important part of our strategy to address industry supply constraints in mid market demand. For parts and service and collision compared to the quarter a year ago, center revenue of $559 million increased $12 million or 2%. We're pleased to note that our custom revenue of $187 billion was up $5 million or 3% making the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. Parts service included gross profit of $239 million was flat compared to a year ago with gross profit increases for customer pay service, internal and collision offset by decreases in warranty in wholesale and retail counterparts. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was up 90 basis points to 42.8% compared to a year-ago. We saw slight mix, slight shift in mix to our internal as well as a shift within customer pay resulting from our initiatives to grow tires and maintenance to drive customer retention. I'll also note that the warranty comparison in the period a year ago had the benefit of the Toyota recalls.
As I mentioned before, we are focused on growing customer pay revenue and gross and are pleased with the progress at both fronts as we continue to work to improve retail execution and our service drive across the enterprise.
Turning to F&I. Total gross profit in the quarter increased $9 million or 9% to $114 million on flat total retail volume year-over-year. Same-store gross profit per vehicle retailed was $1243 per vehicle, an increase of $109 or 10% compared to a year ago. We achieved this primarily due to improvement in both our rates and product commission and execution of our best practice processes at our stores In the quarter, we recognized favorable restrospective provisions related to products sold in higher volume years. We also continue to benefit from our strong lender network as well as a solid product penetration. The credit environment in the quarter was solid and stable while sequentially and year-over-year and we have noted expanded time parameters for key prime nonprime, subprime lenders year-over-year. At June 30, our store portfolio numbered 213 stores, 254 franchises, representing 32 brands in 15 states. Reconciling our store count to our Q1 of 2011 call, we opened ad points during the second quarter as follows: Mercedes-Benz at Coconut Creek in South Florida Mercedes-Benz of Sanford and Central Florida, Power Fiat of South Bay and Southern California and Team Fiat Mall of Georgia outside of Atlanta. We came into the year with an aggressive plan to build new facilities and undertake several major facility renovations, about 2/3 of the projects are completed, which include the opening of Team Fiat at Mall of Georgia and the extensive renovation of Infinity of South Bay in the second quarter. Seven  additional projects are slated for completion by year end.
Looking ahead, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria. In closing, AutoNation adopted well to challenges in the environment by delivering top line and margin growth as well as a record EPS for the third consecutive quarter. This growth occurred will also deliver an excellent CSI, low associate turnover and strong sales efficiency. We continue to take a long view by investing at facilities, technology and associate development. And on behalf of our executive team, I'd like to thank all of our associates over delivering an outstanding quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Jackson."

And we have thousands of customers who have told us that they are waiting for both the specific vehicle that they want and/or different incentives so I think they all come back in the market and we have a strong close with a monthly selling rate moving back over $30 million and by December, it's probably high $30 million, if not, $40 million for the month of September.

Everybody said let's take the high road here through this and not do anything abnormal. And on the other hand though, I think we're in a fragile recovery that if there is something unusual going on, I think it significantly affects sales. There's not nought demand that you can plow through something like this and not have an impact on sales. But it was the supply constrained impact on the sales rate and that's why I feel that as that situation normalizes, you have both a mini pent-up demand from the spring disruption and you have a macro pent-up demand in principle with the number of vehicles that have been deferred over the last several years and the agent of the carpool that they should have a pretty good selling rate for the second half, for the last part of the second half of the year."

So that's a positive. I think there will be some moderation on new vehicle margins as the supply improves but the principle, our goal has been to improve foreign end margin during the recovery journey from the absolute of the bottom back towards 15 million, 16 million units. So while there be some moderation to the strength of the let's say, a peak with the Japanese during the second quarter, I think that the trendline is such that we see permanent gains in front end margins exactly where they are, I can't say, but we see improvements in front end margins."

Today we reported record earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.49 for the second quarter, a 29% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.38 adjusted EPS for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit for all our major categories -- new, used, finance and insurance, parts and service -- improved compared to the second quarter of 2010, and our expense structure remained very disciplined.
Second quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.3 billion compared to $3.1 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 8%, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle averages retail selling prices based on CNW Research Data. In the second quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales decreased 2%. In the second quarter, AutoNation's total new vehicle unit sales were flat and on a same-store basis declined 4%. This quarter once again demonstrated that our diversified business model is the right strategy as well as our ability to rapidly adapt to change and execute effectively in a changing marketplace. In light of the Japanese supply constraints, we adjusted rated [ph] our operating plans to optimize our inventories and maximize gross profit. We drove impressive results in the second quarter, increasing total gross profit by 10% over the prior year due to an increase in gross profit on both new and used vehicles. On a per vehicle basis, gross profit increased 26% for new and 11% for used. We applaud the efforts of our Japanese based partner as they work nonstop to rebuild and bring production back online. We estimate that the vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers were approximately 40% below planned levels in the second quarter, and that by September they will be approximately 10% to 15% below planned levels. While the improved supply environment may mitigate the peak that import PVR experienced in the second quarter, we expect that import margins will remain strong in the third quarter. We expect the new vehicle sales environment will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter of 2011.

During our last quarterly conference call, we indicated that we expected to recognize approximately $4.5 million of operating income in the second quarter related to performance-based manufacturer incentives on premium luxury vehicles previously sold.

Second quarter revenue increased $232 million or 8% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved by $54.1 million or 10% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.6% for the quarter. This represents an 80 basis points sequential improvement excluding the benefit from the premium luxury performance incentives in both quarters. We achieved this improvement despite approximately $5 million or $0.02 per share in cost related to hail storms, which impacted some of our stores in several states during the quarter. This SG&A results were achieved in the quarter with a SAAR of approximately 12 million units, highlighting the current benefits of our Shared Service Center and low-cost platform. The last time our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was below 72% was in the third quarter of 2007, which is prior to the recession. Our cost structure can further benefit as we continue to implement best practices and technology tools and as volume recovers.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $3.4 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the $4.7 million benefit in the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher core financial [ph] expense driven by higher inventory levels compared to the prior-year period. Nonvehicle interest expense was $15.9 million for the quarter, an increase from the $14.7 million we reported in the second quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels and increased spreads related to our refinancing in April of 2010. During the quarter, we borrowed $110 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $275 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of June. Our second quarter nonvehicle debt balance was $1.45 billion, an increase of $77.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. LIBOR rates were 11 basis points lower on average compared with the second quarter of 2010. Provision for income tax in the quarter was $45.1  million or 38.1%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares for $110.9 million at an average balance of $33.04 per share. We ended the second quarter with 145.7 million shares outstanding. In May, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million under our existing share repurchase program, and at the end of June, $314 million dollars of Board [ph] authorization was remaining for future share repurchases.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million. Our CapEx estimate for the year remains at approximately $140 million net of proceeds from rated asset sales. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.67 billion at quarter end, an increase of approximately $21 million from March 31, 2011 in line with inventory levels. 
Last week, Standard & Poor's upgraded AutoNation's corporate credit rating to investment grade as a reflection of our strong operating execution, diversified business model and disciplined financial management. Our robust balance sheet continues to be industry-leading, and we will remain well within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio at June 30 was 2.39x or 2.1x on a net jdebt basis, including used floorplan availability compared to the limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $82 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in a healthy total liquidity of approximately $482 million at the end of June. We again demonstrated the agility of the auto retail model in our leadership position as we navigated successfully through the Japanese supply constraints. We continue to operate the business with a solid balance sheet and strong cash flow generation and remain focused on actively allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns. 
Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,137042695,146913,"AutoNation Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike and good morning. We're very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The resiliency of our strategic operating model, coupled with strong operating execution, allowed us to remain nimble and manage through the Japanese product disruption",1308,"Thanks, Mike and good morning. We're very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The resiliency of our strategic operating model, coupled with strong operating execution, allowed us to remain nimble and manage through the Japanese product disruption to deliver revenue and gross profit increases in all areas of our business along with an impressive operating margin of 4.3%.
Turning to detailed results. I'll begin with our segment performance. At $134 million, total segment income for the second quarter grew 15% or $17 million compared to the period a year ago with increase across all 3 segments. I'll note that at $66 million, the Import segment income increased $13 million or 25% driven in large part by increased new vehicle gross profit. It was a result of intense efforts to optimize our Import segment inventory in response to the supply constraints. 
As I continue my comments, we'll be in a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. AutoNation retailed 50,000 new vehicles in the second quarter, [indiscernible] 4% for same stores compared to the period a year ago.
Unit increases in Domestic and Premium Luxury were offset by import volume declines from limited supply. For total stores, AutoNation was flat year-over-year compared to the industry being down 2% at retail, according to CNW. Looking at various geographies relative to retail volume, Texas continues to be our strongest market, while markets in California and Florida are experiencing a more uneven recovery. New vehicles same-store revenue increased $33 million or 2% to $1.7 billion driven by increased revenue per vehicle retail, particularly on imports due to supply and demand as well as increase for both Domestic and Premium Luxury units sold. Gross profit for new vehicle retail increased $543 or 26% to $2,642 with increases in all 3 segments as follows: Imports increased $676, Premium Luxury was up $538, Domestic, up $107. A significant contributing factor to gross profit PVR lift was a solid tactical plan implanted across the enterprise for domestic Import and Premium Luxury segments, with particular focus on optimizing the Japanese brand inventory while maximizing gross. This included developing a proprietary web-based pricing tool to capture various market pricing metrics and establish target in floor prices for each model in every brand. We're adjusting both new and used prices to optimize traffic in sales. New vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 120 basis points to 7.8%. At June 30, new vehicle days supply was 59 day or 38,900 units compared to 55 days and 37,500 units a year ago.
Turning to used vehicles. AutoNation retailed 42,000 used vehicles in the quarter, a 3% increase compared to the period a year ago. Our used to new ratio was 0.83:1. In the quarter, same-store retail used vehicle revenue of $766 million rose 9% year-over-year, and revenue per used vehicle retailed at $18,400 dollars increased 6% or $1,004 compared to the period a year ago. Steady demand and continued tight inventory availability for the industry kept used prices high in the quarter. Same-store used vehicle gross profit is $75 million reflected an increase of 14%, while gross profit for vehicle retailed at $1,800 grew $174 or 11% compared to the period a year ago, both driven in large part by demand in the Import segment, where some new vehicles intenders moved to used vehicles. Used vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue at 9.8% grew 40 basis points. At June 30, used vehicle days supply was 47 days compared to 44 a year ago and 42 days at March 31. During the quarter, we ramped up our used vehicle inventory when the timeline on the Japanese disruption the new vehicle inventory was anticipated to be longer. We are now prudently working through that inventory to reduce our used day supply to better prepare for seasonal pricing adjustments.
Two final items I'll mentioned relative to used vehicles. First, during the quarter, we've moved 10,500 used vehicles from their originating stores, the stores where they should have quicker turn time and higher PVR. Second, we now have 26 Value Vehicle Outlets in operation with 3 more scheduled to open in the third quarter. we created the Value Vehicles Outlets in operation, with 3 more scheduled to open in the third quarter. We created the Value Vehicle Outlets to retail value priced vehicle that we would have traditionally wholesaled. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing growth of this program, which is an important part of our strategy to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand. 
For parts service and collision compared to the quarter a year ago, same-store revenue of $559 million increased $12 million or 2%. I'm pleased to note that our customer pay revenue of $187 million was up $5 million or 3%, making the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. Parts service including gross profit of $239 million was flat compared to a year ago, with gross profit increases for customer pay service, internal and collision offset by decreases in warranty in wholesale and retail counterparts. Gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 90 basis points to 42.8% compared to a year-ago. We saw a slight mix, slight shift in mix toward internal as well as a shift within customer pay resulting from our initiatives to grow tires and maintenance to drive customer retention. I'll also note that the warranty comparison in the period a year ago had the benefit of the Toyota recall.
As I mentioned before, we are focused on growing customer pay revenue and gross and are pleased with the progress on both fronts as we continue to work to improve retail execution in our service drive across the enterprise.
Turning to F&I. Total gross profit in the quarter increased $9 million or 9% to $114 million on flat total retail volume year-over-year. Same-store gross profit per vehicle retailed was $1,243 per vehicle, an increase of $109 or 10% compared to a year ago. We attribute this primarily to improvement in both rate and product commission and a crisp execution of our best practice processes at our stores. In the quarter, we recognized favorable restrospective commissions related to products sold in higher volume years. We also continue to benefit from our strong preferred lender network as well a a solid product penetration. The credit environment in the quarter was solid and stable while sequentially and year-over-year, and we have noted expanded buying parameters for key prime, nonprime, and subprime lenders year-over-year. 
At June 30, our store portfolio numbered 213 stores, 254 franchises, representing 32 brands in 15 states. Reconciling our store count to our Q1 2011 call, we opened ad points during the second quarter as follows: Mercedes-Benz of Coconut Creek in South Florida, Mercedes-Benz of Sanford and Central Florida, Power Fiat of South Bay and Southern California and Team Fiat Mall of Georgia outside of Atlanta. We came into the year with an aggressive plan to build new facilities and undertake several major facility renovations. About 2/3 of the projects are completed, which include the opening of Team Fiat Mall at Georgia and the extensive renovation of Infinity of South Bay in the second quarter. Seven additional projects are slated for completion by year end.
Looking ahead, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria. In closing, AutoNation adapted well to challenges in the environment by delivering top line and margin growth as well as record EPS for the third consecutive quarter. This growth occurred while also delivering excellent CSI,low associate turnover and strong sales efficiency. We continue to take a long view by investing at facilities, technology and associate development. And on behalf of our executive team, I'd like to thank all of our associates over delivering an outstanding quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Jackson."

And we have thousands of customers who have told us they are waiting for both the specific vehicle that they want and/or different incentives, so I think they all come back into the market and we have a strong clue with a monthly selling rate moving back over $30 million and by December, it's probably high $30 million, if not, $40 million for the month of September. You average all that out though, it's still in mid $12 million in my mind that we end up with and the one caveat of course is that assuming that in Washington, D.C., there is some sort of debt deal that gives roadmap to fiscal responsibility."

Everybody said, let's take the high road here through this and not do anything abnormal. And on the other hand though, I think we're in a fragile recovery that if there is something unusual going on, I think it significantly affects sales. There's not enough demand that you can plow through something like this and not have it impact sales. But it was the supply constrained impact on the sales rate and that's why I feel that as that situation normalizes, you have both a mini pent-up demand from the spring disruption and you have a macro pent-up demand in principle with the number of vehicles that have been deferred over the last several years and the ages of the carpool that -- it should have a pretty good selling rate for the second half -- for the last part of the second half of the year."

So that's a positive. I think there will be some moderation on new vehicle margins as the supply improves but in principle, our goal has been to improve front end margins during the recovery journey from the absolute of this, of a bottom to back towards 15.5 million, 16 million units.

The second is in our shared service center and shared service center related capabilities whether that's our payroll center or a purchasing area. And so that as you know, is a focus item. And within this quarter in particular, we did call out a hail item that affected several of our stores that was about $5 million in the quarter of additional spend that we haven't expected. So that would adjust that number by almost a point in terms of SG&A as a percentage of gross. And in terms of thinking it out a little bit further, there have been periods in AutoNation's history where we've operated with SG&A as a percentage of gross below 70%.

Today we reported record earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.49 for the second quarter, a 29% increase on a per-share basis as compared to $0.38 adjusted EPS for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit for all of our major categories -- new, used, finance and insurance, parts and service -- improved compared to the second quarter of 2010, and our expense structure remained very disciplined.
Second quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.3 billion compared to $3.1 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 8%, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle averages retail selling prices based on CNW Research Data. In the second quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales decreased 2%. In the second quarter, AutoNation's total new vehicle unit sales were flat and on a same-store basis declined 4%. This quarter once again demonstrated that our diversified business model is the right strategy as well as our ability to rapidly adapt to change and execute effectively in a changing marketplace. In light of the Japanese supply constraints, we [indiscernible] our operating plan to optimize our inventories and maximize gross profit. We drove impressive results in the second quarter, increasing total gross profit by 10% over the prior year due to an increase in gross profit on both new and used vehicles. On a per-vehicle basis, gross profit increased 26% for new and 11% for used. We applaud the efforts of our Japanese-based partner as they work nonstop to rebuild and bring production back online. We estimate that the vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers were approximately 40% below planned levels in the second quarter, and that by September they will be approximately 10% to 15% below planned levels. While the improved supply environment may mitigate the peak that import PVRs experienced in the second quarter, we expect that import margins will remain strong in the third quarter. We expect the new vehicle sales environment will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter of 2011.

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $73.3 million or $0.49 per share versus adjusted net income of $62.1 million or $0.38 per share during the second quarter of 2010, a 29% improvement on a per-share basis. Our second quarter prior-year results exclude $12.1 million after-tax or $0.07 per share of expenses related to debt financing costs. There were no adjustments to net income in the second quarter of 2011. Adjustments to net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release. During our last quarterly conference call, we indicated that we expected to recognize approximately $4.5 million of operating income in the second quarter related to performance-based manufacturer incentives on premium luxury vehicles previously sold. Due to delays in construction projects, the favorable impact of second quarter gross profit and operating income was only $1.4 million. We expect to recognize the remaining incentives under this program in the second half of 2011. Second quarter revenue increased $232 million or 8% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved by $54.1 million or 10% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.6% for the quarter. This represents an 80 basis point sequential improvement excluding the benefit from the premium luxury performance incentives in both quarters. We achieved this improvement despite approximately $5 million or $0.02 per share in cost related to hail storms, which impacted some of our stores in several states during the quarter. This SG&A results were achieved in the quarter with a SAAR of approximately 12 million units, highlighting the current benefits of our Shared Service Center and low-cost platform. The last time our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was below 72% was in the third quarter of 2007, which is prior to the recession. Our cost structure can further benefit as we continue to implement best practices and technology tools and as volume recovers.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $3.4 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the $4.7 million benefit in the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher floorplan interest expense driven by higher inventory levels compared to the prior-year period. Non-vehicle interest expense was $15.9 million for the quarter, an increase from the $14.7 million we reported in the second quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels and increased spreads related to our refinancing in April of 2010. During the quarter, we borrowed $110 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $275 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of June. Our second quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.45 billion, an increase of $77.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. LIBOR rates were 11 basis points lower on average compared with the second quarter of 2010. Provision for income tax in the quarter was $45.1 million or 38.1%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares for $110.9 million at an average balance of $33.04 per share. We ended the second quarter with 145.7 million shares outstanding. In May, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million under our existing share repurchase program, and at the end of June, $314 million dollars of Board authorization was remaining for future share repurchases.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million. Our CapEx estimate for the year remains at approximately $140 million net of proceeds from related asset sales. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.67 billion at quarter-end, an increase of approximately $21 million from March 31, 2011 in line with inventory levels. 
Last week, Standard & Poor's upgraded AutoNation's corporate credit rating to investment grade as a reflection of our strong operating execution, diversified business model and disciplined financial management. Our robust balance sheet continues to be industry-leading, and we will remain well within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio at June 30 was 2.39x or 2.1x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability compared to the limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $82 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in a healthy total liquidity of approximately $482 million at the end of June. We again demonstrated the agility of the auto retail model and our leadership position as we navigated successfully through the Japanese supply constraints. We continue to operate the business with a solid balance sheet and strong cash flow generation and remain focused on actively allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns. 
Now let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,137042695,147039,"AutoNation Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2011",2011-07-27,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike and good morning. We're very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The resiliency of our strategic operating model, coupled with strong operating execution, allowed us to remain nimble and manage through the Japanese product disruption",1287,"Thanks, Mike and good morning. We're very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The resiliency of our strategic operating model, coupled with strong operating execution, allowed us to remain nimble and manage through the Japanese product disruption to deliver revenue and gross profit increases in all areas of our business along with an impressive operating margin of 4.3%.
Turning to detailed results. I'll begin with our segment performance. At $134 million, total segment income for the second quarter grew 15% or $17 million compared to the period a year ago with increase across all 3 segments. I'll note that at $66 million, the Import segment income increased $13 million or 25% driven in large part by increased new vehicle gross profit. It was a result of intense efforts to optimize our Import segment inventory in response to the supply constraints. 
As I continue my comments, we'll be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. AutoNation retailed 50,000 new vehicles in the second quarter, [indiscernible] 4% for same stores compared to the period a year ago.
Unit increases in Domestic and Premium Luxury were offset by import volume declines from limited supply. For total stores, AutoNation was flat year-over-year compared to the industry being down 2% at retail, according to CNW. Looking at various geographies relative to retail volume, Texas continues to be our strongest market, while markets in California and Florida are experiencing a more uneven recovery. New vehicle same-store revenue increased $33 million or 2% to $1.7 billion driven by increased revenue per vehicle retailed, particularly on imports due to supply and demand as well as increase for both Domestic and Premium Luxury units sold. Gross profit for new vehicle retailed increased $543 or 26% to $2,642 with increases in all 3 segments as follows: Imports increased $676, Premium Luxury was up $538, Domestic, up $107. A significant contributing factor to gross profit PVR lift was a solid tactical plan implemented across the enterprise for domestic Import and Premium Luxury segments, with particular focus on optimizing the Japanese brand inventory while maximizing gross. This included developing a proprietary web-based pricing tool to capture various market pricing metrics and establish targets and poor [ph] prices for each model in every brand. We're adjusting both new and used prices to optimize traffic in sales. New vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 120 basis points to 7.8%. At June 30, new vehicle days supply was 59 day or 38,900 units compared to 55 days and 37,500 units a year ago.
Turning to used vehicles. AutoNation retailed 42,000 used vehicles in the quarter, a 3% increase compared to the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio was 0.83:1. In the quarter, same-store retail used vehicle revenue of $766 million rose 9% year-over-year, and revenue per used vehicle retailed at $18,400 dollars increased 6% or $1,004 compared to the period a year ago. Steady demand and continued tight inventory availability for the industry kept used prices high in the quarter. Same-store used vehicle gross profit is $75 million reflected an increase of 14%, while gross profit for vehicle retailed at $1,800 grew $174 or 11% compared to the period a year ago, both driven in large part by demand in the Import segment, where some new vehicle intenders moved to used vehicles. Used vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue at 9.8% grew 40 basis points. At June 30, used vehicle days supply was 47 days compared to 44 a year ago and 42 days at March 31. During the quarter, we ramped up our used vehicle inventory when the timeline on the Japanese disruption to new vehicle inventory was anticipated to be longer. We are now prudently working through that inventory to reduce our used day supply to better prepare for seasonal pricing adjustments.
Two final items I'll mentioned relative to used vehicles. First, during the quarter, we've moved 10,500 used vehicles from their originating stores to stores where they should have quicker turn time and higher PVRs. Second, we now have 26 Value Vehicle Outlets in operation with 3 more scheduled to open in the third quarter. We created the Value Vehicles Outlets to retail value-priced vehicle that we would have traditionally wholesaled. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing growth of this program, which is an important part of our strategy to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand. 
For parts service and collision compared to the quarter a year ago, same-store revenue of $559 million increased $12 million or 2%. I'm pleased to note that our customer pay revenue of $187 million was up $5 million or 3%, making the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. Parts service and collision gross profit of $239 million was flat compared to a year ago, with gross profit increases for customer pay service, internal and collision offset by decreases in warranty in wholesale and retail counterparts. Gross profit as a percent of revenue was up 90 basis points to 42.8% compared to a year-ago. We saw a slight mix, slight shift in mix toward internal as well as a shift within customer pay resulting from our initiatives to grow tires and maintenance to drive customer retention. I'll also note that the warranty comparison in the period a year ago had the benefit of the Toyota recalls.
As I mentioned before, we are focused on growing customer pay revenue and gross and are pleased with the progress on both fronts as we continue to work to improve retail execution in our service drives across the enterprise.
Turning to F&I. Total gross profit in the quarter increased $9 million or 9% to $114 million on flat total retail volume year-over-year. Same-store gross profit per vehicle retailed was $1,243 per vehicle, an increase of $109 or 10% compared to a year ago. We attribute this primarily to improvement in both rate and product commissions and a crisp execution of our best practice processes at our stores. In the quarter, we recognized favorable retrospective commissions related to products sold in higher volume years. We also continue to benefit from our strong preferred lender network as well solid product penetration. The credit environment in the quarter was solid and stable both sequentially and year-over-year, and we noted expanded buying parameters for key prime, nonprime, and sub-prime lenders year-over-year.
 
At June 30, our store portfolio numbered 213 stores, 254 franchises, representing 32 brands in 15 states. Reconciling our store count to our Q1 2011 call, we opened ad points during the second quarter as follows: Mercedes-Benz of Coconut Creek in South Florida, Mercedes-Benz of Sanford and Central Florida, Power Fiat of South Bay and Southern California and Team Fiat Mall of Georgia outside of Atlanta. We came into the year with an aggressive plan to build new facilities and undertake several major facility renovations. About 2/3 of the projects are completed, which includes the opening of Team Fiat Mall at Georgia and the extensive renovation of Infinity of South Bay in the second quarter. Seven additional projects are slated for completion by year end.
Looking ahead, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria. In closing, AutoNation adapted well to challenges in the environment by delivering top line and margin growth as well as record EPS for the third consecutive quarter. This growth occurred while also delivering excellent CSI, low associate turnover and strong sales efficiency. We continue to take a long view by investing in facilities, technology and associate development. And on behalf of our executive team, I'd like to thank all of our associates for delivering an outstanding quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Jackson."

And I think you really begin to see normalization of those activities starting in September. So I think we still face a couple disrupted months that will impact the sales rate, and then as you build towards the end of the year, I really see everyone who's probably under-budget on marketing cost this year try to drive through their year-end targets. And we have thousands of customers who have told us they’re waiting for both the specific vehicle that they want and/or different incentives, so I think they all come back into the market and we have a strong close with the monthly selling rate moving back over $13 million and by December, it's probably high- $13 million if not $14 million for the month of September. You average all that out though, it's still in mid- $12 million in my mind that we end up with and the one caveat of course is that’s assuming that in Washington, D.C., there is some sort of debt deal that gives a roadmap to fiscal responsibility."

Everybody said, let's take the high road here through this and not do anything abnormal. And on the other hand though, I think we're in a fragile recovery that if there is something unusual going on, I think it significantly affects sales. There's not enough demand that you can plow through something like this and not have it impact sales. But it was a supply-constrained impact on the sales rate and that's why I feel that as that situation normalizes, you have both a mini pent-up demand from the spring disruption and you have a macro pent-up demand in principle with the number of vehicles that have been deferred over the last several years and the age of the carpool that says you should have a pretty good selling rate for the second half -- for the last part of the second half of the year."

So that's a positive. I think there will be some moderation on new vehicle margins as the supply improves but in principle, our goal has been to improve front-end margins during the recovery journey from the absolute of this, of a bottom, to back towards 15.5 million, 16 million units. So while there'll be some moderations from the strength of the -- let's say, a peak with the Japanese during the second quarter, I think the trend line is such that we see permanent gains in front end margins exactly what they are, I can't say exactly, but we see improvements in front-end margins."

First is best process execution of all of our business processes, including cost control within our stores.

The second is in our shared service center and shared service center-related capabilities, whether that's our payroll center or our purchasing area. And so that as you know, is a focus item. And within this quarter in particular, we did call out a hail item that affected several of our stores that was about $5 million in the quarter of additional spend that we hadn't expected. So that would adjust that number by almost a point in terms of SG&A as a percentage of gross. And in terms of taking it out a little bit further, there have been periods in AutoNation's history where we've operated with SG&A as a percentage of gross below 70%.

Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48, a record for third quarter results, up 23% compared to the $0.39 in the third quarter of 2010. Operating income increased 19% to $144 million compared to the period a year ago. Third quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.5 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 7%, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle average selling prices. Based on CNW Research Data, in the third quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 1%. In the third quarter, AutoNation's total new vehicle unit sales were flat, and on same-store basis, declined 2% as of the Japanese earthquake affected availability of vehicles produced by the Japanese manufacturers. 
This quarter, we once again demonstrated that our diversified business model is the right strategy, as well as our ability to rapidly adapt to change and execute effectively in a changing marketplace. In light of the Japanese supply constraints, we adjusted our operating plan to optimize our inventories and maximize gross profit. While shipments from the Japanese manufacturers improved in the third quarter, inventory levels for these vehicles remained constrained. We would expect that the improving supply environment will result in sequentially lower margins on these vehicles in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $71 million or $0.48 per share versus $59 million or $0.39 per share during the third quarter of 2010, a 23% improvement on a per-share basis. There were no adjustments in net income in either period. 
Last quarter, we indicated that we expected to receive the remaining incentives under the premium luxury program during the second half of 2011. We did not receive any of these incentives during the third quarter, but expect to receive approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares to gross profit from incentives of $13 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Third quarter revenue increased $233 million or 7% compared to prior year, and gross profit improved by $30 million or 5% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.5% for the quarter, which represents a 240 basis point improvement compared to the year ago period. 
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $6.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.9 million compared to the $4.7 million benefit in the third quarter of 2010. This improvement was due to lower floorplan interest expense, driven by lower credit spreads compared to the prior year period. Floorplan assistance rates also increased compared to the third quarter of 2010. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.51 billion at quarter end, a decrease of approximately $162 million from June 30, 2011, in line with inventory levels. 
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.4 million for the quarter, an increase compared to the $16.1 million we reported in the third quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels. During the quarter, we borrowed $25 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $300 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of September. 
Our third quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.49 billion, an increase of $107 million compared to the third quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax for the quarter was $45 million or 38.8%. By comparison, this in the third quarter of 2010 was 37.5%, which reflected the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. 
From July 1, 2011, through October 19, 2011, we repurchased 7.2 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $34.45 per share. Today, we announced that our board authorized a repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of AutoNation common stock. AutoNation has $316 million now remaining in board authorization for share repurchase.  As of October 19, there were 139.9 million shares outstanding. 
We incurred $50 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, reflecting our commitment to continue to reinvest in the business. For the full year, we expect to incur $145 million in CapEx net of proceeds from related asset sales. We remain within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio at September 30 was 2.38x or 2.11x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability compared to our limit of 3.25x. Our quarter end cash balance was $67 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in a healthy total liquidity of $446 million at the end of September. 
Our robust balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and disciplined cost structure position us to continue to invest in our business. We remain focused on actively allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns. Now, let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."

In the quarter, we continue to navigate the Japanese product disruption and economic uncertainty while growing both revenue and total gross profit. We delivered strong new vehicle and financial insurance gross margins and a solid operating margin of 4.1%, a 40 basis point improvement year-over-year. 
Third quarter total segment income of $134 million grew 22% or $24 million compared to the period a year ago, with increases across all 3 segments. $65 million import segment income increased $14 million or 27% for the second quarter. This improvement is attributable, in large part, to increased new vehicle gross profit as inventory supplier remained constrained. 
The Domestic segment, at $47 million, increased $4 million or 10%, and the most stable segment, Premium Luxury, increased $2 million or 4% to $50 million. 
As I continue my comments, we'll be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. In the quarter, AutoNation retailed 55,000 new vehicles, up 2% year-over-year for same stores, compared to the industry that was up 1% at retail according to CNW. Even with extremely tight supply of higher demand models in all segments, we realized increased unit sales of 12% in the Domestic segment and 11% in the Premium Luxury segment on a total store basis. However, these increases were largely offset by a drop of 10% in import volume due to the ongoing effect of the Japanese inventory disruption. 
From a geography standpoint, Texas continue as our strongest market in the quarter. Florida, in our Western markets where recovery for more heavily impacted by the Japanese inventory disruption due to the higher mix of large import stores in these states. At $1.8 billion, new vehicle same-store revenue increased $62 million or 4% driven by increased revenue per vehicle retailed, which at $33,000 was up $1,900 or 6%, with increases in each segment. 
Gross profit for new vehicle retailed of $2,456 reflects an increase of $462 or 23% with improvement across all 3 segments. New vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue was 7.3%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the period a year ago. We attribute these improvements to the tactical plan implemented in the second quarter in response to Japanese inventory disruptions. We also continued to utilize our proprietary web-based pricing tool described during our second quarter call.  The tool captured various market pricing metrics and establish as a target in for prices by model. 
While we are very pleased with strong new vehicle margin growth, we expect some moderation as inventory levels continue to normalize. I'll also note that in the fourth quarter of 2010, our new vehicle margin benefited by about $250 on a per vehicle basis from additional performance-based manufacturer incentives. 
In September 30, new vehicle days supply was 45 days or 34,000 units compared to 57 days or 42,000 units a year ago. Looking ahead, our new vehicle inventory will continue to build throughout the fourth quarter, and we expect to reach normal levels in the first quarter of 2012. 
Turning to used vehicles, AutoNation retailed 43,000 on a same-store basis in the quarter, up 1% versus the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.79, up from 0.76 year ago. Same-store retail used vehicle revenue of $776 million increased $33 million or 5% year-over-year. Revenue per used vehicle retail of $17,600 was up $560 or 3% as industry used vehicle prices remain strong in the quarter due to consumer demand and tight inventory availability. 
Same-store retail used vehicle gross profit of $66 million declined 2%, and gross profit per vehicle retailed at $1,529, was up 3% compared to the period a year ago. In the quarter, we noted a 6% increase in appraisals and a 7% increase in trade-ins acquired compared to the period a year ago, with a close ratio of 47%. I'll also note that we continue to move used vehicles to locations that will drive a faster turn and higher gross.  In the period, we moved nearly 11,000 vehicles with good success at retail. 
At September 30, used vehicle days supply was 43 days compared to 46 days a year ago and 47 days at June 30. During the quarter, we've reduce our used vehicle days supply to better prepare for seasonal pricing changes, and we experienced moderate wholesale loss. 
Same-store parts service and collision revenues of $569 million increased $5 million or 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. We're pleased with our results in customer pay, where revenue increased up 3% to $193 million, marks the fifth consecutive second quarter of year-over-year increases. This gain was more than offset by a significant decline in warranty revenue where our repair order count trap up about 10% year-over-year. We attribute this to the ongoing trend of fewer units in operations and improved vehicle quality. 
Gross profit of $238 million declined $8 million or 3% compared to the quarter a year ago. Customer pay gross profit grew by 2%. However, gains here were offset by a 15% decline in warranty gross profit. 
As for pay, gross profit was up for the fifth consecutive quarter year-over-year, driven in part by aggressive efforts to grow tires sales and other lower margins service offerings increase in customer retention. I'll also note, there was one last working day in the quarter compared to the year ago. Turning to F&I, we continue to be pleased with our industry-leading performance. Total gross profit in the quarter was $119 million, an increase of $7 million or 7% compared to a year ago. Same-store gross profit for vehicle retailed was $1,200, $1,214 per vehicle, up $84 or 7% compared to a year ago. Results continue to be driven by solid process execution, which drove improved rate and product commissions. 
We continue to benefit from our strong preferred lender network for prime, nonprime and subprime, as well as strong product penetration. The credit environment was solid and stable in the quarter. 
At September 30, our store portfolio numbered 214 stores and 257 franchises, representing 32 brands in 15 states. In the quarter, we opened Go Fiat in Denver and added 2 Smart franchises to existing Mercedes-Benz stores. Our corporate real estate team is also wrapping up several other significant projects that are slated for completion by year end. 
Looking ahead, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our market plan and return on investment criteria. 
In closing, in the quarter, we delivered a 19% increase in operating income, along with record third quarter EPS. We did it with best effort customer satisfaction levels, low associate turnover, a disciplined cost structure and one team, one goal approach. I'd like to thank all of our 20,000 associates for their commitment and dedication to AutoNation. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

First, we given up above where we think the industry and the market is going and they are. And there, we are convinced that this market is on a journey back to something around 16 million units plus or minus 500,000 either way. And I think there's 3 fundamental drivers to that. There's definite pent-up demand, genuine replacement need. The cars that we are creating everyday in looking at are old and tired, and the customers want to trade them in, with the average age pushing 11 years. At the same time, for the brands we represent, every manufacturers there was a fantastic products with a full spectrum of small cars through pickup trucks. And finally, financing for our customers is very much available and very much at attractive rates. The banks and the finance companies during this disruptive period from '08 till today really took minimal, if any, losses in automotive retail. And consequently, since there's still stress in commercial real estate and the whole mortgage market in small business loans, they are really interested in the automotive space. So those 3 factors of genuine replacement need, exciting new products and very good financing available convinces me that we're on the road back to 16 million. And the only debate is the rate of the recovery. I think then, also speaking of '08, '09 and '10, if you look at AutoNation's performance and everyone's validation of the work that we were doing with our eye on the long term, I mean that was the ultimate test. And if you look at our performance a while for the competition, I think we really distinguished ourselves. Now having said all of that, we don't give forward guidance per se. We say, hey, look at our past performance. Look at where we think the market is going and the rest is really up to you."

Let me just add a thought on the operating leverage because I think that's tangentially related to the question that you asked. And I think what we've tried to communicate in the past is we think right now, our operating costs structure is about 50% fixed and 50% variable. And with the variable elements largely being compensation and things that are commission and structure based. As time passes, we would expect to see that leverage continued to drop to the bottom line and we're operating at really dramatically improved SG&A as a percentage of growth from where we were a year or 2 ago, but we're still not back from where we've been in the past. We've been down below 70% as in SG&A as a percentage of gross in  the past. And our goal is to get back there and continue to drive that number lower. And we have been investing as Mike mentioned throughout the downturn in some of the very important initiative that we have been including our Shared Service Center, and that's coming along very well. We're almost done with the rollout of that. We've one regional left to go that we should do next year, as well as building new capabilities.

There were some real concerns that is Toyota and Honda restocked, that we're going to see this new round of pricing awards as they try to call back some of their lost market share, which I'm not sure I would really agree with. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that. Specifically because it doesn't make a lot sense to me given the inventory is tight across the board and probably will still be tight there. It just seems not to be too logical but, there's a real prevailing thought that pricing might erode significantly and may impact your business, as well as the industry at large."

In principle, I see a much more rational, sustainable industry than what we've had in the past. And I think the manufacturers have really fundamentally changed their outlook. Not to say it won't be competitive, but I really don't see a price war being unleashed as the Japanese availability improves in the marketplace. I think incentives will step up somewhat. But my sense on the domestic is that they know they stabilized their share. They may even have improved their share somewhat, but they have a spike in share due to the lack of availability by the Japanese. And I don't see any steps on their part to do mega-programs like that we had in the summer of '05 of employee pricing in order to try to keep their share at $47.5. So I don't expect that. I expect it would be a normal marketing between here and now and by that I mean aggressive and competitive. But no attempt to say that the domestics have to stay in the high 40s. Having said all of that, I think we have had an extraordinary detour away from normal marketing for 6 months with this unique situation with the Japanese. We learned a lot from it with our pricing tools. Some of that I think is a permanent value to us, but they'll probably some impact on front and gross profit going to the fourth quarter.

I think when I arrived, it was something like 530 million shares outstanding. And today we're at 140 million shares outstanding. And if you look at how we bought in this last quarter again, we did it opportunistically. There's a lot of volatility in the equity market that applies to us also. The large price swings and within the quarter and we saw moments where we could step in and take advantage of it. Whether we have those types of opportunities in the future, no one knows. We don't know. So again, we have the same capital allocation approach that we've had since I've been here. And there is no end game specific in mind. We decided on a quarter-by-quarter basis looking at the opportunities on acquisitions.

We retailed 4,300 of those in the quarter at lower margins, but we believe we're expanding our customer base in doing so. So that was one. Our secondly is as the inventory disruption occurred, we got very aggressive buying Hondas, Toyotas and other import products. And frankly, the market shifted slightly as they began to resume production. That production resumption was a little bit ahead of schedule. And so what we did is we liquidated some of that inventory and took small wholesale losses, but also took lower retail grocers. So that it was a little bit of an unusual situation, but we felt that we wanted to get right sized so that we could compete in both the new and used vehicle business.
I think the third factor is that the Premium Luxury segment had far less return, and those were generally high margin business that we did not, we were not able to take advantage of them that the quarter. So all in all our used car business was up slightly. We did give up a little bit of gross, but we feel very good about our position today, and our inventories are clean and in good shape.

And the entire organization is focused on it. It's not just the finance organization. I would point out that these ratios have both a numerator and a nominator to it, and the partnership that exists between the finance organization and the operations team at AutoNation is one of the hallmarks of the company. And because we're able to work together and identify benchmarking opportunities, we can drive both the numerator and the dominator. And the breadth of portfolio that we have allows us to e benchmarking analysis and the number of things that we built capabilities around that are unique to AutoNation in separates us from our peer group."

Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48, a record for third quarter results, up 23% compared to the $0.39 in the third quarter of 2010. Operating income increased 19% to $144 million compared to the period a year ago.
Third quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.5 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 7%, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle average selling prices. Based on CNW Research data, in the third quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 1%.
In the third quarter, AutoNation's total new vehicle unit sales were flat and, on a same-store basis, declined 2% as the Japanese earthquake affected availability of vehicles produced by the Japanese manufacturers.
This quarter, we once again demonstrated that our diversified business model is the right strategy, as well as our ability to rapidly adapt to change and execute effectively in a changing marketplace. In light of the Japanese supply constraints, we adjusted our operating plan to optimize our inventories and maximize gross profit. While shipments from the Japanese manufacturers improved in the third quarter, the inventory levels for these vehicles remained constrained. We would expect that the improving supply environment will result in sequentially lower margins on these vehicles in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $71 million or $0.48 per share versus $59 million or $0.39 per share during the third quarter of 2010, a 23% improvement on a per-share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period.
Last quarter, we indicated that we expected to receive the remaining incentives under the premium luxury program during the second half of 2011. We did not receive any of these incentives during the third quarter but expect to receive approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares to gross profit from incentives of $13 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Third quarter revenue increased $233 million or 7% compared to prior year, and gross profit improved by $30 million or 5% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.5% for the quarter, which represents a 240-basis-point improvement compared to the year-ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $6.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.9 million compared to the $4.7 million benefit in the third quarter of 2010. This improvement was due to lower floorplan interest expense driven by lower credit spreads compared to the prior-year period. Floorplan assistant -- assistance rates also increased compared to the third quarter of 2010. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.51 billion at quarter end, a decrease of approximately $162 million from June 30, 2011, in line with the inventory levels.
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.4 million for the quarter, an increase compared to the $16.1 million we reported in the third quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels. During the quarter, we borrowed $25 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $300 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of September.
Our third quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.49 billion, an increase of $107 million compared to the third quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax for the quarter was $45 million or 38.8%. By comparison, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 was 37.5%, which reflected the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments.
From July 1, 2011, through October 19, 2011, we repurchased 7.2 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $34.45 per share. Today, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of AutoNation common stock. AutoNation has $316 million now remaining in Board authorization for share repurchase. As of October 19, there were 139.9 million shares outstanding.
We incurred $50 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, reflecting our commitment to continue to reinvest in the business. For the full year, we expect to incur $145 million in CapEx, net of proceeds from related asset sales.
We remain within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio at September 30 was 2.38x or 2.11x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, compared to our limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $67 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in a healthy total liquidity of $446 million at the end of September.
Our robust balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and disciplined cost structure position us to continue to invest in our business. We remain focused on actively allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns.
Now, let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,140986545,174688,"AutoNation Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning.

In the quarter, we continued to navigate the Japanese product disruption and economic uncertainty while growing both revenue and total gross profit. We delivered strong new vehicle and finance and insurance gross margins and a solid operating margin of 4.1%, a 40-basis-point improvement year-over-year.
Third quarter total segment income of $134 million grew 22% or $24 million compared to the period a year ago with increases across all 3 segments. The $65 million Import segment income increased $14 million or 27% to more [ph] to the second quarter. This improvement is attributable, in large part, to increased new vehicle gross profit as inventory supply remained constrained.
The Domestic segment, at $47 million, increased $4 million or 10%. And the most stable segment, Premium Luxury, increased $2 million or 4% to $50 million.
As I continue, my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise.
In the quarter, AutoNation retailed 55,000 new vehicles, up 2% year-over-year for same stores compared to the industry that was up 1% at retail, according to CNW. Even with extremely tight supply of higher-demand models in all segments, we realized increased unit sales of 12% in the Domestic segment and 11% in the Premium Luxury segment on a total store basis. However, these increases were largely offset by a drop of 10% in import volume due to the ongoing effect of the Japanese inventory disruption.
From a geography standpoint, Texas continued as our strongest market in the quarter. Florida and our western markets, while in recovery, were more heavily impacted by the Japanese inventory disruption due to the higher mix of large import stores in these states.
At $1.8 billion, new vehicle same-store revenue increased $62 million or 4%, driven by increased revenue per vehicle retailed, which, at $33,000, was up $1,900 or 6%, with increases in each segment.
Gross profit for new vehicle retailed of $2,456 reflects an increase of $462 or 23% with improvement across all 3 segments. New vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue was 7.3%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the period a year ago. We attribute these improvements to the tactical plan we implemented in the second quarter in response to Japanese inventory disruption. We also continued to utilize our proprietary web-based pricing tool described during our second quarter call. The tool captures various market pricing metrics and establishes target in floor prices by model.
While we are very pleased with strong new vehicle margin growth, we expect some moderation as inventory levels continue to normalize. I'll also note that, in the fourth quarter of 2010, our new vehicle margins benefited by about $250 on a per-vehicle basis from additional performance-based manufacturer incentives.
At September 30, new vehicle days supply was 45 days or 34,000 units compared to 57 days or 42,000 units a year ago. Looking ahead, our new vehicle inventory will continue to build throughout the fourth quarter and we expect to reach normal levels in the first quarter of 2012.
Turning to used vehicles. AutoNation retailed 43,000 used vehicles on a same-store basis in the quarter, up 1% versus the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.79, up from 0.76 a year ago.
Same-store retail used vehicle revenue of $776 million increased $33 million or 5% year-over-year. Revenue per used vehicle retailed of $17,600 was up $560 or 3% as industry used vehicle prices remained strong in the quarter due to consumer demand and tight inventory availability.
Same-store retail used vehicle gross profit of $66 million declined 2%, and gross profit per vehicle retailed at $1,529 was up 3% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, we noted a 6% increase in appraisals and a 7% increase in trade-ins acquired compared to the period a year ago with a close ratio of 47%. I'll also note that we continue to move used vehicles to locations that will drive a faster turn and higher gross. In the period, we moved nearly 11,000 vehicles with good success at retail.
At September 30, used vehicle days supply was 43 days compared to 46 days a year ago and 47 days at June 30. During the quarter, we've reduced our used vehicle days supply to better prepare for seasonal pricing changes, and we experienced moderate wholesale loss.
Same-store parts service and collision revenue of $569 million increased $5 million or 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. We're pleased with our results in customer pay where revenue increased, up 3% to $193 million. It marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. This gain was more than offset by a significant decline in warranty revenue where our repair order count dropped about 10% year-over-year. We attribute this to the ongoing trend of fewer units in operation and improved vehicle quality.
Gross profit of $238 million declined to $8 million or 3% compared to the quarter a year ago. Customer pay gross profit grew by 2%. However, gains here were offset by a 15% decline in warranty gross profit. As for pay, gross profit was up for the fifth consecutive quarter year-over-year, driven in part by aggressive efforts to grow tire sales and other lower-margin service offerings both aimed at increasing customer retention.
I'll also note that there was one less working day in the quarter compared to a year ago.
Turning to F&I, we continue to be pleased with our industry-leading performance. Total gross profit in the quarter was $119 million, an increase of $7 million or 7% compared to a year ago. Same-store gross profit for vehicle retailed was $1,200, $1,214 per vehicle, up $84 or 7% compared to a year ago. Results continue to be driven by solid process execution, which drove improved rate and product commissions.
We continue to benefit from our strong preferred lender network for prime, non-prime and sub-prime, as well as strong product penetration. The credit environment was solid and stable in the quarter.
At September 30, our store portfolio numbered 214 stores and 257 franchises, representing 32 brands in 15 states. In the quarter, we opened GO FIAT in Denver and added 2 smart franchises to existing Mercedes-Benz stores. Our corporate real estate team is also wrapping up several other significant projects that are slated for completion by year end.
Looking ahead, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria.
In closing, in the quarter, we delivered a 19% increase in operating income along with record third quarter EPS. We did it with best-ever customer satisfaction levels, low associate turnover, a disciplined cost structure and a one team, one goal approach. I'd like to thank all of our 20,000 associates for their commitment and dedication to AutoNation.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

I mean, as we look at the first 3 quarters of this year, the SAARs run at about 12.5 million units. And if we look back to a period of time where you had similar earnings to what you did in the first 3 quarters of this year, it would be really the first 3 quarters of 2007 when we saw it was 16.1 million units. And looking at that, you guys have really kind of shut the lights out here on execution and growing your earnings or stabilizing your earnings in a tough time. I'm just curious, as we step forward and the SAAR really recovers, do you think there's any cost creep or any risk that this great execution kind of slips a little bit? Or are we just looking at this real paradigm shift in your earnings potential here and that, as we see the SAAR increase, hopefully dramatically, over the next couple of years, that you really can earn significantly more money than you have in the past?"

First, we give an outlook on where we think the industry and the market is going. And there, we are convinced that this market is on a journey back to something around 16 million units plus or minus 500,000 either way. And I think there's 3 fundamental drivers to that. There's definite pent-up demand, genuine replacement need -- the cars that we are appraising everyday and looking at are old and tired, and the customers want to trade them in, with the average age pushing 11 years. At the same time, for the brands we represent, every manufacturer is there with a fantastic product cadence and with the full spectrum of small cars through pickup trucks. And finally, the financing for our customers is very much available and very much at attractive rates. The banks and the finance companies during this disruptive period from '08 'til today really took minimal, if any, losses in automotive retail. And consequently, since there's still stress in commercial real estate in the whole mortgage market in small business loans, they are really interested in the automotive space. So those 3 factors of genuine replacement need, exciting new products and very good financing available convinces me that we're on the road back to 16 million. And the only debate is the rate of the recovery. I think, then, also speaking of '08, '09 and '10, if you looked at AutoNation's performance and knew everyone's validation of the work that we were doing with our eye on the long term, I mean, that was the ultimate test. And if you look at our performance relative to competition, I think we really distinguished ourselves. Now having said all that, we don't give forward guidance per se. We say, ""Hey, look at our past performance. Look at where we think the market is going,"" and the rest is really up to you."

Let me just add a thought on the operating leverage because I think that's tangentially related to the question that you asked. And I think what we've tried to communicate in the past is we think, right now, our operating cost structure is about 50% fixed and 50% variable. And with the variable elements largely being compensation and things that are commission structure-based. So as time passes, we would expect to see that leverage continue to drop to the bottom line. And we're operating at a pretty -- at dramatically improved SG&A as a percentage of growths from where we were a year or 2 ago, but we're still not back to where we've been at the past. We've been down below 70% as in SG&A as a percentage of gross in the past, and our goal is to get back there and continue to drive that number lower. And we're -- we've been investing, as Mike mentioned, throughout the downturn in some of the very important initiatives that we have and including our Shared Service Center and that's coming along very well. We're almost done with the rollout of that. We have one region left to go that we should do next year, as well as building new capabilities. For example, we're only starting -- we're in the very early innings of developing our ability to leverage our purchasing capability. And so there's additional opportunity out there for us. But we're working hard on it and I think you're seeing it in the results."

I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that specifically because it doesn't make a whole lot sense to me, given that inventory is tight across-the-board and probably will still be tight there.

In principle, I see a much more rational, sustainable industry than what we've had in the past. And I think the manufacturers have really fundamentally changed their outlook. Not to say it won't be competitive, but I really don't see a price war being unleashed as the Japanese availability improves in the marketplace. I think incentives will step up somewhat. But my sense on Domestic is that they know they've stabilized their share. They know -- they may even have improved their share somewhat but that they have a spike in share due to the lack of availability by the Japanese. And I don't see any steps on their part to do mega-programs like that we had in the summer of '05 of employee pricing in order to try to keep their share at $47.5. So I don't expect that. I expect that it'll be normal marketing between here and now, and by that, I mean aggressive and competitive, but no attempt to say the domestics have to stay in the high 40s. Having said all of that, I think we have had an extraordinary detour away from normal marketing for 6 months with this unique situation with the Japanese. We learned a lot from it with our pricing tools, some of that, I think, is the permanent value to us, but there'll probably be some impact on front-end gross profit going into the fourth quarter.

We retailed 4,300 of those in the quarter at lower margin, but we believe we're expanding our customer base in doing so. So that was one. Secondly is, as the inventory disruption occurred, we got very aggressive buying Hondas, Toyotas and other import products. And frankly, the market shifted slightly as they began to resume production. That production resumption was a little bit ahead of schedule, and so what we did is we liquidated some of that inventory and took both -- took small wholesale losses but also took lower retail grosses. So I think that it was a little bit of an unusual situation but we felt that we wanted to get right-sized so that we could compete in both the new and used vehicle business. I think the third factor is that the Premium Luxury segment had far less of lease returns, and those were generally high-margin business that we did not -- we're not able to take advantage of in that quarter. So all in all, our used car business was up slightly. We did give up a little bit of gross, but we feel very good about our position today, and our inventories are clean and in good shape.

So certainly, we've had significant warranty compression, but I think, when you really think about that, that's a good thing. It really speaks to the products, the quality of the products that's coming out and the customer experience with those products.

So Patrick, the -- within the Shared Service Center, there's the base level, and that's accounts payable, receivables, bank reconciliations. And as Mike mentioned, we've rolled that out now. And for the -- over a year, we've had everybody in that configuration. The real -- the next level, which we call extended, is -- has much more beneficial effect in terms of the cost structure. And that's where we actually shift the actual car transactions electronically to our Shared Service Center and they're all processed directly from the Shared Service Center. Just to give you an anecdotal example of that: In all of our stores today that are not in the extended Shared Service Center model, you have 1, maybe 2 people responsible for billing the car deals. For the 3 regions, 75% of the company that we have in the Shared Service Center in extended right now, able to do all of that billing with 8 people. So it gives you a sense of the magnitude of the efficiencies that we can generate and why we're so bullish on the Shared Service Center model here at AutoNation. And yes, it's running very well in the 3 regions where we have it operating right now. So Florida region is the only region that has not yet gone into extended Shared Service Center. We're just completing the central region right now, and Florida will go next year. So I think that's the key behind it. On the purchasing side, we do have a sourcing group here within the company. They're doing a great job. We're thinking about, now that we've demonstrated the capability, expanding their scope to other spend areas. I want to be clear, though: We're not talking about the -- purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers at different prices. This is primarily in SG&A items, potentially aftermarket parts purchases and things like that. It's less about the buying of vehicles. With respect to our used vehicle business, we do have people who have specific expertise in buying used vehicles on behalf of our stores, but that's different than the kind of core purchasing areas in SG&A and parts and service that I'm talking about."

Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48, a record for third quarter results, up 23% compared to the $0.39 in the third quarter of 2010. Operating income increased 19% to $144 millio",235,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48, a record for third quarter results, up 23% compared to the $0.39 in the third quarter of 2010. Operating income increased 19% to $144 million compared to the period a year ago.
Third quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.5 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 7%, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle average selling prices. Based on CNW Research data, in the third quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 1%.
In the third quarter, AutoNation's total new vehicle unit sales were flat and, on a same-store basis, declined 2% as the Japanese earthquake affected availability of vehicles produced by the Japanese manufacturers.
This quarter, we once again demonstrated that our diversified business model is the right strategy, as well as our ability to rapidly adapt to change and execute effectively in a changing marketplace. In light of the Japanese supply constraints, we adjusted our operating plan to optimize our inventories and maximize gross profit. While shipments from the Japanese manufacturers improved in the third quarter, the inventory levels for these vehicles remained constrained. We would expect that the improving supply environment will result in sequentially lower margins on these vehicles in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $71 million or $0.48 per share versus $59 million or $0.39 per share during the third quarter of 2010, a 23% improvement on a per-share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period.
Last quarter, we indicated that we expected to receive the remaining incentives under the premium luxury program during the second half of 2011. We did not receive any of these incentives during the third quarter but expect to receive approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares to gross profit from incentives of $13 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Third quarter revenue increased $233 million or 7% compared to prior year, and gross profit improved by $30 million or 5% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.5% for the quarter, which represents a 240-basis-point improvement compared to the year-ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $6.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.9 million compared to the $4.7 million benefit in the third quarter of 2010. This improvement was due to lower floorplan interest expense driven by lower credit spreads compared to the prior-year period. Floorplan assistant -- assistance rates also increased compared to the third quarter of 2010. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.51 billion at quarter end, a decrease of approximately $162 million from June 30, 2011, in line with the inventory levels.
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.4 million for the quarter, an increase compared to the $16.1 million we reported in the third quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels. During the quarter, we borrowed $25 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $300 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of September.
Our third quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.49 billion, an increase of $107 million compared to the third quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax for the quarter was $45 million or 38.8%. By comparison, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 was 37.5%, which reflected the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments.
From July 1, 2011, through October 19, 2011, we repurchased 7.2 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $34.45 per share. Today, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of AutoNation common stock. AutoNation has $316 million now remaining in Board authorization for share repurchase. As of October 19, there were 139.9 million shares outstanding.
We incurred $50 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, reflecting our commitment to continue to reinvest in the business. For the full year, we expect to incur $145 million in CapEx, net of proceeds from related asset sales.
We remain within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio at September 30 was 2.38x or 2.11x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, compared to our limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $67 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in a healthy total liquidity of $446 million at the end of September.
Our robust balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and disciplined cost structure position us to continue to invest in our business. We remain focused on actively allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns.
Now, let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,140986545,174798,"AutoNation Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning.

In the quarter, we continued to navigate the Japanese product disruption and economic uncertainty while growing both revenue and total gross profit. We delivered strong new vehicle and finance and insurance gross margins and a solid operating margin of 4.1%, a 40-basis-point improvement year-over-year.
Third quarter total segment income of $134 million grew 22% or $24 million compared to the period a year ago with increases across all 3 segments. The $65 million Import segment income increased $14 million or 27% to more [ph] to the second quarter. This improvement is attributable, in large part, to increased new vehicle gross profit as inventory supply remained constrained.
The Domestic segment, at $47 million, increased $4 million or 10%. And the most stable segment, Premium Luxury, increased $2 million or 4% to $50 million.
As I continue, my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise.
In the quarter, AutoNation retailed 55,000 new vehicles, up 2% year-over-year for same stores compared to the industry that was up 1% at retail, according to CNW. Even with extremely tight supply of higher-demand models in all segments, we realized increased unit sales of 12% in the Domestic segment and 11% in the Premium Luxury segment on a total store basis. However, these increases were largely offset by a drop of 10% in import volume due to the ongoing effect of the Japanese inventory disruption.
From a geography standpoint, Texas continued as our strongest market in the quarter. Florida and our western markets, while in recovery, were more heavily impacted by the Japanese inventory disruption due to the higher mix of large import stores in these states.
At $1.8 billion, new vehicle same-store revenue increased $62 million or 4%, driven by increased revenue per vehicle retailed, which, at $33,000, was up $1,900 or 6%, with increases in each segment.
Gross profit for new vehicle retail up $2,456, reflects an increase of $462 or 23% with improvement across all 3 segments. New vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue was 7.3%, of an increase of 100 basis points compared to the period a year ago. We attribute these improvements to the tactical plan we implemented in the second quarter in response to Japanese inventory disruption. We also continued to utilize our proprietary web-based pricing tool described during our second quarter call. The tool captures various market pricing metrics and establishes target in floor prices by model.
While we are very pleased with strong new vehicle margin growth, we expect some moderation as inventory levels continue to normalize. I'll also note that, in the fourth quarter of 2010, our new vehicle margins benefited by about $250 on a per-vehicle basis from additional performance-based manufacturer incentives.
At September 30, new vehicle days supply was 45 days or 34,000 units compared to 57 days or 42,000 units a year ago. Looking ahead, our new vehicle inventory will continue to build throughout the fourth quarter and we expect to reach normal levels in the first quarter of 2012.
Turning to used vehicles. AutoNation retailed 43,000 used vehicles on a same-store basis in the quarter, up 1% versus the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.79, up from 0.76 a year ago.
Same-store retail used vehicle revenue of $776 million increased $33 million or 5% year-over-year. Revenue per used vehicle retailed of $17,600 was up $560 or 3% as industry used vehicle prices remained strong in the quarter due to consumer demand and tight inventory availability.
Same-store retail used vehicle gross profit of $66 million declined 2%, and gross profit per vehicle retailed at $1,529 was up 3% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, we noted a 6% increase in appraisals and a 7% increase in trade-ins acquired compared to the period a year ago with a close ratio of 47%. I'll also note that we continue to move used vehicles to locations that will drive a faster turn and higher gross. In the period, we moved nearly 11,000 vehicles with good success at retail.
At September 30, used vehicle days supply was 43 days compared to 46 days a year ago and 47 days at June 30. During the quarter, we've reduced our used vehicle days supply to better prepare for seasonal pricing changes, and we experienced moderate wholesale loss.
Same-store parts service and collision revenue of $569 million increased $5 million or 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. We're pleased with our results in customer pay where revenue increased, up 3% to $193 million. It marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. This gain was more than offset by a significant decline in warranty revenue where our repair order count dropped about 10% year-over-year. We attribute this to the ongoing trend of fewer units in operation and improved vehicle quality.
Gross profit of $238 million declined to $8 million or 3% compared to the quarter a year ago. Customer pay gross profit grew by 2%. However, gains here were offset by a 15% decline in warranty gross profit. As for pay, gross profit was up for the fifth consecutive quarter year-over-year, driven in part by aggressive efforts to grow tire sales and other lower-margin service offerings both aimed at increasing customer retention.
I'll also note that there was one less working day in the quarter compared to a year ago.
Turning to F&I, we continue to be pleased with our industry-leading performance. Total gross profit in the quarter was $119 million, an increase of $7 million or 7% compared to a year ago. Same-store gross profit for vehicle retailed was $1,200, $1,214 per vehicle, up $84 or 7% compared to a year ago. Results continue to be driven by solid process execution, which drove improved rate and product commissions.
We continue to benefit from our strong preferred lender network for prime, non-prime and sub-prime, as well as strong product penetration. The credit environment was solid and stable in the quarter.
At September 30, our store portfolio numbered 214 stores and 257 franchises, representing 32 brands in 15 states. In the quarter, we opened GO FIAT in Denver and added 2 smart franchises to existing Mercedes-Benz stores. Our corporate real estate team is also wrapping up several other significant projects that are slated for completion by year end.
Looking ahead, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria.
In closing, in the quarter, we delivered a 19% increase in operating income along with record third quarter EPS. We did it with best-ever customer satisfaction levels, low associate turnover, a disciplined cost structure and a one team, one goal approach. I'd like to thank all of our 20,000 associates for their commitment and dedication to AutoNation.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

And looking at that, you guys have really kind of shut the lights out here on execution and growing your earnings or stabilizing your earnings in a tough time. I'm just curious, as we step forward and the SAAR really recovers, do you think there's any cost creep or any risk that this great execution kind of slips a little bit?

First, we give an outlook on where we think the industry and the market is going. And there, we are convinced that this market is on a journey back to something around 16 million units plus or minus 500,000 either way. And I think there's 3 fundamental drivers to that. There's definite pent-up demand, genuine replacement need -- the cars that we are appraising everyday and looking at are old and tired, and the customers want to trade them in, with the average age pushing 11 years. At the same time, for the brands we represent, every manufacturer is there with a fantastic product cadence and with the full spectrum of small cars through pickup trucks. And finally, the financing for our customers is very much available and very much at attractive rates. The banks and the finance companies during this disruptive period from '08 'til today really took minimal, if any, losses in automotive retail. And consequently, since there's still stress in commercial real estate in the whole mortgage market in small business loans, they are really interested in the automotive space. So those 3 factors of genuine replacement need, exciting new products and very good financing available convinces me that we're on the road back to 16 million. And the only debate is the rate of the recovery. I think, then, also speaking of '08, '09 and '10, if you looked at AutoNation's performance and knew everyone's validation of the work that we were doing with our eye on the long term, I mean, that was the ultimate test. And if you look at our performance relative to competition, I think we really distinguished ourselves. Now having said all that, we don't give forward guidance per se. We say, ""Hey, look at our past performance. Look at where we think the market is going,"" and the rest is really up to you."

Let me just add a thought on the operating leverage because I think that's tangentially related to the question that you asked. And I think what we've tried to communicate in the past is we think, right now, our operating cost structure is about 50% fixed and 50% variable. And with the variable elements largely being compensation and things that are commission structure-based. So as time passes, we would expect to see that leverage continue to drop to the bottom line. And we're operating at a pretty -- at dramatically improved SG&A as a percentage of growths from where we were a year or 2 ago, but we're still not back to where we've been at the past. We've been down below 70% as in SG&A as a percentage of gross in the past, and our goal is to get back there and continue to drive that number lower. And we're -- we've been investing, as Mike mentioned, throughout the downturn in some of the very important initiatives that we have and including our Shared Service Center and that's coming along very well. We're almost done with the rollout of that. We have one region left to go that we should do next year, as well as building new capabilities. For example, we're only starting -- we're in the very early innings of developing our ability to leverage our purchasing capability. And so there's additional opportunity out there for us. But we're working hard on it and I think you're seeing it in the results."

That was a really good factor for yourselves and the industry. There's some real concern that is Toyota and Honda restocked, that we're going to see this new round of pricing wars as they try to call back some of their lost market share, which I'm not sure I would really agree with. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that specifically because it doesn't make a whole lot sense to me, given that inventory is tight across-the-board and probably will still be tight there. And it seems not to be too logical but this is a real prevailing thought that pricing might erode significantly and may impact your business as well as the industry at large."

In principle, I see a much more rational, sustainable industry than what we've had in the past. And I think the manufacturers have really fundamentally changed their outlook. Not to say it won't be competitive, but I really don't see a price war being unleashed as the Japanese availability improves in the marketplace. I think incentives will step up somewhat. But my sense on Domestic is that they know they've stabilized their share. They know -- they may even have improved their share somewhat but that they have a spike in share due to the lack of availability by the Japanese. And I don't see any steps on their part to do mega-programs like that we had in the summer of '05 of employee pricing in order to try to keep their share at $47.5. So I don't expect that. I expect that it'll be normal marketing between here and now, and by that, I mean aggressive and competitive, but no attempt to say the domestics have to stay in the high 40s. Having said all of that, I think we have had an extraordinary detour away from normal marketing for 6 months with this unique situation with the Japanese. We learned a lot from it with our pricing tools, some of that, I think, is the permanent value to us, but there'll probably be some impact on front-end gross profit going into the fourth quarter.

We retailed 4,300 of those in the quarter at lower margin, but we believe we're expanding our customer base in doing so. So that was one. Secondly is, as the inventory disruption occurred, we got very aggressive buying Hondas, Toyotas and other import products. And frankly, the market shifted slightly as they began to resume production. That production resumption was a little bit ahead of schedule, and so what we did is we liquidated some of that inventory and took both -- took small wholesale losses but also took lower retail grosses. So I think that it was a little bit of an unusual situation but we felt that we wanted to get right-sized so that we could compete in both the new and used vehicle business. I think the third factor is that the Premium Luxury segment had far less of lease returns, and those were generally high-margin business that we did not -- we're not able to take advantage of in that quarter. So all in all, our used car business was up slightly. We did give up a little bit of gross, but we feel very good about our position today, and our inventories are clean and in good shape. And we're looking forward to performing in the quarter."

And that's where we actually shift the actual car transactions electronically to our Shared Service Center and they're all processed directly from the Shared Service Center. Just to give you an anecdotal example of that: In all of our stores today that are not in the extended Shared Service Center model, you have 1, maybe 2 people responsible for billing the car deals. For the 3 regions, 75% of the company that we have in the Shared Service Center in extended right now, able to do all of that billing with 8 people. So it gives you a sense of the magnitude of the efficiencies that we can generate and why we're so bullish on the Shared Service Center model here at AutoNation. And yes, it's running very well in the 3 regions where we have it operating right now. So Florida region is the only region that has not yet gone into extended Shared Service Center. We're just completing the central region right now, and Florida will go next year. So I think that's the key behind it. On the purchasing side, we do have a sourcing group here within the company. They're doing a great job. We're thinking about, now that we've demonstrated the capability, expanding their scope to other spend areas. I want to be clear, though: We're not talking about the -- purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers at different prices. This is primarily in SG&A items, potentially aftermarket parts purchases and things like that. It's less about the buying of vehicles.

Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48, a record for third quarter results, up 23% compared to the $0.39 in the third quarter of 2010. Operating income increased 19% to $144 million compared to the period a year ago.
Third quarter 2011 revenue totaled $3.5 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 7%, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle average selling prices. Based on CNW Research data, in the third quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 1%.
In the third quarter, AutoNation's total new vehicle unit sales were flat and, on a same-store basis, declined 2% as the Japanese earthquake affected availability of vehicles produced by the Japanese manufacturers.
This quarter, we once again demonstrated that our diversified business model is the right strategy, as well as our ability to rapidly adapt to change and execute effectively in a changing marketplace. In light of the Japanese supply constraints, we adjusted our operating plan to optimize our inventories and maximize gross profit. While shipments from the Japanese manufacturers improved in the third quarter, the inventory levels for these vehicles remained constrained. We would expect that the improving supply environment will result in sequentially lower margins on these vehicles in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $71 million or $0.48 per share versus $59 million or $0.39 per share during the third quarter of 2010, a 23% improvement on a per-share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period.
Last quarter, we indicated that we expected to receive the remaining incentives under the premium luxury program during the second half of 2011. We did not receive any of these incentives during the third quarter but expect to receive approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares to gross profit from incentives of $13 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Third quarter revenue increased $233 million or 7% compared to prior year, and gross profit improved by $30 million or 5% for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.5% for the quarter, which represents a 240-basis-point improvement compared to the year-ago period.
Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $6.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.9 million compared to the $4.7 million benefit in the third quarter of 2010. This improvement was due to lower floorplan interest expense driven by lower credit spreads compared to the prior-year period. Floorplan assistant -- assistance rates also increased compared to the third quarter of 2010. Floorplan debt was approximately $1.51 billion at quarter end, a decrease of approximately $162 million from June 30, 2011, in line with the inventory levels.
Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.4 million for the quarter, an increase compared to the $16.1 million we reported in the third quarter of 2010 due to higher debt levels. During the quarter, we borrowed $25 million under our revolving credit facility, resulting in $300 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of September.
Our third quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.49 billion, an increase of $107 million compared to the third quarter of 2010. The provision for income tax for the quarter was $45 million or 38.8%. By comparison, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 was 37.5%, which reflected the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments.
From July 1, 2011, through October 19, 2011, we repurchased 7.2 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $34.45 per share. Today, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of AutoNation common stock. AutoNation has $316 million now remaining in Board authorization for share repurchase. As of October 19, there were 139.9 million shares outstanding.
We incurred $50 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, reflecting our commitment to continue to reinvest in the business. For the full year, we expect to incur $145 million in CapEx, net of proceeds from related asset sales.
We remain within the limits of our financial covenants. Our leverage ratio at September 30 was 2.38x or 2.11x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, compared to our limit of 3.25x. Our quarter-end cash balance was $67 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in a healthy total liquidity of $446 million at the end of September.
Our robust balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and disciplined cost structure position us to continue to invest in our business. We remain focused on actively allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns.
Now, let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,140986545,175108,"AutoNation Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning.

In the quarter, we continued to navigate the Japanese product disruption and economic uncertainty while growing both revenue and total gross profit. We delivered strong new vehicle and finance and insurance gross margins and a solid operating margin of 4.1%, a 40-basis-point improvement year-over-year.
Third quarter total segment income of $134 million grew 22% or $24 million compared to the period a year ago with increases across all 3 segments. The $65 million Import segment income increased $14 million or 27% to more [ph] to the second quarter. This improvement is attributable, in large part, to increased new vehicle gross profit as inventory supply remained constrained.
The Domestic segment, at $47 million, increased $4 million or 10%. And the most stable segment, Premium Luxury, increased $2 million or 4% to $50 million.
As I continue, my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise.
In the quarter, AutoNation retailed 55,000 new vehicles, up 2% year-over-year for same stores compared to the industry that was up 1% at retail, according to CNW. Even with extremely tight supply of higher-demand models in all segments, we realized increased unit sales of 12% in the Domestic segment and 11% in the Premium Luxury segment on a total store basis. However, these increases were largely offset by a drop of 10% in import volume due to the ongoing effect of the Japanese inventory disruption.
From a geography standpoint, Texas continued as our strongest market in the quarter. Florida and our western markets, while in recovery, were more heavily impacted by the Japanese inventory disruption due to the higher mix of large import stores in these states.
At $1.8 billion, new vehicle same-store revenue increased $62 million or 4%, driven by increased revenue per vehicle retailed, which, at $33,000, was up $1,900 or 6%, with increases in each segment.
Gross profit for new vehicle retailed of $2,456 reflects an increase of $462 or 23% with improvement across all 3 segments. New vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue was 7.3%, of an increase of 100 basis points compared to the period a year ago. We attribute these improvements to the tactical plan we implemented in the second quarter in response to Japanese inventory disruption. We also continued to utilize our proprietary web-based pricing tool described during our second quarter call. The tool captures various market pricing metrics and establishes target in floor prices by model.
While we are very pleased with strong new vehicle margin growth, we expect some moderation as inventory levels continue to normalize. I'll also note that, in the fourth quarter of 2010, our new vehicle margins benefited by about $250 on a per-vehicle basis from additional performance-based manufacturer incentives.
At September 30, new vehicle days supply was 45 days or 34,000 units compared to 57 days or 42,000 units a year ago. Looking ahead, our new vehicle inventory will continue to build throughout the fourth quarter and we expect to reach normal levels in the first quarter of 2012.
Turning to used vehicles. AutoNation retailed 43,000 used vehicles on a same-store basis in the quarter, up 1% versus the period a year ago. Our used-to-new ratio in the quarter was 0.79, up from 0.76 a year ago.
Same-store retail used vehicle revenue of $776 million increased $33 million or 5% year-over-year. Revenue per used vehicle retailed of $17,600 was up $560 or 3% as industry used vehicle prices remained strong in the quarter due to consumer demand and tight inventory availability.
Same-store retail used vehicle gross profit of $66 million declined 2%, and gross profit per vehicle retailed at $1,529 was up 3% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, we noted a 6% increase in appraisals and a 7% increase in trade-ins acquired compared to the period a year ago with a close ratio of 47%. I'll also note that we continue to move used vehicles to locations that will drive a faster turn and higher gross. In the period, we moved nearly 11,000 vehicles with good success at retail.
At September 30, used vehicle days supply was 43 days compared to 46 days a year ago and 47 days at June 30. During the quarter, we've reduced our used vehicle days supply to better prepare for seasonal pricing changes, and we experienced moderate wholesale loss.
Same-store parts service and collision revenue of $569 million increased $5 million or 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. We're pleased with our results in customer pay where revenue increased, up 3% to $193 million. It marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. This gain was more than offset by a significant decline in warranty revenue where our repair order count dropped about 10% year-over-year. We attribute this to the ongoing trend of fewer units in operation and improved vehicle quality.
Gross profit of $238 million declined to $8 million or 3% compared to the quarter a year ago. Customer pay gross profit grew by 2%. However, gains here were offset by a 15% decline in warranty gross profit. As for pay, gross profit was up for the fifth consecutive quarter year-over-year, driven in part by aggressive efforts to grow tire sales and other lower-margin service offerings both aimed at increasing customer retention.
I'll also note that there was one less working day in the quarter compared to a year ago.
Turning to F&I, we continue to be pleased with our industry-leading performance. Total gross profit in the quarter was $119 million, an increase of $7 million or 7% compared to a year ago. Same-store gross profit for vehicle retailed was $1,200, $1,214 per vehicle, up $84 or 7% compared to a year ago. Results continue to be driven by solid process execution, which drove improved rate and product commissions.
We continue to benefit from our strong preferred lender network for prime, non-prime and sub-prime, as well as strong product penetration. The credit environment was solid and stable in the quarter.
At September 30, our store portfolio numbered 214 stores and 257 franchises, representing 32 brands in 15 states. In the quarter, we opened GO FIAT in Denver and added 2 smart franchises to existing Mercedes-Benz stores. Our corporate real estate team is also wrapping up several other significant projects that are slated for completion by year end.
Looking ahead, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand and return on investment criteria.
In closing, in the quarter, we delivered a 19% increase in operating income along with record third quarter EPS. We did it with best-ever customer satisfaction levels, low associate turnover, a disciplined cost structure and a one team, one goal approach. I'd like to thank all of our 20,000 associates for their commitment and dedication to AutoNation.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson."

I mean, as we look at the first 3 quarters of this year, the SAARs run at about 12.5 million units. And if we look back to a period of time where you had similar earnings to what you did in the first 3 quarters of this year, it would be really the first 3 quarters of 2007 when we saw it was 16.1 million units. And looking at that, you guys have really kind of shut the lights out here on execution and growing your earnings or stabilizing your earnings in a tough time. I'm just curious, as we step forward and the SAAR really recovers, do you think there's any cost creep or any risk that this great execution kind of slips a little bit? Or are we just looking at this real paradigm shift in your earnings potential here and that, as we see the SAAR increase, hopefully dramatically, over the next couple of years, that you really can earn significantly more money than you have in the past?"

First, we give an outlook on where we think the industry and the market is going. And there, we are convinced that this market is on a journey back to something around 16 million units plus or minus 500,000 either way. And I think there's 3 fundamental drivers to that. There's definite pent-up demand, genuine replacement need -- the cars that we are appraising everyday and looking at are old and tired, and the customers want to trade them in, with the average age pushing 11 years. At the same time, for the brands we represent, every manufacturer is there with a fantastic product cadence and with the full spectrum of small cars through pickup trucks. And finally, the financing for our customers is very much available and very much at attractive rates. The banks and the finance companies during this disruptive period from '08 'til today really took minimal, if any, losses in automotive retail. And consequently, since there's still stress in commercial real estate in the whole mortgage market in small business loans, they are really interested in the automotive space. So those 3 factors of genuine replacement need, exciting new products and very good financing available convinces me that we're on the road back to 16 million. And the only debate is the rate of the recovery. I think, then, also speaking of '08, '09 and '10, if you looked at AutoNation's performance and knew everyone's validation of the work that we were doing with our eye on the long term, I mean, that was the ultimate test. And if you look at our performance relative to competition, I think we really distinguished ourselves. Now having said all that, we don't give forward guidance per se. We say, ""Hey, look at our past performance. Look at where we think the market is going,"" and the rest is really up to you."

Let me just add a thought on the operating leverage because I think that's tangentially related to the question that you asked. And I think what we've tried to communicate in the past is we think, right now, our operating cost structure is about 50% fixed and 50% variable. And with the variable elements largely being compensation and things that are commission structure-based. So as time passes, we would expect to see that leverage continue to drop to the bottom line. And we're operating at a pretty -- at dramatically improved SG&A as a percentage of growths from where we were a year or 2 ago, but we're still not back to where we've been at the past. We've been down below 70% as in SG&A as a percentage of gross in the past, and our goal is to get back there and continue to drive that number lower. And we're -- we've been investing, as Mike mentioned, throughout the downturn in some of the very important initiatives that we have and including our Shared Service Center and that's coming along very well. We're almost done with the rollout of that. We have one region left to go that we should do next year, as well as building new capabilities. For example, we're only starting -- we're in the very early innings of developing our ability to leverage our purchasing capability. And so there's additional opportunity out there for us. But we're working hard on it and I think you're seeing it in the results."

I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that specifically because it doesn't make a whole lot sense to me, given that inventory is tight across-the-board and probably will still be tight there.

In principle, I see a much more rational, sustainable industry than what we've had in the past. And I think the manufacturers have really fundamentally changed their outlook. Not to say it won't be competitive, but I really don't see a price war being unleashed as the Japanese availability improves in the marketplace. I think incentives will step up somewhat. But my sense on Domestic is that they know they've stabilized their share. They know -- they may even have improved their share somewhat but that they have a spike in share due to the lack of availability by the Japanese. And I don't see any steps on their part to do mega-programs like that we had in the summer of '05 of employee pricing in order to try to keep their share at $47.5. So I don't expect that. I expect that it'll be normal marketing between here and now, and by that, I mean aggressive and competitive, but no attempt to say the domestics have to stay in the high 40s. Having said all of that, I think we have had an extraordinary detour away from normal marketing for 6 months with this unique situation with the Japanese. We learned a lot from it with our pricing tools, some of that, I think, is the permanent value to us, but there'll probably be some impact on front-end gross profit going into the fourth quarter.

We retailed 4,300 of those in the quarter at lower margin, but we believe we're expanding our customer base in doing so. So that was one. Secondly is, as the inventory disruption occurred, we got very aggressive buying Hondas, Toyotas and other import products. And frankly, the market shifted slightly as they began to resume production. That production resumption was a little bit ahead of schedule, and so what we did is we liquidated some of that inventory and took both -- took small wholesale losses but also took lower retail grosses. So I think that it was a little bit of an unusual situation but we felt that we wanted to get right-sized so that we could compete in both the new and used vehicle business. I think the third factor is that the Premium Luxury segment had far less of lease returns, and those were generally high-margin business that we did not -- we're not able to take advantage of in that quarter. So all in all, our used car business was up slightly. We did give up a little bit of gross, but we feel very good about our position today, and our inventories are clean and in good shape.

It really speaks to the products, the quality of the products that's coming out and the customer experience with those products. So we really focus on the customer pay side where we're being very aggressive in our customer offerings and are really glad to be growing that business 5 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis with our initiatives."

So Patrick, the -- within the Shared Service Center, there's the base level, and that's accounts payable, receivables, bank reconciliations. And as Mike mentioned, we've rolled that out now. And for the -- over a year, we've had everybody in that configuration. The real -- the next level, which we call extended, is -- has much more beneficial effect in terms of the cost structure. And that's where we actually shift the actual car transactions electronically to our Shared Service Center and they're all processed directly from the Shared Service Center. Just to give you an anecdotal example of that: In all of our stores today that are not in the extended Shared Service Center model, you have 1, maybe 2 people responsible for billing the car deals. For the 3 regions, 75% of the company that we have in the Shared Service Center in extended right now, able to do all of that billing with 8 people. So it gives you a sense of the magnitude of the efficiencies that we can generate and why we're so bullish on the Shared Service Center model here at AutoNation. And yes, it's running very well in the 3 regions where we have it operating right now. So Florida region is the only region that has not yet gone into extended Shared Service Center. We're just completing the central region right now, and Florida will go next year. So I think that's the key behind it. On the purchasing side, we do have a sourcing group here within the company. They're doing a great job. We're thinking about, now that we've demonstrated the capability, expanding their scope to other spend areas. I want to be clear, though: We're not talking about the -- purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers at different prices. This is primarily in SG&A items, potentially aftermarket parts purchases and things like that. It's less about the buying of vehicles. With respect to our used vehicle business, we do have people who have specific expertise in buying used vehicles on behalf of our stores, but that's different than the kind of core purchasing areas in SG&A and parts and service that I'm talking about."
