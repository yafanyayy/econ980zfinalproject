I appreciate everybody joining us for this year-end teleconference call. I have with me today Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton, Matt Reid, our VP and regional managers; and our newly elected VP of Engineering and Technology, Steve Lindeman.  I want to state that the language of forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today. 
At this time, we have several things to cover and expand on with the three press releases that we issued last night. I will briefly cover the year-end financial results, the year-end reserve metrics and then a more detailed discussion of our operations including our plan for 2011. I'll be brief and allow time for Q&A at the end. 
Cabot did report its financial results for the year with earnings of just over $100 million and with cash flow from operations of $485 million. The company maintained our strong financial structure, raising over $200 million through asset sales in the fourth quarter to reduce debt and create more flexibility with capitalization ratio of 32%. From a clean earnings perspective, net income was basically the same as reported with selected items, which include gain on sale, impairments, stock compensation and a true-up of deferred taxes that net out.
Fourth quarter clean earnings were $20 million on the strength of record production levels. While we do not normalize cash flow, both the quarter and the year were impacted by the cash taxes associated with the gains from the fourth quarter asset sales. This had an approximately $25 million to $30 million lowering effect on reported cash flow. However, I'd gladly take the $211 million pretax proceeds we raised in exchange. 
From a value-added perspective, as we all know, a key metric to an organization's growth and value creation is its ability to stack up reserves at economic investment levels. Cabot once again accomplished that by growing reserves a record 31% year-over-year to a new established high of 2.7 Tcfe. Not only is this record performance impressive, it is equally noteworthy that we held our PUD level at 36%, the same percentage reported at the end of 2009. This booking translates into a proved developed reserve increase of 30%. 
The value from this program has created for Cabot shareholders, as illustrated by the fact with only 13% increase in year-end SEC gas prices, Cabot realized a 100% increase in its SEC PV 10 to $3.2 billion. That is a good demonstration of value creation year-over-year.  The company was able to add 651 Bcfe before production and revision adjustments for the year. This compares to 463 Bcfe added last year. With all of the 2010 increase coming from our organic drilling program, the corresponding all-source finding cost was $1.05 per Mcfe, a level not seen since 2002 when we had roughly $100 million program. Excluding lease, this figure drops to $0.89 an Mcfe. The company replaced 603% of its production through organic growth at a very efficient finding cost.
As I mentioned a minute ago, Cabot once again managed its product portfolio for compliance with the five-year SEC rule. We look at our PUD profile as a balancing act with future capital needs, finding cost metrics over the long term and a realistic assessment of how much PUD drilling is prudent to execute in our program over the next several years. In light of the current natural gas strip, the dynamics of our Marcellus program and the South regions all program, we removed from our conventional inventory in West Virginia, Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, South Texas and East Texas. This high graded our overall PUD portfolio, which now only has 620 total locations, down from 948 at the end of 2009. All these PUDs can be drilled easily with anticipated cash flow. Even with this reclassification of P2 from PUD, the performance revisions from our Marcellus program provided us with an overall positive revision of approximately 137 Bcfe. Our investment program during the year for total finding cost purposes totaled $828 million, which included $131 million for new leases in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford.
In terms of production, the company reached a milestone with a full year production number of 130.6 Bcfe, exceeding the high end of our full year expectation of 25% production growth. Our actual growth was 28.6% increase. This record-setting performance was achieved even after the restricted rates due to the slowdown related to the Lathrop compression station Phase II permitting approval process. I'll have additional comments on our Phase II work once I get to the North region. 
Guidance last night, we posted full year 2011 guidance. This range results in an overall growth rate of 30% to 36%. Specifically, the growth in natural gas volumes is targeted at 30% to 35%, while our South region emphasis on oil for their entire program is expected to pay dividends with liquid growth of about 30% to 70%. The range of growth is dependent upon the timing of our completions.
So my fearless guidance is conservative based on our reserve release and the dynamics of our 2010 program. However, today, there is over 1.2 Bcf per day flowing into the Tennessee 300 line from our cells and peers in the Three County area in Northeast PA. Until our initiatives to move gas to other types are complete, and that's our strategy we implemented over a year ago, we're going to be comfortable with this guidance. Our conservative approach assumes this dynamic is clarified by the start of the fourth quarter with three new construction and expansion projects scheduled for completion. These projects include a 33-mile, high-pressure, 24-inch pipeline from our Lathrop station to Transco interstate pipeline; a 35-mile 16-inch high-pressure pipeline that will connect our northern acreage position with Millenium interstate pipeline and the expansion of the lateral designed to move gas out of our core area also to the Millennium line.
our operations plans for 2011 have remained unchanged from our original budget. We are holding firm to our $600 million capital program that has $350 million directed towards the North region for the Marcellus and $250 million in South region for the Eagle Ford oil initiative. Cabot did take advantage of a short window of opportunity for natural gas price strength during the first quarter and hedged approximately 150 million cubic foot of production, which was hedged at a mark north of $5. And that is for all of the remainder of 2011 and all of 2012. This effort combined with the previous position has us 36% hedged in 2011 based on the midpoint equivalent guidance.  We also have a good job north of $5 for 2012. 
In the North region, our Marcellus area as you saw in the press releases continues to excel, achieving a new production record of 265 million cubic foot gross per day, predominantly from 51 horizontal wells with production growth an impressive rate of 36% over our third quarter  2010. Cabot continues to have great success as demonstrated by one of our recent completions that had an IP of over 23 million cubic foot per day and a 30-day average of approximately 19 million cubic foot per day from a 3,700-foot lateral. Other recent 30-day averages include a 14 million per day and 10 million per day from several shorter lateral wells. We also just finished drilling a 6,100-plus usable lateral, which is another record for us. We plan to complete those wells with a 26-stage frac.  In addition, we recently had a well achieve three Bcf production in just eight months from a 15-stage completion, which is also a record on the accum-ed production number in that short period of time. The well is currently still producing 9 million a day. These statistics highlight the prolific nature of this area of the Marcellus where Cabot's acreage is located. 
Based on these statistics and while still continuing to enhance our completion technics, we have conservatively booked 6.5 Bcfe EUR for our PUDs in the area, which assumes a well with approximately 10-stage frac. However we have a growing population of wells that are expected to produce 10 Bcf plus. And s we get more data, we will continue to assess our reserve bookings. Cabot is currently running five rigs in the Marcellus and our plan is to drill around 50 horizontal wells during 2011. Today, Cabot has 34 stages being completed, 107 stages waiting on pipeline and 450 stages waiting on completion.
At the Lathrop Compressor Station, which now is owned by Williams, they received all the required permits to run an additional four compressors at the station, which will give the station a total of seven compressors. With the startup of the four compressors, which we're currently commissioning, the capacity of Lathrop will be at 250 million cubic foot per day when units five, six and seven become operational. Along with the necessary additional dehydration, Williams will increase the capacity of the station potentially reaching a total of 450 million cubic foot per day. Again, actual flowing ability will be tied to the interstate take-away capacity and the completion of the William Springville line from Lathrop to Transco, which is expected to be operational in the third quarter. 
In the Rocky Mountain area in the North region, Cabot has drilled and cased a Montana horizontal located in the Heath play. We expect to complete this well in the second quarter of this year. We have over 100,000 acres in the play.
Now moving to the South region, which we're going to allocate all of our $250 million to the Eagle Ford. The company has successfully completed its fourth Eagle Ford well. It's a 100% well located in South Kenny. It was drilled to a total depth of over 14,800 feet and had over a 5,900-foot lateral. The well was tested and flowed on a maximum 24-hour rate of 789 barrels of oil equivalent a day. This well is located in our Buckhorn area. The fifth company-operated well, also 100% Cabot, is located in County also in the Buckhorn area, was drilled with a lateral of over 6,700 feet and is presently being completed. Two additional wells have been drilled and cased in the Buckhorn area and will be completed in late February and March. 
Additionally, our 18,000-acre area of mutual interest with EOG Resources, the first well has been drilled and cased. This well was drilled with over a 7,000-foot lateral and is presently on flowback after completion operations. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 20 net Eagle Ford oil wells in 2011. Also to ensure timely completion of the Cabot-operated wells, the company has executed an agreement for a dedicated frac crew for 2011 for these operations.
Moving to East Texas and a comment in regards to East Texas joint venture. Cabot is finalizing agreements that would allow Cabot to maintain a large percentage of its acreage with no capital investment. These agreements will provide Cabot with a carrying interest on the initial well for 25 units. If commodity prices remain at similar levels we're seeing today and the acreage held by the initial wells in the units, no subsequent drilling would occur in these units for a period of time. Additionally, the negotiations include the sale of a minority interest in 34 non-operated units, both producing and nonproducing with net production to Cabot of approximately 4 million cubic foot per day. These agreements will allow Cabot to maintain approximately 22,000 net acres of its original 33,000 net acres in the play.
In closing, Cabot's operational program is, quite frankly, fairly simple. We'll spend $350 million in the best area the industry has discovered in the Marcellus. And we will deliver significant returns with, I think, stellar reserve and production growth. Also, we will allocate $250 million in the oil window of the Eagle Ford, which will increase our oil reserves and will increase our oil production between 30% and 70% year-over-year. So in Cabot, you have the best rate of return gas project in North America, which I think includes a rate of return comparison to many oil projects. And the remainder of our capital is allocated to a good rate of return project in the Eagle Ford. 
That really with those comments, I will now turn it back to you to see if there's any questions."

There's also another aspect of this and that's the long-term take-away agreement that we have on Tennessee pipeline. Those agreements allow for -- I think, the earliest one expires in five years, and they go out as far as 15 years.

But it has mainly dealt with capacity constraints with the compressor station and getting our equity gas out of the field into the interstate pipeline. And when you look at the amount of acreage that we blocked up in Susquehanna, and certainly Cabot has the largest position in Susquehanna, we're trying to effect trades of our acreage and swaps of our acreage that would allow companies that have a minority position just an acre here, an acre there within our outlined area to trade acreage with them and allow them to block up where their position is, allow us to block up where our position is, where the dollars that our group spends is allocated 100% to Cabot and the dollars they spend would be allocated 100% to their position. It also holds true with equity gas that we're moving out of the field. Again, we're not able to move 100% of our equity gas at this period of time. We have a significant present value backlog, if you will, by not being able to produce all of our gas. If we start bringing in third-party gas into this pipeline system, all that does is displace Cabot equity gas and does not allow us to recognize the present value of our investment out there. In early stage, we think it is prudent to be able to use every molecule that is available out there in infrastructure and capacity for Cabot equity gas. We've invested over $1 billion in this county, in Susquehanna County right now, and we are working that return. I think we've got a spectacular return. But nevertheless, we don't have room for all our gas. So that's why the trades are being negotiated, have been executed and we continue moving in that regard. Long-winded answer to illustrate to you that. Also in some cases, those negotiations might affect the placement of wells. But also there are holdouts in certain areas and individuals that have acreage that do not want to lease their acreage under any circumstances. And that would preclude us from maybe drilling the lateral length that we'd like to drill."

I appreciate everybody joining us for this year-end teleconference call. I have with me today Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton, Matt Reid, our VP and Regional Manager of South; and our newly elected VP of Engineering and Technology, Steve Lindeman.  I want to state that the boilerplate language, forward-looking statements included on the press release do apply to my comments today. 
At this time, we have several things to cover and expand on from the three press releases that we're issued last night. I will briefly cover the year-end financial results, the year-end reserve metrics and then on a more detailed discussion of our operations including our plan for 2011. I'll be brief and allow time for Q&A at the end. 
Cabot did report its financial results for the year with earnings of just over $100 million and with cash flow from operations of $485 million. The company maintained our strong financial structure, raising over $200 million through asset sales in the fourth quarter to reduce debt and create more flexibility with capitalization ratio of 32%. From a clean earnings perspective, net income was basically the same as reported with selected items, which include gain on sale, impairments, stock compensation and a true-up of deferred taxes that net out.
Fourth quarter clean earnings were $20 million on the strength of record production levels. We do not normalize cash flow, both the quarter and the year were impacted by the cash taxes associated with the gains from the fourth quarter asset sales. This had approximately a $25 million to $30 million lowering effect on reported cash flow. However, I'd gladly take the $211 million pretax proceeds we raised in exchange. 
From a value-added perspective, as we all know, a key metric to an organization's growth and value creation is its ability to stack up reserves at economic investment levels. Cabot once again accomplished that by growing reserves a record 31% year-over-year to a new established high of 2.7 Tcfe. Not only is this record performance impressive, it is equally noteworthy that we held our PUD level at 36%, the same percentage reported at the end of 2009. This booking translates into a proved developed reserve increase of 30%. 
The value from this program has created for Cabot shareholders, as illustrated by the fact with only 13% increase in year-end SEC gas prices, Cabot realized a 100% increase in its SEC PV 10 to $3.2 billion. That is a good demonstration of value creation year-over-year.  The company was able to add 651 Bcfe before production and revision adjustments for the year. This compares to 463 Bcfe added last year. With all of the 2010 increase coming from our organic drilling program, the corresponding all-source finding cost was $1.05 per Mcfe, a level not seen since 2002 when we had roughly a $100 million program. Excluding lease acts, this figure drops to $0.89 an Mcfe. The company replaced 603% of its production through organic growth at a very efficient finding cost.
As I mentioned a minute ago, Cabot once again managed its product portfolio for compliance with the five-year SEC rule. We look at our PUD profile as a balancing act with future capital needs, finding cost metrics over the long term and a realistic assessment of how much PUD drilling is prudent to execute in our program over the next several years. In light of the current natural gas strip, the dynamics of our Marcellus program and the South Region's oil program, we removed PUDs from our conventional inventory in West Virginia, Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, South Texas and East Texas. This high graded our overall PUD portfolio, which now only has 620 total locations, down from 948 at the end of 2009. All these PUDs can be drilled easily with anticipated cash flow. Even with this reclassification of P2 from PUD, the performance revisions from our Marcellus program provided us with an overall positive revision of approximately 137 Bcfe. Our investment program during the year for total finding cost purposes totaled $828 million, which included $131 million for new leases in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford.
In terms of production, the company reached a milestone with a full year production number of 130.6 Bcfe, exceeding the high end of our full year expectation of 25% production growth. Our actual growth was 28.6% increase. This record-setting performance was achieved even after the restricted rates due to the slowdown related to the Lathrop compression station Phase II permitting approval process. I'll have additional comments on our Phase II work once I get to the North region. 
Guidance last night, we posted full year 2011 guidance. This range results in an overall growth rate of 30% to 36%. Specifically, the growth in natural gas volumes is targeted at 30% to 35%, while our South region emphasis on oil for their entire program is expected to pay dividends with liquid growth of about 30% to 70%. The range of growth is dependent upon the timing of our completions.
So my fearless guidance is a conservative based on our reserve release and the dynamics of our 2010 program. However, today, there is over 1.2 Bcf per day flowing into the Tennessee 300 line from our sales and our peers in the Three County area in Northeast PA. Until our initiatives to move gas through other types are complete, and that's a strategy we implemented over a year ago, we're going to be comfortable with this guidance. Our conservative approach assumes this dynamic is clarified by the start of the fourth quarter with three new construction and expansion projects scheduled for completion. These projects include a 33-mile high-pressure 24-inch pipeline from our Lathrop station to Transco interstate pipeline; a 35-mile 16-inch high-pressure pipeline that will connect our northern acreage position with Millenium interstate pipeline and the expansion of the Stagecoach Lateral designed to move gas out of our core area also to the Millennium line.
Okay, our operations plans for 2011 have remained unchanged from our regional budget. We're holding firm to our $600 million capital program that has $350 million directed towards the North region for the Marcellus and $250 million in the South region for the Eagle Ford oil initiative. Cabot did take advantage of a short window of opportunity for natural gas price strength during the first quarter and hedged approximately 150 million cubic foot of production, which was hedged at a mark north of $5. And that is for all of the remainder of 2011 and all of 2012. This effort combined with the previous position has us 36% hedged in 2011 based on the midpoint equivalent guidance. We also have a good job north of $5 for 2012. 
In the North region, our Marcellus area as you saw in the press releases continues to excel, achieving a new production record of 265 million cubic foot gross per day, predominantly from 51 horizontal wells with production growth an impressive rate of 36% over our third quarter of  2010. Cabot continues to have great success as demonstrated by one of our recent completions that had an IP of over 23 million cubic foot per day and a 30-day average of approximately 19 million cubic foot per day from a 3,700-foot lateral. Other recent 30-day averages include a 14 million per day and 10 million per day from several shorter lateral wells. We also just finished drilling a 6,100-plus usable lateral, which is another record for us. We plan to complete those well with a 26-stage frac. In addition, we recently had a well achieve three Bcf key in production in just eight months from a 15-stage completion, which is also a record on the key in production number in that short period of time. The well is currently still producing 9 million a day. These statistics highlight the prolific nature of this area of Marcellus where Cabot's acreage is located. 
Based on these statistics and while still continuing to enhance our completion technics, we have conservatively booked 6.5 Bcf EUR for our PUDs in the area, which assumes a well with approximately 10-stage frac. However we have a growing population of wells that are expected to produce 10 Bcf plus. And as we get more data, we will continue to assess our reserve bookings. Cabot is currently running five rigs in the Marcellus and our plan is to drill around 50 horizontal wells during 2011. Today, Cabot has 34 stages being completed, 107 stages waiting on pipeline and 450 stages waiting on completion.
At the Lathrop Compressor Station, which now is owned by Williams, they received all the required permits to run an additional four compressors at the station, which will give the station a total of seven compressors. With the startup of the fourth compressor, which we're currently commissioning, the capacity of Lathrop will be at 250 million cubic foot per day when units five, six and seven become operational. Along with the necessary additional dehydration, Williams will increase the capacity of the station potentially reaching a total of 450 million cubic foot per day. Again, actual flowing ability will be tied to the interstate take-away capacity and the completion of the William Springville line from Lathrop to Transco, which is expected to be operational in the third quarter. 
In the Rocky Mountain area of the North region, Cabot has drilled and cased a Montana horizontal lock at located in the Heath play. We expect to complete this well in the second quarter of this year. We have over 100,000 acres in the play.
Now moving down to the South region, which we're going to allocate all of our $250 million to the Eagle Ford. The company had successfully completed its fourth Eagle Ford well. It's a 100% well located in the South county. It was drilled to a total depth of over 14,800 feet and had over a 5,900-foot lateral. The well was tested and flowed on a maximum 24-hour rate of 789 barrels of oil equivalent a day. This well is located in our Buckhorn area. The fifth company-operated well, also 100% Cabot, is located in Frio County also in the Buckhorn area, was drilled with a lateral of over 6,700 feet and is presently being completed. Two additional wells have been drilled and cased in the Buckhorn area and will be completed in late February and March. 
Additionally, our 18,000-acre area of mutual interest with EOG Resources, the first well has been drilled and cased. This well was drilled with over a 7,000-foot lateral and is presently on flowback after completion operations. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 20 net Eagle Ford oil wells in 2011. Also to ensure timely completion of the Cabot-operated wells, the company has executed an agreement for a dedicated frac crew for 2011 for these operations.
Moving to East Texas and a comment in regard to our East Texas joint venture. Cabot is finalizing agreements that would allow Cabot to maintain a large percentage of a changeable acreage with no capital investment. These agreements will provide Cabot with a carried interest on the initial well for 25 units. If commodity prices remain at similar levels we're seeing today and the acreage held by the initial wells in the units, no subsequent drilling would occur in these units for a period of time. Additionally, the negotiations include the sale of a minority interest in 34 non-operated units, both producing and nonproducing with net production to Cabot of approximately 4 million cubic foot per day. When executed, these agreements will allow Cabot to maintain approximately 22,000 net acres of its original 33,000 net acres in the play.
In closing, Cabot's operational program is, quite frankly, fairly simple. We'll spend $350 million in the best area the industry has discovered in the Marcellus. And we will deliver significant returns with, I think, stellar reserve and production growth. Also, we will allocate $250 million in the oil window of the Eagle Ford, which will increase our oil reserves and will increase our oil production between 30% and 70% year-over-year. So in Cabot, you have the best rate of return gas project in North America, which I concludes a rate of return comparison to many oil projects. And the remainder of our capital is allocated to a good rate of return project in the Eagle Ford. 
That really with those comments, I will now turn it back to you to see if there's any questions."

But it has mainly dealt with capacity constraints with the compressor station and getting our equity gas out of the field into the interstate pipeline. And when you look at the amount of acreage that we blocked up in Susquehanna, and certainly Cabot has the largest position in Susquehanna, we're trying to affect on trades of our acreage, swaps of our acreage that would allow companies that have a minority position just an acre here, an acre there within our outlined area to us trade acreage with them and allow them to block up where their position is, allow us to block up where our position is, where the dollars that our group spends is allocated 100% to Cabot and the dollars base then would be allocated 100% to their position. It also holds true with the equity gas that we're moving out of the field. Again, we're not able to move 100% of our equity gas at this period of time. We have a significant present value backlog, if you will, by not being able to produce all of our gas. If we start bringing in third-party gas into this pipeline system, all that does is displace Cabot equity gas and does not allow us to recognize the present value of our investment out there. In early stage, we think it is prudent to be able to use every molecule that is available out there in infrastructure and capacity for Cabot equity gas. We've invested over $1 billion in this county, in Susquehanna County right now, and we are working that return. I think we've got a spectacular return. But nevertheless, we don't have room for all our guests. So that's why the trades are being negotiated, have been executed and we continue moving in, in that regard. Long-winded answer to illustrate to you that in, also in some cases, those negotiations might affect the placement of wells. But also there are holdouts in certain areas and individuals that have acreage that do not want to lease their acreage under any circumstances. And that would preclude us from maybe drilling the lateral length that we'd like to drill."

When we did the 2009 budget originally, that number was in the $3 million to $4 million range. And clearly the science and what we found and clearly the results show that what we did with longer laterals closer in spacing pays huge dividends from an economics selective. That's all been captured in the $350 million program for the North. So the overages that you see will have already been captured in the $350 million.

I appreciate everybody joining us for this year-end teleconference call. I have with me today Scott Schroeder, Jeff Hutton, Matt Reid, our VP and Regional Manager of South; and our newly elected VP of Engineering and Technology, Steve Lindeman.  I want to state that the boilerplate language, forward-looking statements included on the press release do apply to my comments today. 
At this time, we have several things to cover and expand on from the three press releases that were issued last night. I will briefly cover the year-end financial results, the year-end reserve metrics and then on a more detailed discussion of our operations including our plans for 2011. I'll be brief and allow time for Q&A at the end. 
Cabot did report its financial results for the year with earnings of just over $100 million and with cash flow from operations of $485 million. The company maintained our strong financial structure, raising over $200 million through asset sales in the fourth quarter to reduce debt and create more flexibility with capitalization ratio of 32%. From a clean earnings perspective, net income was basically the same as reported with selected items, which include gain on sale, impairments, stock compensation and a true-up of deferred taxes that net out.
Fourth quarter clean earnings were $20 million on the strength of record production levels. We do not normalize cash flow, both the quarter and the year were impacted by the cash taxes associated with the gains from the fourth quarter asset sales. This had approximately a $25 million to $30 million lowering effect on reported cash flow. However, I'd gladly take the $211 million pretax proceeds we raised in exchange. 
From a value-added perspective, as we all know, a key metric to an organization's growth and value creation is its ability to stack up reserves at economic investment levels. Cabot once again accomplished that by growing reserves a record 31% year-over-year to a new established high of 2.7 Tcfe. Not only is this record performance impressive, it is equally noteworthy that we held our PUD level at 36%, the same percentage reported at the end of 2009. This booking translates into a proved developed reserve increase of 30%. 
The value from this program has created for Cabot shareholders, as illustrated by the fact with only 13% increase in year-end SEC gas prices, Cabot realized a 100% increase in its SEC PV 10 to $3.2 billion. That is a good demonstration of value creation year-over-year.  The company was able to add 651 Bcfe before production and revision adjustments for the year. This compares to 463 Bcfe added last year. With all of the 2010 increase coming from our organic drilling program, the corresponding all-source finding cost was $1.05 per Mcfe, a level not seen since 2002 when we had roughly a $100 million program. Excluding lease acts, this figure drops to $0.89 an Mcfe. The company replaced 603% of its production through organic growth at a very efficient finding cost.
As I mentioned a minute ago, Cabot once again managed its PUD portfolio for compliance with the five-year SEC rule. We look at our PUD profile as a balancing act with future capital needs, finding cost metrics over the long term and a realistic assessment of how much PUD drilling is prudent to execute in our program over the next several years. In light of the current natural gas strip, the dynamics of our Marcellus program and the South Region's oil program, we removed PUDs from our conventional inventory in West Virginia, Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, South Texas and East Texas. This high graded our overall PUD portfolio, which now only has 620 total locations, down from 948 at the end of 2009. All these PUDs can be drilled easily with anticipated cash flow. Even with this reclassification of P2 from PUD, the performance revisions from our Marcellus program provided us with an overall positive revision of approximately 137 Bcfe. Our investment program during the year for total finding cost purposes totaled $828 million, which included $131 million for new leases in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford.
In terms of production, the company reached a milestone with a full year production number of 130.6 Bcfe, exceeding the high end of our full year expectation of 25% production growth. Our actual growth was 26.8% increase. This record-setting performance was achieved even after the restricted rates due to the slowdown related to the Lathrop compression station Phase II permitting approval process. I'll have additional comments on our Phase II work once I get to the North region. 
Guidance last night, we posted full year 2011 guidance. This range results in an overall growth rate of 30% to 36%. Specifically, the growth in natural gas volumes is targeted at 30% to 35%, while our South region emphasis on oil for their entire program is expected to pay dividends with liquid growth of about 30% to 70%. The range of growth is dependent upon the timing of our completions.
So my fearless guidance is a conservative based on our reserve release and the dynamics of our 2010 program. However, today, there is over 1.2 Bcf per day flowing into the Tennessee 300 line from ourselves and our peers in the Three County area in Northeast PA. Until our initiatives to move gas through other pipes are complete, and that's a strategy we implemented over a year ago, we're going to be comfortable with this guidance. Our conservative approach assumes this dynamic is clarified by the start of the fourth quarter with three new construction and expansion projects scheduled for completion. These projects include a 33-mile high-pressure 24-inch pipeline from our Lathrop station to Transco interstate pipeline; a 35-mile 16-inch high-pressure pipeline that will connect our northern acreage position with Millenium interstate pipeline and the expansion of the Stagecoach Lateral designed to move gas out of our core area also to the Millennium line.
Okay, our operations plans for 2011 have remained unchanged from our original budget. We're holding firm to our $600 million capital program that has $350 million directed towards the North region for the Marcellus and $250 million in the South region for the Eagle Ford oil initiative. Cabot did take advantage of a short window of opportunity for natural gas price strength during the first quarter and hedged approximately 150 million cubic foot of production, which was hedged at a mark north of $5. And that is for all of the remainder of 2011 and all of 2012. This effort combined with the previous position has us 36% hedged in 2011 based on the midpoint equivalent guidance. We also have a good job north of $5 for 2012. 
In the North region, our Marcellus area as you saw in the press releases continues to excel, achieving a new production record of 265 million cubic foot gross per day, predominantly from 51 horizontal wells with production growth an impressive rate of 36% over our third quarter of 2010. Cabot continues to have great success as demonstrated by one of our recent completions that had an IP of over 23 million cubic foot per day and a 30-day average of approximately 19 million cubic foot per day from a 3,700-foot lateral. Other recent 30-day averages include a 14 million per day and 10 million per day from several shorter lateral wells. We also just finished drilling a 6,100-plus usable lateral, which is another record for us. We plan to complete this well with a 26-stage frac. In addition, we recently had a well achieve three Bcf key in production in just eight months from a 15-stage completion, which is also a record on the key in production number in that short period of time. The well is currently still producing 9 million a day. These statistics highlight the prolific nature of this area of Marcellus where Cabot's acreage is located. 
Based on these statistics and while still continuing to enhance our completion techniques, we have conservatively booked 6.5 Bcf EUR for our PUDs in the area, which assumes a well with approximately 10-stage frac. However, we have a growing population of wells that are expected to produce 10 Bcf plus. And as we get more data, we will continue to assess our reserve bookings. Cabot is currently running five rigs in the Marcellus and our plan is to drill around 50 horizontal wells during 2011. Today, Cabot has 34 stages being completed, 107 stages waiting on pipeline and 450 stages waiting on completion.
At the Lathrop Compressor Station, which now is owned by Williams, they have received all the required permits to run an additional four compressors at the station, which will give the station a total of seven compressors. With the startup of the fourth compressor, which we're currently commissioning, the capacity of Lathrop will be at 250 million cubic foot per day when units five, six and seven become operational. Along with the necessary additional dehydration, Williams will increase the capacity of the station potentially reaching a total of 450 million cubic foot per day. Again, actual flowing ability will be tied to the interstate take-away capacity and the completion of the William Springville line from Lathrop to Transco, which is expected to be operational in the third quarter. 
In the Rocky Mountain area of the North region, Cabot has drilled and cased a Montana horizontal lock at located in the Heath play. We expect to complete this well in the second quarter of this year. We have over 100,000 acres in the play.
Now moving down to the South region, which we're going to allocate all of our $250 million to the Eagle Ford. The company had successfully completed its fourth Eagle Ford well. It's a 100% well located in the South county. It was drilled to a total depth of over 14,800 feet and had over a 5,900-foot lateral. The well was tested and flowed on a maximum 24-hour rate of 789 barrels of oil equivalent a day. This well is located in our Buckhorn area. The fifth company-operated well, also 100% Cabot, is located in Frio County also in the Buckhorn area, was drilled with a lateral of over 6,700 feet and is presently being completed. Two additional wells have been drilled and cased in the Buckhorn area and will be completed in late February and March. 
Additionally, our 18,000-acre area of mutual interest with EOG Resources, the first well has been drilled and cased. This well was drilled with over a 7,000-foot lateral and is presently on flowback after completion operations. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 20 net Eagle Ford oil wells in 2011. Also to ensure timely completion of the Cabot-operated wells, the company has executed an agreement for a dedicated frac crew for 2011 for these operations.
Moving to East Texas and a comment in regard to our East Texas joint venture. Cabot is finalizing agreements that would allow Cabot to maintain a large percentage of a changeable acreage with no capital investment. These agreements will provide Cabot with a carried interest on the initial well for 25 units. If commodity prices remain at similar levels we're seeing today and the acreage held by the initial wells in the units, no subsequent drilling would occur in these units for a period of time. Additionally, the negotiations include the sale of a minority interest in 34 non-operated units, both producing and nonproducing with net production to Cabot of approximately 4 million cubic foot per day. When executed, these agreements will allow Cabot to maintain approximately 22,000 net acres of its original 33,000 net acres in the play.
In closing, Cabot's operational program is, quite frankly, fairly simple. We'll spend $350 million in the best area the industry has discovered in the Marcellus. And we will deliver significant returns with, I think, stellar reserve and production growth. Also, we will allocate $250 million in the oil window of the Eagle Ford, which will increase our oil reserves and will increase our oil production between 30% and 70% year-over-year. So in Cabot, you have the best rate of return gas project in North America, which I concludes a rate of return comparison to many oil projects. And the remainder of our capital is allocated to a good rate of return project in the Eagle Ford. 
That really with those comments, I will now turn it back to you to see if there's any questions."

We have a significant present value backlog, if you will, by not being able to produce all of our gas. If we start bringing in third-party gas into this pipeline system, all that does is displace Cabot equity gas and does not allow us to recognize the present value of our investment out there. In early stage, we think it is prudent to be able to use every molecule that is available out there in infrastructure and capacity for Cabot equity gas. We've invested over $1 billion in this county, in Susquehanna County right now, and we are working that return. I think we've got a spectacular return. But nevertheless, we don't have room for all our guests. So that's why the trades are being negotiated, have been executed and we continue moving in, in that regard. Long-winded answer to illustrate to you that in, also in some cases, those negotiations might affect the placement of wells. But also there are holdouts in certain areas and individuals that have acreage that do not want to lease their acreage under any circumstances. And that would preclude us from maybe drilling the lateral length that we'd like to drill."

I appreciate everybody joining for this conference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing, Matt Reid, VP and Regional Manager of South; and Steve Lindemann, our VP of Engineering and Technology; with me today.  As you're aware, the boilerplate language that's in our forward-looking statements included in the press release will apply to my comments today.
We have several items to cover, and I'll also expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I'll briefly cover the first quarter financial results and a discussion of our operations and further plans for 2011. And at the end, we'll leave ample time for Q&A.
Cabot did report its financial results for the first quarter with claimed earnings of just over $20 million and with discretionary cash flow of about $109 million. This quarter continued the same trend of lower natural gas price realizations, offset by robust production growth. Throughout the remainder of 2011, I would expect to see similar commodity pricing and also a continued increase in our production profile. 
In terms of production, the company posted a 41% production growth rate between comparable first quarters. 37.7 Bcf was the highest quarterly production total the company has ever reported. Along with this production achievement is the fact that last week, we surpassed 100 Bcf cumulative production level for the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and we did this in just under 3 years. At our current production rate, the next 100 Bcf of production will be achieved within less than a year. 
Looking ahead to guidance. Last night, we posted new full year 2011 expectations, increasing the overall growth rate to 34% to 42%. Effectively, the guidance midpoint is now 5% higher than before. The low end of the guidance is based on the current production levels. The high end of the guidance is tempered by our best guess of timing of the commissioning of the additional dehydration units, which we are currently installing and the hookup of additional gathering lines to the Lathrop compressor station. With the dehydration and additional gathering lines, we think we can move an additional 50 million to 70 million cubic foot of gas to the market.  
Any upside to our second quarter guidance would be dependent upon the timing of these 2 items. And again, that's upside to the second quarter guidance.  You will note as we move to the third and fourth quarters, we are increasing our guidance as we anticipate the commissioning of the Williams Springville line from Lathrop to the Transco interstate line, which is 30 miles south. 
To summarize, I understand there remains a lot of near-term noise and some uncertainty on the timing of infrastructure. However, each day, we get a little bit more clarity on these items. By the end of the second quarter, Lathrop should be fully commissioned with the piping and dehydration installation. At this point in time, we will be waiting on the Springville pipeline. Again in the infrastructure capacity, this is not production but the infrastructure capacity at Lathrop and Teel at the end of the second quarter will be 550 million cubic foot of capacity. Following the Springville commissioning, we will begin producing into this available capacity. And our guidance reflects what we think might be a conservative look at the expectations as we fill up this capacity in the third and fourth quarters.  I think most importantly is the fact that our well performance and the deliverability that we've seen from our completions has not changed, and we continue to add to the backlog of completions for future productivity.
Okay, as part of our marketing effort, our costs associated with the required firm transportation arrangements and our gathering fee have grown. And as such, they are now reflected on separate line items. Previously, these costs were an offset to realized prices. The impact of this change to historical comparisons is 0, as realized prices are slightly higher to completely offset the new expense category. 
For the first time, we have posted guidance for the transportation line, which captures all of these arrangements company-wide. This addition, together with some reductions in DD&A, financing, operating costs and in addition to slight increase in G&A, excluding the pension termination and stock compensation are the changes that were reflected and posted to our costs guidance. 
Now let's move to operations for 2011. Our plans remain unchanged from our original budget. We're holding firm to a $600 million capital program that has $350 million directed towards the North region for our Marcellus and $250 million in the South region for the Eagle Ford oil initiatives. I would note that the first quarter disclosure for capital investments on the cash flow statement included over $30 million of 2010 carryover that was paid in 2011. 
Now let's take a look at our hedging. Cabot did take advantage of a short window of opportunity with natural gas price strength during the first part of the quarter, to add hedges in 2012 and 2013. This effort now has the company with 21 contracts for 2012, production, excluding the 5 basis only hedges and 5 contracts we placed for 2013 production. The hedge slide that we have on our website will illustrate all of this. 
Moving to the North region and a little bit of detail, some of this might be a little redundant, but we do continue to establish new milestones in the Marcellus. During the first quarter, we had a new production record of 320 million gross per day predominantly from 57 horizontal wells. Cabot continues to have excellent results as demonstrated by a 2-well pad site that has been in line for 3 months and is currently producing 36 million cubic foot a day, in addition to our first 6-well pad site that is producing at a curtailed rate of 51 million cubic foot per day. We would expect the 6-well pad site to be able to produce around 70 million to 80 million cubic foot uncurtailed. 
On the completion side, we have just finished frac-ing a 5-well pad site that is currently cleaning up. Also, we are in the process of completing our longest lateral to date, which was a total usable lateral length of over 6,000 feet and we're well on our way to finalize 26 stages in this completion.  Cabot continues to run 5 rigs in the Marcellus and has a total of 560 stages being completed or cleaned up, waiting on pipeline or waiting to be completed. A dedicated frac crew has been very effective, averaging 3 completions gauges per pumping day during March, and we generally average about 20 pumping days per month. 
At the Lathrop compressor station, which Williams now owns, there are a total of 7 compressors running, giving us a current capacity of 225 million cubic foot per day at Lathrop station. Once the additional dehydration units, which I've talked about, are installed along with additional piping, the capacity at the station will increase to 450 million per day. And the Teel station will have another 100 million a day to get us to that 550 million I previously mentioned. Again, actually flowing capacity will be tied to the interstate take-away capacity and the completion of the Williams line to the south. And that completion and commissioning of the Springville line down to Transco is anticipated for the third quarter. 
In terms of other initiatives, we have several initiatives going on. In regards to the one that's most visible, the Heath, we have a completion crew scheduled for late May. This well is designed for an 8 stage frac and we'll report the results when we get these results available. We do have several other items or several other initiatives going, which we will also report on in a timely fashion in the appropriate time. We have been asked about our future plans in the Heath and right now, we're currently focused on the completion of this particular well.
Now let's move south into the Eagle Ford area. In our Buckhorn area, the company has successfully completed 3 recent Eagle Ford wells. Each well is 100% Cabot well and they're located in Frio County. The wells flowed at a 24-hour rate of 558 barrels per day equivalent, 400 -- excuse me, that's 958 barrels of oil per day equivalent 460 barrels of oil per day equivalent and 345 barrels a day equivalent. The 345 barrels per day was a well that we got a little bit out of zone in. But nevertheless, it's early in our completion techniques in this area, and we certainly like the results we've seen so far. 3 additional wells have been drilled encased in the Buckhorn area and they will be completed in May and June. Additionally, there are 3 wells that have been drilled in our 18,000-plus acre, AMI with EOG. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford oil wells in 2011. 
In regard to our activity in East Texas and our Haynesville joint ventures, Cabot has finalized two agreements that would allow us to maintain a large percentage of our Haynesville acreage with no capital investment. The agreements will provide Cabot with a carried interest in the initial well covering 24 units. If commodity prices remain similar levels and with the acreage held by initial well in each unit, subsequent drilling would occur in these units for a period of time. An additional agreement that Cabot has been working on is to sell a minority interest in some nonoperated units, both producing and nonproducing, with net production to Cabot of approximately 4 million cubic foot per day, and that is executed and moving towards close. Combined, these agreements will allow Cabot to maintain approximately 22,000 net acres of its original 33,000 net acres in the play within the original lease terms at no incremental cost to us for 2011 and 2012. This was our plan going into these joint ventures. Two participation agreements, as I mentioned, are complete and operated and sales transactions is expected to close in early May. And as we said, cash proceeds are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million subject to final adjustment. 
In closing, Cabot's operational program remains fairly simple, spending $350 million in the best area industry as discovered in the Marcellus. That will deliver us significant returns with stellar reserve and production growth. Additionally, we'll allocate the remainder of our capital, $250 million to the oil window at Eagle Ford, which will increase our oil reserves and our production year-over-year. So best rate of return gas project in North America, which includes comparing rate of returns to many oil projects plus a great rate of return project in the South region. Additionally, we had several other while initiatives that we are moving on. With that quick overview, I'll stop here and answer any questions the group might have."

Governor Corbett's commission is staying in Marcellus and looking at the entire space and trying to balance the environmental aspects, along with the tremendous upside potential in the form of jobs and revenue generated by the Marcellus for the state. The conversations, which we're all aware of, have been along the lines of severance, tax and Corbett's made clear that he is not in favor of severance tax. There has been discussion on an impact fee, which would be a fee generated whether it is based on a pad side or your well permitting or volumes is yet to be determined. But that impact fee would be for the benefit of the local communities where the activity is taking place. And whether or not that holds true and how the final form of that is anybody's guess at this stage. More on the regulatory side, they recently announced, Mike, Secretary of the DEP, recently announced where we do not -- they do not want any produced water to be taken to the public disposal sites anymore, and we fully support that. We don't have any problems with that. For a long, long time, we have been recycling 100% of our frac water and we're not taking any of our produced frac fluids to any of these sites. So it's not effect on Cabot. I think with the decision made, I think the majority of the industry will be recycling their produced water, so I don't think that's going to have an effect. As far as any incremental regulations, certainly the EPA is going to continue to try and get involved in our business. They may feel like the controlling hydraulic fractioning, as an example, should be an EPA item. We are fully convinced and supportive that the states can control their regulations much, much better than a federal oversight body could. And with our full disclosure now of frac fluids and chemicals on the groundwater commissions website, fracfocus.org, I think clarity and concern about what we put in frac fluids is also a benefit to the community and the politicians. But aside from that and again looking at what industry is doing up there, I think every one of us are trying to employ the best available technology. Using premium connections is one area that we are employing. And we think it is a benefit to the community and to the environment and we're doing all we can right now to mitigate any potential rest. I think it is and should be stated, and maybe we should be a little bit more vocal as an industry to state, that there's no large-scale industry like the manufacturing industry or the extraction industry or many other types of industries out there that has 0 potential for offset. I think we do our fair share and we spend million dollars and million dollars of dollars to mitigate any risk. But I think it has to be understood by all that in order to have our energy source and in order to have cars to drive and be able to flip a switch and turn on the lights, that there is a lot of work behind the scenes to be able to get there and there is inherent risk with every type of industry out there."

Some of our other wells were also not being pulled as hard as they possibly could. We do anticipate though with the infrastructure build-out, which we are getting very, very close to on the Lathrop station, dehy and additional pipelines and Williams we know is working diligently to get that pipeline put into the South, we do anticipate that we'll be able to add another frac crew. It will probably be towards the end of '11 or the beginning of '12 and look at picking up some of these, picking up the piece, if you will, in some of the wells that are in the queue.

And then in the eastern part of that block, at the Landsville area we planned, -- we already have a 12-inch tapped there in Tennessee in the compressor site. Again, we were able to free flow quite a bit of gas in Tennessee without compression prior to building labor.

I appreciate everybody joining for this conference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP and Regional Manager in South; and Steve Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology, with me toda",1838,"Thank you, Melissa. I appreciate everybody joining for this conference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP and Regional Manager in South; and Steve Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology, with me today.  As you're aware, the boilerplate language that's in our forward-looking statements included in the press release will apply to my comments today.
We have several items to cover, and I'll also expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I'll briefly cover the first quarter financial results and a discussion of our operations and further plans for 2011. And at the end, we'll leave ample time for Q&A.
Cabot did report its financial results for the first quarter with claimed earnings of just over $20 million and with discretionary cash flow of about $109 million. This quarter continued the same trend of lower natural gas price realizations, offset by robust production growth. Throughout the remainder of 2011, I would expect to see similar commodity pricing and also a continued increase in our production profile. 
In terms of production, the company posted a 41% production growth rate between comparable first quarters. 37.7 Bcf was the highest quarterly production total the company has ever reported. Along with this production achievement is the fact that last week, we surpassed 100 Bcf cumulative production level for the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and we did this in just under 3 years. At our current production rate, the next 100 Bcf of production will be achieved within less than a year. 
Looking ahead to guidance. Last night, we posted new full year 2011 expectations, increasing the overall growth rate to 34% to 42%. Effectively, the guidance midpoint is now 5% higher than before. The low end of the guidance is based on the current production levels. The high end of the guidance is tempered by our best guess of timing of the commissioning of the additional dehydration units, which we are currently installing, and the hookup of additional gathering lines to the Lathrop compressor station. With the dehydration and additional gathering lines, we think we can move an additional 50 million to 70 million cubic foot of gas to the market.  
Any upside to our second quarter guidance would be dependent upon the timing of these 2 items. And again, that's upside to the second quarter guidance.  You will note as we move to the third and fourth quarters, we are increasing our guidance as we anticipate the commissioning of the Williams Springville line from Lathrop to the Transco interstate line, which is 30 miles south. 
To summarize, I understand there remains a lot of near-term noise and some uncertainty on the timing of infrastructure. However, each day, we get a little bit more clarity on these items. By the end of the second quarter, Lathrop should be fully commissioned with the piping and dehydration installation. At this point in time, we will be waiting on the Springville pipeline. Again, the infrastructure capacity, this is not production, but the infrastructure capacity at Lathrop and Teel at the end of the second quarter will be 550 million cubic foot of capacity. 
Following the Springville commissioning, we will begin producing into this available capacity. And our guidance reflects what we think might be a conservative look at the expectations as we fill up this capacity in the third and fourth quarters. I think, most importantly, is the fact that our well performance and the deliverability that we've seen from our completions has not changed, and we continue to add to the backlog of completions for future productivity.
Okay. As part of our marketing effort, our costs associated with the required firm transportation arrangements and our gathering fee have grown. And as such, we are now reflected on separate line items. Previously, these costs were an offset to realized prices. The impact of this change to historical comparisons is 0, as realized prices are slightly higher to completely offset the new expense category. 
For the first time, we have posted guidance for the transportation line, which captures all of these arrangements company-wide. This addition, together with some reductions in DD&A, financing, operating costs and in addition to a slight increase in G&A, excluding the pension termination and stock compensation are the changes that were reflected and posted to our costs guidance. 
Now let's move to operations for 2011. Our plans remain unchanged from our original budget. We're holding firm to a $600 million capital program that has $350 million directed towards the North region for our Marcellus and $250 million in the South region for the Eagle Ford oil initiative. I would note that the first quarter disclosure for capital investments on the cash flow statement included over $30 million of 2010 carryover that was paid in 2011. 
Now let's take a look at our hedging. Cabot did take advantage of a short window of opportunity with natural gas price strength during the first part of the quarter, to add hedges in 2012 and 2013. This effort now has the company with 21 contracts for 2012 production, excluding the 5 basis only hedges and 5 contracts we placed for 2013 production. The hedge slide that we have on our website will illustrate all of this. 
Moving to the North region and a little bit of detail, some of this might be a little redundant, but we do continue to establish new milestones in the Marcellus. During the first quarter, we had a new production record of 320 million gross per day predominantly from 57 horizontal wells. Cabot continues to have excellent results as demonstrated by a 2-well pad site that has been in line for 3 months and is currently producing 36 million cubic foot a day, in addition to our first 6-well pad site that is producing at a curtailed rate of 51 million cubic foot per day. We would expect the 6-well pad site to be able to produce around 70 million to 80 million cubic foot on curtailed. 
On the completion side, we have just finished frac-ing a 5-well pad site that is currently cleaning up. Also, we are in the process of completing our longest lateral to date, which was a total usable lateral length of over 6,000 feet and we're well on our way to finalize 26 stages in this completion. Cabot continues to run 5 rigs in the Marcellus and has a total of 560 stages being completed or cleaned up, waiting on pipeline or waiting to be completed. A dedicated frac crew has been very effective, averaging 3 completions stages per pumping day during March. And we generally average about 20 pumping days per month. 
At the Lathrop compressor station, which Williams now owns, there are a total of 7 compressors running giving us a current capacity of 225 million cubic foot per day at the Lathrop station. Once the additional dehydration units, which I've talked about, are installed along with additional piping, the capacity at the station will increase to 450 million per day. And the Teel station will have another 100 million a day to get us to that 550 million I previously mentioned. Again, actually flowing capacity will be tied to the interstate take-away capacity and the completion of the Williams line to the south. And that completion and commissioning of that Springville line down to Transco is anticipated for the third quarter. 
In terms of other initiatives, we have several initiatives going on. In regard to the one that's most visible, the Heath, we have a completion crew scheduled for late May. This well is designed for an 8 stage frac, and we'll report the results when we get these results available. We do have several other items or several other initiatives going on, which we will also report on in a timely fashion in the appropriate time. We have been asked about our future plans in the Heath and right now, we're just currently focused on the completion of this particular well.
Now let's move south into the Eagle Ford area. In our Buckhorn area, the company has successfully completed 3 recent Eagle Ford wells. Each well is 100% Cabot well and they're located in Frio County. The wells flowed at a 24-hour rate of 558 barrels per day equivalent, 400 -- excuse me, that's 958 barrels of oil per day equivalent 460 barrels of oil per day equivalent and 345 barrels a day equivalent. The 345 barrels per day was a well that we got a little bit out of zone in. But nevertheless, it's already in the completion techniques in this area and we certainly like the results we've seen so far. Three additional wells have been drilled encased in the Buckhorn area and they will be completed in May and June. Additionally, there are 3 wells that have been drilled in our 18,000-plus acre AMI with EOG. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford oil wells in 2011. 
In regard to our activity in East Texas and our Haynesville joint ventures, Cabot has finalized 2 agreements that will allow us to maintain a large percentage of our Haynesville acreage with no capital investment. These agreements will provide Cabot with a carried interest in the initial well covering 24 units. If commodity prices remain similar levels and with the acreage held by the initial well in each unit, no subsequent drilling would occur in these units for a period of time. 
An additional agreement that Cabot has been working on is to sell a minority interest in some nonoperated units, both producing and nonproducing, with net production to Cabot of approximately 4 million cubic foot per day. And that is executed and moving towards close. Combined, these agreements will allow Cabot to maintain approximately 22,000 net acres of its original 33,000 net acres in the play within the original lease terms at no incremental cost to us for 2011 and 2012. This was our plan going into these joint ventures. 
Two participation agreements, as I mentioned, are complete and operated, and sales transaction is expected to close in early May. And as we said, cash proceeds are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million subject to final adjustment. 
In closing, Cabot's operational program remains fairly simple, spending $350 million in the best area industry as discovered in the Marcellus, that will deliver us significant returns with stellar reserve and production growth. Additionally, we'll allocate the remainder of our capital, $250 million to the oil window at Eagle Ford, which will increase our oil reserves and our production year-over-year. So the best rate of return gas project in North America, which includes comparing rate of returns to many oil projects plus a great rate of return project in the South region. Additionally, we had several other oil initiatives that we are moving on. 
Well, with that quick overview, I'll stop here and answer any questions the group might have."

Governor Corbett's commission is staying in Marcellus and looking at the entire space and trying to balance the environmental aspects, along with the tremendous upside potential in the form of jobs and revenue generated by the Marcellus for the state. The conversations, which we're all aware of, have been along the lines of severance tax. And Corbett's made clear that he is not in favor of severance tax. There has been discussion on an impact fee, which would be a fee generated whether it is based on a pad side or your well permitting or volumes is yet to be determined. But that impact fee would be for the benefit of the local communities where the activity is taking place. And whether or not that holds true and how the final form of that is anybody's guess at this stage. More on the regulatory side, they recently announced, Mike Krancer, the Secretary of the DEP, recently announced the -- where we do not -- they do not want any produced water to be taken to the public disposal sites anymore. And we fully support that. We don't have any problems with that. For a long, long time, we have been recycling 100% of our frac water and we are not taking any of our produced frac fluids to any of these sites, so it's not effect on Cabot. I think with the decision made, I think the majority of the industry will be recycling their produced water, so I don't think that's going to have an effect. As far as any incremental regulations, certainly the EPA is going to continue to try and get involved in our business. They feel like the controlling hydraulic fractioning, as an example, should be an EPA item. We are fully convinced and supportive that the states can control their regulations much, much better than a federal oversight body could. And with our full disclosure now of frac fluids and chemicals on the groundwater commissions website, fracfocus.org, I think the clarity and concern about what we put in frac fluids is also a benefit to the community and the politicians. But aside from that, and again looking at what industry is doing up there, I think every one of us are trying to employ the best available technology. Using premium thread connections is one area that we are employing. And we think it is a benefit to the community and to the environment, and we're doing all we can right now to mitigate any potential risk. I think it is, and should be stated, and maybe we should be a little bit more vocal as an industry to state that there's no large-scale industry like the manufacturing industry or the extraction industry or many other types of industries out there that has a 0 potential for offset. I think we do our fair share and we spend millions and millions of dollars to mitigate any risk. But I think it has to be understood by all that in order to have our energy source and in order to have cars to drive and be able to flip a switch and turn on the lights, that there is a lot of work behind the scenes to be able to get there and there is inherent risk with every type of industry out there."

Some of our other wells are also not being pulled as hard as they possibly could. We do anticipate though with the infrastructure buildout, which we're getting very, very close to on the Lathrop station dehy [dehydration] and additional pipelines.

And then in the eastern part of our block, at the Lennoxville area, we planned -- we already have our 12-inch tapped there in Tennessee and a compressor site.

I appreciate everybody joining for this conference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP and Regional Manager in the South; and Steve Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology, with me",1843,"Thank you, Melissa. I appreciate everybody joining for this conference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP and Regional Manager in the South; and Steve Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology, with me today.  As you're aware, the boilerplate language that's in our forward-looking statements included in the press release will apply to my comments today.
We have several items to cover, and I'll also expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I'll briefly cover the first quarter financial results and a discussion of our operations and further plans for 2011. And at the end, we'll leave ample time for Q&A.
Cabot did report its financial results for the first quarter with clean earnings of just over $20 million and with discretionary cash flow of about $109 million. This quarter continued the same trend of lower natural gas price realizations, offset by robust production growth. Throughout the remainder of 2011, I would expect to see similar commodity pricing and also a continued increase in our production profile. 
In terms of production, the company posted a 41% production growth rate between comparable first quarters. 37.7 Bcf was the highest quarterly production total the company has ever reported. Along with this production achievement is the fact that last week, we surpassed 100 Bcf cumulative production level for the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and we did this in just under 3 years. At our current production rate, the next 100 Bcf of production will be achieved within less than a year. 
Looking ahead to guidance. Last night, we posted new full year 2011 expectations, increasing the overall growth rate to 34% to 42%. Effectively, the guidance midpoint is now 5% higher than before. The low end of the guidance is based on the current production levels. The high end of the guidance is tempered by our best guess of timing of the commissioning of the additional dehydration units, which we are currently installing, and the hookup of additional gathering lines to the Lathrop compressor station. With the dehydration and additional gathering lines, we think we can move an additional 50 million to 70 million cubic foot of gas to the market.  
Any upside to our second quarter guidance would be dependent upon the timing of these 2 items. And again, that's upside to the second quarter guidance.  You will note as we move to the third and fourth quarters, we are increasing our guidance as we anticipate the commissioning of the Williams Springville line from Lathrop to the Transco interstate line, which is 30 miles south. 
To summarize, I understand there remains a lot of near-term noise and some uncertainty on the timing of infrastructure, however, each day, we get a little bit more clarity on these items. By the end of the second quarter, Lathrop should be fully commissioned with the piping and dehydration installation. At this point in time, we will be waiting on the Springville pipeline. Again, the infrastructure capacity, this is not production, but the infrastructure capacity at Lathrop and Teel at the end of the second quarter will be 550 million cubic foot of capacity. 
Following the Springville commissioning, we will begin producing into this available capacity. And our guidance reflects what we think might be a conservative look at the expectations as we fill up this capacity in the third and fourth quarters. I think, most importantly, is the fact that our well performance and the deliverability that we've seen from our completions has not changed, and we continue to add to the backlog of completions for future productivity.
Okay. As part of our marketing effort, our costs associated with the required firm transportation arrangements and our gathering fee have grown. And as such, we are now reflected on separate line items. Previously, these costs were an offset to realized prices. The impact of this change to historical comparisons is 0, as realized prices are slightly higher to completely offset the new expense category. 
For the first time, we have posted guidance for the transportation line, which captures all of these arrangements company-wide. This addition, together with some reductions in DD&A, financing, operating costs and in addition to a slight increase in G&A, excluding the pension termination and stock compensation, are the changes that were reflected and posted to our costs guidance. 
Now let's move to operations for 2011. Our plans remain unchanged from our original budget. We're holding firm to a $600 million capital program that has $350 million directed towards the North region for our Marcellus and $250 million in the South region for the Eagle Ford oil initiative. I would note that the first quarter disclosure for capital investments on the cash flow statement included over $30 million of 2010 carryover that was paid in 2011. 
Now let's take a look at our hedging. Cabot did take advantage of a short window of opportunity with natural gas price strength during the first part of the quarter, to add hedges in 2012 and 2013. This effort now has the company with 21 contracts for 2012 production, excluding the 5 basis only hedges, and 5 contracts we placed for 2013 production. The hedge slide that we have on our website will illustrate all of this. 
Moving to the North region and a little bit of detail, some of this might be a little redundant, but we do continue to establish new milestones in the Marcellus. During the first quarter, we had a new production record of 320 million gross per day, predominantly from 57 horizontal wells. Cabot continues to have excellent results as demonstrated by a 2-well pad site that has been in line for 3 months and is currently producing 36 million cubic foot a day, in addition to our first 6-well pad site that is producing at a curtailed rate of 51 million cubic foot per day. We would expect the 6-well pad site to be able to produce around 70 million to 80 million cubic foot uncurtailed. 
On the completion side, we have just finished frac-ing a 5-well pad site that is currently cleaning up. Also, we are in the process of completing our longest lateral to date, which was a total usable lateral length of over 6,000 feet, and we're well on our way to finalize 26 stages in this completion. Cabot continues to run 5 rigs in the Marcellus and has a total of 560 stages being completed or cleaned up, waiting on pipeline or waiting to be completed. Our dedicated frac crew has been very effective, averaging 3 completions stages per pumping day during March. And we generally average about 20 pumping days per month. 
At the Lathrop compressor station, which Williams now owns, there are a total of 7 compressors running, giving us a current capacity of 225 million cubic foot per day at the Lathrop station. Once the additional dehydration units, which I've talked about, are installed along with additional piping, the capacity at the station will increase to 450 million per day. And the Teel station will have another 100 million a day to get us to that 550 million I previously mentioned. Again, actually flowing capacity will be tied to the interstate take-away capacity and the completion of the Williams line to the south. And that completion and commissioning of that Springville line down to Transco is anticipated for the third quarter. 
In terms of other initiatives, we have several initiatives going on. In regard to the one that's most visible, the Heath, we have a completion crew scheduled for late May. This well is designed for an 8-stage frac, and we'll report the results when we get these results available. We do have several other items or several other initiatives going on, which we will also report on in a timely fashion in the appropriate time. We have been asked about our future plans in the Heath and right now, we're just currently focused on the completion of this particular well.
Now let's move south into the Eagle Ford area and our Buckhorn area. The company has successfully completed 3 recent Eagle Ford wells. Each well is a 100% Cabot well and they're located in Frio County. The wells flowed at a 24-hour rate of 558 barrels per day equivalent, 400 -- excuse me, that's 958 barrels of oil per day equivalent, 460 barrels of oil per day equivalent and 345 barrels a day equivalent. The 345 barrels per day was a well that we got a little bit out of zone in. But nevertheless, it's early in the completion techniques in this area and we certainly like the results we've seen so far. Three additional wells have been drilled and cased in the Buckhorn area and they will be completed in May and June. Additionally, there are 3 wells that have been drilled in our 18,000-plus acre AMI with EOG. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford oil wells in 2011. 
In regard to our activity in East Texas and our Haynesville joint ventures, Cabot has finalized 2 agreements that would allow us to maintain a large percentage of our Haynesville acreage with no capital investment. These agreements will provide Cabot with a carried interest in the initial well covering 24 units. If commodity prices remain at similar levels and with the acreage held by the initial well in each unit, no subsequent drilling would occur in these units for a period of time. 
An additional agreement that Cabot has been working on is to sell a minority interest in some nonoperated units, both producing and nonproducing, with net production to Cabot of approximately 4 million cubic foot per day. And that is executed and moving towards close. Combined, these agreements will allow Cabot to maintain approximately 22,000 net acres of its original 33,000 net acres in the play within the original lease terms at no incremental cost to us for 2011 and 2012. This was our plan going into these joint ventures. 
Two participation agreements, as I mentioned, are complete and operated, and the sales transaction is expected to close in early May. And as we said, cash proceeds are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, subject to final adjustment. 
In closing, Cabot's operational program remains fairly simple, spending $350 million in the best area industry has discovered in the Marcellus, that will deliver us significant returns with stellar reserve and production growth. Additionally, we'll allocate the remainder of our capital, $250 million, to the oil window at Eagle Ford, which will increase our oil reserves and our production year-over-year. So we have the best rate of return gas project in North America, which includes comparing rate of returns to many oil projects plus a great rate of return project in the South region. Additionally, we had several other oil initiatives that we are moving on. 
Melissa, with that quick overview, I'll stop here and answer any questions the group might have."

Governor Corbett's commission is studying the Marcellus and looking at the entire space and trying to balance the environmental aspects, along with the tremendous upside potential in the form of jobs and revenue generated by the Marcellus for the state. The conversations, which we're all aware of, have been along the lines of a severance tax. And Corbett's made clear that he is not in favor of a severance tax. There's been discussion on an impact fee, which would be a fee generated. Whether it is based on a pad site or your well permitting or volumes is yet to be determined. But that impact fee would be for the benefit of the local communities where the activity is taking place. And whether or not that holds true and how the final form of that is anybody's guess at this stage. More on the regulatory side, they recently announced -- Mike Krancer, the Secretary of the DEP, recently announced the -- where we do not -- they do not want any produced water to be taken to the public disposal sites anymore. And we fully support that. We don't have any problems with that. For a long, long time, we have been recycling 100% of our frac water and we are not taking any of our produced frac fluids to any of these sites, so it's non-effect on Cabot. I think with the decision made, I think the majority of the industry will be recycling their produced water, so I don't think that's going to have an effect. As far as any incremental regulations, certainly the EPA is going to continue to try and get involved in our business. They feel like controlling hydraulic fractioning, as an example, should be an EPA item. We are fully convinced and supportive that the states can control their regulations much, much better than a federal oversight body could. And with our full disclosure now of frac fluids and chemicals on the groundwater commission's website, fracfocus.org, I think the clarity and concern about what we put in frac fluids is also a benefit to the community and the politicians. But aside from that, and again looking at what industry is doing up there, I think every one of us are trying to employ the best available technology. Using premium thread connections is one area that we are employing. And we think it is a benefit to the community and to the environment, and we're doing all we can right now to mitigate any potential risk. I think it is, and should be stated, and maybe we should be a little bit more vocal as an industry to state that there's no large-scale industry like the manufacturing industry or the extraction industry or many other types of industries out there that has a 0 potential for upsets. I think we do our fair share and we spend millions and millions of dollars to mitigate any risk. But I think it has to be understood by all that, in order to have our energy source and in order to have cars to drive and be able to flip a switch and turn on the lights, that there is a lot of work behind the scenes to be able to get there and there is inherent risk with every type of industry out there."

As I mentioned in the 6-stage -- I mean 6-well pad, we have that particular pad site restricted and curtailed right now. Some of our other wells are also not being pulled as hard as they possibly could. We do anticipate, though, with the infrastructure buildout, which we're getting very, very close to on the Lathrop station dehy [dehydration] and additional pipelines, and Williams, we know, is working diligently to get that pipeline put into the South, we do anticipate that we'll be able to add another frac crew. It'll probably be towards the end of '11 or the beginning of '12 and look at picking up some of these -- picking up the pace, if you will, on some of the wells that are in the queue.

And that's, again, kind of a third quarter timing on that. They'll have -- they should have everything ready to go, and of course we'll be ready to go. And then in the eastern part of our block, at the Lennoxville area, we've planned -- we already have our 12-inch tap there at Tennessee and a compressor site. Again, we were able to free flow quite a bit of gas in the Tennessee without compression prior to building Lathrop. And so we intend to do the same thing, although there is already compressors ordered and the site is there, and right away is acquired. So I would say that's kind of end of the year, first quarter 2012 timing.

I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP and Regional Manager in the South; and Steve Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology, with me",1843,"Thank you, Melissa. I appreciate everybody joining for this conference call. I have Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Matt Reid, VP and Regional Manager in the South; and Steve Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology, with me today.  As you're aware, the boilerplate language that's in our forward-looking statements included in the press release will apply to my comments today.
We have several items to cover, and I'll also expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I'll briefly cover the first quarter financial results and a discussion of our operations and further plans for 2011. And at the end, we'll leave ample time for Q&A.
Cabot did report its financial results for the first quarter with clean earnings of just over $20 million and with discretionary cash flow of about $109 million. This quarter continued the same trend of lower natural gas price realizations, offset by robust production growth. Throughout the remainder of 2011, I would expect to see similar commodity pricing and also a continued increase in our production profile. 
In terms of production, the company posted a 41% production growth rate between comparable first quarters. 37.7 Bcf was the highest quarterly production total the company has ever reported. Along with this production achievement is the fact that last week, we surpassed 100 Bcf cumulative production level for the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and we did this in just under 3 years. At our current production rate, the next 100 Bcf of production will be achieved within less than a year. 
Looking ahead to guidance. Last night, we posted new full year 2011 expectations, increasing the overall growth rate to 34% to 42%. Effectively, the guidance midpoint is now 5% higher than before. The low end of the guidance is based on the current production levels. The high end of the guidance is tempered by our best guess of timing of the commissioning of the additional dehydration units, which we are currently installing, and the hookup of additional gathering lines to the Lathrop compressor station. With the dehydration and additional gathering lines, we think we can move an additional 50 million to 70 million cubic foot of gas to the market.  
Any upside to our second quarter guidance would be dependent upon the timing of these 2 items. And again, that's upside to the second quarter guidance.  You will note as we move to the third and fourth quarters, we are increasing our guidance as we anticipate the commissioning of the Williams Springville line from Lathrop to the Transco interstate line, which is 30 miles south. 
To summarize, I understand there remains a lot of near-term noise and some uncertainty on the timing of infrastructure, however, each day, we get a little bit more clarity on these items. By the end of the second quarter, Lathrop should be fully commissioned with the piping and dehydration installation. At this point in time, we will be waiting on the Springville pipeline. Again, the infrastructure capacity, this is not production, but the infrastructure capacity at Lathrop and Teel at the end of the second quarter will be 550 million cubic foot of capacity. 
Following the Springville commissioning, we will begin producing into this available capacity. And our guidance reflects what we think might be a conservative look at the expectations as we fill up this capacity in the third and fourth quarters. I think, most importantly, is the fact that our well performance and the deliverability that we've seen from our completions has not changed, and we continue to add to the backlog of completions for future productivity.
Okay. As part of our marketing effort, our costs associated with the required firm transportation arrangements and our gathering fee have grown. And as such, we are now reflected on separate line items. Previously, these costs were an offset to realized prices. The impact of this change to historical comparisons is 0, as realized prices are slightly higher to completely offset the new expense category. 
For the first time, we have posted guidance for the transportation line, which captures all of these arrangements company-wide. This addition, together with some reductions in DD&A, financing, operating costs and in addition to a slight increase in G&A, excluding the pension termination and stock compensation, are the changes that were reflected and posted to our costs guidance. 
Now let's move to operations for 2011. Our plans remain unchanged from our original budget. We're holding firm to a $600 million capital program that has $350 million directed towards the North region for our Marcellus and $250 million in the South region for the Eagle Ford oil initiative. I would note that the first quarter disclosure for capital investments on the cash flow statement included over $30 million of 2010 carryover that was paid in 2011. 
Now let's take a look at our hedging. Cabot did take advantage of a short window of opportunity with natural gas price strength during the first part of the quarter, to add hedges in 2012 and 2013. This effort now has the company with 21 contracts for 2012 production, excluding the 5 basis only hedges, and 5 contracts we placed for 2013 production. The hedge slide that we have on our website will illustrate all of this. 
Moving to the North region and a little bit of detail, some of this might be a little redundant, but we do continue to establish new milestones in the Marcellus. During the first quarter, we had a new production record of 320 million gross per day, predominantly from 57 horizontal wells. Cabot continues to have excellent results as demonstrated by a 2-well pad site that has been in line for 3 months and is currently producing 36 million cubic foot a day, in addition to our first 6-well pad site that is producing at a curtailed rate of 51 million cubic foot per day. We would expect the 6-well pad site to be able to produce around 70 million to 80 million cubic foot uncurtailed. 
On the completion side, we have just finished frac-ing a 5-well pad site that is currently cleaning up. Also, we are in the process of completing our longest lateral to date, which was a total usable lateral length of over 6,000 feet, and we're well on our way to finalize 26 stages in this completion. Cabot continues to run 5 rigs in the Marcellus and has a total of 560 stages being completed or cleaned up, waiting on pipeline or waiting to be completed. Our dedicated frac crew has been very effective, averaging 3 completions stages per pumping day during March. And we generally average about 20 pumping days per month. 
At the Lathrop compressor station, which Williams now owns, there are a total of 7 compressors running, giving us a current capacity of 225 million cubic foot per day at the Lathrop station. Once the additional dehydration units, which I've talked about, are installed along with additional piping, the capacity at the station will increase to 450 million per day. And the Teel station will have another 100 million a day to get us to that 550 million I previously mentioned. Again, actually flowing capacity will be tied to the interstate take-away capacity and the completion of the Williams line to the south. And that completion and commissioning of that Springville line down to Transco is anticipated for the third quarter. 
In terms of other initiatives, we have several initiatives going on. In regard to the one that's most visible, the Heath, we have a completion crew scheduled for late May. This well is designed for an 8-stage frac, and we'll report the results when we get these results available. We do have several other items or several other initiatives going on, which we will also report on in a timely fashion in the appropriate time. We have been asked about our future plans in the Heath and right now, we're just currently focused on the completion of this particular well.
Now let's move south into the Eagle Ford area and our Buckhorn area. The company has successfully completed 3 recent Eagle Ford wells. Each well is a 100% Cabot well and they're located in Frio County. The wells flowed at a 24-hour rate of 558 barrels per day equivalent, 400 -- excuse me, that's 958 barrels of oil per day equivalent, 460 barrels of oil per day equivalent and 345 barrels a day equivalent. The 345 barrels per day was a well that we got a little bit out of zone in. But nevertheless, it's early in the completion techniques in this area and we certainly like the results we've seen so far. Three additional wells have been drilled and cased in the Buckhorn area and they will be completed in May and June. Additionally, there are 3 wells that have been drilled in our 18,000-plus acre AMI with EOG. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford oil wells in 2011. 
In regard to our activity in East Texas and our Haynesville joint ventures, Cabot has finalized 2 agreements that would allow us to maintain a large percentage of our Haynesville acreage with no capital investment. These agreements will provide Cabot with a carried interest in the initial well covering 24 units. If commodity prices remain at similar levels and with the acreage held by the initial well in each unit, no subsequent drilling would occur in these units for a period of time. 
An additional agreement that Cabot has been working on is to sell a minority interest in some nonoperated units, both producing and nonproducing, with net production to Cabot of approximately 4 million cubic foot per day. And that is executed and moving towards close. Combined, these agreements will allow Cabot to maintain approximately 22,000 net acres of its original 33,000 net acres in the play within the original lease terms at no incremental cost to us for 2011 and 2012. This was our plan going into these joint ventures. 
Two participation agreements, as I mentioned, are complete and operated, and the sales transaction is expected to close in early May. And as we said, cash proceeds are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, subject to final adjustment. 
In closing, Cabot's operational program remains fairly simple, spending $350 million in the best area industry has discovered in the Marcellus, that will deliver us significant returns with stellar reserve and production growth. Additionally, we'll allocate the remainder of our capital, $250 million, to the oil window at Eagle Ford, which will increase our oil reserves and our production year-over-year. So we have the best rate of return gas project in North America, which includes comparing rate of returns to many oil projects plus a great rate of return project in the South region. Additionally, we had several other oil initiatives that we are moving on. 
Melissa, with that quick overview, I'll stop here and answer any questions the group might have."

Governor Corbett's commission is studying the Marcellus and looking at the entire space and trying to balance the environmental aspects, along with the tremendous upside potential in the form of jobs and revenue generated by the Marcellus for the state. The conversations, which we're all aware of, have been along the lines of a severance tax. And Corbett's made clear that he is not in favor of a severance tax. There's been discussion on an impact fee, which would be a fee generated. Whether it is based on a pad site or your well permitting or volumes is yet to be determined. But that impact fee would be for the benefit of the local communities where the activity is taking place. And whether or not that holds true and how the final form of that is anybody's guess at this stage. More on the regulatory side, they recently announced -- Mike Krancer, the Secretary of the DEP, recently announced the -- where we do not -- they do not want any produced water to be taken to the public disposal sites anymore. And we fully support that. We don't have any problems with that. For a long, long time, we have been recycling 100% of our frac water and we are not taking any of our produced frac fluids to any of these sites, so it's non-effect on Cabot. I think with the decision made, I think the majority of the industry will be recycling their produced water, so I don't think that's going to have an effect. As far as any incremental regulations, certainly the EPA is going to continue to try and get involved in our business. They feel like controlling hydraulic fractioning, as an example, should be an EPA item. We are fully convinced and supportive that the states can control their regulations much, much better than a federal oversight body could. And with our full disclosure now of frac fluids and chemicals on the groundwater commission's website, fracfocus.org, I think the clarity and concern about what we put in frac fluids is also a benefit to the community and the politicians. But aside from that, and again looking at what industry is doing up there, I think every one of us are trying to employ the best available technology. Using premium thread connections is one area that we are employing. And we think it is a benefit to the community and to the environment, and we're doing all we can right now to mitigate any potential risk. I think it is, and should be stated, and maybe we should be a little bit more vocal as an industry to state that there's no large-scale industry like the manufacturing industry or the extraction industry or many other types of industries out there that has a 0 potential for upsets. I think we do our fair share and we spend millions and millions of dollars to mitigate any risk. But I think it has to be understood by all that, in order to have our energy source and in order to have cars to drive and be able to flip a switch and turn on the lights, that there is a lot of work behind the scenes to be able to get there and there is inherent risk with every type of industry out there."

We have -- in fact, we had moved on a spot crew out there, we moved a second crew in to pick up a location that had a couple of wells on it recently.

As I mentioned in the 6-stage -- I mean 6-well pad, we have that particular pad site restricted and curtailed right now. Some of our other wells are also not being pulled as hard as they possibly could. We do anticipate, though, with the infrastructure buildout, which we're getting very, very close to on the Lathrop station dehy [dehydration] and additional pipelines, and Williams, we know, is working diligently to get that pipeline put into the South, we do anticipate that we'll be able to add another frac crew. It'll probably be towards the end of '11 or the beginning of '12 and look at picking up some of these -- picking up the pace, if you will, on some of the wells that are in the queue.

And that's, again, kind of a third quarter timing on that. They'll have -- they should have everything ready to go, and of course we'll be ready to go. And then in the eastern part of our block, at the Lennoxville area, we've planned -- we already have our 12-inch tap there at Tennessee and a compressor site. Again, we were able to free flow quite a bit of gas in the Tennessee without compression prior to building Lathrop. And so we intend to do the same thing, although there is already compressors ordered and the site is there, and right away is acquired. So I would say that's kind of end of the year, first quarter 2012 timing. And then the, of course, Springville line is due to be in place third quarter this year and the first expansion is April, May of 2012, with a second expansion planned for May of 2013."

It is the better well performance that we reported back in February. And it's also, if you think about our Marcellus gas, it's got a UOP [ph] rate of less than $1 from a DD&A perspective, and it is a growing component of the blended rate. In other words, that accounts for 2/3 to 3/4 of our production base. So that's the dynamic that is driving the DD&A rate down."

Good morning and I appreciate everybody joining us for this call.

Good morning and I appreciate everybody joining us for this call. I have with me today from corporate head, Scott Schroeder, you all know Jeff Hutton, Steve Lindeman, also have the 2 regional managers, Matt Reid and Phil Stalnaker. Before we start, you're aware that the forward-looking statements included in the press release apply to my comments today.
At this time, we have many things to cover and talk about. And I'd also like to expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I will briefly cover second quarter financial results. I'll also have discussions of our operations in both regions, north and south. And I'll cover so the rationale behind the sale of our Rocky Mountains assets and some of the use of those proceeds.
Overview should be fairly brief and will allow ample time for questions at the end. Cabot reported its financial results for the first quarter with clean earnings of $43 million and with discretionary cash flow of about $147 million. This quarter continued the consistent trend of lower natural gas price realizations, offset by very robust production growth. 
We expect natural gas prices to remain ranged down through the remainder of 2011 as we have seen in the first half. Additionally, we anticipate robust production for the remainder of the year, which I will outline in a few moments.
In terms of second quarter production, the company posted a 47.5% growth rate between comparable second quarter, producing 45 Bcfe. That's the highest quarterly production that Cabot has ever reported. We continue to enjoy high growth rate from our gas portfolio, but I'm particularly pleased to see that results of our liquids initiatives with over 20% growth in oil volume. With more wells coming on stream, I would expect this will -- liquid increase to continue.
For our guidance, with our wells still showing excellent results, last night we posted a new full year 2011 guidance, increasing the overall growth rate to 46%, up from 34% to 42%. This increase is based on the level of gas we are currently producing. The incremental volumes expected to free flow into the Laser Pipeline in Northeast PA and an additional interstate outlet expected to occur in the fourth quarter also in the Marcellus area. 
As a footnote, this increase in production guidance has taken into consideration the sale of our Rocky Mountains properties effective September 1, 2011, which is about 27 million cubic feet per day.
Cost guidance has been updated with decreases in operating expense. DD&A and other taxes and an increase in G&A and third quarter exploration expense. The net impact is an overall lowering of unit cost from previous guidance levels. Obviously the reduction of unit cost will yield incremental dollars to our bottom line and we do expect this trend to continue into 2012. 
We have maintained a strong preference to deliver a disciplined approach for our 2011 capital spending program. With our wealth of opportunities in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, continuous progress and infrastructure buildout up there, and our improved efficiencies and returns of our new liquids-rich ideas, we have decided to monetize a portion of our Rocky Mountains asset base and deploy some of those dollars towards additional drilling in both our north and south regions that will enhance our production profile for 2012. 
The assets result in the Rockies region were our legacy green river basin asset. We did not sell any of our early initiatives such as the Heath or --. Additionally we've monetized an asset not valued by the market providing an opportunity for a multiple value expansion with use of a portion of proceeds from this asset sale we will be able to drill a few incremental Marcellus wells and replace the production as we expand our effort into higher return areas. I'll cover more on the specifics around this capital plan a little bit later.
Cabot did add to its hedge book for 2011 and well during the quarter, which we posted in June. This effort now has a company with 28 contracts for the remainder of 2011 production, 28 contracts for 2012 production, excluding the 5 basis only hedges that we have. And 5 contracts for 2013 production. No new hedges were added since this last posting in June.
Operations, as we have previously discussed, operationally for 2011 our plans remain to deliver a net cash flow neutral program in light of our recent asset sales. We were more likely to deliver a debt reduction program after applying the proceeds from the sales. With that as a backdrop, we are evaluating adding $80 million to $100 million to our Marcellus program to drill 10 to 15 additional wells for the full year, along with -- to invest about $50 million for the Eagleford and Marmaton oil projects, including a small portion of the $50 million to be allocated towards another liquids-rich deal we are working on.
Now let's move specifically to the regions. In the North region, the wells in Susquehanna continue to exceed our expectations. We achieved a new one-day fuel production high of 140 million cubic foot, excuse me, 440 million cubic foot per day, some of the wells contributing to this record production include 5 wells completed in the quarter that each exceeded 20 million cubic foot per day for our 24-hour production rate with ranges between 21 million to 28 million per day. 
Also, the combined 30-day rate for the 5 wells was 100 million cubic foot per day. As we stated in the release, we indicated and we indicated the prolific nature of our area in the Marcellus by highlighting 2 wells that have now surpassed the 4 Bcf mark in cumulative production, one of those occurring in only 12 months, the other in 16 months time period, respectively. These wells still producing at a combined rate of over 10 million cubic foot per day.
As we anticipate the completion of some takeaway infrastructure in the near term, which I will discuss that in a moment we continue to add to our production capacity and our inventory. We are running 5 rigs in the Marcellus and a full-time frac crew. We have a total of 259 stages being completed, cleaning up or waiting to turn in line and an additional 323 stages waiting to be completed for a total of 582 stages. 
As you're aware, we remain constrained by the infrastructure capacity, which currently allows us to flow somewhere in between 400 million and 440 million cubic foot on any given day through the Teel and to the Tennessee 300 line.
The additional flow capacity interstate takeaway capacity, which will remain static as I mentioned until the completion of the Williams Springville line, which is tied to our Lathrop station running down to Transco to the south and/or the completion of the Laser Pipeline from the northern portion of our acreage, which will run to the north and tie into the Millennium Pipeline.
Now everybody is anxious just as we are to receive the news and see the progress of this infrastructure buildout. In particular, the Springville pipeline and its status. I'm pleased to announce the pipeline construction has begun on segments of the pipeline and significant progress has been made regarding the installation of the compressor station located in Wyoming County. 
However, even under the best circumstance, project completion has slipped slightly to the fourth quarter. To be conservative, we are modeling a December in-service date, which is reflected in our guidance. In addition to the Springville line, the Laser Pipeline to the north attached to the Millennium is also currently under construction with an early fourth quarter in-service date. We have begun completion activity on the handful of wells targeted for completion and connection to the Laser line, again anticipating modest production adds for the fourth quarter in our guidance.
So as of today, Cabot has pipeline capacity up to 440 million cubic foot per day and compression capacity of up to 550 million cubic foot per day.
Now let me get into the future plan and describe what is going to come about and the timing that will come about with the buildout. First, I'm going to address just the pipeline and the timing of the pipeline. And then I'm going to discuss compression and the timing of the compression installation. At the end of these numbers, I will circle back around and give you a summary of the key dates to look for and some of those volumes when you tie the pipeline and compression capacity together.
So first off, with the new pipeline capacity expected in the fourth quarter and throughout 2012. Here are some of the numbers break down: The Laser takeaway just the pipe is scheduled for October at 50 million cubic foot per day tying into the Millennium line. But we will be able to utilize at that point in time for free cash flow gas. 
Springville takeaway, heading to the south, is anticipated as I mentioned in December and that pipeline has the capacity at 300 million cubic foot per day to carry down to Transco. Beyond that is attached to our Lathrop compressor station. And March of 2012, Phase II of Laser will add an incremental 50 million cubic foot per day. And in April of 12, Lennox takeaway pipeline will have an incremental 150 million cubic foot per day, which Lennox is tied to Tennessee. Again I do plan on circling back around and tying these numbers together. 
Now let me move to the compression capacity, which is expected to be installed and commissioned in 2012. The Laser compression in March of 2012 will be the 50 million cubic foot per day. The Lennoxville compression, which will be in April of 2012 will be at 150 million cubic foot per day, and Williams central compression, which is July of 2012 will be 300 million cubic foot per day. 
So when you combine and tie together this in-service date with both pipeline takeaway and compression capacity, the true takeaway ability from our well head into the market is going to be as follows, and these are really the key dates that you ought to focus on. 
The Laser pipeline in October of 12, we anticipate having the capacity, excuse me, in October of 2011, we anticipate having the capacity of 50 million cubic foot per day that we could free cash flow some gas. In December of 2011, we anticipate that the Springville line will be available at about 100 million cubic foot per day.
In March of 2012, Laser Pipeline will add an incremental 50 million cubic foot per day. In April of 2012, the Lennoxville compression pipeline will have 150 million cubic foot per day. And the central compressor that I discussed for Springville in July of 2012 will have an incremental 200 million cubic foot per day. 
So to sum it up, we will be adding 550 million cubic foot per day of total takeaway capacity, which includes price and compression to the current capacity of 440 million cubic foot per day to give us a total takeaway of approximately 1 Bcf per day by mid 2012. We also have other modifications and expansions planned and have not changed our original target of 1.2 Bcf per day total takeaway infrastructure by year end 2012.
If you have any questions Jeff Hutton he will be able to clarify. Also in the north region, Cabot initial well in our Heath prospects located in -- County Montana was completed in the second quarter. This late stage completion is currently on test and recovering load water. The process has taken longer than anticipated. 
However, we have recovered about 20% of our frac load to date. The well initially flowed in as anticipated we did place the well on comp. We're still optimistic on this completion. And we're in the process currently of making a well bore cleanout run and we'll be able to give additional information on this in September.
Going to the South region in Buckhorn area in the Eagle, the company has drilled a total of 17 wells, each well is a 100% working interest well in Frio County, 11 of these wells -- with 3 wells completing, 3 wells waiting on completion and 2 wells currently drilling. As the press release highlighted, 4 of the 11 producing wells were placed on production during the second quarter. These 4 wells each produced at a combined average initial 24 hour rate of 721 barrels of oil equivalent.
Up until now, we have had residual gas as there was no pipeline connection. We're pleased to announce our new pipeline system is now in place in Buckhorn in partnership with our midstream services, the pipeline infrastructure commenced service in early July at approximately 3 million cubic foot per day presently being produced into the pipeline. 
Our old pipeline infrastructure is scheduled to be in service early in the fourth quarter. Both projects will greatly enhance our overall operations in the Eagle Ford area. In our AMI area with EOG, there are 2 wells at presently drilling in this 18,000 plus acre area. Cabot intends to participate in total, 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011.
Also, covered under our south region and moving up to Oklahoma and Beaver County, Cabot completed its first Marmaton well with a 24-hour rate 592 barrels of oil and 325 Mcf per day for an equivalent total of 646 barrels. The well is drilled with a 4,000-foot lateral -- with a 10-stage frac for around $4 million. 
The well averaged 368 barrels plus 130 or so Mcf per day for the first 30 days. And 320 barrels of oil and 189 Mcf per day of gas for the first 60 days. It's a little early to discuss EURs but a range we could throw out would be a expectation of 175 to 225 MBoe. 
We're very pleased with these results and Cabot's immediate plans are to participate in 5 to 6 additional non-operated wells to further evaluate play, along with looking for a rig to drill another operated well or 2. Cabot has increased its acreage position in the area as a result of these early results. It's over 32,000 net acres. 
In closing, Cabot operational program remains simple, focused our gas efforts only in the Marcellus and allocate dollars in the oil window is of the Eagleford and now the Marmaton, which will increase our oil reserves and oil production year-over-year. With asset sales now close or moving towards a close, we're going to take advantage of additional dollars to enhance our 2011 year end reserves and the opportunity to increase our early 2012 production capacity expectations.
Additionally, we will be securing more liquids-rich acreage to improve our lines in several of these areas. We have already highlighted our production expectation post the asset sale and our reserves are expected to approximate 3 TCF at year end even after taking into consideration the asset sale lever. So as we increase reserves, increase production and add more acreage to future drilling opportunities, we will also most likely be reducing our debt year-over-year.
With that quick summary. Stephanie, I will be more than happy to open up the lines for questions."

We are talking and looking at extended contracts into our 2012 program. But our average cost per well very dependent upon the total lateral linked and the number of stages, and we have not seen a great deal of difference in those costs. I would anticipate at some point in time to gain efficiencies with keeping a rig maybe on location a little bit longer to drill more wells on location efficiencies versus drilling may be 1 or 2 wells per pad. I think we're gaining the efficiencies on our construction of our pad sites. We're recycling 100% of our flowback water and also our drill water now. And we're reusing that, so that is creating some efficiency for us. And we're looking out the logistics of moving water up there, which is a fairly big cost to improve on those types of logistics. So we're doing things to keep the cost as they are or in fact reduce the cost up there. So our cost per well, per stage, if you will, has not changed dramatically."

The takeaways, just to kind of reiterate, I think we've done a decent job on keeping our capital discipline. I like our guidance increasing even in light of asset sales and the redeployment of the capital into our key areas in the Marcellus, Eagleford and Marmaton is going to set us up well for year end reserves and also early in increased expectations in 12 for production. Very pleased that we're going to have a Bcf capacity takeaway within a year from today and in 2012, with Matt and Phil staying here and I'm sure got the numbers are going to give us so we can talk to the board that will show reserve growth, production growth. And I would imagine it's going to be certainly within a cash flow neutral program and most likely a cash flow positive program in 2012. And certainly couldn't ask any more from the team. I appreciate your interest. Thank you."

Good morning, and I appreciate everybody joining us for this call. I have with me today -- from corporate, I have Scott Schroeder. You all know Jeff Hutton, Steve Lindeman, and I also have the 2 regional managers, Matt Reid and Phil",2592,"Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and I appreciate everybody joining us for this call. I have with me today -- from corporate, I have Scott Schroeder. You all know Jeff Hutton, Steve Lindeman, and I also have the 2 regional managers, Matt Reid and Phil Stalnaker. Before we start, you're aware that the forward-looking statements included in the press release apply to my comments today.
At this time, we have many things to cover and talk about. And I'd also like to expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I will briefly cover our second quarter financial results. I'll also have discussions of the operations in both regions, north and south. And I'll cover so the rationale behind the sale of our Rocky Mountains assets and some of the use of those proceeds.
Overview should be fairly brief, and I will allow ample time for questions at the end. Cabot reported its financial results for the first quarter with clean earnings of $43 million and with discretionary cash flow of about $147 million. This quarter continued the consistent trend of low natural gas price realizations, offset by very robust production growth. 
We expect natural gas prices to remain ranged down through the remainder of 2011, as we have seen in the first half. Additionally, we anticipate robust production for the remainder of the year, which I will outline in a few moments.
In terms of second quarter production, the company posted a 47.5% growth rate between comparable second quarters, producing 45 Bcfe. That's the highest quarterly production that Cabot has ever reported. We continue to enjoy high growth rate from our gas portfolio, but I'm particularly pleased to see the results of our liquids initiative with over 20% growth in oil volumes. With more wells coming on stream, I would expect this oil and liquids increase to continue.
For our guidance, with our wells still showing excellent results, last night we posted a new full year 2011 guidance, increasing the overall growth rate to 46%, up from 34% to 42%. This increase is based on the level of gas we are currently producing. The incremental volumes expected to free flow into the Laser Pipeline in Northeast PA and an additional interstate outlet expected to occur in the fourth quarter also in the Marcellus area. 
As a footnote, this increase in production guidance has taken in consideration the sale of our Rocky Mountains properties effective September 1, 2011, which is about 27 million cubic feet per day.
Cost guidance has been updated with decreases in operating expense, DD&A and other taxes and an increase in G&A and third quarter exploration expense. The net impact is an overall lowering of unit cost from previous guidance levels. Obviously the reduction of unit cost will yield incremental dollars to our bottom line, and we do expect this trend to continue into 2012. 
We have maintained a strong preference to deliver a disciplined approach for our 2011 capital spending program. With our wealth of opportunities in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, our continuous progress in the infrastructure buildout up there, and our improved efficiencies and returns of our new liquids-rich ideas, we have decided to monetize a portion of our Rocky Mountains asset base and deploy some of those dollars towards additional drilling in both our north and south regions that will enhance our production profile for 2012. 
The assets result on the Rockies region were our legacy Green River Basin assets. We did not sell any of our early initiatives such as the Heath or Chainman. Essentially, we've monetized an asset not valued by the market, providing an opportunity for a multiple value expansion. With the use of a portion of proceeds from this asset sale, we'll be able to drill a few incremental Marcellus wells and replace the sold production as we expand our efforts into high return areas. I'll cover more on the specifics around this capital plan a little bit later.
Cabot did add to its hedge book for 2011 and '12 during the quarter, which we've posted in June. This effort now has a company with 28 contracts for the remainder of 2011 production, 28 contracts for 2012 production, excluding the 5 basis only hedges that we have and 5 contracts for 2013 production. No new hedges were added since this last posting in June.
Operations, as we have previously discussed, operationally, for 2011 our plans remain to deliver a net cash flow neutral program in light of our recent asset sales. We were more likely to deliver a debt reduction program after applying the proceeds from the sales. With that as a backdrop, we are evaluating adding $80 million to $100 million to our Marcellus program to drill 10 to 15 additional wells for the full year, along with the south to invest about $50 million for the Eagleford and Marmaton oil projects, including a small portion of the $50 million to be allocated towards another liquids-rich deal we are working on.
Now let's move specifically to the regions. In the North region, the wells in Susquehanna continue to exceed our expectations. We achieved a new one-day fuel production high of 140 million cubic foot -- excuse me, 440 million cubic foot per day. Some of the wells contributing to this record production include 5 wells completed in the quarter, that each exceeded 20 million cubic foot per day for our 24-hour production rate with ranges between 21 million to 28 million per day. 
Also, the combined 30-day rate for the 5 wells was 100 million cubic foot per day. As we stated in the release, we indicated the prolific nature of our area in the Marcellus by highlighting 2 wells that have now surpassed the 4 Bcf mark in cumulative production, one of those occurring in only 12 months, the other in 16 months time period respectively, with these wells still producing at a combined rate of over 10 million cubic foot per day.
As we anticipate, the completion of some takeaway infrastructure in the near term, which I'll discuss that in a moment, we continue to add to our production capacity and our inventory. We are running 5 rigs in the Marcellus and a full-time frac crew. We have a total of 259 stages being completed, cleaning up or waiting to turn in line and an additional 323 stages waiting to be completed for a total of 582 stages. 
As you're aware, we remain constrained by the infrastructure capacity, which currently allows us to flow somewhere in between 400 million and 440 million cubic foot on any given day through the Teel and Lathrop into the Tennessee 300 line.
The additional flow capacity is tied to interstate takeaway capacity which will remain static, as I mentioned, until the completion of the Williams Springville line, which is tied to our Lathrop station running down to Transco to the south and/or the completion of the Laser Pipeline from the northern portion of our acreage, which will run to the north and tie into the Millennium Pipeline.
Now everybody is anxious, just as we are, to receive the news and see the progress of this infrastructure buildout. In particular, the Springville pipeline and its status. I'm pleased to announce that the pipeline construction has begun on segments of the pipeline, and significant progress has been made regarding the installation of their compressor station located in Wyoming County. 
However, even under the best circumstance, the project completion has slid slightly into the fourth quarter. To be conservative, we are modeling a December in-service date, which is reflected in our guidance. In addition to the Springville line, the Laser Pipeline to the north, going to attach to Millennium, is also currently under construction with an early fourth quarter in-service date. We have begun completion activities on the handful of wells targeted for completion and connection to the Laser line, again anticipating some modest production adds for the fourth quarter in our guidance.
So as of today, Cabot has pipeline capacity up to 440 million cubic foot per day and compression capacity up to 550 million cubic foot per day.
Now let me get into the future plan and describe what is going to come about and the timing that will come about with the buildout. First, I'm going to address just the pipeline and the timing of the pipeline. And then I'm going to discuss compression and the timing of the compression installation. At the end of these numbers, I will circle back around and give you a summary of the key dates to look for and some of those volumes when you tie the pipeline and compression capacity together.
So first off, with the new pipeline capacity expected in the fourth quarter and throughout 2012. Here are some of the numbers breakdown: The Laser takeaway, just with the pipe, is scheduled for October at 50 million cubic foot per day tying into the Millennium line. That we will be able to utilize at that point in time for free cash flow gas. 
The Springville takeaway, heading to the south, is anticipated, as I mentioned, in December, and that pipeline has the capacity at 300 million cubic foot per day to carry down to Transco. Beyond that is attached to our Lathrop compressor station. In March of 2012, Phase II of Laser will add an incremental 50 million cubic foot per day. And in April of '12, Lenox takeaway pipeline will have an incremental 150 million cubic foot per day, which the Lenox is tied to Tennessee. Again I do plan on circling back around and tying these numbers together. 
Now let me move to the compression capacity, which is expected to be installed and commissioned in 2012. The Laser compression in March of 2012 will be the 50 million cubic foot per day. The Lenoxville compression, which will be in April of 2012 will be at 150 million cubic foot per day, and Williams central compression, which is July of 2012, will be 300 million cubic foot per day. 
So when you combine and tie together this in-service dates with both the pipeline takeaway and compression capacity, the true takeaway ability from our wellhead into the market is going to be as follows, and these are really the key dates that you ought to focus on. 
The Laser pipeline in October of '12, we anticipate having the capacity -- excuse me, in October of 2011, we anticipate having the capacity of 50 million cubic foot per day that we could free flow some gas. In December of 2011, we anticipate that the Springville line will be available at about 100 million cubic foot per day.
In March of 2012, the Laser Pipeline will add an incremental 50 million cubic foot per day. In April of 2012, the Lenoxville compression pipeline will have 150 million cubic foot per day. And the central compressor that I discussed for Springville in July of 2012 will have an incremental 200 million cubic foot per day. 
So to sum it up, we will be adding 550 million cubic foot per day of total takeaway capacity, which includes pipes and compression to the current capacity of 440 million cubic foot per day, to give us a total takeaway of approximately 1 Bcf per day by mid-2012. We also have other modifications and expansions planned and have not changed our original target of 1.2 Bcf per day of total takeaway infrastructure by year-end 2012.
If you have any questions, and I botched any of that, Jeff Hutton is sitting beside me, and he will be able to clarify. Also in the north region, Cabot initial well in our Heath prospect, located in  Rosebud County, Montana, was completed in the second quarter. Now this 8-stage completion is currently on test and recovering load water. 
The process has taken longer than anticipated.  However, we have recovered about 20% of our frac load to date. The well initially flowed, and as anticipated, we did place the well on pump. We're still optimistic on this completion. And we're in the process currently of making a well bore cleanout run, and we'll be able to give additional information on this in September.
Going to the South region, in our Buckhorn area, in the Eagle Ford, the company has drilled a total of 17 wells. Each well is 100%-working interest well in Frio County. 11 of these wells are on production, with 3 wells completing, 3 wells waiting on completion and 2 wells currently drilling. As the press release highlighted, 4 of the 11 producing wells were placed on production during the second quarter. These 4 wells each produced at a combined average initial 24-hour rate of 721 barrels of oil equivalent.
Up until now, we have had the flare of the residual gas, as there was no pipeline connection. We're pleased to announce that our new pipeline system now in place at Buckhorn. In partnership with the  TexStar Midstream Services, the pipeline infrastructure commenced service in early July, and approximately 3 million cubic foot per day are presently being produced into the pipeline. 
Our old pipeline infrastructure is scheduled to be in service early in the fourth quarter. Both projects will greatly enhance our overall operation in the Eagle Ford area. In our AMI area with EOG, there are 2 wells presently drilling in this 18,000-plus acre area. Cabot intends to participate, in total, 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011.
Also, covered under our south region, and moving up to Oklahoma and Beaver County, Cabot completed its first Marmaton well with a 24-hour rate, 592 barrels of oil and 325 Mcf per day for an equivalent total of 646 barrels. The well is drilled with a 4,000-foot lateral and completed with a 10-stage frac for around $4 million. 
The well averaged 368 barrels plus 130 or so Mcf per day for the first 30 days. And 320 barrels of oil and 189 Mcf per day of gas for the first 60 days. It's a little early to discuss EURs, but a range we could throw out would be an expectation of 175 to 225 MBoe. 
We're very pleased with these results and Cabot's immediate plans are to participate in 5 to 6 additional non-operated wells to further evaluate the play, along with looking for a rig to drill another operated well or 2. Cabot has increased its acreage position in the area as a result of these early results to over 32,000 net acres. 
In closing, Cabot's operational program remains simple, focus our gas efforts only in the Marcellus and allocate dollars in the oil windows of the Eagleford and now the Marmaton, which will increase our oil reserves and oil production year-over-year. With asset sales now closed or moving towards a close, we're going to take advantage of additional dollars to enhance our 2011 year-end reserves and the opportunity to increase our early 2012 production capacity expectations.
Additionally, we will be securing more liquids-rich acreage to improve our lines in several of these areas. We have already highlighted our production expectation post the asset sale, and our reserves are expected to approximate 3 TCF at year end even after taking in consideration the asset sale effort. So as we increase reserves, increase production and add more acreage to future drilling opportunities, we will also most likely be reducing our debt year-over-year.
With that quick summary, Stephanie, I will be more than happy to open up the lines for questions."

I would anticipate, at some point in time, to gain efficiencies with keeping a rig, maybe on location, a little bit longer to drill more wells on location adds efficiencies versus drilling maybe 1 or 2 wells per pad. I think we're gaining efficiencies on our construction of our pad sites. We're recycling 100% of our flowback water and also our drill water now. And we're reusing that, so that is creating some efficiencies for us. And we're looking out the logistics of moving water up there which is a fairly big cost to improve on those types of logistics. So we're doing things to keep the cost as they are or in fact reduce the cost up there. So our cost per well, per stage, if you will, has not changed dramatically."

Good morning, and I appreciate everybody joining us for this call. I have with me today -- from corporate, I have Scott Schroeder.

I have with me today -- from corporate, I have Scott Schroeder. You all know Jeff Hutton, Steve Lindeman, and I also have the 2 regional managers, Matt Reid and Phil Stalnaker. Before we start, you're aware that the forward-looking statements included in the press release apply to my comments today.
At this time, we have many things to cover and talk about. And I'd also like to expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I will briefly cover the second quarter financial results. I'll also have discussions of the operations in both regions, north and south. And I'll cover so the rationale behind the sale of our Rocky Mountains assets and some of the use of those proceeds.
Overview should be fairly brief, and I will allow ample time for questions at the end. Cabot reported its financial results for the first quarter with clean earnings of $43 million and with discretionary cash flow of about $147 million. This quarter continued the consistent trend of low natural gas price realizations, offset by very robust production growth. 
We expect natural gas prices to remain ranged down through the remainder of 2011, as we have seen in the first half. Additionally, we anticipate robust production for the remainder of the year, which I will outline in a few moments.
In terms of second quarter production, the company posted a 47.5% growth rate between comparable second quarters, producing 45 Bcfe. That's the highest quarterly production that Cabot has ever reported. We continue to enjoy high growth rate from our gas portfolio, but I'm particularly pleased to see the results of our liquids initiative with over 20% growth in oil volumes. With more wells coming on stream, I would expect this oil and liquids increase to continue.
For our guidance, with our wells still showing excellent results, last night we posted a new full year 2011 guidance, increasing the overall growth rate to 46%, up from 34% to 42%. This increase is based on the level of gas we are currently producing. The incremental volumes expected to free flow into the Laser Pipeline in Northeast PA and an additional interstate outlet expected to occur in the fourth quarter also in the Marcellus area. 
As a footnote, this increase in production guidance has taken in consideration the sale of our Rocky Mountains properties effective September 1, 2011, which is about 27 million cubic feet per day.
Cost guidance has been updated with decreases in operating expense, DD&A and other taxes and an increase in G&A and third quarter exploration expense. The net impact is an overall lowering of unit cost from previous guidance levels. Obviously the reduction of unit cost will yield incremental dollars to our bottom line, and we do expect this trend to continue into 2012. 
We have maintained a strong preference to deliver a disciplined approach for our 2011 capital spending program. With our wealth of opportunities in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, our continuous progress in the infrastructure buildout up there, and our improved efficiencies and returns of our new liquids-rich ideas, we have decided to monetize a portion of our Rocky Mountains asset base and deploy some of those dollars towards additional drilling in both our north and south regions that will enhance our production profile for 2012. 
The assets result on the Rockies region were our legacy Green River Basin assets. We did not sell any of our early initiatives such as the Heath or Chainman. Essentially, we've monetized an asset not valued by the market, providing an opportunity for a multiple value expansion. With the use of a portion of proceeds from this asset sale, we'll be able to drill a few incremental Marcellus wells and replace the sold production as we expand our efforts into high return areas. I'll cover more on the specifics around this capital plan a little bit later.
Cabot did add to its hedge book for 2011 and '12 during the quarter, which we've posted in June. This effort now has a company with 28 contracts for the remainder of 2011 production, 28 contracts for 2012 production, excluding the 5 basis only hedges that we have and 5 contracts for 2013 production. No new hedges were added since this last posting in June.
Operations, as we have previously discussed, operationally, for 2011 our plans remain to deliver a net cash flow neutral program in light of our recent asset sales. We were more likely to deliver a debt reduction program after applying the proceeds from the sales. With that as a backdrop, we are evaluating adding $80 million to $100 million to our Marcellus program to drill 10 to 15 additional wells for the full year, along with the south to invest about $50 million for the Eagleford and Marmaton oil projects, including a small portion of the $50 million to be allocated towards another liquids-rich idea we are working on.
Now let's move specifically to the regions. In the North region, the wells in Susquehanna continue to exceed our expectations. We achieved a new one-day fuel production high of 140 million cubic foot -- excuse me, 440 million cubic foot per day. Some of the wells contributing to this record production include 5 wells completed in the quarter, that each exceeded 20 million cubic foot per day for our 24-hour production rate with ranges between 21 million to 28 million per day. 
Also, the combined 30-day rate for the 5 wells was 100 million cubic foot per day. As we stated in the release, we indicated the prolific nature of our area in the Marcellus by highlighting 2 wells that have now surpassed the 4 Bcf mark in cumulative production, one of those occurring in only 12 months, the other in 16 months time period respectively, with these wells still producing at a combined rate of over 10 million cubic foot per day.
As we anticipate, the completion of some takeaway infrastructure in the near term, which I'll discuss that in a moment, we continue to add to our production capacity and our inventory. We are running 5 rigs in the Marcellus and a full-time frac crew. We have a total of 259 stages being completed, cleaning up or waiting to turn in line and an additional 323 stages waiting to be completed for a total of 582 stages. 
As you're aware, we remain constrained by the infrastructure capacity, which currently allows us to flow somewhere in between 400 million and 440 million cubic foot on any given day through the Teel and Lathrop into the Tennessee 300 line.
The additional flow capacity is tied to interstate takeaway capacity which will remain static, as I mentioned, until the completion of the Williams Springville line, which is tied to our Lathrop station running down to Transco to the south and/or the completion of the Laser Pipeline from the northern portion of our acreage, which will run to the north and tie into the Millennium Pipeline.
Now everybody is anxious, just as we are, to receive the news and see the progress of this infrastructure buildout. In particular, the Springville pipeline and its status. I'm pleased to announce that the pipeline construction has begun on segments of the pipeline, and significant progress has been made regarding the installation of their compressor station located in Wyoming County. 
However, even under the best circumstance, the project completion has slid slightly into the fourth quarter. To be conservative, we are modeling a December in-service date, which is reflected in our guidance. In addition to the Springville line, the Laser Pipeline to the north, going to attach to Millennium, is also currently under construction with an early fourth quarter in-service date. We have begun completion activities on the handful of wells targeted for completion and connection to the Laser line, again anticipating some modest production adds for the fourth quarter in our guidance.
So as of today, Cabot has pipeline capacity up to 440 million cubic foot per day and compression capacity up to 550 million cubic foot per day.
Now let me get into the future plan and describe what is going to come about and the timing that will come about with the buildout. First, I'm going to address just the pipeline and the timing of the pipeline. And then I'm going to discuss compression and the timing of the compression installation. At the end of these numbers, I will circle back around and give you a summary of the key dates to look for and some of those volumes when you tie the pipeline and compression capacity together.
So first off, with the new pipeline capacity expected in the fourth quarter and throughout 2012. Here’s how some of the numbers breakdown: The Laser takeaway, just with the pipe, is scheduled for October at 50 million cubic foot per day tying into the Millennium line. That we will be able to utilize at that point in time for free cash flow gas. 
The Springville takeaway, heading to the south, is anticipated, as I mentioned, in December, and that pipeline has the capacity at 300 million cubic foot per day to carry down to Transco. Beyond that is attached to our Lathrop compressor station. In March of 2012, Phase II of Laser will add an incremental 50 million cubic foot per day. And in April of '12, Lenox takeaway pipeline will have an incremental 150 million cubic foot per day, which the Lenox is tied to Tennessee. Again I do plan on circling back around and tying these numbers together. 
Now let me move to the compression capacity, which is expected to be installed and commissioned in 2012. The Laser compression in March of 2012 will be the 50 million cubic foot per day. The Lenoxville compression, which will be in April of 2012 will be at 150 million cubic foot per day, and Williams central compression, which is July of 2012, will be 300 million cubic foot per day. 
So when you combine and tie together this in-service dates with both the pipeline takeaway and compression capacity, the true takeaway ability from our wellhead into the market is going to be as follows, and these are really the key dates that you ought to focus on. 
The Laser pipeline in October of '12, we anticipate having the capacity -- excuse me, in October of 2011, we anticipate having the capacity of 50 million cubic foot per day that we could free flow some gas. In December of 2011, we anticipate that the Springville line will be available at about 100 million cubic foot per day.
In March of 2012, the Laser Pipeline will add an incremental 50 million cubic foot per day. In April of 2012, the Lenoxville compression pipeline will have 150 million cubic foot per day. And the central compressor that I discussed for Springville in July of 2012 will have an incremental 200 million cubic foot per day. 
So to sum it up, we will be adding 550 million cubic foot per day of total takeaway capacity, which includes pipes and compression to the current capacity of 440 million cubic foot per day, to give us a total takeaway of approximately 1 Bcf per day by mid-2012. We also have other modifications and expansions planned and have not changed our original target of 1.2 Bcf per day of total takeaway infrastructure by year-end 2012.
If you have any questions, and I botched any of that, Jeff Hutton is sitting beside me, and he will be able to clarify. Also in the north region, Cabot initial well in our Heath prospect, located in Rosebud County, Montana, was completed in the second quarter. Now this 8-stage completion is currently on task and recovering load water. 
The process has taken longer than anticipated.  However, we have recovered about 20% of our frac load to date. The well initially flowed, and as anticipated, we did place the well on pump. We're still optimistic on this completion. And we're in the process currently of making a well bore cleanout run, and we'll be able to give additional information on this in September.
Going to the South region, in our Buckhorn area, in the Eagle Ford, the company has drilled a total of 17 wells. Each well is 100%-working interest well in Frio County. 11 of these wells are on production, with 3 wells completing, 3 wells waiting on completion and 2 wells currently drilling. As the press release highlighted, 4 of the 11 producing wells were placed on production during the second quarter. These 4 wells each produced at a combined average initial 24-hour rate of 721 barrels of oil equivalent.
Up until now, we have had the flare of the residual gas, as there was no pipeline connection. We're pleased to announce that our new pipeline system now in place at Buckhorn. In partnership with the TexStar Midstream Services, the pipeline infrastructure commenced service in early July, and approximately 3 million cubic foot per day are presently being produced into the pipeline. 
Our old pipeline infrastructure is scheduled to be in service early in the fourth quarter. Both projects will greatly enhance our overall operation in the Eagle Ford area. In our AMI area with EOG, there are 2 wells presently drilling in this 18,000-plus acre area. Cabot intends to participate, in total, 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011.
Also, covered under our south region, and moving up to Oklahoma and Beaver County, Cabot completed its first Marmaton well with a 24-hour rate, 592 barrels of oil and 325 Mcf per day for an equivalent total of 646 barrels. The well is drilled with a 4,000-foot lateral and completed with a 10-stage frac for around $4 million. 
The well averaged 368 barrels plus 130 or so Mcf per day for the first 30 days. And 320 barrels of oil and 189 Mcf per day of gas for the first 60 days. It's a little early to discuss EURs, but a range we could throw out would be an expectation of 175 to 225 MBoe. 
We're very pleased with these results and Cabot's immediate plans are to participate in 5 to 6 additional non-operated wells to further evaluate the play, along with looking for a rig to drill another operated well or 2. Cabot has increased its acreage position in the area as a result of these early results to over 32,000 net acres. 
In closing, Cabot's operational program remains simple, focus our gas efforts only in the Marcellus and allocate dollars in the oil windows of the Eagleford and now the Marmaton, which will increase our oil reserves and oil production year-over-year. With asset sales now closed or moving towards a close, we're going to take advantage of additional dollars to enhance our 2011 year-end reserves and the opportunity to increase our early 2012 production capacity expectations.
Additionally, we will be securing more liquids-rich acreage to improve our lines in several of these areas. We have already highlighted our production expectation post the asset sale, and our reserves are expected to approximate 3 TCF at year end even after taking in consideration the asset sale effort. So as we increase reserves, increase production and add more acreage to future drilling opportunities, we will also most likely be reducing our debt year-over-year.
With that quick summary, Stephanie, I will be more than happy to open up the lines for questions."

We are talking and looking at extended contracts into our 2012 program. But knowing our average cost per well very dependent upon the total lateral lane and the number of stages, and we have not seen a great deal of difference in those costs. I would anticipate, at some point in time, to gain efficiencies with keeping a rig, maybe on location, a little bit longer to drill more wells on location adds efficiencies versus drilling maybe 1 or 2 wells per pad. I think we're gaining efficiencies on our construction of our pad sites. We're recycling 100% of our flowback water and also our drill water now. And we're reusing that, so that is creating some efficiencies for us. And we're looking out the logistics of moving water up there which is a fairly big cost to improve on those types of logistics. So we're doing things to keep the cost as they are or in fact reduce the cost up there. So our cost per well, per stage, if you will, has not changed dramatically."

And like our guidance, increasing even in light of asset sales and the redeployment of the capital into our key areas in the Marcellus, Eagleford and Marmaton is going to set us up well for year-end reserves and also early in increased expectations in '12 for production. I'm very pleased that we're going to have a Bcf capacity takeaway within a year from today and in 2012, with Matt and Phil staying here. And I'm sure the numbers are going to give us, so we can talk to the board that will show reserve growth, production growth. And I would imagine and that it's going to be certainly within a cash flow neutral program and most likely a cash flow positive program in 2012. And certainly, I couldn't ask any more from the team.

Appreciate everybody joining us this morning.

Appreciate everybody joining us this morning. I have in the room with me today Scott Schroeder; Jeff Hutton, VP Marketing; Steve Lindeman our VP of Engineering; Matt Reid our VP of South Region; and Phil Stalnaker, VP of our North region. 
Let me just make an opening comment that the forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today. At this time, we have many things to cover and I'll also try to expand on the press releases that were issued last night. Briefly cover the third quarter financial results, a discussion of operations and Pennsylvania, Texas and Oklahoma. 
Additionally, I will discuss our outlook for the next 15 months for Cabot. But before I get into the details on these topics, let me start with a summary of our impressive results so far year-to-date in 2011 and a quick overview of expectations for '12. In '11 Cabot will grow production in the 40% to 46% range net of asset sales. We will grow reserves 10 plus percent. We will reduce or at a minimum maintain total debt at a level below $1 billion. 
And this is all generated by a program that encompasses a total rig count of 7, which I think indicates the prolific nature of our portfolio. If we look ahead, 2012, our expectations will be and this off of a larger base, grow production between 45% and 55% or grow reserves again 10 plus percent, maintain or reduce debt without asset sales and again all generated from a total rig count of 7. 
I think from the guidance I've seen from the industry, Cabot's numbers are unmatched. In fact, I've been in the business for over 30 years and it's rare that I've seen numbers that can demonstrate this amount of growth in a cash flow neutral to cash flow positive program. Cabot's financial reported for third quarter had clean earnings of $35 million and with discretionary cash flow of $165 million. This quarter continued the consistent trend of low natural gas price realizations to offset by very robust production growth. We expect natural gas prices to remain ranged down through the remainder of 2011 or until seasonal factors kick in. 
Additionally, we do anticipate further production advances for the remainder of the year as infrastructure capabilities do become available but we have not included these in our fourth quarter guidance. In terms of third quarter production, the company posted a 39% growth rate between comparable third quarters reporting 50 Bcf. We continue to enjoy high growth rates from our gas portfolio but I'm particularly pleased to see the results of our liquids initiative with over 100% growth in oil and related liquid volumes between comparable third quarters. Clearly this indicate, this increase comes from our Eagle Ford effort with more wells coming online. We do expect to see an ongoing increase in our liquids production. 
The guidance last night we posted new guidance with regard to '12 production. We initiated with a range of growth between 45% and 55%. We provided details for the first quarter only due to the fact that there are several infrastructure projects in the works with estimated 2012 start date. 
As we have seen this year, multifaceted projects at timeframes that can slide. Our expectation is we will have a much clearer, more exact timing on the front by the February call when we could give more specific details. With that said again at a minimum we anticipate 2012 production growth to be in the 45% to 55% range. In terms of 2011 fourth quarter, we maintained our existing guidance with 9 months of actual production having already exceeded last year's record total level. Our expectation for 2011 will be faraway better than any time in our history. 
This rate also takes into account the production in several infrastructure delays. In terms of infrastructure, Laser just came online this week in PA and Springville is still expected in mid-December again no incremental volumes in 2011 and from Springville are contemplated for us to stay within our guidance. Cost guidance has been updated with no change to our fourth quarter 2011. However our first quarter of '12 reflects reduction to operating expense, DD&A and financing and increase to transportation, G&A and maintain -- tax and exploration expense. 
The overall impact in 12 is a lowering of cost from previous guidance levels. Obviously the reduction of our unit cost will yield incremental dollars to the bottom line. We do expect this reduction trend to continue throughout 12. We are maintaining a strong preference to deliver a disciplined approach to capital spending. The asset sales 2011 have allowed the expansion of our current year program to about $825 million to $875 million. You'll recall that on the second quarter call, the number would move up from the $600 million mark to around $750 million, the slight increase from there is a result of our drilling efficiencies that have allowed more wells to be drilled in Pennsylvania, Texas and Oklahoma, more completions although constrained by infrastructure and more leasing activity on key areas and a couple of new. 
For '12 we expect our program to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. The planned program range is fully funded at the low end with a $4 gas price and the program generates a cash flow surplus at the high end with a 450 gas price. Bottom line, we have positioned ourselves for one of the highest percent production growth of our peer group, while staying within cash flow. 
In addition, we are able to achieve our goals with just 7 rigs an excellent indication of our capital efficiency. Our industry has a tendency to significantly outspend cash flow to achieve in some cases a much lower growth rate. Note that hedges were added in the third quarter with 1 2012 oil hedge added thus far in the fourth quarter. 
The company has 28 contracts for the remainder of 11 production, 28 contracts for '12, excluding the 5 basis only hedges and 5 contracts for '13. You can evaluate those on our website. Now let's move to operations in the north region, our Marcellus reserve in Susquehanna continued to achieve new milestones and again highlight some of the key records that we have set, new 24-hour production record of 517 million cubic foot per day from only 94 horizontal wells. Cabot's fastest well to produce 3 Bcf took only 223 days. Our fastest well to 4 Bcf, took only 347 days. We're adding drilling efficiencies with our fastest well to TD to just 12.5 days and that was a 3,500 foot lateral. 
Cabot's area of the Marcellus produced 16 of the top 20 wells in PA during the first half of 2011. During the quarter, we turned in line a total of 18 wells, 17 horizontals and 1 vertical well. The summer production base new wells was 153 million cubic foot per day but the production was curtailed due to infrastructure restrictions. Currently we have 4 rigs operating in Susquehanna with an additional new build scheduled to arrive in November. Also we currently have a total of 497 stages in various stages of completion, 213 of those are being completed, or cleaning up or waiting to turn in line. 284 of those are waiting to be completed. 
We continue to make progress of the many infrastructure projects that will ultimately create one of the largest takeaway capacity systems in the United States. This week was initial in-service day of our Laser pipe -- the Laser pipeline located in the northern area of Cabot's lease hold in Susquehanna, Laser pipeline is ultimately designed to carry 150 million cubic foot per day at Cabot's production for sale into the Millennium Pipeline system in New York. 
At Laser, we currently have a total of 4 wells cleaning up into the line. We have been asked about the Marcellus in the northern portion of our acreage. The growth section is slightly shallower and is approximately 240-foot thick versus approximately 350-foot thick where we've been drilling. Keep in mind the thickness we see in this northern area remains considerably thicker than the Marcellus seen throughout PA. 
We anticipate keeping a rig active in the north area and adding volumes throughout the fourth quarter. We Are trying to have Cabot's Marcellus production into a new marketplace. Next we are anxiously awaiting the startup of Springville pipeline now scheduled for early December. Significant progress has been made today including the completion of the compression station, significant progress on the major bores and completion at the tap into the Transco pipeline. This is great news as we await the finishing touches on the 24-inch pipeline. Transco, just like Millennium Pipeline, represents new markets for Cabot to immediately access. 
One new development we're excited about regarding Springville, which we did release last night is that Cabot and Williams have agreed to terms regarding the unsubscribed capacity on Springville, essentially increasing our position from 300 million cubic foot per day of takeaway to 625 million cubic foot per day. This additional capacity will be available mid-2012. 
With this as a backdrop, the majority of our 2012 production will be going to markets not served today by Cabot, which we think is an improvement. When you combine the incremental capacity of 325 million per day to the pre-announced plans for our infrastructure, midyear 2012 takeaway now stands at 1.325 Bcf per day. And the year end total takeaway capacity grows from the 1.2 Bcf per day to 1.525 Bcf per day. 
Let me also add that various other projects and expansions we have discussed previously are all on track or on time completion. As we reported last night with the delays in moving gas, Laser and Transco, we have combined and been combined to deliver of our Marcellus production into one single 24 inch Tennessee pipeline with the gas on gas competition from the surrounding areas pricing for our northeast Marcellus producers have seen downward pressure. 
While we have heard numerous rumors regarding the price we have received for our gas, Cabot's monthly average price in fourth quarter has remained above $3 per Mcf during the soft period. We are mindful that our pending takeaway projects to the -- prior production and to multiple downstream markets, our new interstate pipelines will relieve some of this tension. 
Now let's move to the south region. In our Buckhorn area and the Eagle Ford, the company has drilled a total of 24 wells. Each well is 100% working interest well in Frio County. 21 of these wells are on production with 2 wells completing, 1 well waiting on completion and 1 well drilling. The 2 most recently completed wells produced at initial 24 hour rates of 938 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 791 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In our AMI area or EOG, there are 6 wells currently on production in this 18,000 plus acre area with 3 of these wells drilled and completed in the third quarter and the results are at anticipated levels. Gross production for both areas in the Eagle Ford is over 7600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011. 
Now moving to Oklahoma. Beaver County where we have our Marmaton operation, Cabot has continued its effort there with participation as planned in 7 non-operated wells with a few more to go in this quarter. Last night, we highlighted the latest 2 wells and these wells were a significant uptick from our excellent initially operated well. The second Cabot operated well was spud last week and the well is designed for 4,000 foot lateral with approximately 16 frac stages. Cabot intends to drill 2 additional operated wells and will participate in 8 to 10 total non-operated well in 2011. 
Cabot now controls approximately 61,500 plus net acres in the play, which is up from the 54,000 we previously announced. We believe the results that we will see in the Marmaton will provide us very favorable economic returns. In the Heath, we have gathered as much information as we could from a poorly drilled and completed well. We status-ed the well as unsuccessful and we'll take the information we collected and continue our science work in the area. 
Science efforts drove our exploration cost above guidance essentially $0.03 for the quarter. Fortunately we do have long lease terms remaining to work with. Now moving to 2012 plans in Pennsylvania for 2012, Cabot will have on average 5 rigs running. We're planning 70 to 78 Marcellus wells. We also anticipate running 1.5 frac crews for the year. In Texas and Oklahoma, we will remain focused on acreage production in the Eagle Ford Cabot will drill or participate in 20 to 30 wells in the Marmaton we anticipate that the company will participate in the drilling of between 25 and 30 grows wells with the majority of these wells being operated. 
Plans call right now for the company to operate 2 rigs in the south, 1 in the Eagle Ford and 1 in the Marmaton. We believe our 2012 program will yield greater efficiencies from a dollar invested perspective that our 2011 program will demonstrate operational efficiency in both the drilling and completion, along with the moderation in our overall service cost per completed well. 
Additionally, we continue to improve efficiencies in our vertical integrated operation with our internal construction of locations, roads. We also provide water hauling and handling and frac-ing in other various sundry things that we have in house. In closing, Cabot's operations remain simple focus our gas efforts solely in the Marcellus and allocate dollars to the oil window of the Eagle Ford and Marmaton, which will drive our double-digit growth and reserves and production year-over-year, all within at anticipated cash flow neutral. With that, summary, Holly, I'll stop and be happy to answer any questions the group might have."

Keep in mind that again just the geology such that southwest PA has a much standard section than we have. Our section is 240 to 400-foot thick. So the in-place reserves that we have in that section compared to 70-foot section or so is significantly different. So the recoveries of that we realized and we are working on right now and have a third-party study out there that will be delivered to us at the end of the year that is trying to arrive at that recovery factor. But we think we're going to see in our particular area with the efficiency of our completions and no liquids in the majority of our reservoir we don't have any relative Perm issues or anything like that. We think we have very, very good high recovery factors that could push the 50% to 60% range."

Let me just make an opening comment that the forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today. At this time, we have many things to cover, and I'll also try to expand on the press releases that were issued last night. Briefly cover the third quarter financial results, a discussion of operations in Pennsylvania, Texas and Oklahoma. 
Additionally, I will discuss our outlook for the next 15 months for Cabot. But before I get into the details on these topics, let me start with a summary of our impressive results so far year-to-date in 2011 and a quick overview of expectations for '12. In '11, Cabot will grow production in the 40% to 46% range net of asset sales. We will grow reserves 10-plus percent. We will reduce or at a minimum maintain total debt at a level below $1 billion. 
And this is all generated by a program that encompasses a total rig count of 7, which I think indicates the prolific nature of our portfolio. If we look ahead, 2012, our expectations will be -- and this is off of a larger base, grow production between 45% and 55% or grow reserves again 10-plus percent, maintain or reduce debt without asset sales and again, all generated from a total rig count of 7. 
I think from the guidance I have seen from the industry, Cabot's numbers are unmatched. In fact, I've been in the business for over 30 years and it's rare that I've seen numbers that can demonstrate this amount of growth in a cash flow neutral to cash flow positive program. Cabot's financial report for third quarter had clean earnings of $35 million and with discretionary cash flow of $165 million. This quarter continued the consistent trend of low natural gas price realizations offset by very robust production growth. We expect natural gas prices to remain ranged bound through the remainder of 2011 or until seasonal factors kick in. Additionally, we do anticipate further production advances for the remainder of the year as infrastructure capabilities do become available, though we have not included these in our fourth quarter guidance. 
In terms of third quarter production, the company posted a 39% growth rate between comparable third quarters reporting 50 Bcf. We continue to enjoy high growth rates from our gas portfolio, but I'm particularly pleased to see the results of our liquids initiative with over 100% growth in oil and related liquid volumes between comparable third quarters. Clearly, this indicate -- this increase comes from our Eagle Ford effort with more wells coming online. We do expect to see an ongoing increase in our liquids production. 
The guidance last night, we posted new guidance with regard to '12 production. We initiated with a range of growth between 45% and 55%. We provided detail for the first quarter only due to the fact that there are several infrastructure projects in the works with estimated 2012 start dates. 
As we have seen this year, multifaceted projects at timeframes that can slide. Our expectation is we will have a much clearer, more exact timing on this front by February call when we could give more specific details. With that said, let me emphasize again, at a minimum, we anticipate 2012 production growth to be in the 45% to 55% range. In terms of 2011 fourth quarter, we maintained our existing guidance with 9 months of actual production having already exceeded last year's record total level. Our expectation for 2011 will be faraway better than any time in our history. 
This rate also takes into account the sold production and several infrastructure delays. In terms of infrastructure, Laser just came online this week up in PA, and Springville is still expected in mid-December, again, no incremental volumes in 2011 and from Springville are contemplated for us to stay within our guidance. Cost guidance has been updated with no change fourth quarter 2011. However, our first quarter of '12 reflects reduction to operating expense, DD&A and financing at increased to transportation, G&A and maintain error taxes and exploration expense. 
The overall impact in '12 is a lowering of cost from previous guidance levels. Obviously, the reduction of our unit cost will yield incremental dollars to the bottom line. We do expect this reduction trend to continue throughout '12. We have maintained a strong preference to deliver a disciplined approach to capital spending. The asset sales 2011 have allowed the expansion of our current year program to about $825 million to $875 million. You'll recall that on the second quarter call, the number would move up from the $600 million mark to around $750 million. The slight increase from there is a result of our drilling efficiencies that have allowed more wells to be drilled in Pennsylvania, Texas and Oklahoma, more completions although still constrained by infrastructure and more leasing activity on key areas and a couple of new ideas.
For '12, we expect our program to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. The planned program range is fully funded at the low end with a $4 gas price and the program generates a cash flow surplus at the high end with a $450 gas price. Bottom line, we have positioned ourselves for one of the highest percent production growth of our peer group, while staying within cash flow. 
In addition, we are able to achieve our goals with just 7 rigs, an excellent indication of our capital efficiency. Our industry had a tendency to significantly outspend cash flow to achieve in some cases a much lower growth rate. Note that hedges were added in the third quarter with one 2012 oil hedge added thus far in the fourth quarter. 
The company has 28 contracts for the remainder of 11 production, 28 contracts for '12, excluding the 5 basis only hedges and 5 contracts for '13. You can evaluate those on our website. Now, let's move to operations in the north region, our Marcellus result in Susquehanna continue to achieve new milestones and again highlight some of the key records that we have set, new 24-hour production record of 517 million cubic foot per day from only 94 horizontal wells. Cabot is fastest as well to produce 3 Bcf took only 223 days. Our fastest well to 4 Bcf, took only 347 days. We're adding drilling efficiencies with our fastest well to TD to just 12.5 days and that was a 3,500-foot lateral. 
Cabot's area over Marcellus produced 16 of the top 20 wells in PA during the first half of 2011. During the quarter, we turned in line a total of 18 wells, 17 horizontals and 1 vertical well. The summer production base newly -- new wells was 153 million cubic foot per day but the production was curtailed due to infrastructure restrictions. Currently, we have 4 rigs operating in Susquehanna with an additional new build scheduled to arrive in November. Also, we currently have a total of 497 stages in various phases of completion. 213 of those are being completed, or cleaning up or being -- or waiting to turn in line. 284 of those are waiting to be completed. 
We continue to make progress of the many infrastructure projects that will ultimately create one of the largest takeaway capacity systems in the United States. This week was initial in-service day of our Laser pipe -- the Laser Pipeline located in the northern area of Cabot's lease hold in Susquehanna, Laser Pipeline is ultimately designed to carry 150 million cubic foot per day at Cabot's production for sale into the Millennium Pipeline system in New York. 
At Laser, we currently have a total of 4 wells cleaning up into the line. We have been asked about the Marcellus in the northern portion of our acreage. The growth section is slightly shallower and is approximately 240-foot thick versus approximately 350-foot thick where we've been drilling. Keep in mind, the thickness we see in this northern area remains considerably thicker than the Marcellus seen throughout PA. 
We anticipate keeping a rig active in the north area and adding volumes throughout the fourth quarter. We are trying to have Cabot's Marcellus production into a new marketplace. Next, we are anxiously awaiting the startup of Springville pipeline -- excuse me -- now scheduled for early December. Significant progress has been made today including the completion of the compression station, significant progress on the major bores and completion at the tap into the Transco pipeline. This is great news as we await the finishing touches on the 24-inch pipeline. Transco, just like Millennium Pipeline, represents new markets for Cabot to immediately access. 
One new development, we're excited about regarding Springville, which we did release last night is that Cabot and Williams have agreed to terms regarding the unsubscribed capacity on Springville, essentially increasing our position from 300 million cubic foot per day of takeaway to 625 million cubic foot per day. This additional capacity will be available mid-2012. 
With this as a backdrop, the majority of our 2012 production will be going to markets not served today by Cabot, which we think is an improvement. When you combine the incremental capacity of 325 million per day to the pre-announced plans for our infrastructure, midyear 2012 takeaway now stands at 1.325 Bcf per day. And the year end total takeaway capacity grows to -- from the 1.2 Bcf per day to 1.525 Bcf per day. 
Let me also add that various other projects and expansions we have discussed previously are all on track or on time completion. As we reported last night with the delays in moving gas, Laser and Transco, we have combined and been combined to deliver of our Marcellus production into one single 24-inch Tennessee pipeline with the gas on gas competition from the surrounding areas pricing for our northeast Marcellus producers have seen downward pressure. 
While we have heard numerous rumors regarding the price we have received for our gas, Cabot's monthly average price in fourth quarter has remained above $3 per Mcf during the soft period. We are mindful that our pending takeaway projects to diversify our production into multiple downstream markets on new interstate pipelines will relieve some of this tension. 
Now let's move to the south region. In our Buckhorn area and the Eagle Ford, the company has drilled a total of 24 wells. Each well is 100% working-interest well in Frio and La Salle County. 21 of these wells are on production with 2 wells completing, 1 well waiting on completion and 1 well drilling. The 2 most recently completed wells produced at initial 24-hour rates of 938 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 791 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In our AMI area or EOG, there are 6 wells currently on production in this 18,000-plus-acre area with 3 of these wells drilled and completed in the third quarter and the results are at anticipated levels. Gross production for both areas in the Eagle Ford is over 7,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011. 
Now moving to Oklahoma. Beaver County where we have our Marmaton operation, Cabot has continued its effort there with participation as planned in 7 non-operated wells with a few more to go in this quarter. Last night, we highlighted the latest 2 wells, and these wells were a significant uptick from our excellent initially operated well. The second Cabot operated well was spud last week, and the well is designed for a 4,000-foot lateral with approximately 16 frac stages. Cabot intends to drill 2 additional operated wells and will participate in 8 to 10 total non-operated well in 2011. 
Cabot now controls approximately 61,500 plus net acres in the play, which is up from the 54,000 we previously announced. We believe the results that we will see in the Marmaton will provide us very favorable economic returns. In the Heath, we have gathered as much information as we could from a poorly drilled and completed well. We status-ed the well as unsuccessful, and we'll take the information we collected and continue our science work in the area. 
Science efforts drove our exploration cost above guidance essentially $0.03 for the quarter. Fortunately, we do have long lease terms remaining to work with. Now moving to 2012 plans in Pennsylvania for 2012, Cabot will have on average 5 rigs running. We're planning 70 to 78 Marcellus wells. We also anticipate running 1.5 frac crews for the year. In Texas and Oklahoma, we will remain focused on acreage production. In the Eagle Ford, Cabot will drill or participate in 20 to 30 wells. In the Marmaton, we anticipate that the company will participate in the drilling of between 25 and 30 gross wells with the majority of these wells being operated. 
Plans call right now for the company to operate 2 rigs in the south, one in the Eagle Ford and one in the Marmaton. We believe our 2012 program will yield greater efficiencies from a dollar invested perspective that our 2011 program will demonstrate operational efficiencies in both the drilling and completion, along with the moderation in our overall service cost per completed well. 
Additionally, we continue to improve efficiencies in our vertical integrated operation with our internal construction of locations, roads. We also provide water hauling and handling and frac-ing in other various sundry things that we have in house. In closing, Cabot's operations remain simple, focus our gas efforts solely in the Marcellus and allocate dollars to the oil window of the Eagle Ford and Marmaton, which will drive our double-digit growth and reserves and production year-over-year, all within at anticipated cash flow neutral program. With that summary, Holly, I'll stop and be happy to answer any questions the group might have."

Appreciate everybody joining us this morning. I have in the room with me today Scott Schroeder; Jeff Hutton, VP Marketing; Steve Lindeman, the VP of Engineering; Matt Reid, our VP of South Region; and Phil Stalnaker, our VP of our North Region. 
Let me just make an opening comment that the forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today. At this time, we have many things to cover, and I'll also try to expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I'll briefly cover the third quarter financial results, a discussion of operations in Pennsylvania, Texas and Oklahoma. 
Additionally, I will discuss our outlook for the next 15 months for Cabot. But before I get into the details on these topics, let me start with a summary of our impressive results so far year-to-date in 2011 and a quick overview of expectations for '12. In '11, Cabot will grow production in the 40% to 46% range net of asset sales. We will grow reserves 10-plus percent. We will reduce or at a minimum maintain total debt at a level below $1 billion. 
And this is all generated by a program that encompasses a total rig count of 7, which I think indicates the prolific nature of our portfolio. If we look ahead, 2012, our expectations will be -- and this is off of a larger base, grow production between 45% and 55% or grow reserves again 10-plus percent, maintain or reduce debt without asset sales and again, all generated from a total rig count of 7. 
I think from the guidance I have seen from industry, Cabot's numbers are unmatched. In fact, I've been in the business for over 30 years and it's rare that I've seen numbers that can demonstrate this amount of growth in a cash flow neutral to cash flow positive program. Cabot's financial report for third quarter had clean earnings of $35 million and with discretionary cash flow of $165 million. This quarter continued the consistent trend of low natural gas price realizations offset by very robust production growth. We expect natural gas prices to remain ranged bound through the remainder of 2011 or until seasonal factors kick in. Additionally, we do anticipate further production advances for the remainder of the year as infrastructure capabilities do become available, though we have not included these in our fourth quarter guidance. 
In terms of third quarter production, the company posted a 39% growth rate between comparable third quarters reporting 50 Bcf. We continue to enjoy high growth rates from our gas portfolio, but I'm particularly pleased to see the results of our liquids initiative with over 100% growth in oil and related liquid volumes between comparable third quarters. Clearly, this indicate -- this increase comes from our Eagle Ford effort with more wells coming online. We do expect to see an ongoing increase in our liquids production. 
The guidance last night, we posted new guidance with regard to '12 production. We initiated with a range of growth between 45% and 55%. We provided detail for the first quarter only due to the fact that there are several infrastructure projects in the works with estimated 2012 start dates. 
As we have seen this year, multifaceted projects at timeframes that can slide. Our expectation is we will have a much clearer, more exact timing on this front by the February call when we could give more specific details. With that said, let me emphasize again, at a minimum, we anticipate 2012 production growth to be in the 45% to 55% range. In terms of 2011 fourth quarter, we maintained our existing guidance with 9 months of actual production having already exceeded last year's record total level. Our expectation for 2011 will be faraway better than any time in our history. 
This rate also takes into account the sold production and several infrastructure delays. In terms of infrastructure, Laser just came online this week up in PA, and Springville is still expected in mid-December, again, no incremental volumes in 2011 and from Springville are contemplated for us to stay within our guidance. Cost guidance has been updated with no change fourth quarter 2011. However, our first quarter of '12 reflects reduction to operating expense, DD&A and financing at increased to transportation, G&A and maintain owed taxes and exploration expense. 
The overall impact in '12 is a lowering of cost from previous guidance levels. Obviously, the reduction of our unit cost will yield incremental dollars to the bottom line. We do expect this reduction trend to continue throughout '12. We have maintained a strong preference to deliver a disciplined approach to capital spending. The asset sales 2011 have allowed the expansion of our current year program to about $825 million to $875 million. You'll recall that on the second quarter call, the number would move up from the $600 million mark to around $750 million. The slight increase from there is a result of our drilling efficiencies that have allowed more wells to be drilled in Pennsylvania, Texas and Oklahoma, more completions although still constrained by infrastructure and more leasing activity on key areas and a couple of new ideas.
For '12, we expect our program to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. The planned program range is fully funded at the low end with a $4 gas price and the program generates a cash flow surplus at the high end with a $4.50 gas price. Bottom line, we have positioned ourselves for one of the highest percent production growth of our peer group, while staying within cash flow. 
In addition, we are able to achieve our goals with just 7 rigs, an excellent indication of our capital efficiency. Our industry has a tendency to significantly outspend cash flow to achieve in some cases a much lower growth rate. No new hedges were added in the third quarter with one 2012 oil hedge added thus far in the fourth quarter. 
The company has 28 contracts for the remainder of '11 production, 28 contracts for '12, excluding the 5 basis only hedges and 5 contracts for '13. You can evaluate those on our website. Now, let's move to operations. In the north region, our Marcellus result in Susquehanna continue to achieve new milestones and again highlight some of the key records that we have set, new 24-hour production record of 517 million cubic foot per day from only 94 horizontal wells. Cabot's fastest well to produce 3 Bcf took only 223 days. Our fastest well to 4 Bcf, took only 347 days. We're adding drilling efficiencies with our fastest well to TD took just 12.5 days and that was a 3,500-foot lateral. 
Cabot's area of the Marcellus produced 16 of the top 20 wells in PA during the first half of 2011. During the quarter, we turned in line a total of 18 wells, 17 horizontals and 1 vertical well. The summer production base newly -- new wells was 153 million cubic foot per day but the production was curtailed due to infrastructure restrictions. Currently, we have 4 rigs operating in Susquehanna with an additional new build scheduled to arrive in November. Also, we currently have a total of 497 stages in various phases of completion. 213 of those are being completed, or cleaning up or being -- or waiting to turn in line. 284 of those are waiting to be completed. 
We continue to make progress of the many infrastructure projects that will ultimately create one of the largest takeaway capacity systems in the United States. This week was initial in-service day of our Laser pipe -- the Laser Pipeline located in the northern area of Cabot's lease hold in Susquehanna, Laser Pipeline is ultimately designed to carry 150 million cubic foot per day at Cabot's production for sale into the Millennium Pipeline system in New York. 
At Laser, we currently have a total of 4 wells cleaning up into the line. We have been asked about the Marcellus in the northern portion of our acreage. The growth section is slightly shallower and is approximately 240-foot thick versus approximately 350-foot thick where we've been drilling. Keep in mind, the thickness we see in this northern area remains considerably thicker than the Marcellus seen throughout PA. 
We anticipate keeping a rig active in the north area and adding volumes throughout the fourth quarter. We are trying to have Cabot's Marcellus production into a new marketplace. Next, we are anxiously awaiting the startup of Springville pipeline -- excuse me -- now scheduled for early December. Significant progress has been made to date including the completion of the compression station, significant progress on the major bores and completion of the tap into the Transco pipeline. This is great news as we await the finishing touches on the 24-inch pipeline. Transco, just like Millennium Pipeline, represents new markets for Cabot to immediately access. 
One new development, we're excited about regarding Springville, which we did release last night is that Cabot and Williams have agreed to terms regarding the unsubscribed capacity on Springville, essentially increasing our position from 300 million cubic foot per day of takeaway to 625 million cubic foot per day. This additional capacity will be available mid-2012. 
With this as a backdrop, the majority of our 2012 production will be going to markets not served today by Cabot, which we think is an improvement. When you combine the incremental capacity of 325 million per day to the pre-announced plans for our infrastructure, midyear 2012 takeaway now stands at 1.325 Bcf per day. And the year end total takeaway capacity grows to -- from the 1.2 Bcf per day to 1.525 Bcf per day. 
Let me also add that various other projects and expansions we have discussed previously are all on track for on time completion. As we reported last night with the delays in moving gas, Laser and Transco, we have combined and been combined to deliver of our Marcellus production into one single 24-inch Tennessee pipeline with the gas on gas competition from the surrounding areas pricing for our northeast Marcellus producers have seen downward pressure. 
While we have heard numerous rumors regarding the price we have received for our gas, Cabot's monthly average price in fourth quarter has remained above $3 per Mcf during the soft period. We are mindful that our pending takeaway projects to diversify our production into multiple downstream markets on new interstate pipelines will relieve some of this tension. 
Now let's move to the south region. In our Buckhorn area in the Eagle Ford, the company has drilled a total of 24 wells. Each well is 100% working-interest well in Frio and La Salle County. 21 of these wells are on production with 2 wells completing, 1 well waiting on completion and 1 well drilling. The 2 most recently completed wells produced at initial 24-hour rates of 938 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 791 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In our AMI area with EOG, there are 6 wells currently on production in this 18,000-plus-acre area with 3 of these wells drilled and completed in the third quarter and the results are at anticipated levels. Gross production for both areas in the Eagle Ford is over 7,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford wells in 2011. 
Now moving to Oklahoma. Beaver County where we have our Marmaton operation, Cabot has continued its effort there with participation as planned in 7 non-operated wells with a few more to go in this quarter. Last night, we highlighted the latest 2 wells, and these wells were a significant uptick from our excellent initially operated well. The second Cabot operated well was spud last week, and the well is designed for a 4,000-foot lateral with approximately 16 frac stages. Cabot intends to drill 2 additional operated wells and will participate in 8 to 10 total non-operated well in 2011. 
Cabot now controls approximately 61,500 plus net acres in the play, which is up from the 54,000 we previously announced. We believe the results that we will see in the Marmaton will provide us very favorable economic returns. In the Heath, we have gathered as much information as we could from a poorly drilled and completed well. We status-ed the well as unsuccessful, and we'll take the information we collected and continue our science work in the area. 
Science efforts drove our exploration cost above guidance essentially $0.03 for the quarter. Fortunately, we do have long lease terms remaining to work with. Now moving to 2012 plans in Pennsylvania for 2012, Cabot will have on average 5 rigs running. We're planning 70 to 78 Marcellus wells. We also anticipate running 1.5 frac crews for the year. In Texas and Oklahoma, we will remain focused on acreage production. In the Eagle Ford, Cabot will drill or participate in 20 to 30 wells. In the Marmaton, we anticipate that the company will participate in the drilling of between 25 and 30 gross wells with the majority of these wells being operated. 
Plans call right now for the company to operate 2 rigs in the south, one in the Eagle Ford and one in the Marmaton. We believe our 2012 program will yield greater efficiencies from a dollar invested perspective than our 2011 program. We will demonstrate operational efficiencies in both drilling and completion, along with some moderation in our overall service cost per completed well. 
Additionally, we continue to improve efficiencies in our vertical integrated operation with our internal construction of locations, roads. We also provide water hauling and handling and frac-ing in other various and sundry things that we have in house. In closing, Cabot's operations remain simple, focus our gas efforts solely in the Marcellus and allocate dollars to the oil window of the Eagle Ford and Marmaton, which will drive our double-digit growth and reserves and production year-over-year, all within an anticipated cash flow neutral program. With that summary, Holly, I'll stop and be happy to answer any questions the group might have."
