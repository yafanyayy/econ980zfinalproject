We're very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.26 per share versus $1.01 per share last year. Our reported 2010 results was $1.36 per share versus $1.08",1824,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.26 per share versus $1.01 per share last year. Our reported 2010 results was $1.36 per share versus $1.08 last year. Both this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. This year's reported fourth quarter results include pretax gains from sales of express shares and a payment of an express dividend totaling $52 million or $0.10 per share. 
2009's reported results included tax benefit of $23 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to the reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries. All results discussed on this call excludes these significant items in both years. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.26 significantly exceeded our beginning of the quarter expectation of $1.02 to $1.17 per share. This upside was driven by the 10% comp increase versus our initial forecast of up low-single digits. 
To take you through the fourth quarter results as detailed on Page 1 of the presentation, net sales were $3.456 billion versus $3.063 billion last year and comps increased 10%. The gross margin rate increased 100 basis points to 41.8% primarily driven by a leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate increased slightly despite a negative impact of about 60 basis points related to the increase in MAST sales to Express in Limited Stores, which are recognized at 100% this year versus 75% last year. 
The change in revenue recognition is a result of the change in accounting for our Express investment to the cost method versus the equity method last year and the sale of our remaining investment in Limited Stores. This accounting change, which occurs in the third quarter of 2010 will continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated versus our margin rate in the first two quarters of 2011. 
SG&A dollars increased by $67.8 million or 10%, and the SG&A rate improved by 50 basis points. The major drivers of expense growth are as follows: over half the dollar increase in SG&A was driven by increased selling costs, including cost related to these stores in Canada; total selling cost leverage as a percent of sales; about 25% of the increase was related to certain unusual expenses in the quarter, including a significant increase in stock compensation expense due to a lower forfeiture rate as a result of lower associate turnover and separately the write-offs of an intangible freight name asset. And most of the remainder of the increase were driven by an increase in marketing costs, which held flat as a percent of sales. 
Turning to operating income on Page 2. Total operating income increased $128 million or 22% and 150 basis points as a percent of sales to $713.5 million or 20.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $83.8 million or 230 basis points as a percent of sales to $394.8 million or 19.6% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $35.4 million or 130 basis points as a percent of sales to $330 million or 30.5% of sales. And the other segment operating loss declined by $8.7 million to $11.3 million. Total nonoperating expenses were roughly flat at $47.5 million as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was offset by declines in interest expense. 
Turning to our full year results on Page 3. Excluding the significant items described in our press release, earnings per share increased 67% to $2.06 versus $1.23 last year. Our operating income and earnings per share results were records for the company. Net sales increased 11% to $9.613 billion versus $8.632 billion last year and comps increased 9%. The gross margin rate increased 270 basis points to 37.8%, about 2/3 of the gross margin rate increase was driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and the remainder was driven by buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A dollars increased by $176.9 million or 8%, and the SG&A rate improved by 70 basis points. 
Page 4 details our full year operating income results. We made significant progress toward our goal of a 15% operating income rate. Total operating income increased by 50% to $1.084 billion, and our operating income rate improved by 340 basis points to 13.4% driven by significant improvement in all three segments. Another area of ongoing interest and the drivers of results in the other segment, so I'd like to take some time to provide some additional clarity. The other segment consists of sourcing function, MAST Global, Henri Bendel, corporate overhead and all of our international operations except La Senza, which is included in the Victoria's Secret segment. 
For the full year, Other segment revenue consisted of the following: MAST to third parties were $886 million, an increase by roughly $100 million from last year. About $70 million of the increase was driven by the accounting change to recognize 100% of sales to Express and Limited Stores in the last two quarters of the year versus 75% last year, and the remainder was driven by sales growth to third-party customers. Sales from our Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret stores in Canada totaled roughly $165 million, an increase by about $100 million versus last year driven by new store openings. 
Revenue from our International Wholesale and Franchise business, including our Victoria's Secret travel and tourism location stores and our Bath & Body Works franchise stores was about $75 million and increased by approximately 50% over last year. And finally, our Henri Bendel business recorded sales of about $50 million, about 23% above last year. The Other segment operating loss is driven by corporate overhead expense and a loss from our Henri Bendel business, which is partially offset by operating income from MAST and our international business. The improvement in the 2010 Other segment operating loss of $22 million was driven by the allocation of technology cost to Victoria's Secret and an increase in profits from our International business, partially offset by a decline in profitability at MAST. 
Moving down the income statement below operating income. Total nonoperating expenses for the year decreased by $36.6 million to $181 million primarily driven by decline in interest expense. Moving to the balance sheet on Page 5. Retail inventories per square foot of cost ended the year down 2% versus last year and down 11% on a two-year basis. Excluding an increase in the first quarter of 2009 related to the inventories associated with the Victoria's Secret systems implementation, inventories per square foot has decreased for 15 consecutive quarters. We ended the year with $2.5 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash. Free cash flow in 2010 was just over $1 billion, a record year. 2010 capital expenditures were $274 million. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter for $60.5 million. We have 139 million remaining under our 200 million share repurchase program. In 2010, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, special dividends and our ongoing regular dividend. We also just announced a 33% increase in our annual dividend to $0.80 per share. 
Turning to Page 6 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011. We expect earnings per share between $0.26 and $0.31 in the first quarter. This forecast reflects a top increase of between 2% and 4% including the updated guidance for February comps is up high-single digits. We expect the spread of about three to three percentage points between total sales growth and comps driven by sales growth in new stores in Canada and MAST. 
We are projecting first quarter gross margin and SG&A rate that are roughly flat to last year. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to last year. For the full year, we are projecting low single-digit positive comps and a spread between comps in total sales of roughly three percentage points driven by growth in MAST and international. 
With respect to increases in sourcing cost. We want to communicate five points. First, we make our money on the sale side. We create value for our customers through the emotional content of our brand and merchandise, which enables us to price independent cost and to earn premium margins. We think this aspect of our business differentiates us from any others in the retail industry. Second, the combination of inventory discipline and our efforts to get faster in the execution of our business has enabled us to improve merchandise margin over the last several years, and we do believe that there are divisional opportunities. Third, we have a very significant sourcing capability in the MAST global organization with a lot of experience literally on the ground in key regions. We have launched many relationships with our sourcing partners, as well as a geographically diverse bender base and we think that these capabilities and relationships also differentiate us. Fourth, about 40% of our retail sales come from personal care and beauty: shower gels, body lotions, fragrance. These products do not contain patent and substantially all of these products are made from the United States. With all that said, we do expect to see some pressure from the increased cost weighted principally to the back half of the year. It's not practical to predict how much of that can be offset through more full-priced selling. Therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be principally offset by buying and occupancy leverage, so our forecast for our 2011 gross margin rate to be about flat to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage on total sales growth. Nonoperating expenses are projected roughly flat to last year at about $47 million per quarter consisting principally interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%, and weighted average shares will approximate $333 million. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.15 and $2.35 per share. We are projecting 2011 capital spending of about $400 million. As detailed on Page 7 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 30 to 35 stores this year, mostly in Canada and close roughly 45 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $600 million to $650 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in a very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks, and now I'll turn that discussion over to Sharen."

Victoria's Secret earned record Q4 and full year profit in fiscal 2010. We are very pleased with these results and are confident that the keys to our success are the priorities we've been discussing all year,",781,"Thank you, Stuart and good morning, everyone. Victoria's Secret earned record Q4 and full year profit in fiscal 2010. We are very pleased with these results and are confident that the keys to our success are the priorities we've been discussing all year, so let's talk about those. But first is our focus on our core categories: bras and panties, coupled with a much higher impetus on getting faster and more agile. Second, is our continued, purposeful balance between business with optimism and conservative management of inventories and expenses. And third, is bringing all our work together in a well-told brand story across channel and telling that story through innovative products, steady newness with the right fashion and outstanding in-store execution. 
I'll begin my remarks this morning with a review of fourth quarter performance at both Victoria's Secret channel, followed by a brief recap of the full year and will then turn to a discussion of how we are thinking about the business as we head into the first quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter results are detailed on Page 8 of the presentation. In the Victoria's Secret stores channel, fourth quarter comps were up 15% with total sales increasing 16% to $1.39 billion. This result was driven by strength across the assortment as customers continue to respond favorably to our new, fresh and fashion drive offerings. We remain agile on inventory, chasing into winter and placing strategic bets in a controlled manner. Our Lingerie business demonstrated balanced growth in Q4 with bras, panties and sleepwear all performing well. The quarter began with a relaunch of the Miraculous bra. We did focus on gifting for the holiday selling season. All three of our businesses were much less promotional than both last year and in general. 
Pink has outstanding performance. We continue to see growth in bras and loungewear. In beauty, customers continued to love the Bombshell fragrance introduced last quarter, as well as new fourth quarter offerings including seasonal fragrance program and expanded gift sets. A key contributor to our top line performance has been our in-store execution, and we again achieved a record customer conversion for the quarter, something we've done every quarter this year. 
Q4 merchandise margin rates were up versus last year. As I mentioned, we continue to accomplish these results for being less promotional than last year and with lower inventory levels related to sales. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate increased significantly versus last year, and our operating profit was up nearly 25%. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $504 million driven by strength in bras, Pink, swim and dresses. And gross margin rate increased significantly driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate as the strength of the assortment and our conservative inventory exposition enabled us to drive more business at regular price. Additionally, both SG&A and buying and occupancy expenses leveraged, so operating income dollars increased more than 30% and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Turning to our full year results on Page 9. Victoria's Secret comps increased 14% with total sales increasing 15% to $4 billion. Merchandise growth and operating margins all increased significantly versus last year, and operating income was up nearly 16%. At Victoria's Secret Direct, sales increased 8% to $1.5 billion. Merchandise growth and operating margins also increased significantly versus last year and operating income was up over 40%. 
We believe the frequent innovation we delivered throughout 2010 drove results. We remain focused on the core and the fundamental. We take balance in our approach, and we told our brand story through fresh products. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we will continue to do more of what works. We will offer customers newness and innovation and plan the business conservatively. We feel very good about our inventory position and are managing our expenses prudently. Investing in what we believe could improve our customer connection and our profitability. 
With respect to our view of product cost, our priorities in sourcing are getting faster and increasing quality and innovation. As Stuart mentioned, we do expect some pressure from increased costs in 2011 weighted towards the back half of the year. We have a strong emotional connection with our customers, and we will continue to focus on maximizing full price balance. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance and our position, but we see opportunities to do better. We will continue to focus on executing with discipline, simplicity and speed. And of course, staying close to our customer and driving profitable growth will continue to be our top priority. Thanks, and now we'll turn the discussion over to Diane."

We were able to deliver growth in sales and operating income versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on our top three category, which is our Signature Collection product line, our soap business and our home fragrance assortment. The revenue improved on top of strong results last year in our Signature Collection driven by performance of our Holiday Collection and launches of our new fragrance Secret Wonderland, the New Island Escape collection and the continued success of fragrances launched throughout the past years. The business continued it's strong growth trajectory driven by growth and our Hand Soap and Sanitizer business, as well as performance in holiday fragrances and [indiscernible] Our home fragrance sales also drove our strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candle and seasonal fragrances, as well as the introduction of new [indiscernible] Transactions were up versus the last year driven by an improvement in our conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. 
Let me take you to the financial results in the quarter as detailed on Page 10 of the presentation. Bath & Body Works were up 6%. Total sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which is up 7% or $73 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $330 million, which is up $35 million or 12% from the last year and represented a record performance. Operating income as a percent of sales is 31% in the quarter and up to last year, driven by strong top line sales, improvements in merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses in the fourth quarter. Improvements in our merchandise margin rate continue to be driven by cost reduction. Our in-store promotional activity was comparable to last year in the fourth quarter. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock division continue to improve. 
For fiscal 2010 as presented on Page 11, our operating income was $454 million, which is up $106 million or 29% versus last year and also represented record performance. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 18.4%, which is up 340 basis points last year. The operating income performance was driven by comps of about 5%, improvement in merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses. The channels delivered stronger sales and operating income growth, and we continue to do the direct channel and revenue generator and a marketing vehicle for our brand. 
So with that in mind, in the first quarter, we will continue to introduce new innovation in both home and fragrance. This month, we launched our new Signature Collection fragrance, Carried Away, and will transition to the relaunch of our already successful fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom. We are very pleased on our focus of disciplined approach to deliver record performance for the year. We're cautiously optimistic about the first quarter and continue to manage expenses and inventories conservatively. Our focus is to get faster and better in understanding and satisfying our customers' needs, while providing them with a world-class, in-store experience. In addition to our focus on products and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, maintaining flexibility in our inventories direct to our customers' needs. And with that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martyn."
285544,99887059,105864,"Limited Brands Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Diane, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend some time this morning updating you on our strategy to grow our International business.

I'd like to spend some time this morning updating you on our strategy to grow our International business. Of course, it goes without saying that we recognize that we have tremendous international growth opportunities for all of our brands, and we are expanding now outside of the United States aggressively. 
We are determined to pursue this growth with discipline, while making sure that we do not overrun our headlights or denigrate the reputation of our brands. We want to ensure that we have both the managerial bandwidth and the sourcing logistics and systems infrastructure in place to support our growth and delivers for brand experienced to our customers. 
We've made significant progress in 2010. We opened 77 new stores internationally. We moved the La Senza business to Columbus, and we launched our first organic franchise partnership. We also just recently hired Mary Mitchell to join Martin Water's core leadership team as Chief Administrative Officer. Most recently, Mary inventory management strategy for Banana Republic's North American business. Previously, she served as General Manager for Gap's international operations in Europe and Japan, where she delivered business teams in each of these markets and opened a Banana Republic flagship store in London. 
While many of you are familiar with our six-point agenda for International business development, which is detailed on Page 12 of the presentation. Now just before I go on, let me just set for a minute, please remember that the La Senza and La Senza International businesses, as well as the Victoria's Secret Direct International business roll-up under the Victoria's Secret segment for recording purposes. While the BBW, VS and Pink Canada business, the Travel and Tourism business and our new franchise BBW business are all reported as part of the Other segment. 
Our first priority is, as you see on the slide, continues to be improve the performance of our La Senza business. La Senza's comps declined 5% in the fourth quarter with the significant growth in our core Bra and Panty business did not fully offset the decline in the Sleepwear business, as we're de-emphasizing this category. Total sales were $121.2 million and the total sales declined year-over-year was also attributable to our closure of the La Senza Girl business in 2009. The gross margin rate increased significantly driven by an increased merchandise margin rate and a decrease in buying and occupancy cost. The improvement in merchandise margin rate was driven by the sales shift to panties and bras and better inventory management. The operating results was approximately breakeven. 
For the full year, La Senza comps were down 1% and sales were $398.2 million. Gross margin rate increased versus last year, driven by a significant improvement in the merchandise margin rate. Excluding the one-time cost related to the relocation of the business to Columbus, La Senza's 2010 operating results was about breakeven. While we are in courage by the growth in the Bra and Panty business and the performance of our remodeled store locations, conversion is up significantly, however, the business has been and continues to be challenged by significant traffic declines. We are actively working to turn this business around. 
Well, in addition to the approximately 250 stores in Canada, there are over 450 La Senza stores in the rest of the world that are operated by our franchise partners. We saw significant improvement in the performance of these locations in 2010 and believe we will likely add 50 additional locations in 2011 with existing partners. 
Turning to our second priority, which is our new businesses in Canada. We ended the year with 59 Bath & Body Works stores, four Victoria's Secret stores in eight Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these the stores. As Stuart mentioned, we delivered $165 million in retail sales from these new businesses in 2010. Our Bath & Body Works stores continue to perform well above our U.S. average store volumes and the response to the Victoria's Secret stores has been phenomenal. 
In 2011, we plan to open about 10 additional BBW stores, about eight additional Victoria's Secret stores and one or two additional Pink stores. We expect these new stores, along with full year sales related to the 2010 store openings will contribute over $100 million in incremental retail sales in 2011, with four-wall profitability, that is consistent with our U.S. stores. 
Now looking at our third priority, we ended the year with 18 stores operating under the Victoria's Secret travel and tourism model, which are principally in international airport locations. These are small Victoria's Secret stores focused on beauty and Victoria's Secret branded accessories. The stores are approximately 1,000 square feet in size and are operated by partners under either a wholesale or franchise model. These stores continue to deliver strong results with retail sales averaging around $1.5 million per store. In 2011, we plan to open another 40 to 50 stores in the T&T format. 
And against our four priority, we opened our first six BBW stores in the Middle East under our franchise agreement with Alshaya. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores and could open around 20 more stores this year. In addition, as you know, we plan to open a previously announced Victoria's Secret flagship location on new Bond Street in London in mid-2012. 
And finally, our Direct business continues to gain strength internationally with over $150 million in sales to over 200 countries in 2010. So in summary, we're building on our existing base of profitable sales outside of the United States. With our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we're seeing in our other initiatives, we believe we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally. 
And before we take your questions, I want to reiterate that we're very pleased with our progress that we've made in 2010 and our record-setting financial performance. This performance was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation to getting faster and more agile in everything that we do, and of course, staying close to our customers. We will maintain this discipline and focused approach in 2011, and we clearly see opportunities to continue to get even better. Thanks, and I'll now turn it back over to Amie."

If you look at the aggregate of what I just announced in terms of 2011, the overall agenda for Martin Waters and his international business team, it is significant. There's a lot of things we're putting on the plan for 2011. And frankly, one of the traits that we've made in looking at resources, time, priorities is to continue the expansion of BBW in Canada but not exactly at the same pace. There's nothing to do with our performance or concerns about our ability to expand in Canada over time, just simply a resources and priority decision. The other thing to note is we've increased our emphasis on expansion of the Victoria's Secret stores and relatively speaking in terms of square footage for instance because for Victoria's Secret stores are much bigger, the actual overall expansion of square footage in Canada in '11 will be very similar to '10 but it'll be the combination of VS and BBW."

So we had a lot of stability in leadership and management, and the effect of that is that our forfeiture rates on stock comp were down a lot. And between Q3 and Q4, for different groups and based on additional analysis, we should set up and the effect in the quarter was significant. In addition, I mentioned the write-off of the trade name, which was also significant, which is why we called it out. And when you isolate those two things out, the flow-through, the profit flow from sales in Q4 was about 40%, which is an ongoing benchmark in my mind, obviously, over the last several years of profit growth through from sales has been higher than that. But when you account for those two things I described, the flow-through of that 40%, and again I think that's really the delta on expenses and some views that folks who may have on operating income. With respect to going forward, our mindset is we've been consistent about this and hopefully you see it in our numbers, we intend very clearly to grow expenses slower than sales. And we did that in 2010. We expect to do that in 2011. There is a little bit of increase in de-leveraging Q1 in SG&A driven by some additional investment in marketing, but that de-leveraging and marketing and SG&A is not that significant at the end of the day. So the key message is that we will continue to be disciplined on it and grow expenses slower than sales."

As I said in my remarks, the business is in the process of being transformed. We talked about that in the last three or four calls, still very much a work in progress, lots of progress being made. But as we described today, the business was basically flat year-over-year in comps, and it's a breakeven business for us still today. In terms of prospects in the future, our goal and clear plan is to produce this kind of profitability, margin rate, if you will from the La Senza Canada business, company-owned retail business that we would produce for our U.S. brands. It's obviously, not there today and that is the plan. How much progress we'll make in 2011? I really am not prepared to describe because it is, as I said, a work in progress. The other businesses, we also described in more detail today in terms of how they're making contribution to the overall international results. And the last thing I want to mention is I think in terms of the overall international business model, in addition to the company-owned retail business that we have in Canada with La Senza, Pink, VS, BBW, these other businesses that we're building which is the franchise businesses and the travel and tourism business are a different business model. That's why I keep calling them businesses, it's not one business outside the United States. And for the T&T, what we call T&T travel and tourism, and for the franchise businesses, it's important to remember that for those businesses, we'll be recognizing revenues that are based on the mix of wholesale, sales, royalty income and sourcing sales to those partnered businesses and are those recognized revenues, we expect profit contribution from those businesses that are growing at a very fast-paced to be highly accretive to our overall operating income margin. Hopefully, it's helpful to you in terms of understanding on how to think about that business. The last thing I'd say in international is obviously, as I described, we're investing in people and new store opening costs and systems to support our growth, which is also constraining short-term profitability obviously. In terms of the international Victoria's Secret Direct business, it is, and I want to repeat, it is the sixth of our six-agenda items. And therefore, we're not putting as much time to help against that opportunity as we already the first five. That said, we remain convinced that there is a substantial opportunity there, and we're building additional systems and capabilities around that to improve the customer experience when the customer is ordering from us for international or from an international location, improve the shipping and handling experience and also improve the language experience. For instance, we have a Spanish-language site open. We would look at doing an additional language, one in FR retail operations or expanded into different geographies where that would be very helpful to our customers, so optimistic but not our top priority."

I think the key thing for the my point of view is view what we've declared to the stage in the last two years of investor update takes aim at repeated today which is we believe La Senza is our core brands was. It represents the value position and intimate apparel category that works well around the world today, not as well in Canada as we needed to work because we're transforming it and we believe that it has a position in our portfolio of businesses, alongside if not against but outside of Victoria's Secret and Pink that has global expansion potential beyond its current distribution around the world. We're committed to making it work this personally we're spending a lot of time on it and I have a tremendous confidence in Martin Waters, Joanne Nemeroff and our management team that they're going to figure it out and get it right, whether it will produce exactly the same kind of profitability that our Secret produces, probably not over time, but close to it is the ambition that we have.

We're very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.26 per share versus $1.01 per share last year. Our reported 2010 result was $1.36 per share versus $1.08",1841,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.26 per share versus $1.01 per share last year. Our reported 2010 result was $1.36 per share versus $1.08 last year. Both this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. This year's reported fourth quarter results include pretax gains from the sale of Express shares and the payment of an Express dividend totaling $52 million or $0.10 per share. 
2009's reported results include a tax benefit of $23 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to the reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items in both years. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.26 significantly exceeded our beginning of the quarter expectations of $1.02 to $1.17 per share. This upside was driven by the 10% comp increase versus our initial forecast of up low-single digits. 
To take you through the fourth quarter results as detailed on Page 1 of the presentation, net sales were $3.456 billion versus $3.063 billion last year, and comps increased 10%. The gross margin rate increased 100 basis points to 41.8%, primarily driven by a leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate increased slightly despite a negative impact of about 60 basis points related to the increase in Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at 100% this year versus 75% last year. 
The change in revenue recognition is a result of the change in accounting for our Express investment to the cost method versus the equity method last year and the sale of our remaining investment in Limited Stores. This accounting change, which occurred in the third quarter of 2010 will continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated merchandise margin rate in the first two quarters of 2011. 
SG&A dollars increased by $67.8 million or 10%, and the SG&A rate improved by 50 basis points. The major drivers of expense growth are as follows: over half the dollar increase in SG&A was driven by increased store selling costs, including cost related to new stores in Canada; total selling cost leverage as a percent of sales; about 25% of the increase was related to certain unusual expenses in the quarter, including a significant increase in stock compensation expense due to a lower forfeiture rate as a result of lower associate turnover; and separately, the write-offs of an intangible freight name asset. And most of the remainder of the increase was driven by an increase in marketing costs, which held flat as a percent of sales. 
Turning to operating income on Page 2. Total operating income increased $128 million or 22% and 150 basis points as a percent of sales to $713.5 million or 20.6 percent of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $83.8 million or 230 basis points as a percent of sales to $394.8 million or 19.6 percent of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $35.4 million or 130 basis points as a percent of sales to $330 million or 30.5 percent of sales. And the other segment operating loss declined by $8.7 million to $11.3 million. Total nonoperating expenses were roughly flat at $47.5 million, as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to our full year results on Page 3. Excluding the significant items described in our press release, earnings per share increased 67% to $2.06 versus $1.23 last year. Our operating income and earnings per share results were records for the company. Net sales increased 11% to $9.613 billion versus $8.632 billion last year, and comps increased 9%. The gross margin rate increased 270 basis points to 37.8%, about 2/3 of the gross margin rate increase was driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate, and the remainder was driven by buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A dollars increased by $176.9 million or 8%, and the SG&A rate improved by 70 basis points. 
Page 4 details our full year operating income results. We made significant progress toward our goal of a 15% operating income rate. Total operating income increased by 50% to $1.284 billion, and our operating income rate improved by 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by significant improvement in all three segments. I know there is ongoing interest in the drivers of results in the other segment, so I'd like to take some time to provide some additional clarity. The other segment consists of our sourcing function, MAST Global, Henri Bendel, corporate overhead and all of our international operations except La Senza, which is included in the Victoria's Secret segment. 
For the full year, other segment revenue consisted of the following. Mast sales to the third parties were $886 million, an increase by roughly $100 million from last year. About $70 million of the increase was driven by the accounting change to recognize 100% of sales to Express and Limited Stores in the last two quarters of the year versus 75% last year. And the remainder was driven by sales growth to third-party customers. Sales from our Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret stores in Canada totaled roughly $165 million, an increase by about $100 million versus last year, driven by new store openings. 
Revenue from our international, wholesale and franchise business, including our Victoria's Secret Travel and Tourism location stores and our Bath & Body Works franchise stores was about $75 million and increased by approximately 50% over last year. And finally, our Henri Bendel business recorded sales of about $50 million, about 20% above last year. The other segment operating loss is driven by corporate overhead expense and a loss from our Henri Bendel business, which is partially offset by operating income from Mast and our international business. The improvement in the 2010 other segment operating loss of $22 million was driven by the allocation of technology cost to Victoria's Secret and an increase in profits from our international business, partially offset by a decline in profitability at Mast. 
Moving down the income statement below operating income. Total nonoperating expenses for the year decreased by $36.6 million to $181 million, primarily driven by a decline in interest expense. Moving to the balance sheet on Page 5. Retail inventories per square foot of cost ended the year down 2% versus last year, and down 11% on a two-year basis. Excluding an increase in the first quarter of 2009 related to the full port of inventories associated with the Victoria's Secret systems implementation, inventories per square foot has decreased for 15 consecutive quarters. We ended the year with $2.5 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash. Free cash flow in 2010 was just over $1 billion, a record year. 2010 capital expenditures were $274 million. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter for $60.5 million. We have $139 million remaining under our $200 million share repurchase program. In 2010, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, special dividends and our ongoing regular dividend. We also just announced a 33% increase in our regular annual dividend to $0.80 per share. 
Turning to Page 6 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011. We expect earnings per share between $0.26 and $0.31 in the first quarter. This forecast reflects a comp increase of between 2% and 4%, including the updated guidance for February comps of up high-single digits. We expect the spread of about two to three percentage points between total sales growth and comps, driven by sales growth from new stores in Canada and Mast. 
We are projecting first quarter gross margin and SG&A rate that are roughly flat to last year. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to last year. For the full year, we are projecting low single-digit positive comps and a spread between comps in total sales of roughly three percentage points, driven by growth in Mast and international. 
With respect to increases in sourcing cost. We want to communicate five points. First, we make our money on the sell side. We create value for our customers through the emotional content of our brands and merchandise, which enables us to price independent of cost and to earn premium margins. We think this aspect of our business differentiates us from many others in the retail industry. Second, the combination of inventory discipline and our efforts to get faster in the execution of our business has enabled us to improve merchandise margin over the last several years, and we do believe that there are is additional opportunity. Third, we have a very significant sourcing capability in the Mast Global organization with a lot of experience literally on the ground in key regions. We have launched many relationships with our sourcing partners, as well as a geographically-diverse vendor base, and we think that these capabilities and relationships also differentiate us. Fourth, about 40% of our retail sales come from personal care and beauty, shower gels, body lotions, fragrance. These products do not contain cotton, and substantially all of the product is made in the United States. 
With all that said, we do expect to see some pressure from the increased cost weighted principally to the back half of the year. It's not practical to predict how much of that can be offset through more full-priced selling. Therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be principally offset by buying and occupancy leverage, so our forecast is for our 2011 gross margin rate to be about flat to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage on total sales growth. Nonoperating expenses are projected roughly flat to last year at about $47 million per quarter, consisting principally interest expense. To support any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%, and weighted average shares will approximate $333 million. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.15 and $2.35 per share. We are projecting 2011 capital spending of about $400 million. As detailed on Page 7 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 30 to 35 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 45 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $600 million to $650 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Victoria's Secret earned record Q4 and full year profit in fiscal 2010. We are very pleased with these results and are confident that the keys to our success are the priorities we've been discussing all year,",783,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. Victoria's Secret earned record Q4 and full year profit in fiscal 2010. We are very pleased with these results and are confident that the keys to our success are the priorities we've been discussing all year, so let's talk about those. The first is our focus on our core categories, bras and panties, coupled with a much higher emphasis on getting faster and more agile. Second, is our continued purposeful balance between managing business with optimism and conservative management of inventories and expenses. And third, is bringing all our work together in a well-told brand story across channel and telling that story through innovative products, steady newness with the right fashion and outstanding in-store execution. 
I'll begin my remarks this morning with review of fourth quarter performance at both Victoria's Secret channel, followed by a brief recap of the full year and will then turn to a discussion of how we are thinking about the business as we head into the first quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter results are detailed on Page 8 of the presentation. In the Victoria's Secret stores channel, fourth quarter comps were up 15%, with total sales increasing 16% to $1.39 billion. This result was driven by strength across the assortment as customers continue to respond favorably to our new, fresh and fashion brand offerings. We remained agile on inventory, chasing into winners and placing strategic bets in a controlled manner. Our lingerie business demonstrated balanced growth in Q4 with bras, panties and sleepwear, all performing well. The quarter began with a relaunch of the Miraculous bra. We didn't focus on gifting for the holiday-selling season. All three of our businesses were much less promotional than both last year, end of month, in general. 
Pink has outstanding performance. We continue to see growth in bras and loungewear. In Beauty, customers continue to love the Bombshell fragrance introduced last quarter, as well as new fourth quarter offerings, including seasonal fragrance program and expanded gift set. A key contributor to our top line performance has been our in-store execution. And we, again, achieved a record customer conversion for the quarter, something we've done every quarter this year. 
Q4 merchandise margin rates were up versus last year. As I mentioned, we continue to accomplish these results for being less promotional than last year and with lower inventory levels related to sales. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate increased significantly versus last year, and our operating profit was up nearly 25%. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $504 million, driven by strength in bras, Pink, swim and dresses. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate as the strength of the assortment and our conservative inventory exposition enabled us to drive more business at regular price. Additionally, both SG&A and buying and occupancy expenses leveraged, so operating income dollars increased more than 30%, and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Turning to our full year results on Page 9. Victoria's Secret comps increased 14% with total sales increasing 15% to $4 billion. Merchandise gross and operating margins all increased significantly versus last year, and operating income was up nearly 16%. At Victoria's Secret Direct, sales increased 8% to $1.5 billion. Merchandise gross and operating margins also increased significantly versus last year, and operating income was up over 40%. 
We believe the frequent innovation we delivered throughout 2010 drove results. We remain focused on the core and the fundamental. We state balance in our approach, and we told our brand story through fresh products. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we will continue to do more of what works. We will offer customers newness and innovation and plan the business conservatively. We feel very good about our inventory position and are managing our expenses prudently, investing when we believe we can improve our customer connection and our profitability. 
With respect to our view of product cost, our priorities in sourcing are on getting faster and increasing quality and innovation. As Stuart mentioned, we do expect some pressure from increased costs in 2011 weighted towards the back half of the year. We have a strong emotional connection with our customers, and we will continue to focus on maximizing full price balance. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance and our position, but we see opportunities to do better. We will continue to focus on executing with discipline, simplicity and speed. And of course, staying close to our customer and driving profitable growth will continue to be our top priority. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Diane."

In Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of our fourth quarter. We were able to deliver growth in sales and operating income versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus our strong",612,"Thank you, Sharen, and good morning. In Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of our fourth quarter. We were able to deliver growth in sales and operating income versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus our strong performance last year by maintaining focus on our top three categories, which is our Signature Collection product line, the anti-bacterial soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Performance improved on top of strong results last year in our Signature Collection, driven by the performance of our holiday collection and launches of our new fragrance, Secret Wonderland, the new Island Escape collection and the continued success of fragrances launched throughout the past year. The anti-bacterial business continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by growth in our hand soap and sanitizer business, as well as performance in holiday fragrances and new seasonal form. Our home fragrance sales also delivered strong performance last year and continued to be driven by candle and seasonal fragrances, as well as the introduction of new forms analysis in our distributed categories. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by an improvement in our conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. 
[indiscernible] Let me take you to the financial results in the quarter as detailed on Page 10 of the presentation. Bath & Body Works fourth quarter comps were up 6%. Total sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was up 7% or $73 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $330 million, which is up $35 million or 12% from last year and represented a record performance. Operating income as a percent of sales is 31% in the quarter, and up to last year, driven by strong top line sales, improvements in merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses in the fourth quarter. Improvements in our merchandise margin rate continue to be driven by cost reduction. Our in-store promotional activity was comparable to last year in the fourth quarter. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock division continue to improve. 
For fiscal 2010, as presented on Page 11, our operating income was $464 million, which is up $106 million or 29% versus last year, and also represented record performance. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 18.4%, which is up 340 basis points last year. The operating income performance was driven by comps of about 5%, improvement in merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses. Adjustment by our referral  channels delivered strong sales and operating income growth, and we continue to view the direct channel in both the revenue generator and a marketing vehicle for our brand. 
So with that in mind, in the first quarter, we will continue to introduce newest innovation in both forms and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance, Carried Away, and will transition to the relaunch of our already successful fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom. We are very pleased with our focus in disciplined approach delivered record performance for the year. We're cautiously optimistic about the first quarter and continue to manage expenses and inventories conservatively. Our focus is to get faster and better in understanding and satisfying our customers' needs, while providing them with a world-class, in-store experience. In addition to our focus on products and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, maintaining flexibility in our inventories direct quickly to our customers' needs. And with that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martyn."

I'd like to spend some time this morning updating you on our strategy to grow our international businesses.

I'd like to spend some time this morning updating you on our strategy to grow our international businesses. Of course, it goes without saying that we recognize that we have tremendous international growth opportunities for all of our brands, and we are expanding now outside of the United States aggressively. 
We're determined to pursue this growth with discipline, while making sure that we do not overrun our headlights or denigrate the reputation of our brands. We want to ensure that we have both the managerial bandwidth and the sourcing logistics and systems infrastructure in place to support our growth and delivers for brand experienced to our customers. 
We've made significant progress in 2010. We opened 77 new stores internationally. We moved the La Senza business to Columbus, and we launched our first organic franchise partnership. We also just recently hired Mary Mitchell to join Martin Water's core leadership team as Chief Administrative Officer. Most recently, Mary led inventory management strategy for Banana Republic's North American business. Previously, she served as General Manager for Gap's international operations in Europe and Japan, where she delivered business teams in each of these markets and opened the Banana Republic flagship store in London. 
While many of you are familiar with our six-point agenda for international business development, which is detailed on Page 12 of the presentation. Now just before I go on, let me just set for a minute, please remember that the La Senza and La Senza international businesses, as well as the Victoria's Secret Direct International business roll-up under the Victoria's Secret segment for recording purposes. While the BBW, VS and Pink Canada business, the Travel and Tourism business and our new franchise BBW business are all reported as part of the other segment. 
Our first priority, as you see on the slide, continues to be improve the performance of our La Senza business. La Senza's comps declined 5% in the fourth quarter, as significant growth in our core bra and panty business did not fully offset the decline in the sleepwear business, as we're de-emphasizing this category. Total sales were $121.2 million, and the total sales decline year-over-year was also attributable to our closure of the La Senza Girl business in 2009. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by an increased merchandise margin rate and a decrease in buying and occupancy cost. The improvement in merchandise margin rate was driven by the sales shift to panties and bras and better inventory management. The operating result was approximately breakeven. 
For the full year, La Senza comps were down 1%, and sales were $398.2 million. Gross margin rate increased versus last year, driven by a significant improvement in the merchandise margin rate. Excluding the one-time cost related to the relocation of the business to Columbus, La Senza's 2010 operating result was about breakeven. Now we encouraged by the growth in the bra and panty business and the performance of our remodeled store locations, conversion is up significantly, however, the business has been and continues to be challenged by significant traffic declines. We are actively working to turn this business around. 
Now in addition to the approximately 250 stores in Canada, there are over 450 La Senza stores in the rest of the world that are operated by our franchise partners. We saw a significant improvement in the performance of these locations in 2010 and believe we will likely add around 50 additional locations in 2011 with existing partners. 
Now turning to our second priority, which is our new businesses in Canada. We ended the year with 59 Bath & Body Works stores, four Victoria's Secret stores in eight Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. As Stuart mentioned, we delivered $165 million in retail sales from these new businesses in 2010. Our Bath & Body Works stores continue to perform well above our U.S. average store volumes, and the response to the Victoria's Secret stores has been phenomenal. 
In 2011, we plan to open about 10 additional BBW stores, about eight additional Victoria's Secret stores and one or two additional Pink stores. We expect that these new stores, along with full year sales related to the 2010 store openings will contribute over $100 million in incremental retail sales in 2011, with four-wall profitability, that is consistent with our U.S. stores. 
Now looking at our third priority, we ended the year with 18 stores operating under the Victoria's Secret Travel and Tourism model, which are principally in international airport locations. These are small Victoria's Secret stores focused on beauty and Victoria's Secret branded accessories. The stores are approximately 1,000 square feet in size and are operated by partners under either a wholesale or franchise model. These stores continue to deliver strong results with retail sales averaging around $1.5 million per store. In 2011, we plan to open another 40 to 50 stores in the T&T format. 
And against our four priority, we opened our first six BBW stores in the Middle East under our franchise agreement with Alshaya. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores and could open around 20 more stores this year. In addition, as you know, we plan to open the previously announced Victoria's Secret flagship location on New Bond Street in London in mid-2012. 
And finally, our Direct business continues to gain strength internationally with over $150 million in sales to over 200 countries in 2010. So in summary, we're building on our existing base of profitable sales outside of the United States. With our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we're seeing in our other initiatives, we believe we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally. 
And before we take your questions, I want to reiterate that we're very pleased with our progress that we've made in 2010 and our record-setting financial performance. This performance was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation to getting faster and more agile in everything that we do, and of course, staying close to our customers. We will maintain this disciplined and focused approach in 2011, and we clearly see opportunities to continue to get even better. Thanks, and I'll now turn it back over to Amie."

It has nothing to do with our performance or our concerns about our ability to expand in Canada over time, just simply a resources and priority decision. The other thing to note is we've increased our emphasis on expansion of the Victoria's Secret stores, and relatively speaking in terms of square footage for instance because for Victoria's Secret stores are much bigger, the actual overall expansion of square footage in Canada in '11 will be very similar to '10, but it'll be the combination of VS and BBW."

So we did recognize a meaningful amount of additional expense related to stock compensation because frankly, we just had a lot of turnover in our business, which we view by the way as a good thing. So we've had a lot of stability in leadership and management, and the effect of that is that our forfeiture rates on stock comp were down a lot. And between Q3 and Q4, for different groups and based on additional analysis, we shoot that up, and the effect in the quarter was significant. In addition, I mentioned the write-off of the trade name, which was also significant, which is why we called it out. And when you isolate or pull those two things out, the flow-through, the profit flow from sales in Q4 was about 40%, which is kind of an ongoing benchmark in my mind, obviously, over the last several years of profit flow-through from sales has been higher than that. But when you account for those two things I described, the flow-through of that 40%, and again, I think that's really the delta on expenses and some views that folks may have had on operating income. With respect to going forward, our mindset is we've been consistent about this, and hopefully you see it in our numbers. We intend very clearly to grow expenses slower than sales. And we did that in 2010. We expect to do that in 2011. There is a little bit of increase in de-leveraging Q1 in SG&A, driven by some additional investment in marketing, but that de-leveraging in marketing and SG&A is not that significant at the end of the day. So the key message is that we will continue to be disciplined on it and grow expenses slower than sales."

As I said in my remarks, the business is in the process of being transformed. And we talked about that in the last three or four calls, still very much a work in progress, lots of progress being made. But as we described today, the business was basically flat year-over-year in comps, and it's a breakeven business for us still today. In terms of prospects of the future, our goal and clear plan is to produce this kind of OI profitability, margin rate, if you will, from the La Senza Canada business, company-owned retail business that we would produce for our U.S. brands. It's, obviously, not there today, and that is the plan. How much progress we'll make in 2011? I really am not prepared to describe because it is, as I said, a work in progress. The other businesses, we've also described in more detail today in terms of how they're making contribution to the overall international results. And the last thing I would want to mention is, I think, in terms of the overall international business model, in addition to the company-owned retail business that we have in Canada with La Senza, Pink, VS, BBW, these other businesses that we're building, which is the franchise businesses and the Travel and Tourism business are a different business model. That's why I keep calling them businesses, it's not one business outside the United States. And for the T&T, what we call T&T, Travel and Tourism, and for the franchise businesses, it's important to remember that for those businesses, we'll be recognizing revenues that are based on the mix of wholesale, sales, royalty income and sourcing sales to those partnered businesses and that on those recognized revenues, we expect the profit contribution from those businesses that are growing at a very fast pace to be highly accretive to our overall operating income margin. Hopefully, it's helpful to you in terms of understanding how to think about that business. The last thing I'd say about international is, obviously as I described, we're investing in people and new store opening costs and systems to support our growth, which is also constraining short-term profitability obviously. In terms of the international, Victoria's Secret Direct business, it is, and I want to repeat, it is the sixth priority of our six agenda items. And therefore, we're not putting as much time and effort against that opportunity as we are the first five. That said, we remain convinced that there is a substantial opportunity there, and we're building additional systems and capabilities around that to improve the customer experience when the customer is ordering from us for international or from an international location, improve the shipping and handling experience and also improve the language experience. For instance, we have a Spanish-language site up, and we would look at doing additional languages when our FR retail operations are expanded into different geographies where that would be very helpful to our customers, so optimistic but not our top priority."

So we'll continue to test those different strategies throughout the spring season,  not necessarily form, fall and holiday of next year. And as far as other two questions you have for me, as far new product pipeline for spring, we're about double last year. And it's really due to the fact that I have mentioned in the earlier answer is that our business is being driven much more seasonally than it ever was in the past. So we have the opportunity for more seasonally relevant fragrance launches across all three of our businesses this spring that we didn't have last spring or as much last spring. And as far cost being driven down, it really is a multiple of things, when you realize you have an opportunity and it goes from 10,000 units to 1 million units, it's a cost advantage for that. And that has really helped drive a lot of our cost decreases over the last couple of years."

We do it with our Board, you can look at our track record over time, but it would be pretty mature and not appropriate to comment about what we may do in 2011. We'll see how the year unfolds.

I think the key thing from my point of view is kind of what we've declared from the stage in our last two years of investor update meetings, and I'll repeat it today, which is we believe La Senza is another core brand to us. It represents a value position in the intimate apparel category that works well around the world today, not as well in Canada as we needed to work because we're transforming it. And we believe that it has a position in our portfolio of businesses, alongside if not against up against the longside of Victoria's Secret and Pink. And that it has a global expansion potential beyond its current distribution around the world. We're committed to making it work. Les is personally committed to making it work. He's spending a lot of time on it, and I have a tremendous confidence in Les, Martin Waters, Joanne Nemeroff and our management team that they're going to figure it out and get it right, whether it will produce exactly the same kind of profitability that our Victoria's Secret produces, probably not over time, but close to it is the ambition that we have. And I'm talking about operating margin rate, it's obviously a lower per store sales volume type of business because of its smaller box size and value position."

We're very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.26 per share versus $1.01 per share last year. Our reported 2010 result was $1.36 per share versus $1.08",1834,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.26 per share versus $1.01 per share last year. Our reported 2010 result was $1.36 per share versus $1.08 last year. Both this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. This year's reported fourth quarter results include pretax gains from the sale of Express shares and the payment of an Express dividend totaling $52 million or $0.10 per share. 
2009's reported results include a tax benefit of $23 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to the reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items in both years. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.26 significantly exceeded our beginning of the quarter expectations of $1.02 to $1.17 per share. This upside was driven by the 10% comp increase versus our initial forecast of up low-single digits. 
To take you through the fourth quarter results as detailed on Page 1 of the presentation, net sales were $3.456 billion versus $3.063 billion last year, and comps increased 10%. The gross margin rate increased 100 basis points to 41.8%, primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate increased slightly despite a negative impact of about 60 basis points related to the increase in Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at 100% this year versus 75% last year. 
The change in revenue recognition is a result of the change in accounting for our Express investment to the cost method versus the equity method last year and the sale of our remaining investment in Limited Stores. This accounting change, which occurred in the third quarter of 2010 will continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated merchandise margin rate in the first two quarters of 2011. 
SG&A dollars increased by $67.8 million or 10%, and the SG&A rate improved by 50 basis points. The major drivers of expense growth are as follows: over half the dollar increase in SG&A was driven by increased store selling costs, including costs related to new stores in Canada; total selling cost leverage as a percent of sales; about 25% of the increase was related to certain unusual expenses in the quarter, including a significant increase in stock compensation expense due to a lower forfeiture rate as a result of lower associate turnover; and separately, the write-offs of an intangible trade name asset. And most of the remainder of the increase was driven by an increase in marketing costs, which held flat as a percent of sales. 
Turning to operating income on Page 2. Total operating income increased $128 million or 22% and 150 basis points as a percent of sales to $713.5 million or 20.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $83.8 million or 230 basis points as a percent of sales to $394.8 million or 19.6% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $35.4 million or 130 basis points as a percent of sales to $330 million or 30.5% of sales. And the other segment operating loss declined by $8.7 million to $11.3 million. Total non-operating expenses were roughly flat at $47.5 million, as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to our full year results on Page 3. Excluding the significant items described in our press release, earnings per share increased 67% to $2.06 versus $1.23 last year. Our operating income and earnings per share results were records for the company. Net sales increased 11% to $9.613 billion versus $8.632 billion last year, and comps increased 9%. The gross margin rate increased 270 basis points to 37.8%. About 2/3 of the gross margin rate increase was driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate, and the remainder was driven by buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A dollars increased by $176.9 million or 8%, and the SG&A rate improved by 70 basis points. 
Page 4 details our full year operating income results. We made significant progress toward our goal of a 15% operating income rate. Total operating income increased by 50% to $1.284 billion, and our operating income rate improved by 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by significant improvement in all three segments. I know there is ongoing interest in the drivers of results in the other segment, so I'd like to take some time to provide some additional clarity. The other segment consists of our sourcing function, Mast Global, Henri Bendel, corporate overhead and all of our international operations except La Senza, which is included in the Victoria's Secret segment. 
For the full year, other segment revenue consisted of the following. Mast sales to the third parties were $886 million and increase by roughly $100 million from last year. About $70 million of the increase was driven by the accounting change to recognize 100% of sales to Express and Limited Stores in the last two quarters of the year versus 75% last year. And the remainder was driven by sales growth to third-party customers. Sales from our Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret stores in Canada totaled roughly $165 million and increased by about $100 million versus last year, driven by new store openings. 
Revenue from our international, wholesale and franchise business, including our Victoria's Secret Travel and Tourism location stores and our Bath & Body Works franchise stores was about $75 million and increased by approximately 50% over last year. And finally, our Henri Bendel business recorded sales of about $50 million, about 20% above last year. The other segment operating loss is driven by corporate overhead expense and a loss from our Henri Bendel business, which is partially offset by operating income from Mast and our International business. The improvement in the 2010 other segment operating loss of $22 million was driven by the allocation of technology cost to Victoria's Secret and an increase in profits from our International business, partially offset by a decline in profitability at Mast. 
Moving down the income statement below operating income. Total nonoperating expenses for the year decreased by $36.6 million to $181 million, primarily driven by a decline in interest expense.
Moving to the balance sheet on Page 5. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the year down 2% versus last year and down 11% on a two-year basis. Excluding an increase in the first quarter of 2009 related to the pull-forward of inventories associated with the Victoria's Secret systems implementation, inventory per square foot has decreased for 15 consecutive quarters. We ended the year with $2.5 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash. Free cash flow in 2010 was just over $1 billion, a record year. 2010 capital expenditures were $274 million. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter for $60.5 million. We have $139 million remaining under our $200 million share repurchase program. In 2010, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, special dividends and our ongoing regular dividend. We also just announced a 33% increase in our regular annual dividend to $0.80 per share. 
Turning to Page 6 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011. We expect earnings per share between $0.26 and $0.31 in the first quarter. This forecast reflects a comp increase of between 2% and 4%, including the updated guidance for February comps of up high-single digits. We expect a spread of about two to three percentage points between total sales growth and comps, driven by sales growth from new stores in Canada and Mast. 
We are projecting first quarter gross margin and SG&A rates that are roughly flat to last year. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to last year. For the full year, we are projecting low single-digit positive comps and a spread between comps in total sales of roughly three percentage points, driven by growth in Mast and International. 
With respect to increases in sourcing costs, we want to communicate five points. First, we make our money on the sell side. We create value for our customers through the emotional content of our brands and merchandise, which enables us to price independent of cost and to earn premium margins. We think this aspect of our business differentiates us from many others in the retail industry. Second, the combination of inventory discipline and our efforts to get faster in the execution of our business has enabled us to improve merchandise margin over the last several years, and we do believe that there is additional opportunity. Third, we have a very significant sourcing capability in the Mast Global organization with a lot of experience literally on the ground in key regions. We have longstanding relationships with our sourcing partners, as well as a geographically-diverse vendor base, and we think that these capabilities and relationships also differentiate us. Fourth, about 40% of our retail sales come from personal care and beauty, shower gels, body lotions, fragrance. These products do not contain cotton, and substantially all of this product is made in the United States. 
With all that said, we do expect to see some pressure from increased cost weighted principally to the back half of the year. It is not practical to predict how much of that can be offset through more full-priced selling. Therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be principally offset by buying and occupancy leverage, so our forecast is for our 2011 gross margin rate to be about flat to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage on total sales growth. Nonoperating expenses are projected roughly flat to last year at about $47 million per quarter, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%, and weighted average shares will approximate 333 million. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.15 and $2.35 per share. We are projecting 2011 capital spending of about $400 million. As detailed on Page 7 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 30 to 35 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 45 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $600 million to $650 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Victoria's Secret earned record Q4 and full year profit in fiscal 2010. We are very pleased with this result and are confident that the keys to our success are the priorities we've been discussing all year, so let's talk about those.
The first is our focus on our core categories, bras and panties, coupled with a much higher emphasis on getting faster and more agile. Second, is our continued purposeful balance between managing business with optimism and conservative management of inventories and expenses. And third is bringing all our work together in a well-told brand story across channel and telling that story through innovative products, steady newness with the right fashion and outstanding in-store execution. 
I'll begin my remarks this morning with review of fourth quarter performance at both Victoria's Secret channel, followed by a brief recap of the full year and will then turn to a discussion of how we are thinking about the business as we head into the first quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter results are detailed on Page 8 of the presentation. In the Victoria's Secret stores channel, fourth quarter comps were up 15% with total sales increasing 16% to $1.39 billion. This result was driven by strength across the assortment as customers continue to respond favorably to our new, fresh and fashion-right [ph] offerings. We remained agile on inventory, chasing into winners and placing strategic bets in a controlled manner. Our Lingerie business demonstrated balanced growth in Q4 with bras, panties and sleepwear all performing well. The quarter began with a relaunch of the Miraculous bra. We didn't focus on gifting for the holiday-selling season. All three of our businesses were much less promotional than both last year and the mall in general. 
Pink has outstanding performance. We continue to see growth in bras and loungewear. In Beauty, customers continue to love the Bombshell fragrance introduced last quarter, as well as new fourth quarter offerings, including seasonal fragrance programs and expanded gift sets. A key contributor to our top line performance has been our in-store execution. And we, again, achieved record customer conversion for the quarter, something we've done every quarter this year. 
Q4 merchandise margin rates were up versus last year. As I mentioned, we continue to accomplish these results while being less promotional than last year and with lower inventory levels related to sales. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate increased significantly versus last year, and our operating profit was up nearly 25%. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $504 million, driven by strength in bras, Pink, swim and dresses. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate as the strength of the assortment and our conservative inventory position enabled us to drive more business at regular price. Additionally, both SG&A and buying and occupancy expenses leveraged, so operating income dollars increased more than 30%, and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Turning to our full year results on Page 9. Victoria's Secret comps increased 14% with total sales increasing 15% to $4 billion. Merchandise gross and operating margins all increased significantly versus last year, and operating income was up nearly 16%. At Victoria's Secret Direct, sales increased 8% to $1.5 billion. Merchandise gross and operating margins also increased significantly versus last year, and operating income was up over 40%. 
We believe the frequent innovation we delivered throughout 2010 drove results. We remain focused on the core and the fundamental. We state balance in our approach, and we told our brand story through fresh products. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we will continue to do more of what works. We will offer customers newness and innovation and plan the business conservatively. We feel very good about our inventory position and are managing our expenses prudently, investing when we believe we can improve our customer connections and our profitability. 
With respect to our view of product cost, our priorities in sourcing are getting faster and increasing quality and innovation. As Stuart mentioned, we do expect some pressure from increased costs in 2011 weighted toward the back half of the year. We have a strong emotional connection with our customers, and we will continue to focus on maximizing full price selling. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance and our position, but we see opportunities to do better. We will continue to focus on executing with discipline, simplicity and speed. And of course, staying close to our customer and driving profitable growth will continue to be our top priority.
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Diane."

We were able to deliver growth in sales and operating income versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus our strong performance last year by maintaining focus on our top three categories, which is our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial Soap and Sanitizer business and our Home Fragrance assortment. Performance improved on top of strong results last year in our Signature Collection, driven by the performance of our holiday collection and launches of our new fragrance, Secret Wonderland, the new Island Escape collection and the continued success of fragrances launched throughout the past year. The Anti-Bacterial business continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by growth in our Hand Soap and Sanitizer business, as well as performance in holiday fragrances and new seasonal forms. Our home fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continued to be driven by candles and seasonal fragrances, as well as the introduction of new forms and novelties in our diffuser [ph] category. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by an improvement in our conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. 
So with that backdrop, let me take you to the financial results in the quarter as detailed on Page 10 of the presentation. Bath & Body Works fourth quarter comps were up 6%. Total sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was up 7% or $73 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $330 million, which is up $35 million or 12% from last year and represented a record performance. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 31% in the quarter and up to last year, driven by strong top line sales, improvements in merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses in the fourth quarter. Improvements in our merchandise margin rate continue to be driven by cost reduction. Our in-store promotional activity was comparable to last year in the fourth quarter. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve. 
For fiscal 2010, as presented on Page 11, our operating income was $464 million, which is up $106 million or 29% versus last year and also represented record performance. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 18.4%, which is up 340 basis points to last year. The operating income performance was driven by comps of about 5%, improvements in merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses. The Bath & Body Works direct channel delivered strong sales and operating income growth, and we continue to view the direct channel as both a revenue generator and a marketing vehicle for our brand. 
So with that in mind, in the first quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both forms and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance, Carried Away, and will transition to the relaunch of our already successful fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom. We are very pleased that our focus in disciplined approach delivered record performance for the year. We're cautiously optimistic about the first quarter and continue to manage expenses and inventories conservatively. Our focus will be to get faster and better in understanding and satisfying our customers' needs, while providing them with a world-class, in-store experience. In addition to our focus on products and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, maintaining flexibility in our inventories to react quickly to our customers' needs.
And with that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martyn."
285544,99887059,106229,"Limited Brands Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Diane, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend some time this morning updating you on our strategy to grow our international businesses.

I'd like to spend some time this morning updating you on our strategy to grow our international businesses. Of course, it goes without saying that we recognize that we have tremendous international growth opportunities for all of our brands, and we are expanding now outside of the United States aggressively. 
We're determined to pursue this growth with discipline, while making sure that we do not overrun our headlights or denigrate the reputation of our brands. We want to ensure that we have both the managerial bandwidth and the sourcing logistics and systems infrastructure in place to support our growth and deliver a superb brand experience to our customers. 
We made significant progress in 2010. We opened 77 new stores internationally. We moved the La Senza business to Columbus, and we launched our first organic franchise partnership. We also just recently hired Mary Mitchell to join Martin Waters’ core leadership team as Chief Administrative Officer. Most recently, Mary led inventory management and strategy for Banana Republic's North American business. Previously, she served as General Manager for Gap's international operations in Europe and Japan, where she delivered business teams in each of these markets and opened the Banana Republic flagship store in London. 
Now, many of you are familiar with our six-point agenda for international business development, which is detailed on Page 12 of the presentation. Now just before I go on, let me just level set for a minute. Please remember that the La Senza and La Senza international businesses, as well as the Victoria's Secret Direct International business roll up under the Victoria's Secret segment for reporting purposes, while the BBW, VS and Pink Canada business, the Travel and Tourism business and our new franchise BBW business are all reported as part of the other segment. 
Our first priority, as you see on the slide, continues to be improve the performance of our La Senza business. La Senza's comps declined 5% in the fourth quarter, as significant growth in our core bra and panty business did not fully offset the decline in the sleepwear business, as we are de-emphasizing this category. Total sales were $121.2 million, and the total sales decline year-over-year was also attributable to our closure of the La Senza Girl business in 2009. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by an increased merchandise margin rate and a decrease in buying and occupancy costs. The improvement in merchandise margin rate was driven by the sales shift to panties and bras and better inventory management. The operating result was approximately breakeven. 
For the full year, La Senza comps were down 1%, and sales were $398.2 million. Gross margin rate increased versus last year, driven by a significant improvement in the merchandise margin rate. Excluding the one-time cost related to the relocation of the business to Columbus, La Senza's 2010 operating result was about breakeven. Now we encouraged by the growth in the bra and panty business and the performance of our remodeled store locations. Conversion is up significantly, however, the business has been and continues to be challenged by significant traffic declines. We are actively working to turn this business around. 
Now in addition to the approximately 250 stores in Canada, there are over 450 La Senza stores in the rest of the world that are operated by our franchise partners. We saw a significant improvement in the performance of these locations in 2010 and believe we will likely add around 50 additional locations in 2011 with existing partners. 
Now turning to our second priority, which is our new businesses in Canada. We ended the year with 59 Bath & Body Works stores, four Victoria's Secret stores and eight Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. As Stuart mentioned, we delivered $165 million in retail sales from these new businesses in 2010. Our Bath & Body Works stores continue to perform well above our U.S. average store volumes, and the response to the Victoria's Secret stores has been phenomenal. 
In 2011, we plan to open about 10 additional BBW stores, about eight additional Victoria's Secret stores and one or two additional Pink stores. We expect that these new stores, along with full year sales related to the 2010 store openings will contribute over $100 million in incremental retail sales in 2011 with four-wall profitability that is consistent with our U.S. stores. 
Now looking at our third priority, we ended the year with 18 stores operating under the Victoria's Secret Travel and Tourism model, which are principally in international airport locations. These are small Victoria's Secret stores focused on beauty and Victoria's Secret branded accessories. The stores are approximately 1,000 square feet in size and are operated by partners under either a wholesale or a franchise model. These stores continue to deliver strong early results with retail sales averaging around $1.5 million per store. In 2011, we plan to open another 40 to 50 stores in the T&T format. 
And against our fourth priority, we opened our first six BBW stores in the Middle East under our franchise agreement with Alshaya. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores and could open around 20 more stores this year. In addition, as you know, we plan to open the previously announced Victoria's Secret flagship location on New Bond Street in London in mid-2012. 
And finally, our Direct business continues to gain strength internationally with over $150 million in sales to over 200 countries in 2010. So in summary, we're building on our existing base of profitable sales outside of the United States. With our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we're seeing in our other initiatives, we believe we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally. 
And before we take your questions, I want to reiterate that we're very pleased with our progress that we've made in 2010 and our record-setting financial performance. This performance was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation to getting faster and more agile in everything that we do, and of course, staying close to our customers. We will maintain this disciplined and focused approach in 2011, and we clearly see opportunities to continue to get even better.
Thanks, and now I'll turn it back over to Amie."

We're actually converting that more to a traditional royalty-based franchise model, and those agreements are more consistent across the world. The only other franchise arrangement we have today is the BBW franchise arrangements with Alshaya in the Middle East, and that is a royalty-based franchise model. You're right to say that demand for our brands across the globe is significant, and it's across the globe. The choices that we're making as to where to go, when to go and who to go with remain guided by some of the things I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is we're being very careful, very planful, very purposeful about making sure that we take steps carefully into this new world of international franchising, for instance.

There's a lot of things we're putting on the plan for 2011. And frankly, one of the trades that we've made in looking at resources, time, priorities is to continue the expansion of BBW in Canada but not exactly at the same pace. That has nothing to do with our performance or our concerns about our ability to expand in Canada over time, just simply a resources and priority decision. The other thing to note is we've increased our emphasis on expansion of the Victoria's Secret stores, and relatively speaking, in terms of square footage for instance because the Victoria's Secret stores are much bigger, the actual overall expansion of square footage in Canada in '11 will be very similar to '10, but it'll be the combination of VS and BBW."

So we did recognize a meaningful amount of additional expense related to stock compensation because, frankly, we just had a lot less turnover in our business, which we view by the way as a good thing. So we've had a lot of stability in leadership and management, and the effect of that is that our forfeiture rates on stock comp were down a lot. And between Q3 and Q4, for different groups and based on additional analysis, we trued that up, and the effect during the quarter was significant. In addition, I mentioned the write-off of a trade name, which was also significant, which is why we called it out. And when you isolate or pull those two things out, the flow-through, the profit flow through from sales in Q4 was about 40%, which is kind of an ongoing benchmark in my mind. Obviously, over the last several years, our profit flow-through from sales has been higher than that. But when you account for those two things I described, the flow-through about  40%, and again, I think that's really the delta on expenses and some views that folks may have had on operating income. With respect to going forward, our mindset is we've been consistent about this, and hopefully you see it in our numbers. We intend very clearly to grow expenses slower than sales. And we did that in 2010. We expect to do that in 2011. There is a little bit of increase and de-leverage Q1 in SG&A, driven by some additional investment in marketing, but that “de-leverage” in marketing and SG&A is not that significant at the end of the day. So the key message is that we will continue to be disciplined on it and grow expenses slower than sales."

But as we’ve described today, the business was basically flat year-over-year in comps, and it's a breakeven business for us still today. In terms of prospects for the future, our goal and clear plan is to produce this kind of OI profitability, margin rate, if you will, from the La Senza Canada business, company-owned retail business that we would produce for our U.S. brands. It's, obviously, not there today, and that is the plan. How much progress we'll make in 2011 I really am not prepared to describe because it is, as I said, a work in progress. The other businesses, we've also described in more detail today in terms of how they're making contribution to the overall international results. And the last thing I would want to mention is, I think, in terms of the overall international business model, in addition to the company-owned retail business that we have in Canada with La Senza, Pink, VS, BBW, these other businesses that we're building, which is the franchise businesses and the Travel and Tourism businesses are a different business model. That's why I keep calling them businesses. It's not one business outside the United States. And for the T&T, what we call T&T, Travel and Tourism, and for the franchise businesses, it's important to remember that for those businesses, we'll be recognizing revenues that are based on a mix of wholesale, sales, royalty income and sourcing sales to those partnered businesses and that on those recognized revenues, we expect the profit contribution from those businesses that are growing at a very fast pace to be highly accretive to our overall operating income margin. Hopefully, it's helpful to you in terms of understanding how to think about that business. The last thing I'd say about international is, obviously as I’ve described, we're investing in people and new store opening costs and systems to support our growth, which is also constraining short-term profitability, obviously. In terms of the international Victoria's Secret Direct business, it is, and I want to repeat, it is the sixth priority of our six agenda items. And therefore, we're not putting as much time and effort against that opportunity as we are the first five. That said, we remain convinced that there’s a substantial opportunity there, and we're building additional systems and capabilities around that to improve the customer experience when the customer is ordering from us for international, from an international location, improve the shipping and handling experience and also improve the language experience. For instance, we have a Spanish-language site up, and we would look at doing additional languages when and if our retail operations are expanded into different geographies where that would be very helpful to our customers, so optimistic but not our top priority."

So we're always looking for ways to drive price up or to drive more units and more basket. So where we have broadened units and we marked prices up, we've actually seen absolutely no resistance to that. So we'll continue to test those different strategies throughout the spring season to help us better inform fall and holiday of next year. And as far as -- I’ll just hit the other two questions you had for me, as far new product pipeline for spring, we're about double last year. And it's really due to the fact that, like I mentioned in the earlier answer, is that our business is being driven much more seasonally than it ever was in the past. So we have an opportunity for more seasonally relevant fragrance launches across all three of our businesses this spring that we didn't have last spring or as much last spring. And as far as costs being driven down, it really is a multiple of things, when you realize you have an opportunity and it goes from 10,000 units to 1 million units, there’s a cost advantage for that. And that has really helped drive a lot of our cost decreases over the last couple of years."

We're pleased with our record first quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 60% to $0.40 per share versus $0.25 last year. Our reported results was $0.50 per share versus $0.34 last year. Bo",1125,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our record first quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 60% to $0.40 per share versus $0.25 last year. Our reported results was $0.50 per share versus $0.34 last year. Both this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. This year's reported first quarter results include the following: A pretax gain from the sale from Express shares of $86.4 million or $0.17 per share. A pretax non-cash expense of $50 million or $0.10 per share related to the multiyear funding of our charitable foundation. We plan to fund this commitment by contributing about 1/3 of our remaining investment in Express shares, which allows us to meet our commitment in a tax efficient manner. After this contribution, we will continue to own approximately 5 million shares of Express stock. Also excluded is an income tax benefit of $11 million or $0.03 per share related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters. 
The 2010 reported result includes a pretax gain of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items in both years. Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.40 per share significantly exceeded our beginning of the quarter expectations of between $0.26 and $0.31 per share. This upside was driven by the 15% comp increase versus our initial forecast of about 2% to 4%. 
To take you through the first quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales were $2.217 billion versus $1.932 billion last year and comps increased 15%. The gross margin rate increased 200 basis points to 38%, primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate increased slightly despite a negative impact of about 80 basis points related to the increase in MAST sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at 100% this year versus 75% last year. This accounting change, which occurs-ed in the third quarter of 2010 will continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated merchandise margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A dollars increased by $65.6 million or 13% and the SG&A rate improved by 40 basis points. Total expenses, including buying and occupancy, increased by 10%. Three quarters of our SG&A expense growth relate to investments that we made in store selling and marketing to support and drive sales growth. 
Store selling cost increased by 12% and leverage as a percent of sales. Marketing cost increased by about 20% and deleverage slightly as we invested in the quarter in initiatives to drive sales, including media and in-store visual merchandising and marketing. The remaining increase in SG&A relates to growth in our home office expense across various categories, including investments related to our International business, merit increases and incentive compensation. 
Turning to our operating income on Page 5. Total operating income increased by $81.8 million or 44% and 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $266.8 million or 12% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $72.4 million or 340 basis points as a percent of sales to $239.7 million or 16.6% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $16.5 million or 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $54.2 million or 11.3% of sales. And the other segment operating loss increased by $7 million to $21.7 million driven primarily by an increase in a certain $27.1 million driven primarily by an increase in certain legal reserves. Total nonoperating expenses increased by $7.8 million as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was partially offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 5% versus last year and down 20% on a 2-year basis. Excluding an increase in the first quarter of 2009 related to the full quarter of inventories associated with Victoria's Secret systems implementation, inventory per square foot has decreased for 16 consecutive quarters. As you know, we issued 1 billion of tender notes during the first quarter at an interest rate of 6 5/8%. We repurchased 16.7 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $590 million, and we also just announced a new 500 million share repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 7 of our presentation for our forecast for 2011. We expect earnings per share between $0.38 and $0.43 in the second quarter. This forecast reflects a low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate to increase and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to up slightly to last year. 
For the full year, we are projecting low- to mid-single-digit positive comps. We continue to expect some impact from increasing cost pressures this fall, and therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be more than offset by buying and occupancy leverage, so our forecast for our 2011 gross margin rate to be up slightly to last year. 
We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage slightly on total sales growth. Nonoperating expenses are projected at about $65 million per quarter consisting principally of interest -- of interest expense. This forecast is about $17 million higher than our previous guidance driven by the new notes. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 318 million in the second quarter and the full year, which resumes that we will complete the share repurchase program near the end of the year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year of 2011 to be between $2.25 and $2.45 per share. We are now projecting 2011 CapEx of about $400 million to $425 million. As detailed on Page 8 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 50 stores. We'll enter the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $650 million, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility resulted in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Victoria's Secret funds record operating profit in the first quarter. We are pleased with this result, and I will begin my comments this morning by discussing what we believe have been the key driver of our success. I'll follow this with review of first quarter financial results and will then briefly discuss how we are thinking about the second quarter. 
So let's begin with what we have been doing to deliver our results. We continue to stay very focused on our core categories, bras and panties, coupled with a culture that emphasizes giving faster and more agile every day. We remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and staying conservative on our inventory and expense plans, and we are carefully bringing all of our work together and a well-told brand story across channel. We are telling that story through innovative products, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. 
Our customer connection has been critical to our success. We work everyday to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. An example of our connectivity and our brand strength is our Facebook presence. We are the top specialty retailer. In fact, in March, our Victoria's Secret and Pink pages were the 2 most liked pages of all retailers, something we're very proud. 
Finally, at the very core of our success, are the people who make it happen each and everyday. We have a seasoned and dedicated leadership team across all of our key function. Our leaders have been in place and working together now for a number of years, and I feel very good about our talent from design to merchandising stores, operations, marketing and, really, across the business, both in the home office and in the field. 
Now turning to our financial performance. Our first quarter results are detailed on Page 9 of your presentation material. In the Victoria's Secret stores channel, first quarter comp and total sales were up 19% versus last year, with total sales increasing to $986.6 million. This result was driven by strength across the assortment with fewer in-store promotion and on inventory levels that were significantly below our sales growth. Our Lingerie business demonstrate balanced growth in bras and panties and sleepwear all performing well. We had a success Valentine's Day weekend and offered customers newness throughout the quarter. This included new styles and fashion in many areas of the business, including the Incredible, Gorgeous and Dream Angels bra collection, as well as our innovative Incredible panties and Miraculous swimwear. Pink delivered another very strong performance with growth across the assortment both by base business and strong customers' response to Pink's ongoing newness. We introduced a number of new Pink bras in Q1, and we are pleased with the progress and opportunities we see in this category. 
Our Beauty business also performed well in the first quarter. Customers loved our fragrance and other new product introductions, and we continue to improve the Beauty business integration and coordination with the balance of the store. We began this last fall with the co-launch of Beauty and Lingerie products to the Bombshell bra and fragrance launches and continued this in the first quarter with Incredible and a Dream Angels launches. 
As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been a key contributor to our sales growth, and we again achieved record customer conversion for the quarter. First quarter merchandise margin dollars were up significantly on roughly flat margin rate. Additionally, first quarter growth and operating margins both improved significantly, and combined with our top line, drove our operating profit nearly 50% versus last year. 
Now, let's review Direct performance. First quarter sales increased 5% to $369 million. The top line was driven by strength in bras, Pink, swim and dresses, but that strength was partially offset by stoutness in other parts of the Apparel business. Sales growth was also negatively affected by a very intentional strategy to reduce the number of days we were on promotion and to carry far less clearance inventory into the season. 
The gross margin rate increased significantly driven by the strategy to reduce promotional and clearance selling, as well as the strength in the assortment, enabling us to drive significantly more business at regular price. Additionally, total expense leverage to operating income dollars increased nearly 25%, and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue to do more of what works. We will focus on providing customers fresh, innovative products with high-emotional content. We will stay balanced in our approach, executing with discipline, simplicity and speed. And we will be thoughtful in our inventory and expense plan, investing in customer impacting initiative to drive sustained results. In closing, we are pleased with our performance and see opportunities for improvement. Above all else, we will stay close to our customer and work to drive, sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Diane."

As I'm sure most of you have already heard by now, since we made the announcement on Tuesday, that I decide to return to San Francisco, which would require me to leave my role as CEO of Bath & Body Works. As you can all imagine, this has been a very difficult decision, as I have an amazing team, we have great momentum in the business, and we've accomplished so much over the last 4 years. However, my personal life has been on the West Coast and offer to create more balance, I decided to relocate. The good news is that I will be transitioning to advisory role to help on-board Nick Ko [ph] who was formerly President at Land's End, who will be joining us in early July. 
For those of you who haven't met Nick yet, let me assure that the brand will be in very capable hands. Nick has an incredible track record of merchant and he is as customer-centric as we are at Bath & Body Works. I am convinced that the brand will continue to deliver incredible results under his leadership. 
So let me discuss Bath & Body Works results for the first quarter. We were able to deliver significant sales and operating income growth versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on our 3 key categories, which are Signature Collection product line, the Soap and Sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. 
Performance improved on top of strong results last year and Signature Collection driven by the launches of new fragrances that Carried Away and Country Chic, as well as the relaunch of our already very successful fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom. The Anti business, driven by our Hand Soap and Sanitizer business. Performance in those businesses was driven by increasing fragrance and fashion newness and bath and soap collection. 
Our Home Fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candles and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in new forms and novelties in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year driven by traffic and improvement in our conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. So with that backdrop, let me take you to the financial results for the quarter. [indiscernible]  At the presentation, Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 11%. Total sales for the quarter were $480 million, up 11% or $49 million versus last year. First quarter, our operating income was $54 million, which was up $16 million or 44% from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 11% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by the positive comps, modest improvement in merchandise margin rate and expense leverage, both buying occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter. 
We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year, and we continue to drive inventory down year-over-year while the in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel also delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. In the second quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance Into The Wild, and we'll also launch a new collection of coconut-inspired fragrances. The Anti-Bac and Home Fragrance businesses will also introduce of fashion and newness in fragrances and in form. 
We're cautiously optimistic about the second quarter, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventories conservatively. Our focus will continue to be faster and better in understanding and satisfying our customers' needs while providing them with a world-class, in-store experience. In addition to focusing on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies while maintaining flexibility and our inventories to react quickly to our customers needs. 
Earlier I mentioned that the brand will be in good hands with Nick, but I should also say that the brand will be in that fantastic hands now with Nick and entire senior leadership team that Andrew Maslow [indiscernible] and the entire BBW team. So with that, I'm going to turn the discussion over to Martin."

On our last earnings call, I spent quite a bit of time to updating you on our strategy to grow international businesses. The summary of what we covered on the call is that we recognize that we have tremendous international growth opportunities for all of our brands as we expand outside the United States. We remain on track in the execution of our international strategy and continue to be very pleased with the performance of all of our new international stores. 
As you can see on Page 11 of the presentation, we, along with our partners, will open approximately 100 to 135 new stores this year. In the first quarter, our partners opened 7 new international La Senza locations is and one Travel and Tourism store, which by the way, we're now calling the Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores, a change in name that clarifies, I think, the brand positioning of that concept. 
By just after the close of the quarter, we opened 2 more Victoria's Secret stores in Canada and the customer response to all of these new stores has been terrific. And before we take your questions, I'll close my comments by discussing La Senza's first quarter performance. Total sales increased 3% to $88.3 million in the first quarter. This was driven by foreign currency translation and a mid-single-digit increase in reported revenue in the International businesses, which was partially offset by a 4% comp in the Canadian stores. Our broad categories delivered modest growth, led by the launch of our Body and the continued success of our Hello Sugar and [indiscernible] styles. The gross margin rate declined driven by a significant decline in merchandise margin rate. 
Increase in the merchandise margin rate was driven by a mix shift to the International business, which has a lower margin rate, and also by a decline in Canadian stores, and that was driven higher foreign currency and increased promotional activity. The operating loss improved slightly on a dollar basis and significantly on a rate basis. 
We're encouraged in the Bra business and continue to be focused on refining our assortment and establishing a strong brand that resonates with our target customers. However, it is clear our La Senza business remains a work in progress. 
So in closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to be pleased with the company's overall performance, which was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile and also staying close to our customers. We'll maintain this discipline and focused approach, and we clearly see opportunities to continue to get even better. Thanks, and I'll now turn it back over to Amie for questions."

I don't know how many of you have heard the expression, you don't take great comps to the bank, you take dollars home to do the bank. So there's a lot of things that we think about. The first is just to reiterate quickly, operating profit dollars in the quarter were up 40%. The margin rate, operating margin rate improved by 250 basis points to 12%. And clearly, as we look at expenses, while the geography in our P&L kind of highlights SG&A, there's a lot of home office and other important expenses within gross margin in the buying and occupancy line, and those expenses in aggregate grew about 10%, which was about 500 basis points lower than sales. So we are making investments to drive growth, sales growth and longer-term growth. We think on an overall basis, those investments are paying off. But to your point, the leverage might not be as great as one might cancel out on paper, but the investments we're making are absolutely contributing meaningfully to the topline growth and the dollar profitability of the business. With all that's said, we continue to look at everything very closely and within the brands, within the overall corporation, we continue to look and how we do it.

But with that said, as we've communicated before and it's still our view and have reiterate at it again in our prepared comments, there is some cost pressure in the business. It'll be more weighted to the back half of the year, and we're going to work hard to offset as much of it as we can.

With respect to inventories, similar in mindset to expenses, which is, as you know, it is a critical area for us.

All of that is a work in progress and only 9 months old. So knowing the track record we have for building brands, I would suggest we would need to be patient and stay the course. The other thing I'd say about Canada is if you tracked any of the competitive results in Canada, the Canadian retail market is actually quite challenging right now.

Our international expansion there is paced at a rate that will not distract us from that first report primary mission. With the VS brand, we believe is a very complicated brand to deliver to the rest of the world because of the complex nature of the brand, the multi-sub-brand categories, the big box positioning, et cetera. The La Senza brand, the BBW brands are easier and less complicated, and that's the reason we've been focused on those brands principally in the early days. We're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in Canada, not just the customer sales and profitability results but also the operating results. Now we've demonstrated that and we are able to operate big box with Victoria's Secret store outside the United States. Our next step in that dance will be the London store, and that will help us to demonstrate our ability operationally to do that across the ocean and do that well.

And I think I can represent Les is very pleased with the progress that we're making in that kind of a transformation similar to other transformations that I've seen taken from our other brands do over the past 2 decades. The repositioning of the brand imagery, if you've seen the stores in Toronto, John, is working, and we're pleased with that brand positioning. But that's new, and it's not fully distributed throughout Canada yet. So that needs to be fully distributed and proven to be a good brand positioning in terms of store design and imagery and, et cetera. So all works in progress, and we're pleased with the progress were making. It's not yet producing the financial results, as Stuart said, that we would want to and we'll be targeting to produce. In terms of the International business, that is also going through the same kind of transformation. The number of our international franchisees are adopting the new standards, the new store design and positioning and see great success from that. And relatively speaking, I would say the International Franchise business has been performing well than the Canadian business because it's a less competitive market that they're in many of the cases. So are pleased with the progress working closely with a number of our key international franchisees to convert that into this new model, this new brand model."

Where we do not, we will be then expanding and opening up freestanding Pink stores.

Our reported results was $0.50 per share versus $0.34 last year. Bo",1124,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our record first quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 60% to $0.40 per share versus $0.25 last year. Our reported results was $0.50 per share versus $0.34 last year. Both this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. This year's reported first quarter results include the following: A pretax gain from the sale of Express shares of $86.4 million or $0.17 per share. A pretax non-cash expense of $50 million or $0.10 per share related to the multiyear funding of our charitable foundation. We plan to fund this commitment by contributing about 1/3 of our remaining investment in Express shares, which allows us to meet our commitment in a tax efficient manner. 
After this contribution, we will continue to own approximately 5 million shares of Express stock. Also excluded is an income tax benefit of $11 million or $0.03 per share related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters. 
The 2010 reported result includes a pretax gain of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items in both years. Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.40 per share significantly exceeded our beginning of the quarter expectations of between $0.26 and $0.31 per share. This upside was driven by the 15% comp increase versus our initial forecast of about 2% to 4%. 
To take you through the first quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales were $2.217 billion versus $1.932 billion last year and comps increased 15%. The gross margin rate increased 200 basis points to 38%, primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate increased slightly, despite a negative impact of about 80 basis points related to the increase in MAST sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at 100% this year versus 75% last year. This accounting change, which occurred in the third quarter of 2010 will continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated merchandise margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A dollars increased by $65.6 million or 13% and the SG&A rate improved by 40 basis points. Total expenses, including buying and occupancy, increased by 10%. 3/4 of our SG&A expense growth relate to investments that we made in store selling and marketing to support and drive sales growth. 
Store selling cost increased by 12% and leverage as a percent of sales. Marketing cost increased by about 20% and deleverage slightly as we invested in the quarter in initiatives to drive sales, including media and in-store visual merchandising and marketing. The remaining increase in SG&A relates to growth in our home office expense across various categories, including investments related to our International business, merit increases and incentive compensation. 
Turning to our operating income on Page 5. Total operating income increased by $81.8 million or 44% and 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $266.8 million or 12% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $72.4 million or 340 basis points as a percent of sales to $239.7 million or 16.6% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $16.5 million or 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $54.2 million or 11.3% of sales. And the other segment operating loss increased by $7 million to $21.7 million driven primarily by an increase in certain -- $27.1 million driven primarily by an increase in certain legal reserves. Total non-operating expenses increased by $7.8 million as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was partially offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 5% versus last year and down 20% on a 2-year basis. Excluding an increase in the first quarter of 2009 related to the full quarter of inventories associated with Victoria's Secret systems implementation, inventory per square foot has decreased for 16 consecutive quarters. As you know, we issued 1 billion of 10-year notes during the first quarter at an interest rate of 6 5/8%. We repurchased 16.7 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $590 million, and we also just announced a new 500 million share repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 7 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011. We expect earnings per share between $0.38 and $0.43 in the second quarter. This forecast reflects a low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate to increase and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to up slightly to last year. 
For the full year, we are projecting low- to mid-single-digit positive comps. We continue to expect some impact from increasing cost pressures this fall, and therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be more than offset by buying and occupancy leverage, so our forecast is for our 2011 gross margin rate to be up slightly to last year. 
We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage slightly on total sales growth. Non-operating expenses are projected at about $65 million per quarter, consisting principally of interest -- of interest expense. This forecast is about $17 million higher than our previous guidance driven by the new notes. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 318 million in the second quarter and the full year, which assumes that we will complete the share repurchase program near the end of the year. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.25 and $2.45 per share. We are now projecting 2011 CapEx of about $400 million to $425 million. As detailed on Page 8 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 50 stores. We'll enter the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $650 million, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility resulted in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Victoria's Secret earns record operating profit in the first quarter. We are pleased with this result, and I will begin my comments this morning by discussing what we believe have been the key drivers of our success. I'll follow this with the review of first quarter financial results and will then briefly discuss how we are thinking about the second quarter. 
So let's begin with what we have been doing to deliver our results. We continue to stay very focused on our core categories, Bras and Panties, coupled with a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile every day. We remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and staying conservative on our inventory and expense plans, and we are carefully bringing all of our work together in a well-told brand story across channel. We are telling that story through innovative products, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. 
Our customer connection has been critical to our success. We work everyday to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. An example of our connectivity and our brand strength is our Facebook presence. We are the top specialty retailer. In fact, in March, our Victoria's Secret and Pink pages were the 2 most liked pages of all retailers, something we're very proud of. 
Finally, at the very core of our success, are the people who make it happen each and everyday. We have a seasoned and dedicated leadership team across all of our key function. Our leaders have been in place and working together now for a number of years, and I feel very good about our talent from design to merchandising, stores, operations, marketing and really, across the business, both in the home office and in the field. 
Now turning to our financial performance. Our first quarter results are detailed on Page 9 of your presentation material. In the Victoria's Secret stores channel, first quarter comp and total sales were up 19% versus last year, with total sales increasing to $986.6 million. This result was driven by strength across the assortment with fewer in-store promotion and on inventory levels that were significantly below our sales growth. Our Lingerie business demonstrate balanced growth in Bras and Panties and Sleepwear all performing well. We had a success Valentine's Day weekend and offered customers newness throughout the quarter. This included new styles and fashion in many areas of the business, including the Incredible, Gorgeous and Dream Angels bra collection, as well as our innovative Incredible panties and Miraculous swimwear. 
Pink delivered another very strong performance with growth across the assortment driven by both base business and strong customers' response to Pink's ongoing newness. We introduced a number of new Pink bras in Q1, and we are pleased with the progress and opportunities we see in this category. 
Our Beauty business also performed well in the first quarter. Customers loved our fragrance and other new product introductions, and we continue to improve the Beauty business integration and coordination with the balance of the store. We began this last fall with the co-launch of Beauty and Lingerie products to the Bombshell bra and fragrance launches and continued this in the first quarter with Incredible and a Dream Angels launches. 
As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been a key contributor to our sales growth, and we again achieved record customer conversion for the quarter. First quarter merchandise margin dollars were up significantly on roughly flat margin rate. Additionally, first quarter growth and operating margins both improved significantly, and combined with our top line, drove our operating profit up nearly 50% versus last year. 
Now let's review Direct's performance. First quarter sales increased 5% to $369 million. The top line was driven by strength in Bras, Pink, Swim and Dresses, but that strength was partially offset by softness in other parts of the Apparel business. Sales growth was also negatively affected by a very intentional strategy to reduce the number of days we were on promotion and to carry far less clearance inventory into the season. 
The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by the strategy to reduce promotional and clearance selling, as well as the strength in the assortment, enabling us to drive significantly more business at regular price. Additionally, total expense leveraged so operating income dollars increased nearly 25%, and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue to do more of what works. We will focus on providing customers fresh, innovative products with high-emotional content. We will stay balanced in our approach, executing with discipline, simplicity and speed. And we will be thoughtful in our inventory and expense plan, investing in customer-impacting initiative to drive sustained results. In closing, we are pleased with our performance and see opportunities for improvement. Above all else, we will stay close to our customer and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Diane."

As I'm sure most of you have already heard by now, since we made the announcement on Tuesday, that I decide to return to San Francisco, which would require me to leave my role as CEO of Bath & Body Works. As you can all imagine, this has been a very difficult decision, as I have an amazing team, we have great momentum in the business, and we've accomplished so much over the last 4 years. However, my personal life has been on the West Coast, in an effort to create more balance, I decided to relocate. The good news is that I will be transitioning to advisory role to help on-board Nick Coe, who was formerly President at Land's End, who will be joining us in early July. 
For those of you who haven't met Nick yet, let me assure that the brand will be in very capable hands. Nick has an incredible track record as a merchant and is as customer-centric as we are at Bath & Body Works. I am convinced that the brand will continue to deliver incredible results under his leadership. 
So let me discuss Bath & Body Works results for the first quarter. We were able to deliver significant sales and operating income growth versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on our 3 key categories, which are the Signature Collection product line, the Anti-bac Soap and Sanitizer business and our Home Fragrance assortment. 
Performance improved on top of strong results last year in Signature Collection driven by the launches of new fragrances like Carried Away and Country Chic, as well as the relaunch of our already very successful fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom. The Anti-bac business, driven by our Hand Soap and Sanitizer business. Performance in those businesses was driven by increasing fragrance and fashion newness in PocketBac and soap collection. 
Our Home Fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candles and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in new forms and novelties in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year driven by traffic and improvement in our conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. So with that backdrop, let me take you to the financial results for the quarter. 
Turning to Page 10 of the presentation. Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 11%. Total sales for the quarter were $480 million, up 11% or $49 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $54 million, which was up $16 million or 44% from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 11% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by the positive sales comps, modest improvement in merchandise margin rate and expense leverage, both buying and occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter. 
We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year, and we continue to drive inventory down year-over-year while the in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel also delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. In the second quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance Into The Wild, and we'll also launch a new collection of coconut-inspired fragrances. The Anti-Bac and Home Fragrance businesses will also introduce fashion and newness in fragrances and in form. 
We're cautiously optimistic about the second quarter, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. Our focus continues to be getting faster and better in understanding and satisfying our customers' needs while providing them with the world-class, in-store experience. In addition to focusing on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customers needs. 
Earlier I mentioned that the brand will be in good hands with Nick, but I should also say the brand will be in fantastic hands not only with Nick but with the entire senior leadership team. That's Andrew Maslow, Amy Hauk, Ken Montera, Camille McDonald, Tom Ramsey and the entire BBW team. So with that, I'm going to turn the discussion over to Martyn.."

On our last earnings call, I spent quite a bit of time updating you on our strategy to grow our International businesses. The summary of what we covered on the call is that we recognize that we have tremendous international growth opportunities for all the brands as we expand outside the United States. We remain on track in the execution of our international strategy and continue to be very pleased with the performance of all of our new international stores. 
As you can see on Page 11 of the presentation, we, along with our partners, will open approximately 100 to 135 new stores this year. In the first quarter, our partners opened 7 new La Senza international locations and one Travel and Tourism store, which by the way, we're now calling the Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores, a change in name that clarifies, I think, the brand positioning of that concept. 
At just after the close of the quarter, we opened 2 more Victoria's Secret stores in Canada and the customer response to all of these new stores has been terrific. 
And before we take your questions, I'll close my comments by discussing La Senza's first quarter performance. Total sales increased 3% to $88.3 million in the first quarter. This was driven by foreign currency translation and a mid-single-digit increase in reported revenue in the International businesses, which was partially offset by a 4% comp [indiscernible] in the Canadian stores. Our broad category delivered modest growth, led by the launch of our Body Kiss bra and the continued success of our Hello Sugar and Perfectly Me styles. The gross margin rate declined, driven by a significant decline in the merchandise margin rate. 
Increase in the merchandise margin rate was driven by a mix shift to the International business, which has a lower margin rate, and also by a decline in the merchandise margin rate in the Canadian stores, and that was driven by foreign currency and increased promotional activity. The operating loss improved slightly on a dollar basis and significantly on a rate basis. 
We're encouraged by the growth in the Bra business and continue to be focused on refining our assortment and establishing a strong brand that resonates with our target customers. However, it is clear that our La Senza business remains a work in progress. 
So in closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to be pleased with the company's overall performance, which was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile and also staying close to our customers. We'll maintain this discipline and focused approach, and we clearly see opportunities to continue to get even better. Thanks, and I'll now turn it back over to Amie for questions."

I wanted to ask Stuart about the SG&A leverage point? I know that historically you've said typically when you beat your same-store sales growth plans, you're somewhere between 30% and 50% of those incremental dollars flow-through to the operating income line.

I mean, I don't know how many of you have heard the expression, you don't take great home  [ph] to the bank, you take dollars home to the bank. So there's a lot of things that we think about. The first is just to reiterate quickly, operating profit dollars in the quarter were up 40%. The margin rate -- operating margin rate improved by 250 basis points to 12%. And clearly, as we look at expenses, while our -- the geography in our P&L kind of highlights SG&A, there's a lot of home office and other important expenses within gross margin in the buying and occupancy line, and those expenses in aggregate grew about 10%, which was about 500 basis points slower than sales. So we are making investments to drive growth, sales growth and longer-term growth. We think on an overall basis, those investments are paying off. But to your point, the leverage might not be as great as one might cancel out on paper, but the investments we're making are absolutely contributing meaningfully to the top line growth and the dollar profitability of the business. With all that said, we continue to look at everything very closely, within the brands, within the overall corporation, we continue to look at stuff. We can always get better at how we do it.

We're going to invest in those types of things, all of which are in SG&A, where we believe that we're getting paid for that work that customers notice and then it drives growth in sales, and that's what we're doing.

The biggest opportunity that we see at the end of the day is to get fashion right, to manage inventories tightly and with discipline with an appropriate balance of optimism and conservatism to continue to work down markdowns, to reduce markdowns where we can, which are much more substantial opportunity, frankly, than the pressure of cost. But with that said, as we've communicated before and it's still our view and we have reiterated it again in our prepared comments, there is some cost pressure in the business. It'll be more weighted to the back half of the year, and we're going to work hard to offset as much of it as we can. But not -- in summary, to answer your question, not a lot of changes is viewed from how we saw it a few months ago. With respect to inventories, similar in mindset to expenses, which is, as you know, it is a critical area for us. All of us, all the leaders of the business are -- pay very close attention to it, balancing, creating an appropriate experience for customers, along with managing the risk of inventory and working hard to get better at greeting and reacting and chasing. We made good progress on that, but there's more that we can and will do. As I commented on, we think inventory in terms of where it'll end, the second quarter will be flat to up slightly. So it remains a continued area of focus for us and we're managing it very carefully."

The best way for me to answer that is with the things that we've said, very consistent over the past 2 years. #1, we're focused on our core brands in the United States. We have great core brands in United States with a great growth opportunities. Our international expansion therefore is paced at a rate that will not distract us from that first report primary mission. With the VS brand, we believe, is a very complicated brand to deliver to the rest of the world because of the complex nature of the brand, the multi-sub-brand categories, the big box positioning, et cetera. The La Senza brand, the BBW brands are easier and less complicated, and that's the reason we've been focused on those brands principally in the early days. We're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in Canada, not just the customer sales and profitability results but also the operating results, which demonstrated that we are able to operate a big box with Victoria's Secret store outside the United States. Our next step in that dance will be the London store, and that will help us to demonstrate our ability operationally to do that across the ocean and do that well.

I think that when we think about Victoria's Secret and as we're continuing to be agile, we are in the fashion business and continue to flow the newness, how we are testing and reading and reacting to those, there's still opportunity as how fast we can get back in to the big winners. When I think about how we are really focused on with the product meets the customer, that there's always opportunity for improvement, especially when you're looking at 1,000 store chain and also the Direct channel. So we do have an initiative this year, is that really how do we even get closer to the customer, when we think about the inefficiencies in the business. So I think that if we, as a brand and continue to have a vision for growth, we do believe that there's always opportunities to get better and better, and just think about how we do things differently and especially as we think about what's happening in the social media world and just how we utilize our advertising dollars. So it's really a longer conversation, but I think that we have got a lot of great ideas, new initiatives but still focused on our core category to even make Victoria's Secret a better company."

Where we like the progress is the transformation of the brand in terms of becoming core focused on Bras and Panties. Less focused on Sleepwear but continuing to have an important quality assortment around sexy sleepwear. And that transformation, which we also believe is positioning the brand to be younger, fun, flirty, et cetera, is also changing the customer mix. There's a lot of change going on there. And I think I can represent that Les is very pleased with the progress that we're making in that kind of a transformation similar to other transformations that I've seen Les take the other of our brands through over the past 2 decades. The repositioning of the brand imagery, if you've seen the stores in Toronto, John, is working, and we're pleased with that brand positioning. But that's new, and it's not fully distributed throughout Canada yet. So that needs to be fully distributed and proven to be a good brand positioning in terms of store design and imagery and, et cetera. So all works in progress, and we're pleased with the progress we're making. It's not yet producing the financial results, as Stuart said, that we would want and we would be targeting to produce. In terms of the International business, that is also going through the same kind of transformation. The number of our International franchisees are adopting the new standards, the new store design and positioning and see great success from that. And relatively speaking, I would say the International Franchise business has been performing better than the Canadian business because it's a less competitive market that they're in, in many of the cases. So we're pleased with that progress, working closely with a number of our key International franchisees to convert that into this new model, this new brand model."

Still, continuing to have even more opportunity in the Lounge. So we do believe that this is a powerful brand and a well-told story. As we think about our go-forward strategy, as we can appropriately right-size Pink within the Victoria's Secret box, we prefer that as a side-by-side. Where we cannot, we will be then expanding and opening up freestanding Pink stores. And that is to say, we have about 9 freestanding Pink stores, and we probably still see some more in the future where we just can't get enough real estate for the side-by-side concept. So I think there's opportunity and growth in the Bra category and continue with the Apparel category. We have a unique differentiator for us, as in our collegiate licensing apparel program that is so targeted to that market.

Our adjusted earnings per share increased 60% to $0.40 per share versus $0.25 last year. Our reported result was $0.50 per share versus $0.34 last year. Both this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. This year's reported first quarter results include the following:
A pretax gain from the sale of Express shares of $86.4 million or $0.17 per share.
A pretax non-cash expense of $50 million or $0.10 per share related to the multiyear funding of our charitable foundation. We plan to fund this commitment by contributing about 1/3 of our remaining investment in Express shares, which allows us to meet our commitment in a tax efficient manner. After this contribution, we will continue to own approximately 5 million shares of Express stock.
Also excluded is an income tax benefit of $11 million or $0.03 per share related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters. 
The 2010 reported result includes a pretax gain of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items in both years.
Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.40 per share significantly exceeded our ""beginning of the quarter"" expectations of between $0.26 and $0.31 per share. This upside was driven by the 15% comp increase versus our initial forecast of about 2% to 4%. 
To take you through the first quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales were $2.217 billion versus $1.932 billion last year and comps increased 15%. The gross margin rate increased 200 basis points to 38%, primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate increased slightly, despite a negative impact of about 80 basis points related to the increase in Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at 100% this year versus 75% last year. This accounting change, which occurred in the third quarter of 2010, will continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated merchandise margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A dollars increased by $65.6 million or 13% and the SG&A rate improved by 40 basis points. Total expenses, including buying and occupancy, increased by 10%. 3/4 of our SG&A expense growth relates to investments that we made in store selling and marketing to support and drive sales growth. 
Stores selling costs increased by 12% and leveraged as a percent of sales. Marketing costs increased by about 20% and deleveraged slightly as we invested in the quarter in initiatives to drive sales, including media and in-store visual merchandising and marketing. The remaining increase in SG&A relates to growth in our home office expense across various categories, including investments related to our international business, merit increases and incentive compensation. 
Turning to operating income on Page 5. Total operating income increased by $81.8 million or 44% and 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $266.8 million or 12% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $72.4 million or 340 basis points as a percent of sales to $239.7 million or 16.6% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $16.5 million or 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $54.2 million or 11.3% of sales. And the Other segment operating loss increased by $7 million to $21.7 million driven primarily by an increase in certain -- $27.1 million driven primarily by an increase in certain legal reserves. Total non-operating expenses increased by $7.8 million as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was partially offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 5% versus last year and down 20% on a 2-year basis. Excluding an increase in the first quarter of 2009 related to the full quarter of inventories associated with Victoria's Secret systems implementations, inventory per square foot has decreased for 16 consecutive quarters. As you know, we issued $1 billion of 10-year notes during the first quarter at an interest rate of 6 5/8%. We repurchased 16.7 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $590 million, and we also just announced a new, 500-million-share repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 7 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011. We expect earnings per share between $0.38 and $0.43 in the second quarter. This forecast reflects a low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate to increase and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to up slightly to last year. 
For the full year, we are projecting low- to mid-single-digit positive comps. We continue to expect some impact from increasing cost pressures this fall and, therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be more than offset by buying and occupancy leverage, so our forecast is for our 2011 gross margin rate to be up slightly to last year. 
We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage slightly on total sales growth. Non-operating expenses are projected at about $65 million per quarter, consisting principally of expense. This forecast is about $17 million higher than our previous guidance, driven by the new notes. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 318 million in the second quarter and the full year, which assumes that we will complete the share repurchase program near the end of the year. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.25 and $2.45 per share. We are now projecting 2011 CapEx of about $400 million to $425 million.
As detailed on Page 8 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 50 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $650 million, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Victoria's Secret earned record operating profit in the first quarter. We are pleased with this result, and I will begin my comments this morning by discussing what we believe have been the key drivers of our success. I'll follow this with the review of first quarter financial results and will then briefly discuss how we are thinking about the second quarter. 
So let's begin with what we have been doing to deliver our results. We continue to stay very focused on our core categories, bras and panties, coupled with a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile every day. We remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and staying conservative on our inventory and expense plans, and we are carefully bringing all of our work together in a well-told brand story across channels. We are telling that story through innovative products, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. 
Our customer connection has been critical to our success. We work every day to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. An example of our connectivity and our brand strength is our Facebook presence. We are the top specialty retailer. In fact, in March, our Victoria's Secret and Pink pages were the 2 most liked pages of all retailers, something we're very proud of. 
Finally, at the very core of our success are the people who make it happen each and every day. We have a seasoned and dedicated leadership team across all of our key functions. Our leaders have been in place and working together now for a number of years, and I feel very good about our talent from design to merchandising, stores, operations, marketing and really across the business, both in the home office and in the field. 
Now turning to our financial performance. Our first quarter results are detailed on Page 9 of your presentation material. In the Victoria's Secret stores channel, first quarter comp and total sales were up 19% versus last year, with total sales increasing to $986.6 million. This result was driven by strength across the assortment with fewer in-store promotions and on inventory levels that were significantly below our sales growth. Our lingerie business demonstrate balanced growth with bras, panties and sleepwear all performing well. We had a successful Valentine's Day weekend and offered customers newness throughout the quarter. This included new styles and fashion in many areas of the business, including the Incredible, Gorgeous and Dream Angels bra collections, as well as our innovative Incredible panties and Miraculous swimwear. 
Pink delivered another very strong performance with growth across the assortment driven by both base business and strong customer response to Pink's ongoing newness. We introduced a number of new Pink bras in Q1, and we are pleased with the progress and opportunities we see in this category. 
Our beauty business also performed well in the first quarter. Customers loved our fragrance and other new product introductions, and we continue to improve the beauty business integration and coordination with the balance of the store. We began this last fall with the co-launch of beauty and lingerie products through the Bombshell bra and fragrance launches and continued this in the first quarter with the Incredible and Dream Angels launches. 
As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been a key contributor to our sales growth, and we again achieved record customer conversion for the quarter. First quarter merchandise margin dollars were up significantly on roughly flat margin rate. Additionally, first quarter growth and operating margins both improved significantly and, combined with our top line, drove our operating profit up nearly 50% versus last year. 
Now let's review Direct's performance. First quarter sales increased 5% to $369 million. The top line was driven by strength in bras, Pink, swim and dresses, but that strength was partially offset by softness in other parts of the apparel business. Sales growth was also negatively affected by a very intentional strategy to reduce the number of days we were on promotion and to carry far less clearance inventory into the season. 
The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by the strategy to reduce promotional and clearance selling, as well as the strength of these assortments, enabling us to drive significantly more business at regular price. Additionally, total expense leveraged so operating income dollars increased nearly 25%, and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue to do more of what works. We will focus on providing customers fresh, innovative products with high emotional content. We will stay balanced in our approach, executing with discipline, simplicity and speed. And we will be thoughtful in our inventory and expense plan, investing in customer-impacting initiatives that drive sustained results. In closing, we are pleased with our performance but see opportunities for improvement. Above all else, we will stay close to our customer and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Diane."

As you can all imagine, this has been a very difficult decision. I have an amazing team, we have great momentum in the business, and we've accomplished so much over the last 4 years. However, my personal life has been on the West Coast, and in an effort to create more balance, I decided to relocate. The good news is that I will be transitioning to advisory role to help on-board Nick Coe, who was formerly President at Lands' End, who will be joining us in early July. 
For those of you who haven't met Nick yet, let me assure that the brand will be in very capable hands. Nick has an incredible track record as a merchant and is as customer-centric as we are at Bath & Body Works. I am convinced that the brand will continue to deliver incredible results under his leadership. 
So let me discuss Bath & Body Works results for the first quarter. We were able to deliver significant sales and operating income growth versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on our 3 key categories, which are the Signature Collection product line, the anti-bac soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. 
Performance improved on top of strong results last year in Signature Collection driven by the launches of new fragrances like Carried Away and Country Chic, as well as the relaunch of our already very successful fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom. The anti-bac business continued to deliver growth, driven by our hand soap and sanitizer business. Performance in those businesses was driven by increasing fragrance and fashion newness in PocketBac and soap collections. 
Our home fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candles and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in new forms and novelties in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year driven by traffic and improvement in our conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.
Turning to Page 10 of the presentation. Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 11%. Total sales for the quarter were $480 million, up 11% or $49 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $54 million, which was up $16 million or 44% from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 11% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by the positive sales comps, modest improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense leverage. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter. 
We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year, and we continue to drive inventories down year-over-year while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel also delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. In the second quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance, Into The Wild, and we'll also launch a new collection of coconut-inspired fragrances. The anti-bac and home fragrance businesses will also introduce fashion and newness in fragrances and in form. 
We're cautiously optimistic about the second quarter, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. Our focus continues to be getting faster and better in understanding and satisfying our customers' needs while providing them with a world-class, in-store experience. In addition to focusing on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customers' needs. 
Earlier, I mentioned that the brand will be in good hands with Nick, but I should not -- but I should also say the brand will be in fantastic hands not only with Nick but with the entire senior leadership team. That's Andrew Maslow, Amy Hauk, Ken Montera, Camille McDonald, Tom Ramsey and the entire BBW team. So with that, I'm going to turn the discussion over to Martyn."

On our last earnings call, I spent quite a bit of time updating you on our strategy to grow our international businesses. The summary of what I -- we covered on that call is that we recognize that we have tremendous international growth opportunities for all the brands as we expand outside the United States. We remain on track in the execution of our international strategy and continue to be very pleased with the performance of all of our new international stores. 
As you can see on Page 11 of the presentation, we, along with our partners, will open approximately 100 to 135 new stores this year. In the first quarter, our partners opened 7 new La Senza international locations and one Travel and Tourism store, which by the way, we're now calling the Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores, a change in name that clarifies, I think, the brand positioning of that concept. Just after the close of the quarter, we opened 2 more Victoria's Secret stores in Canada and the customer response to all of these new stores has been terrific. 
Before we take your questions, I'll close my comments by discussing La Senza's first quarter performance. Total sales increased 3% to $88.3 million in the first quarter. This was driven by foreign currency translation and a mid-single-digit increase in reported revenue in the international businesses, which was partially offset by a 4% comp decline in the Canadian stores. Our bra category delivered modest growth, led by the launch of our Body Kiss bra and the continued success of our Hello Sugar and Perfectly Me styles. The gross margin rate declined, driven by a significant decline in the merchandise margin rate. 
The decrease in the merchandise margin rate was driven by a mix shift to the international business, which has a lower margin rate, and also by a decline in the merchandise margin rate in the Canadian stores, and that was driven by foreign currency and increased promotional activity. The operating loss improved slightly on a dollar basis and significantly on a rate basis. 
We're encouraged by the growth in the bra business and continue to be focused on refining our assortment and establishing a strong brand that resonates with our target customers. However, it is clear that our La Senza business remains a work in progress. 
So in closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to be pleased with the company's overall performance, which was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile and also staying close to our customers. We'll maintain this discipline and focused approach, and we clearly see opportunities to continue to get even better. Thanks, and I'll now turn it back over to Amie for questions."

I mean, I don't know how many of you have heard the expression, ""You don't take rate home to the bank; you take dollars home to the bank."" So there's a lot of things that we think about. The first is, just to reiterate quickly, operating profit dollars in the quarter were up 40%. The margin rate -- operating margin rate improved by 250 basis points to 12%. And, Kimberly, as we look at expenses, while our -- the geography in our P&L kind of highlights SG&A, there's a lot of home office and other important expenses within gross margin in the buying and occupancy line, and those expenses in aggregate grew about 10%, which was about 500 basis points slower than sales. So we are making investments to drive growth, sales growth and longer-term growth. We think on an overall basis, those investments are paying off. But to your point, the leverage might not be as great as one might pencil out on paper, but the investments we're making are absolutely contributing meaningfully to the top line growth and the dollar profitability of the business. With all that said, we continue to look at everything very closely. Within the brands, within the overall corporation, we continue to look at stuff. We can always get better at how we do it but we think, overall, we're managing it pretty well."

It's about double and we'll continue with that cadence. And we continue to look at our business at, ""How much basic fragrances do we need on a year-round basis?"" And we continue to weed out where we don't need them, and continue to pump up the amount of seasonal things that we have coming in as well as fashion.

But with that said, as we've communicated before and it's still our view and we reiterated it again in our prepared comments, there is some cost pressure in the business. It'll be more weighted to the back half of the year, and we're going to work hard to offset as much of it as we can. But not -- in summary, to answer your question, not a lot of change in view from how we saw it a few months ago.

The London flagship store for next year, as you called out, is the next step beyond North America for Victoria's Secret. The expansion of Bath & Body Works outside the United States through our partners in the Middle East and Turkey is part of our plans for this year. And beyond that, geographically -- well, sort of in addition to that, the expansion of this Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories concept formerly known as T&T remains a priority for global expansion.

All of that is a work in progress and only 9 months old. So knowing the track record we have for building brands, I would suggest we need to be patient and stay the course. The other thing I'd say about Canada is if you've tracked any of the competitive results in Canada, it's interesting. The Canadian retail market is actually quite challenging right now. And while traffic is significantly negative, and so in addition to the transformational challenges that the management team is working their way through the Canadian retail market, it has presented more headwinds than we're seeing in the United States."

The best way for me to answer that is with the things that we've said very consistently over the past 2 years. Number one, we're focused on our core brands in the United States. We have great core brands in United States with great growth opportunities. Our international expansion, therefore, is paced at a rate that will not distract us from that first report -- primary mission. With the VS brand, we believe is a very complicated brand to deliver to the rest of the world because of the complex nature of the brand, the multi-sub-brand categories, the big box positioning, et cetera. The La Senza brand, the BBW brands are easier and less complicated, and that's the reason we've been focused on those brands principally in the early days. We're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in Canada, not just the customer sales and profitability results but also the operating results, in other words demonstrating that we are able to operate a big box Victoria's Secret store outside the United States. Our next step in that dance will be the London store, and that will help us to demonstrate our ability, operationally, to do that across the ocean and do that well. And then beyond that, I think that will open the doors to further expansion of the Victoria's Secret brand. But as Les has said many times, we're going to be careful and cautious about the pace and make sure that we don't distract ourselves from the core mission of our U.S. business."

Where we like the progress is the transformation of the brand in terms of becoming core focused on bras and panties, less focused on sleepwear but continuing to have an important part of the assortment around sexy sleepwear. And that transformation, which we also believe is positioning the brand to be younger, fun, flirty, et cetera, is also changing the customer mix. There's a lot of change going on there, and I think I can represent that Les is very pleased with the progress that we're making in that kind of a transformation, similar to other transformations that I've seen Les take the other of our brands through over the past 2 decades. The repositioning of the brand imagery, if you've seen the stores in Toronto, John, is working, and we're pleased with that brand positioning. But that's new and it's not fully distributed throughout Canada yet. So that needs to be fully distributed and proven to be a good brand positioning in terms of store design and imagery and et cetera. So all works in progress, and we're pleased with the progress we're making. It's not yet producing the financial results, as Stuart said, that we would want and we will be targeting to produce. In terms of the international business, that is also going through the same kind of transformation, and a number of our international franchisees are adopting the new standards, the new store design and positioning and seeing great success from that. And relatively speaking, I would say the international franchise business has been performing better than the Canadian business because it's a less competitive market that they're in, in many of the cases. So we're pleased with that progress and working closely with a number of our key international franchisees to convert that into this new model -- this new brand model."

We think there's a big opportunity within that category in getting great traction and success as we go forward. And we also believe that there's another opportunity within the accessory category. Still, continuing to have even more opportunity in the lounge. So we do believe that this is a powerful brand and a well-told story. As we think about our go-forward strategy, as we can appropriately right-size Pink within the Victoria's Secret box, we prefer that as a side-by-side. Where we cannot, we will be then expanding and opening up freestanding Pink stores. And that is to say, we have about 9 freestanding Pink stores, and we probably still see some more in the future where we just can't get enough real estate for the side-by-side concept. So I think there's opportunity and growth in the bra category and continue with the apparel category. We have -- a unique differentiator for us is in our collegiate licensing apparel program that is so targeted to that market. And then either within the story is our first and the second one would be freestanding opportunity."

Our adjusted earnings per share increased 60% to $0.40 per share versus $0.25 last year. Our reported result was $0.50 per share versus $0.34 last year. Both this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. This year's reported first quarter results include the following:
A pretax gain from the sale of Express shares of $86.4 million or $0.17 per share.
A pretax non-cash expense of $50 million or $0.10 per share related to the multiyear funding of our charitable foundation. We plan to fund this commitment by contributing about 1/3 of our remaining investment in Express shares, which allows us to meet our commitment in a tax efficient manner. After this contribution, we will continue to own approximately 5 million shares of Express stock.
Also excluded is an income tax benefit of $11 million or $0.03 per share related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters. 
The 2010 reported result includes a pretax gain of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items in both years.
Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.40 per share significantly exceeded our ""beginning of the quarter"" expectations of between $0.26 and $0.31 per share. This upside was driven by the 15% comp increase versus our initial forecast of about 2% to 4%. 
To take you through the first quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales were $2.217 billion versus $1.932 billion last year and comps increased 15%. The gross margin rate increased 200 basis points to 38%, primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate increased slightly, despite a negative impact of about 80 basis points related to the increase in MAST sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at 100% this year versus 75% last year. This accounting change, which occurred in the third quarter of 2010, will continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated merchandise margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A dollars increased by $65.6 million or 13% and the SG&A rate improved by 40 basis points. Total expenses, including buying and occupancy, increased by 10%. 3/4 of our SG&A expense growth relates to investments that we made in store selling and marketing to support and drive sales growth. 
Stores selling costs increased by 12% and leveraged as a percent of sales. Marketing costs increased by about 20% and deleveraged slightly as we invested in the quarter in initiatives to drive sales, including media and in-store visual merchandising and marketing. The remaining increase in SG&A relates to growth in our home office expense across various categories, including investments related to our international business, merit increases and incentive compensation. 
Turning to operating income on Page 5. Total operating income increased by $81.8 million or 44% and 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $266.8 million or 12% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $72.4 million or 340 basis points as a percent of sales to $239.7 million or 16.6% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $16.5 million or 250 basis points as a percent of sales to $54.2 million or 11.3% of sales. And the other segment operating loss increased by $7 million to $21.7 million driven primarily by an increase in certain -- $27.1 million driven primarily by an increase in certain legal reserves. Total non-operating expenses increased by $7.8 million as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was partially offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 5% versus last year and down 20% on a 2-year basis. Excluding an increase in the first quarter of 2009 related to the full quarter of inventories associated with Victoria's Secret systems implementations, inventory per square foot has decreased for 16 consecutive quarters. As you know, we issued $1 billion of 10-year notes during the first quarter at an interest rate of 6 5/8%. We repurchased 16.7 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $590 million, and we also just announced a new, $500 million share repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 7 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011. We expect earnings per share between $0.38 and $0.43 in the second quarter. This forecast reflects a low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate to increase and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to up slightly to last year. 
For the full year, we are projecting low- to mid-single-digit positive comps. We continue to expect some impact from increasing cost pressures this fall and, therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be more than offset by buying and occupancy leverage, so our forecast is for our 2011 gross margin rate to be up slightly to last year. 
We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage slightly on total sales growth. Non-operating expenses are projected at about $65 million per quarter, consisting principally of interest expense. This forecast is about $17 million higher than our previous guidance, driven by the new notes. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 318 million in the second quarter and the full year, which assumes that we will complete the share repurchase program near the end of the year. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.25 and $2.45 per share. We are now projecting 2011 CapEx of about $400 million to $425 million.
As detailed on Page 8 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 50 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $650 million, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Victoria's Secret earned record operating profit in the first quarter. We are pleased with this result, and I will begin my comments this morning by discussing what we believe have been the key drivers of our success. I'll follow this with the review of first quarter financial results and will then briefly discuss how we are thinking about the second quarter. 
So let's begin with what we have been doing to deliver our results. We continue to stay very focused on our core categories, bras and panties, coupled with a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile every day. We remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and staying conservative on our inventory and expense plans, and we are carefully bringing all of our work together in a well-told brand story across channels. We are telling that story through innovative products, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. 
Our customer connection has been critical to our success. We work every day to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. An example of our connectivity and our brand strength is our Facebook presence. We are the top specialty retailer. In fact, in March, our Victoria's Secret and Pink pages were the 2 most liked pages of all retailers, something we're very proud of. 
Finally, at the very core of our success are the people who make it happen each and every day. We have a seasoned and dedicated leadership team across all of our key functions. Our leaders have been in place and working together now for a number of years, and I feel very good about our talent from design to merchandising, stores, operations, marketing and really across the business, both in the home office and in the field. 
Now turning to our financial performance. Our first quarter results are detailed on Page 9 of your presentation material. In the Victoria's Secret stores channel, first quarter comp and total sales were up 19% versus last year, with total sales increasing to $986.6 million. This result was driven by strength across the assortment with fewer in-store promotions and on inventory levels that were significantly below our sales growth. Our lingerie business demonstrate balanced growth with bras, panties and sleepwear all performing well. We had a successful Valentine's Day weekend and offered customers newness throughout the quarter. This included new styles and fashion in many areas of the business, including the Incredible, Gorgeous and Dream Angels bra collections, as well as our innovative Incredible panties and Miraculous swimwear. 
Pink delivered another very strong performance with growth across the assortment driven by both base business and strong customer response to Pink's ongoing newness. We introduced a number of new Pink bras in Q1, and we are pleased with the progress and opportunities we see in this category. 
Our beauty business also performed well in the first quarter. Customers loved our fragrance and other new product introductions, and we continue to improve the beauty business integration and coordination with the balance of the store. We began this last fall with the co-launch of beauty and lingerie products through the Bombshell bra and fragrance launches and continued this in the first quarter with the Incredible and Dream Angels launches. 
As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been a key contributor to our sales growth, and we again achieved record customer conversion for the quarter. First quarter merchandise margin dollars were up significantly on roughly flat margin rate. Additionally, first quarter growth and operating margins both improved significantly and, combined with our top line, drove our operating profit up nearly 50% versus last year. 
Now let's review Direct's performance. First quarter sales increased 5% to $369 million. The top line was driven by strength in bras, Pink, swim and dresses, but that strength was partially offset by softness in other parts of the apparel business. Sales growth was also negatively affected by a very intentional strategy to reduce the number of days we were on promotion and to carry far less clearance inventory into the season. 
The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by the strategy to reduce promotional and clearance selling, as well as the strength of these assortments, enabling us to drive significantly more business at regular price. Additionally, total expense leveraged so operating income dollars increased nearly 25%, and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue to do more of what works. We will focus on providing customers fresh, innovative products with high emotional content. We will stay balanced in our approach, executing with discipline, simplicity and speed. And we will be thoughtful in our inventory and expense plan, investing in customer-impacting initiatives that drive sustained results. In closing, we are pleased with our performance but see opportunities for improvement. Above all else, we will stay close to our customer and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Diane."

As I'm sure most of you have already heard by now, since we made the announcement on Tuesday, that I've decided to return to San Francisco, which would require me to leave my role as CEO of Bath & Body Works. As you can all imagine, this has been a very difficult decision. I have an amazing team, we have great momentum in the business, and we've accomplished so much over the last 4 years. However, my personal life has been on the West Coast, and in an effort to create more balance, I decided to relocate. The good news is that I will be transitioning to advisory role to help on-board Nick Coe, who was formerly President at Lands' End, who will be joining us in early July. 
For those of you who haven't met Nick yet, let me assure that the brand will be in very capable hands. Nick has an incredible track record as a merchant and is as customer-centric as we are at Bath & Body Works. I am convinced that the brand will continue to deliver incredible results under his leadership. 
So let me discuss Bath & Body Works results for the first quarter. We were able to deliver significant sales and operating income growth versus last year. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on our 3 key categories, which are the Signature Collection product line, the anti-bac soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. 
Performance improved on top of strong results last year in Signature Collection driven by the launches of new fragrances like Carried Away and Country Chic, as well as the relaunch of our already very successful fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom. The anti-bac business continued to deliver growth, driven by our hand soap and sanitizer business. Performance in those businesses was driven by increasing fragrance and fashion newness in PocketBac and soap collections. 
Our home fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candles and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in new forms and novelties in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year driven by traffic and improvement in our conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.
Turning to Page 10 of the presentation. Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 11%. Total sales for the quarter were $480 million, up 11% or $49 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $54 million, which was up $16 million or 44% from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 11% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by the positive sales comps, modest improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense leverage. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter. 
We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year, and we continue to drive inventories down year-over-year while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel also delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. In the second quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance, Into The Wild, and we'll also launch a new collection of coconut-inspired fragrances. The anti-bac and home fragrance businesses will also introduce fashion and newness in fragrances and in form. 
We're cautiously optimistic about the second quarter, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. Our focus continues to be getting faster and better in understanding and satisfying our customers' needs while providing them with a world-class, in-store experience. In addition to focusing on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customers' needs. 
Earlier, I mentioned that the brand will be in good hands with Nick, but I should not -- but I should also say the brand will be in fantastic hands not only with Nick but with the entire senior leadership team. That's Andrew Maslow, Amy Hauk, Ken Montera, Camille McDonald, Tom Ramsey and the entire BBW team. So with that, I'm going to turn the discussion over to Martyn."

On our last earnings call, I spent quite a bit of time updating you on our strategy to grow our international businesses. The summary of what I -- we covered on that call is that we recognize that we have tremendous international growth opportunities for all the brands as we expand outside the United States. We remain on track in the execution of our international strategy and continue to be very pleased with the performance of all of our new international stores. 
As you can see on Page 11 of the presentation, we, along with our partners, will open approximately 100 to 135 new stores this year. In the first quarter, our partners opened 7 new La Senza international locations and one Travel and Tourism store, which by the way, we're now calling the Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores, a change in name that clarifies, I think, the brand positioning of that concept. Just after the close of the quarter, we opened 2 more Victoria's Secret stores in Canada and the customer response to all of these new stores has been terrific. 
Before we take your questions, I'll close my comments by discussing La Senza's first quarter performance. Total sales increased 3% to $88.3 million in the first quarter. This was driven by foreign currency translation and a mid-single-digit increase in reported revenue in the international businesses, which was partially offset by a 4% comp decline in the Canadian stores. Our bra category delivered modest growth, led by the launch of our Body Kiss bra and the continued success of our Hello Sugar and Perfectly Me styles. The gross margin rate declined, driven by a significant decline in the merchandise margin rate. 
The decrease in the merchandise margin rate was driven by a mix shift to the international business, which has a lower margin rate, and also by a decline in the merchandise margin rate in the Canadian stores, and that was driven by foreign currency and increased promotional activity. The operating loss improved slightly on a dollar basis and significantly on a rate basis. 
We're encouraged by the growth in the bra business and continue to be focused on refining our assortment and establishing a strong brand that resonates with our target customers. However, it is clear that our La Senza business remains a work in progress. 
So in closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to be pleased with the company's overall performance, which was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile and also staying close to our customers. We'll maintain this discipline and focused approach, and we clearly see opportunities to continue to get even better. Thanks, and I'll now turn it back over to Amie for questions."

I mean, I don't know how many of you have heard the expression, ""You don't take rate home to the bank; you take dollars home to the bank."" So there's a lot of things that we think about. The first is, just to reiterate quickly, operating profit dollars in the quarter were up 40%. The margin rate -- operating margin rate improved by 250 basis points to 12%. And, Kimberly, as we look at expenses, while our -- the geography in our P&L kind of highlights SG&A, there's a lot of home office and other important expenses within gross margin in the buying and occupancy line, and those expenses in aggregate grew about 10%, which was about 500 basis points slower than sales. So we are making investments to drive growth, sales growth and longer-term growth. We think on an overall basis, those investments are paying off. But to your point, the leverage might not be as great as one might pencil out on paper, but the investments we're making are absolutely contributing meaningfully to the top line growth and the dollar profitability of the business. With all that said, we continue to look at everything very closely. Within the brands, within the overall corporation, we continue to look at stuff. We can always get better at how we do it but we think, overall, we're managing it pretty well."

The biggest opportunity that we see at the end of the day is to get fashion right; to manage inventories tightly and with discipline with an appropriate balance of optimism and conservatism; to continue to work down markdowns, to reduce markdowns where we can, which are much more substantial opportunity, frankly, than the pressure of cost. But with that said, as we've communicated before and it's still our view and we reiterated it again in our prepared comments, there is some cost pressure in the business. It'll be more weighted to the back half of the year, and we're going to work hard to offset as much of it as we can. But not -- in summary, to answer your question, not a lot of change in view from how we saw it a few months ago. With respect to inventories, similar in mindset to expenses, which is, as you know, it is a critical area for us. All of us, all the leaders of the business are -- pay very close attention to it, balancing, creating an appropriate experience for customers, along with managing the risk of inventory and working hard to get better at greeting and reacting and chasing. We made good progress on that, but there's more that we can and will do. As I commented on, we think inventory in terms of where it'll end, the second quarter will be flat to up slightly.

In terms of our international expansion plans, the things that we -- and we've kind of discussed this in a great detail or more detail on the year-end earnings call, we remain on track with all the expansion plans that we've previously described. The London flagship store for next year, as you called out, is the next step beyond North America for Victoria's Secret. The expansion of Bath & Body Works outside the United States through our partners in the Middle East and Turkey is part of our plans for this year. And beyond that, geographically -- well, sort of in addition to that, the expansion of this Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories concept formerly known as T&T remains a priority for global expansion. And in addition to that, the La Senza international business, which we're very committed to, working very hard on because we believe that brand is well positioned for expansion globally. All of those remain on track and on plan. Geographically beyond that, we're continuing to be curious about other parts of the world, Asia, South America and elsewhere, and we've not yet decided on where we would go next."

We've now repositioned the brand in terms of its brand positioning to be more of a fun, flirty and sexy brand positioning. We repositioned the assortment to focus on bras and panties. All of that is a work in progress and only 9 months old. So knowing the track record we have for building brands, I would suggest we need to be patient and stay the course. The other thing I'd say about Canada is if you've tracked any of the competitive results in Canada, it's interesting. The Canadian retail market is actually quite challenging right now. And while traffic is significantly negative, and so in addition to the transformational challenges that the management team is working their way through the Canadian retail market, it has presented more headwinds than we're seeing in the United States."

The best way for me to answer that is with the things that we've said very consistently over the past 2 years. Number one, we're focused on our core brands in the United States. We have great core brands in United States with great growth opportunities. Our international expansion, therefore, is paced at a rate that will not distract us from that first report -- primary mission. With the VS brand, we believe is a very complicated brand to deliver to the rest of the world because of the complex nature of the brand, the multi-sub-brand categories, the big box positioning, et cetera. The La Senza brand, the BBW brands are easier and less complicated, and that's the reason we've been focused on those brands principally in the early days. We're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in Canada, not just the customer sales and profitability results but also the operating results, in other words demonstrating that we are able to operate a big box Victoria's Secret store outside the United States. Our next step in that dance will be the London store, and that will help us to demonstrate our ability, operationally, to do that across the ocean and do that well. And then beyond that, I think that will open the doors to further expansion of the Victoria's Secret brand. But as Les has said many times, we're going to be careful and cautious about the pace and make sure that we don't distract ourselves from the core mission of our U.S. business."

Where we like the progress is the transformation of the brand in terms of becoming core focused on bras and panties, less focused on sleepwear but continuing to have an important part of the assortment around sexy sleepwear. And that transformation, which we also believe is positioning the brand to be younger, fun, flirty, et cetera, is also changing the customer mix. There's a lot of change going on there, and I think I can represent that Les is very pleased with the progress that we're making in that kind of a transformation, similar to other transformations that I've seen Les take the other of our brands through over the past 2 decades. The repositioning of the brand imagery, if you've seen the stores in Toronto, John, is working, and we're pleased with that brand positioning. But that's new and it's not fully distributed throughout Canada yet. So that needs to be fully distributed and proven to be a good brand positioning in terms of store design and imagery and et cetera. So all works in progress, and we're pleased with the progress we're making. It's not yet producing the financial results, as Stuart said, that we would want and we will be targeting to produce. In terms of the international business, that is also going through the same kind of transformation, and a number of our international franchisees are adopting the new standards, the new store design and positioning and seeing great success from that. And relatively speaking, I would say the international franchise business has been performing better than the Canadian business because it's a less competitive market that they're in, in many of the cases. So we're pleased with that progress and working closely with a number of our key international franchisees to convert that into this new model -- this new brand model."

As you know, we've really not been focused on the bra category. It was really based upon our lounge business and panty business. We think there's a big opportunity within that category in getting great traction and success as we go forward. And we also believe that there's another opportunity within the accessory category. Still, continuing to have even more opportunity in the lounge. So we do believe that this is a powerful brand and a well-told story. As we think about our go-forward strategy, as we can appropriately right-size Pink within the Victoria's Secret box, we prefer that as a side-by-side. Where we cannot, we will be then expanding and opening up freestanding Pink stores. And that is to say, we have about 9 freestanding Pink stores, and we probably still see some more in the future where we just can't get enough real estate for the side-by-side concept. So I think there's opportunity and growth in the bra category and continue with the apparel category. We have -- a unique differentiator for us is in our collegiate licensing apparel program that is so targeted to that market. And then either within the story is our first and the second one would be freestanding opportunity."

Our adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.48 per share versus $0.36 last year. Our reported results of $0.73 per share versus $0.54 last year. While this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release, this year's reported second quarter results includes the following: a nontaxable gain of $147.1 million or $0.47 per share and a pretax expense of $113.4 million or $0.22 per share related to the contribution of all of our remaining expressed shares to the Limited Brands foundation. This contribution allowed us to fund the foundation in a very cash efficient manner. I won't repeat that 2010 significant items, which are detailed in our press release. All results discussed on this call excludes these significant items in both years. 
To take you through the second quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales were $2.458 billion versus $2.2043 billion last year and comps increased 9%. Our other segment revenue increased by $66.4 million or 26% to $324.4 million. Over 75% of the increase was driven by growth in our International business particularly in Canada. The remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to the change in accounting for Mast sales to Express Limited Stores. The gross margin rate increased 200 basis points to 36.7% primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate improved slightly despite a negative impact of about 60 basis points related to the increase in Mast sales to Express Limited Stores, which are recognized 100% this year versus 75% last year. We will anniversary this accounting change in the third quarter. 
We continue to focus on managing total expense growth at a rate that is lower than sales. Total expenses the combination of buying and occupancy and SG&A increased by 6% and leverage as a percent of sales. SG&A dollars increased by $54.1 million or 10%, and the SG&A rate increased by 10 basis points. A significant portion of our SG&A is variable, and we will continue to manage that proactively throughout the quarter in response to our sales trend. 2/3 of our SG&A expense growth relates to investments that we made in store selling and marketing to support and drive sales growth. These investments included higher selling payroll and credit card fees related to the growth in sales, increased investment in training and investments in other store initiatives, including technology. The remaining increase in SG&A relates to growth in our home office expense across various categories, including investments related to our International business. 
Turning to operating income on Page 6. Total operating income increased $70.5 million or 30% and 190 basis points as a percent of sales to $307 million or 12.5% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $47.4 million or 200 basis points as a percent of sales to $239 million or 15.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $5.7 million or 50 basis points as a percent of sales to $70.1 million or 12.5% as a percent of sales. The other segment operating loss improved by $17.5 million to $2.2 million driven by growth in our International business and improve profitability at Mast. Total nonoperating expenses increased by $25.5 million driven by increased interest expense and the loss of income from Express Limited Stores. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 10. Retail inventories per square foot at cost and in the quarter down 1% versus last year and down 5% on a 2-year basis. We repurchased 8.2 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $314 million. As of July 30, we had $204 mil remaining under our current $500 million share repurchase program. Turning to Page 11 of the presentation for our forecasting 2011, we expect earnings per share between $0.17 and $0.22 in the third quarter against last year's record, $0.18 result. This forecast will result low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. Our comp estimate for the quarter includes August comps in the high-single-digit range versus our previous guidance for a low-single-digit increase. We expect the third quarter merchandise margin rate to be down somewhat negatively impacted by cost increases. However, this decline should be principally offset by leverage on buying and occupancy costs, so we left the gross margin rate to be about flat. We expect the third quarter SG&A rate to be about flat as well. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to up slightly to last year. For the full year, we are projecting mid-single-digit positive comps. We continue to expect some impact from increase in cost this fall, and therefore, our outlook doesn't offer some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. We believe that this decline will be more than offset by our buying and occupancy expense leverage, so our forecast for 2011 gross margin rate to be up to last year. We expect the full year SG&a expense rate to leverage slightly on total sales growth. Nonoperating expenses are projected at about $245 million, including principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%, and we are forecasting weighted average shares of about 309 million in the third quarter and 315 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.35 to $2.50 per share. We are projecting 2011 CapEx of about $425 million. 
As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 50 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $700 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders for a combination of share repurchases and dividend. We took advantage of an attractive bank market in the second quarter by increasing our revolver to $1 billion from $800 million and extending it to 2016. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other receivable need. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

This morning, I'll share with you the key drivers of our success. I'll then review second quarter financial results and end by briefly discussing how we're thinking about our third quarter. Let's begin with what we have been doing to deliver our results. 
We continue to stay focused on our core categories, bras and panties, supported by a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile every day. We remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and staying conservative with our inventory and expense plans. We brought this together in a well-told brand story across channel. We told that story through innovative products, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. And finally, critical to our success is our customer connection. We work hard everyday to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. 
Now turning to our financial performance. Our second quarter results are detailed on Page 13 of your presentation materials. In the Victoria's Secret store channel, second quarter comps were up 12%, and total sales were up 11% increasing to $1.064 billion. This result was driven by strength across the assortment. Our Lingerie business in a straight balance growth with bras, panties and sleepwear all performing well. We had a successful semi-annual sales, which resulted higher sell-throughs and very clean inventory positioning heading into the fall season. Pink delivered very strong performance with growth across the assortment driven by both base business and strong customer response to newness. We also continue to improve the integration and quarter nation of our Beauty business with the balance of the store. In July, following the semiannual sales, Beauty reintroduced popular garden line as a remained VS Fantasies collection. As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been critical to our sales growth, and we again achieved record customer conversion for the quarter. And this is the eighth consecutive quarter we have achieved record conversion. The second quarter merchandise margin was up slightly to last year. Margin rate was positively impacted by an increase in full price selling, which was partially offset by product cost increases. We've also leveraged buying and occupancy and SG&A expense, and this combined with our top line growth, drove our operating profit up over 30% versus last year. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Second quarter sales increased about 1% to $393 million. Top line growth was slow by a 12-day reduction in the spring sales. This strategy was designed to drive more regular price selling, which increased dramatically in the quarter. Swim, Pink and the Active the business were all strong despite the reduction in sale day. With the increase in regular price selling, total gross margin increased significantly. In addition to the fewer days on sale, we were able to offset product cost increases with less, low-margin clearance and selling resulting in a clean inventory position. Even with the slower rate of sales growth, total expenses leveraged in the quarter, so operating income dollars increased 15%, and operating income rate was up significantly. 
Now let's discuss the third quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the third quarter. We are excited based on our 2 latest launches, Heartbreaker and Showstopper. We will not lose focus on our bras and panties business. These categories are our primary investment heading into all-important holiday time period. We will continue to deliver newness in our assortment and provide customer fresh, innovative product with high emotional content. We will maintain maximum agility to chase what is working and manage any downturn as a result of the macroeconomy. We will stay balanced in our approach by managing our inventory and expenses to grow at a rate slower than sales, and we will chase aggressively where appropriate. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance but continue to see opportunities for improvement. We will stay close to our customer and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thank you, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Andrew."

We delivered sales and operating income growth versus last year's strong performance. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on 3 key categories: our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bac Sanitizer business and our Home Fragrance assortment. Performance improve result in Signature Collection driven by the launch of the new fragrances like Into The Wild and the new citrus collection. The anti-bac business continued to deliver growth driven by increasing fragrance, novelty and fashion newness in our PocketBac collection. And fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candles and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in new forms of novelty in our diffuser and scented candle categories. 
Transactions were also up versus last year driven by traffic and continued improvement in our conversion rates. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter as detailed on Page 15. Bath & Body Works second quarter comps were up 4%. Total sales for the quarter were $563 million, up 5% or $27 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $70 million, up $6 million or 9% from last year and up 59% or $26 million from 2 years ago. Operating income as a percent of sales was 12.5% in the quarter and up from last year. Operating income rate in the second quarter was driven by improvement in merchandise margin rate while holding expenses flat as a percent of sales from last year. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down from last year. We continue to drive inventories down year-over-year start of positions continue to improve. The BBW Direct channel also delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both home and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance, and will also continue to introduce novelty in our extended Halloween collection. While the anti-bac and home fragrance businesses have also introduced fashion in newness in fragrances and forms. We are cautiously optimistic about Q3, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. Our overall focus continues to be on getting faster and better and understanding and to satisfy our customer needs while providing them with a world-class, in-store experience. In addition to focusing on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read in the result of new product offerings and promotional strategies while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customer needs. With that, I'll turn that discussion over to Mark."

This morning, I'll focus my remarks on providing an update on our international businesses. As you know, Martin Waters will provide you with more a complete update on our overall international strategy at our investor update meeting in New York in October 19. So I'll only hit the highlights today. 
One of those highlights is that we, along with our partners, continue to be very much on track to open up approximately 130 stores this year outside of the United States. Taking a look at each of the businesses, let's start with the Victoria Secret's international business. In the second quarter, we opened to Victoria's Secret stores in Canada, in Toronto and Calgary, bringing the total in Canada to 6 Victoria's Secret stores and 8 Pink stores. Victoria's continue to do very well and exceeding our sales expectations, and we plan to open another 6 locations in the fall. Our partners opened 6 Victoria's Secret Beauty and accessories stores in the second quarter, bringing the total there to 24 stores. In addition, our partners plan to open another 39 stores by the end of the year. Sales productivity in these stores continue to be very impressive. 
And finally, we continue to be on track to open our flagship store in Bond Street in London next summer. I'm also pleased to announce that we will open another 2 to 3 all assortment mall-based stores in London next summer as well. 
In summary, all of our Victoria's Secret stores outside the United States continue to perform very well, and we are very enthusiastic about global opportunities for this brand. I'll next turn to BBW. We opened 3 stores in Canada in the second quarter bringing our total to 62. These stores continue to achieve sales volumes above our U.S. averages. And we plan to open another 7 stores over the remainder of the year. We opened another 2 stores under our partnership with Alshaya in the Middle East in the second quarter, bringing the total there to 8 stores. These stores also continue to do very well. Our partners will open another 12 stores in the Middle East and Turkey this fall. 
Turning to La Senza. Although business is not significant to our overall results, our Canadian business has been slow to turn around than we would've liked. It's being impacted in part by a very challenging Canadian retail environment, where mall traffic levels will down-low-double digits in the second quarter. La Senza comp store sales increased 1% in the quarter driven by strong semi-annual sales and incremental promotional activity. The La Senza International business has been strong with retail sales up significantly in the quarter. Our partners opened another 9 stores in the second quarter bringing our total to 250 stores, and our partners plan to open another 40 stores in the remainder of the year. Total La Senza operating income was about flat to last year in the quarter and remains at about breakeven. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to be very pleased with the company's overall record-setting performance. This performance was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile and staying close to our customers. Although we obviously recognize the current environment is very uncertain, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to managing business while also aggressively pursuing every opportunity to get even better. Thanks. I'll now turn it back over to Amie."

Basically, the traffic [indiscernible] That traffic has been slightly down, really across the mall, and we were really seeing the benefit to our conversion. I think that your question about how quickly can we respond to the market, one of our true focus is, how do we really think agile in terms of hoping to buy, positioning from a speed perspective. And we have on that in sight to both maximize the outside, as well as to be able to balance our business if there's any downturn with the macroeconomic. We definitely know that it's unstable out there, and that's just our thinking about it. It's how we continue to put the maximum amount of agility into the business. So we do have opportunities to be able to assess the fourth quarter. We're in the throes right now of tapping big key items for the holiday.

So to your question on August, I would say for Bath & Body Works, the trend we're seeing for August on traffic and conversion is similar to what we've been seeing in the past. We do have some timing differences this month, as I mentioned earlier, in the prepared remarks. We have launched a new Signature Collection, fragrance Paris Amore, this month that is incremental to last year, and we did not have one in August last year. And we are, so far, a few days into that launch. I'm very pleased with the performance we're seeing in all metrics attributed with that launch. In terms of our flexibility for the back half, I can agree with everything that Sharen said. In a similar way, we plan conservatively going into the season in terms of how we have inventory position. We have used our speed initiatives to get to the flexibility to either chase with any upside or react in cuts with any downside. In a similar way, our promotional activity, we go into every season planning to essentially anniversary prior year promotional activity. And as we get in-season, we are flexible to ramp that down if we see better performance in full price selling as we did in the spring season or if necessary is the macro environment were to worsen, we can obviously ramp that up as well.

We are pleased with our record second quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.48 per share versus $0.36 last year. Our reported results of $0.73 per share versus $0.54 last year.",1085,"Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our record second quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.48 per share versus $0.36 last year. Our reported results of $0.73 per share versus $0.54 last year. 
While this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release, this year's reported second quarter results include the following: a nontaxable gain of $147.1 million or $0.47 per share and a pretax expense of $113.4 million or $0.22 per share related to the charitable contribution of all of our remaining Express shares to the Limited Brands Foundation. This contribution allowed us to fund the foundation in a very tax efficient manner. I won't repeat the 2010 significant items, which are detailed in our press release. All results discussed on this call excludes these significant items in both years. 
To take you through the second quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales were $2.458 billion versus $2.243 billion last year and comps increased 9%. Our other segment revenue increased by $66.4 million or 26% to $324.4 million. Over 75% of the increase was driven by growth in our International business, particularly in Canada. The remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to the change in accounting for Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores. 
The gross margin rate increased 200 basis points to 36.7% primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate improved slightly despite a negative impact of about 60 basis points related to the increase in Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at a 100% this year versus 75% last year. We will anniversary this accounting change in the third quarter. 
We continue to focus on managing total expense growth at a rate that is lower than sales. Total expenses, the combination of buying and occupancy and SG&A increased by 6% and leverage as a percent of sales. SG&A dollars increased by $54.1 million or 10%, and the SG&A rate increased by 10 basis points. A significant portion of our SG&A is variable, and we will continue to manage that proactively throughout the quarter in response to our sales trend. 2/3 of our SG&A expense growth relates to investments that we made in store selling and marketing to support and drive sales growth. These investments included higher selling payroll and credit card fees related to the growth in sales, increased investment in training and investments in other store initiatives, including technology. The remaining increase in SG&A relates to growth in our home office expense across various categories, including investments related to our International business. 
Turning to operating income on Page 6. Total operating income increased $70.5 million or 30% and 190 basis points as a percent of sales to $307 million or 12.5% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $47.4 million or 200 basis points as a percent of sales to $239 million or 15.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $5.7 million or 50 basis points as a percent of sales to $70.1 million or 12.5% of sales. The other segment operating loss improved by $17.5 million to $2.2 million driven by growth in our International business and improve profitability at Mast. Total non-operating expenses increased by $25.5 million driven by increased interest expense and the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 10. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 1% versus last year and down 5% on a 2-year basis. We repurchased 8.2 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $314 million. As of July 30, we had $204 million remaining under our current $500 million share repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation for our forecast in 2011, we expect earnings per share between $0.17 and $0.22 in the third quarter against last year's record $0.18 result. This forecast reflects a low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. Our comp estimate for the quarter includes an updated view for August comps in the high single-digit range versus our previous guidance for a low single-digit increase. 
We expect the third quarter merchandise margin rate to be down somewhat negatively impacted by cost increases. However, this decline should be principally offset by leverage on buying and occupancy costs, so we look for the gross margin rate to be about flat. We expect the third quarter SG&A rate to be about flat as well. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to up slightly to last year. For the full year, we are projecting mid single-digit positive comps. 
We continue to expect some impact from increasing cost pressure this fall, and therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. 
We believe that this decline will be more than offset by our buying and occupancy expense leverage, so our forecast is for 2011 gross margin rate to be up to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage slightly on total sales growth. Non-operating expenses are projected at about $245 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%, and we are forecasting weighted average shares of about 309 million in the third quarter and 315 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.35 to $2.50 per share. We are projecting 2011 CapEx of about $425 million. 
As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 50 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $700 million. And we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividend. 
We took advantage of an attractive bank market in the second quarter by increasing our revolver to $1 billion from $800 million and extending it to 2016. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in varying strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other receivable need. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

This morning, I'll share with you the key drivers of our success. I'll then review second quarter financial results and end by briefly discussing how we're thinking about the third quarter. Let's begin with what we have been doing to deliver our results. 
We continue to stay focused on our core categories, bras and panties, supported by a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile every day. We remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and staying conservative with our inventory and expense plans. We brought this together in a well-told brand story across channels. We told that story through innovative products, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. And finally, critical to our success is our customer connection. We work hard everyday to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. 
Now turning to our financial performance. Our second quarter results are detailed on Page 13 of your presentation materials. In the Victoria's Secret store channel, second quarter comps were up 12%, and total sales were up 11% increasing to $1.064 billion. This result was driven by strength across the assortment. Our Lingerie business in a straight balance growth with bras, panties and sleepwear all performing well. We had a successful semi-annual sales, which resulted in higher sell-throughs and very clean inventory positioning heading into the fall season. 
Pink delivered a very strong performance with growth across the assortment driven by both base business and strong customer response to Pink's news. We also continue to improve the integration and coordination of our Beauty business with the balance of the store. In July, following the semi-annual sales, Beauty re-introduced the popular garden line as remained VS Fantasies collection. 
As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been critical to our sales growth, and we again achieved record customer conversion for the quarter. And this is the eighth consecutive quarter we have achieved record conversion. The second quarter merchandise margin was up slightly to last year. Margin rate was positively impacted by an increase in full price selling, which was partially offset by product cost increases. We've also leveraged buying and occupancy and SG&A expense, and this combined with our top line growth, drove our operating profit up over 30% versus last year. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Second quarter sales increased about 1% to $393 million. Top line growth was slow by a 12-day reduction in the spring sales. This strategy was designed to drive more regular price selling, which increased dramatically in the quarter. Swim, Pink and the Active business were all strong despite the reduction in sales day. With the increase in regular price selling, total gross margin increased significantly. In addition to the fewer days on sale, we were able to offset product cost increases with less, low-margin clearance selling, resulting in a clean inventory position. Even with the slower rate of sales growth, total expenses leveraged in the quarter, so operating income dollars increased 15%, and operating income rate was up significantly. 
Now let's discuss the third quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the third quarter. We are excited based on our 2 latest launches, Heartbreaker and Showstopper. We will not lose focus on our Bra and Panty business. These categories are our primary investment heading into all-important holiday time period. We will continue to deliver newness in our assortment and provide customers fresh, innovative product with high emotional content. 
We will maintain maximum agility to chase what is working and manage any downturn as a result of the macroeconomy. We will stay balanced in our approach by managing our inventory and expenses to grow at a rate slower than sales, and we will chase aggressively where appropriate. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance but continue to see opportunities for improvement. We will stay close to our customers and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thank you, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Andrew."

We delivered sales and operating income growth versus last year's strong performance. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on 3 key categories: our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bac Soap and Sanitizer business and our Home Fragrance assortment.
Performance improved on top of strong result last year in the Signature Collection, driven by the launch of the new fragrances like Into The Wild and the new Citrus collection. The Anti-Bac business continue to deliver growth driven by increasing fragrance, novelty and fashion newness in our PocketBac collection. And fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candles and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in new forms and novelty in our Diffuser and scented [ph] categories. Transactions were also up versus last year driven by traffic and continued improvement in our conversion rates. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter as detailed on Page 15. 
Bath & Body Works second quarter comps were up 4%. Total sales for the quarter were $563 million, up 5% or $27 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $70 million, up $6 million or 9% from last year and up 59% or $26 million from 2 years ago. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 12.5% in the quarter and up from last year. Operating income rate in the second quarter was driven by improvement in merchandise margin rate, while holding expenses flat as a percent of sales from last year. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down from last year. We continue to drive inventories down year-over-year, while [indiscernible] positions continue to improve. The BBW Direct channel also delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both home and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance, Paris Amour, and we'll also continue to introduce novelty in our extended Halloween Collection. While the Anti-Bac and Home Fragrance businesses have also introduced fashion and newness in fragrances and forms. 
We are cautiously optimistic about Q3, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. Our overall focus continues to be on getting faster and better at understanding and satisfying our customer needs while providing them with a world-class in-store experience. In addition to focusing on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customer needs. With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martyn."

This morning, I will focus my remarks on providing an update on our International businesses. As you know, Martin Waters will provide you with more a complete update on our overall international strategy at our investor update meeting in New York on October 19. So I'll only hit the highlights today. 
One of those highlights is that we, along with our partners, continue to be very much on track to open approximately 130 stores this year outside of the United States. Taking a look at each of the businesses, let's start with Victoria's Secret's International business. In the second quarter, we opened 2 Victoria's Secret stores in Canada, in Toronto and Calgary, bringing the total in Canada to 6 Victoria's Secret stores and 8 Pink stores. 
These stores continue to do very well and are exceeding our sales expectations, and we plan to open another 6 locations in the fall. Our partners opened 6 Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in the second quarter, bringing the total there to 24 stores. In addition, our partners plan to open another 39 stores by the end of the year. Sales productivity in these stores continue to be very impressive.  
And finally, we continue to be on track to open our flagship store on New Bond Street in London next summer. And we're also pleased to announce that we will open another 2 to 3 full assortment mall-based stores in London next summer as well. In summary, all of our Victoria's Secret stores outside the United States continue to perform very well, and we are very enthusiastic about global opportunities for this brand. 
And next, turning to BBW. We opened 3 stores in Canada in the second quarter bringing our total to 62. These stores continue to achieve sales volumes above our U.S. averages. And we plan to open another 7 stores over the remainder of the year. We opened another 2 stores under our partnership with Alshaya in the Middle East in the second quarter, bringing the total there to 8 stores. These stores also continue to do very well. Our partners will open another 12 stores in the Middle East and Turkey this fall. 
Turning to La Senza. Although business is not significant to our overall results, our Canadian business has been slower to turn around than we would've liked. It's being impacted in part by a very challenging Canadian retail environment, where mall traffic levels were down low-double digits in the second quarter. La Senza comp store sales increased 1% in the quarter, driven by a strong semi-annual sales and incremental promotional activity. The La Senza International business has been strong with retail sales up significantly in the quarter. Our partners opened another 9 stores in the second quarter, bringing our total to 250 stores, and our partners plan to open another 40 stores in the remainder of the year. Total La Senza operating income was about flat to last year in the quarter and remains at about breakeven. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to be very pleased with the company's overall record-setting performance. This performance was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation to getting faster and more agile and staying close to our customers. Although we obviously recognize that the current environment is very uncertain, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to managing business while also aggressively pursuing every opportunity to get even better. Thanks. I'll now turn it back over to Amie."

And it's important to reiterate a few things and that is with respect to total expenses, the company has been and will continue to be very committed to growing expenses slower than sales. And as we were looking back at some things, we've done that for 7 consecutive quarters. And so that commitment is there, and it's in the results. And as you know, Kimberly our expenses are in 2 categories in buying and occupancy line and in the SG&A line. So with respect to the SG&A component of that, we are managing expenses within the quarter and a lot of the SG&A expenses do flex with sales. And we're making various investment that Sharen and Andrew could elaborate on, that we believe are customer-focused and improve the customer experience and are contributing to a very good experience for customers and translate through to the sales line. But with all that said, very focused on expenses growing slower than sales which they are. It's part of our cap to '15 framework, which we're making good progress on. And specifically about your question, we do manage within the quarter in terms of that sales increase. We're making sure we've got the right service experience for the customer, so we put more hours in the store, for example, that's our biggest category of SG&A expense. And we do make other discreet decisions within the quarter that relate to top line results. And we think, overall, it's working pretty well."

The unique phenomena in the third quarter particularly in the fall, to a lesser extent, is as we've talked about the price increases generally are back-half weighted to the fall versus the spring, just based on trend of input increases, including cotton and how that sell-through inventory, so back half way consistent with prior commentary. And particularly in the third quarter, Paul, our Personal Care and Beauty side of the business mix is slight. In the Pink business mixes talking about percent of sales. And so as you would appreciate, the Pink and Victoria's Secret Direct businesses are impacted to a greater extent that Personal Care and Beauty on the cost side. And their portion of the business in Q3 is greater than for the full year and certainly for the fourth quarter.

We have used our speed initiatives to get the flexibility to either chase with any upside or react in cuts with any downside. In a similar way, on promotional activity, we go into every season planning to essentially anniversary prior year promotional activity.

And we expect to get some leverage on the buying and occupancy line also. And those 2 things largely offset for a flattish gross margin rate for the balance of the year. So that's our view and we'll obviously work hard to maximize the results on a dollar rate basis, but that's an ongoing assumption. With respect to inventory, 3 or 4 methods, has done better, not a bad thing, I mean we're very focused on the management team here, very focused on, with respect to growth, we expect flattish inventory per foot maybe up slightly by month but clearly well below sales results. So that discipline continues. Clearly, there are some differences between unit growth and dollar growth, depending upon what part of the business that you are talking about. We're not going to go into great detail about that, but there are some differences depending upon what part of the business you're looking at. And when you look at that units and dollars all the time, both on a selling basis and on an inventory position basis. But again, I don't think meaningful to the overall understanding of our managing inventory. What's most important is we're clearly focused on growing inventories slower than sales, improving turn and continuing to get better at speed and agility, which we've made progress on, but we're working hard to make even more progress. We think there's a lot more opportunity."

We are pleased with our record second quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.48 per share versus $0.36 last year. Our reported result was $0.73 per share versus $0.54 last year.",1085,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our record second quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.48 per share versus $0.36 last year. Our reported result was $0.73 per share versus $0.54 last year. 
Though this and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release, this year's reported second quarter results include the following: a nontaxable gain of $147.1 million or $0.47 per share and a pretax expense of $113.4 million or $0.22 per share related to the charitable contribution of all of our remaining Express shares to the Limited Brands Foundation. This contribution allows us to fund the foundation in a very tax efficient manner. I won't repeat the 2010 significant items, which are detailed in our press release. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items in both years. 
To take you through the second quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales were $2.458 billion versus $2.243 billion last year and comps increased 9%. Our other segment revenue increased by $66.4 million or 26% to $324.4 million. Over 75% of the increase was driven by growth in our International business, particularly in Canada. The remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to the change in accounting for Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores. 
The gross margin rate increased 200 basis points to 36.7% primarily driven by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The merchandise margin rate improved slightly despite a negative impact of about 60 basis points related to the increase in Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores, which are recognized at a 100% this year versus 75% last year. We will anniversary this accounting change in the third quarter. 
We continue to focus on managing total expense growth at a rate that is slower than sales. Total expenses, the combination of buying and occupancy and SG&A increased by 6% and leveraged as a percent of sales. SG&A dollars increased by $54.1 million or 10%, and the SG&A rate increased by 10 basis points. A significant portion of our SG&A is variable, and we will continue to manage that proactively throughout the quarter in response to our sales trend. 2/3 of our SG&A expense growth relates to investments that we made in store selling and marketing to support and drive sales growth. These investments included higher selling payroll and credit card fees related to the growth in sales, increased investments in training and investments in other store initiatives, including technology. The remaining increase in SG&A relates to growth in our home office expense across various categories, including investments related to our International business. 
Turning to operating income on Page 6. Total operating income increased $70.5 million or 30% and 190 basis points as a percent of sales to $307 million or 12.5% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $47.4 million or 200 basis points as a percent of sales to $239 million or 15.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $5.7 million or 50 basis points as a percent of sales to $70.1 million or 12.5% of sales. The other segment operating loss improved by $17.5 million to $2.2 million driven by growth in our International business and improve profitability at Mast. Total nonoperating expenses increased by $25.5 million driven by increased interest expense and the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 10. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 1% versus last year and down 5% on a 2-year basis. We repurchased 8.2 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $314 million. As of July 30, we had $204 million remaining under our current $500 million share repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011, we expect earnings per share between $0.17 and $0.22 in the third quarter against last year's record $0.18 result. This forecast reflects a low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. Our comp estimate for the quarter includes an updated view for August comps in the high single-digit range versus our previous guidance for a low single-digit increase. 
We expect the third quarter merchandise margin rate to be down somewhat, negatively impacted by cost increases. However, this decline should be principally offset by leverage on buying and occupancy costs, so we look for the gross margin rate to be about flat. We expect the third quarter SG&A rate to be about flat as well. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot roughly flat to up slightly to last year. For the full year, we are projecting mid single-digit positive comps. 
We continue to expect some impact from increasing cost pressures this fall, and therefore, our outlook does call for some decline in our merchandise margin rate in 2011. 
We believe that this decline will be more than offset by our buying and occupancy expense leverage, so our forecast is for 2011 gross margin rate to be up to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to leverage slightly on total sales growth. Nonoperating expenses are projected at about $245 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%, and we are forecasting weighted average shares of about 309 million in the third quarter and 315 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.35 to $2.50 per share. We are projecting 2011 CapEx of about $425 million. 
As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 50 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $700 million. And we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividend. 
We took advantage of an attractive bank market in the second quarter by increasing our revolver to $1 billion from $800 million and extending it to 2016.

This morning, I'll share with you the key drivers of our success. I'll then review second quarter financial results and end by briefly discussing how we're thinking about the third quarter. Let's begin with what we have been doing to deliver our results. 
We continue to stay focused on our core categories, bras and panties, supported by a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile every day. We've remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and staying conservative with our inventory and expense plans. We brought this together in a well-told brand story across channels. We told that story through innovative products, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. And finally, critical to our success is our customer connection. We work hard every day to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. 
Now turning to our financial performance. Our second quarter results are detailed on Page 13 of your presentation materials. In the Victoria's Secret store channel, second quarter comps were up 12%, and total sales were up 11% increasing to $1.064 billion. This result was driven by strength across the assortment. Our Lingerie business demonstrated balanced growth with bras, panties and sleepwear all performing well. We had a successful semi-annual sale, which resulted in higher sell-throughs and very clean inventory positioning heading into the fall season. 
Pink delivered a very strong performance with growth across the assortment driven by both base business and strong customer response to Pink's news. We also continue to improve the integration and coordination of our Beauty business with the balance of the store. In July, following the semi-annual sale, Beauty re-introduced the popular garden line as renamed VS Fantasies collection. 
As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been critical to our sales growth, and we again achieved record customer conversion for the quarter. And this is the eighth consecutive quarter we have achieved record conversion. The second quarter merchandise margin was up slightly to last year. Margin rate was positively impacted by an increase in full price selling, which was partially offset by product cost increases. We've also leveraged buying and occupancy and SG&A expense, and this combined with our top line growth, drove our operating profit up over 30% versus last year. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Second quarter sales increased about 1% to $393 million. Top line growth was slow by a 12-day reduction in the spring sales. This strategy was designed to drive more regular price selling, which increased dramatically in the quarter. Swim, Pink and the Active business were all strong despite the reduction in sales days. With the increase in regular price selling, total gross margin increased significantly. In addition to the fewer days on sale, we were able to offset product cost increases with less low-margin clearance selling, resulting in a clean inventory position. Even with the slower rate of sales growth, total expenses leveraged in the quarter, so operating income dollars increased 15%, and operating income rate was up significantly. 
Now let's discuss the third quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the third quarter. We are excited based on our 2 latest launches, Heartbreaker and Showstopper. We will not lose focus on our Bra and Panty business. These categories are our primary investment heading into the all-important holiday time period. We will continue to deliver newness in our assortment and provide customers fresh, innovative product with high emotional content. 
We will maintain maximum agility to chase what is working and manage any downturn as a result of the macroeconomy. We will stay balanced in our approach by managing our inventory and expenses to grow at a rate slower than sales, and we will chase aggressively where appropriate. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance but continue to see opportunities for improvement. We will stay close to our customers and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thank you, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Andrew."

We delivered sales and operating income growth versus last year's strong performance. We continue to deliver improved results versus strong performance last year by maintaining focus on 3 key categories: our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bac Soap and Sanitizer business and our Home Fragrance assortment.
Performance improved on top of strong results last year in the Signature Collection, driven by the launch of the new fragrances like Into The Wild and the new Citrus collection. The Anti-Bac business continued to deliver growth driven by increasing fragrance, novelty and fashion newness in our PocketBac collection. And fragrance sales also grew versus strong performance last year and continue to be driven by candles and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in new forms of novelty in our Diffuser and SCENTPORTABLE categories. Transactions were also up versus last year driven by traffic and a continued improvement in our conversion rate. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter as detailed on Page 15. 
Bath & Body Works second quarter comps were up 4%. Total sales for the quarter were $563 million, up 5% or $27 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $70 million, up $6 million or 9% from last year and up 59% or $26 million from 2 years ago. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 12.5% in the quarter and up from last year. Operating income rate in the second quarter was driven by improvements in merchandise margin rate, while holding expenses flat as a percent of sales from last year. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down from last year. We continue to drive inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The BBW Direct channel also delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and fragrance. This month, we launched our newest Signature Collection fragrance, Paris Amour, and we'll also continue to introduce novelty in our expanded Halloween Collection. While the Anti-Bac and Home Fragrance businesses have also introduced fashion and newness in fragrances and forms. 
We are cautiously optimistic about Q3, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. Our overall focus continues to be on getting faster and better at understanding and satisfying our customer needs while providing them with a world-class in-store experience. In addition to focusing on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customer needs. With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martyn."

This morning, I will focus my remarks on providing an update on our International businesses. As you know, Martin Waters will provide you with more a complete update on our overall international strategy at our investor update meeting in New York on October 19. So I'll only hit the highlights today. 
Now one of those highlights is that we, along with our partners, continue to be very much on track to open approximately 130 stores this year outside of the United States. Taking a look at each of the businesses, let's start with Victoria's Secret's International business. In the second quarter, we opened 2 Victoria's Secret stores in Canada, in Toronto and Calgary, bringing the total in Canada to 6 Victoria's Secret stores and 8 Pink stores. 
These stores continue to do very well and are exceeding our sales expectations, and we plan to open another 6 locations in the fall. Our partners opened 6 Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in the second quarter, bringing the total there to 24 stores. In addition, our partners plan to open another 39 stores by the end of the year. Sales productivity in these stores continue to be very impressive. 
 
And finally, we continue to be on track to open our flagship store on New Bond Street in London next summer. And we're also pleased to announce that we will open another 2 to 3 full assortment mall-based stores in London next summer as well. In summary, all of our Victoria's Secret stores outside the United States continue to perform very well, and we are very enthusiastic about the global opportunities for this brand. 
And next, turning to BBW. We opened 3 stores in Canada in the second quarter bringing our total to 62. These stores continue to achieve sales volumes above our U.S. averages. And we plan to open another 7 stores over the remainder of the year. We opened another 2 stores under our partnership with Alshaya in the Middle East in the second quarter, bringing the total there to 8 stores. These stores also continue to do very well. Our partners will open another 12 stores in the Middle East and Turkey this fall. 
Turning to La Senza. Although business is not significant to our overall results, our Canadian business has been slower to turn around than we would've liked. It's being impacted in part by a very challenging Canadian retail environment, where mall traffic levels were down low-double digits in the second quarter. La Senza comp store sales increased 1% in the quarter, driven by a strong semi-annual sale and incremental promotional activity. The La Senza International business has been strong with retail sales up significantly in the quarter. Our partners opened another 9 stores in the second quarter, bringing our total to 250 stores, and our partners plan to open another 40 stores in the remainder of the year. Total La Senza operating income was about flat to last year in the quarter and remains at about breakeven. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to be very pleased with the company's overall record-setting performance. This performance was driven by an intense focus on the fundamentals, coupled with an orientation to getting faster and more agile and staying close to our customers. Although we obviously recognize that the current environment is very uncertain, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to managing business while also aggressively pursuing every opportunity to get even better. Thanks. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Amie."

And it's important to reiterate a few things and that is with respect to total expenses, the company has been and will continue to be very committed to growing expenses slower than sales. And as we were looking back at some things, we've done that for 7 consecutive quarters. And so that commitment is there, and it's in the results. And as you know, Kimberly our expenses are in 2 categories, in the buying and occupancy line and in the SG&A line. So with respect to the SG&A component of that, we are managing expenses within the quarter and a lot of the SG&A expenses do flex with sales. And we're making various investments that Sharen and Andrew could elaborate on, that we believe are customer-focused and improve the customer experience and are contributing to a very good experience for customers and translating through to the sales line. But with all that said, very focused on expenses growing slower than sales which they are. It's part of our path to '15 framework, which we're making good progress on. And specifically about your question, we do manage within the quarter in terms of that sales increase. We're making sure we've got the right service experience for the customer, so we put more hours in the store, for example, that's our biggest category of SG&A expense. And we do make other discrete decisions within the quarter that relate to top line results. And we think, overall, it's working pretty well."

So we continue to see that as a concept that can travel well, not only in the airport, but potentially off-airport as we're starting to do more and more of -- and it really leads to the Victoria's Secret brand into the rest of the world. It kind of seeds the brand with customer, gives us a good read and react perception of how the customer is reacting to the brand, which has been fabulous. And we continue to see that as a big part of our way forward. In terms of the structure of the business, we are moving that business more and more to a traditional franchise structure, royalty-based. There will be continuous relationships that will be more in the wholesale model because of the duty-free operations in airports. But more dominantly, that will be franchise versus wholesale, and we see a great future for it."

And we are, so far, a few days into that launch. Very pleased with the performance we're seeing on all metrics associated with that launch. In terms of our flexibility for the back half, I agree with everything that Sharen said. In a similar way, we plan conservatively going into the season in terms of how we have inventory positioned. We have used our speed initiatives to get the flexibility to either chase with any upside or react in cuts with any downside. In a similar way, on promotional activity, we go into every season planning to essentially anniversary prior year promotional activity. And then as we get in the season, we are flexible to ramp that down if we see better performance in full price selling as we did in the spring season or if necessary if the macro environment were to worsen, we can obviously ramp that up as well.

And we expect to get some leverage on the buying and occupancy line also. And those 2 things largely offset for a flattish gross margin rate for the balance of the year. So that's our view, and we'll obviously work hard to maximize the results on a dollar rate basis, but that's our going-in assumption. With respect to inventory, 3 or 4 methods, some of it are not a bad thing, repetitious, I mean we're very focused on the management team here, very focused on it. With respect to growth, we expect flattish inventory per foot maybe up slightly by month but clearly well below sales results. So that discipline continues. Clearly, there are some differences between unit growth and dollar growth, depending upon what part of the business that you are talking about. We're not going to go into great detail about that, but there are some differences depending upon what part of the business you're looking at. And we look at that units and dollars all the time, both on a selling basis and on an inventory position basis. But again, I don't think meaningful to the overall understanding of how we're managing inventory. What's most important is we're clearly focused on growing inventories slower than sales, improving turn and continuing to get better at speed and agility, which we've made progress on, but we're working hard to make even more progress. We think there's a lot more opportunity."

We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $0.25 per share versus $0.18 last year. Our reported results was $0.31 per share versus $0.18 last year. This year",1249,"Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $0.25 per share versus $0.18 last year. Our reported results was $0.31 per share versus $0.18 last year. This year's reported third quarter results include an income tax benefit primarily due to resolutions of certain tax matters of $16.7 million or $0.06 per share.  Our results discussed on this call excludes the significant items.
To take you through the third quarter results as detailed on Page 3 of the presentation. Net sales were $2.173 billion versus $1.983 billion last year and comps increased 9%. The gross margin rate increased 10 basis points to 36.1% as leveraged on occupancy expense. Offset is declined in the merchandise margin rate. As expected, our third quarter merchandise margin rate was negatively impacted by increased cost. We continue to focus on managing total expense growth at a rate that is lower than sales. Total expenses, the combination of buying and occupancy and SG&A, increased by 5% and leveraged as a percent of sales. SG&A dollars increased by $34 million or 6% and the SG&A rate leveraged by 90 basis points. A significant portion of our SG&A is variable, and we will continue to manage that proactively throughout the quarter in response to our sales trends. Principally, all of our SG&A expense growth in the third quarter relates to investments that we make in store selling to support and drive sales growth. These investments include higher selling payroll related to the growth in sales, increased investment in training and investment in other store initiatives, including technology. 
Turning to operating income on Page 5 of the presentation. Total operating income increased $37 million or 25% and 100 basis points as a percent of sales to $186.1 million or 8.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $25.6 million or 90 basis points as a percent of sales to $148.8 million or 11.3% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $8.9 million or 130 basis points as a percent of sales to $40.6 million or 8.1% of sales. And the other segment operating loss improved by $2.5 million to $3.3 million driven by improved profitability at Mast. Total nonoperating expenses increased by $16.6 million driven by increased interest expense associated with the $1 billion additional  bond issuance. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 9. Retail inventories per square foot at cost and of the quarter up 2% versus last year. We repurchased 4.8 million shares of stock in the third quarter to $172 million. We completed our previous $500 million share repurchase program and the board authorized a new $250 million program on November 3. 
Turning to Page 10 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011 adjusted earnings per share between $1.28 and $1.43 in the fourth quarter against last year's record $1.26 result. This forecast reflects a low-single digit comp increase. Also, as we previously announced at the beginning of November, we sold a 51% interest in our third-party sourcing business. We retained 100% ownership of our intimate apparel and personal care in beauty sourcing business. We received $125 million in net pretax cash, and we expect to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $115 million in the fourth quarter. This gain is not included in our guidance. 
We have included in scheduled raw materials on Page 11, which describes the anticipated impact of this sale on our reported results. Essentially, we will no longer consolidated results related to the third-party sourcing business and will account for 49% ownership under the equity method of accounting. Sales and profits related to the third-party sourcing business will come out as the other segment. The third-party, as you know, the third-party sourcing business is a lower-margin business at approximate mid-single digit operating margin rate, so our gross margin rate and the operating income rate will be positively impacted while our SG&A rate will be negatively impacted. The transaction will have a diluted impact of roughly $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our guidance. We expect the fourth quarter merchandise margin rate to be up significantly as the sale of the third-party sourcing business will benefit our merchandise margin rate by approximately 300 basis points. Absent this impact, we expect the merchandise margin rate to continue to be down negatively impacted by cost increases. We expect the buying and occupancy rates to increase slightly driven by the negative impact of the sale of the third-party sourcing business. Excluding this impact, buying and occupancy costs would leverage on a low-single digit comp in the high-volume fourth quarter. We expect that gross margin rate to be up significantly given the merchandise margin and buying and occupancy results I just discussed. This sale will favorably impact our gross margin rate by about 250 basis points, and again absent this impact, our gross margin rate would be down slightly. We expect the fourth quarter SG&A rate to increase driven by a negative impact related to the third-party sourcing business sales of about 150 basis points. Excluding this impact, the SG&A rate would leverage on low-single-digit comps. The sale of third-party sourcing business would favorably impact our fourth quarter operating income rate by about 100 basis points. 
Moving to inventories, we expect to end fourth quarter with the inventory per square foot roughly up low- to mid-single digit to last year. The end of fourth quarter cash includes a full quarter of inventory related to the timing of Chinese New Year this year, which has an impact of approximately 4 percentage points per foot. For the full year, we are protecting a mid- to high-single-digit positive comps. We expect our gross margin rate to be up driven roughly equally by improvement in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy leverage. The third-party sourcing business sale will benefit our full year gross margin rate by roughly 70 basis points. Excluding this impact, our gross margin rate would still be up for the year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to be roughly flat, negatively impacted by the sale by about 50 basis points. Nonoperating expenses are projected for the year at about $250 million consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discreet items, our tax rate would be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about $306 million in the fourth quarter and $315 million for the full year. So assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.38 and $2.53 per share. Versus our previous guidance, this forecast reflects our third quarter being less than dilutive impact of the third-party sourcing business sale. We are projecting 2011 CapEx of about $425 million. As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 55 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow for 2011 of about $700 million, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash and cash position, along with additional availability under our revolving credit facility result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

The Victoria's Secret segment achieved record sale and profit in the third quarter, a result of which we are proud. This morning, I'll share with you the key drivers of our success. I'll review third quarter",671,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. The Victoria's Secret segment achieved record sale and profit in the third quarter, a result of which we are proud. This morning, I'll share with you the key drivers of our success. I'll review third quarter financial results and end by briefly discussing how we're thinking about fourth quarter. Let's begin with what we've been doing to deliver our results. 
We continue to stay focused on our core categories, bras and panties supported by a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile everyday. We remained purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and conservatism. We brought this together in a well-told ran story across channel. We told that story through innovative product, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. And finally, critical to our success is our customer connection. We work everyday to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction. 
Now turning to our stores' financial performance. Our third quarter results are detailed on Page 13 of your presentation material. In the Victoria's Secret store channel, third quarter comps were up 13% and total sales were up 12%, increasing to $942 million with a 2-year comp of 27%. This result was driven by strength across the assortment. Customers continue to respond favorably to the fresh and fashion wide assortment that we are providing. Examples of our third quarter launches that contributed to this include the Showstopper Bra, the PINK Heartbreaker Bra, the Unforgettable Bra and our Gorgeous Bra, all launches were strong and met our expectation. We found success by complementing our bra launches with the Beauty fragrance launch, a great example [indiscernible] concurrently with our launch of the Gorgeous Bra, driving sales up for both the bra and fragrance business to last year. As with prior quarters in-store execution have been critical to our sales growth, and we again achieved record conversion for the quarter. This is the ninth consecutive quarter we achieved record conversion. 
The third quarter merchandise margin rate was down significantly to last year. Margin rate was impacted by cost pressures in PINK and positive response to our customer programs, including different purchase offers. We leveraged buying occupancy and SG&A expense, and this combined with our top line growth, drove our operating profit up over 15% versus last year. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Third quarter sales increased by 8% to $277 million with the 3-year sales growth of 11%. Top line growth was driven across the assortment with particular strengths in PINK, sleepwear, panties and the clothing. The merchandise margin rate declined with the product increases and increased use of shipping offers. Total expenses leveraged in the quarter, so operating income dollars increased by over 30%, and the operating income rate improve. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter. We've been preparing for holiday already. We are looking forward to Black Friday and the balance of the fourth quarter. Our assortments continue to be fashion-wide and are coupled with expert in-store and online execution. We are cautiously optimistic. Following the all Black Friday weekend, we are very excited about Victoria's Secret fashion show, which will air on November 29 with Kanye West, Nikki and Maroon 5 performing as our musical entertainment. We will not just focus on our bra and panties business, nor we will reduce focus on our robust Disney options such as beauty and sleepwear. These categories are our primary investments heading in the all-important holiday time period. We will maintain maximum agility to chase what is working. We will stay balanced in our approach by managing our inventory and expenses to grow at a rate slower than sales, and we will chase this aggressively where appropriate. In closing, we are pleased with our performance that continue to see opportunities for improvement. We will stay close to our customers and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thank you, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

We delivered sales on operating income growth versus last year's strong performance. We continue to deliver improved results by maintaining focus on 3 key categories: our Signature Collection, the anti-bac soap and sanitizing business and our home fragrance assortment. The customer also responded well to the increased presence of seasonally relevant fragrances and forms. Performance improved versus last year Signature Collection driven by the successful launch of the new fragrance [indiscernible] The anti-bac business delivered growth in our soap and PocketBac collections by increasing novelty and fashion newness in our seasonally-relevant fragrances. 
Operating performance continues to be driven by candle and new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in forms and novelty in our diffuser and other categories. Transactions were up versus last year driven by traffic and continued improvement in our conversion rate. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter as detailed on Page 15 of your materials. 
Bath & Body Works third quarter comps were up 9%. Total sales for the quarter were $504 million, up 8% or $36 million -- up $36 million versus last year. For the quarter, the operating income was $41 million, up $9 million or 28% from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 8% in the quarter and up to last year. Gross margin rate in the quarter was flat to last year. Merchandise margin rate declined somewhat but was offset by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The decline in merchandise margin rate was driven primarily by increasing costs, and we were able to leverage SG&A expenses versus last year. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down from last year. We continue to drive inventories down year-over-year while retaining a high in-stock position. BBW Direct channel delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrances. This month, we began our holiday theme with animation in the windows and front of shop focused on our holiday collections, home fragrance items and gifts. Throughout the month, the shop will be focused on new fragrances, great seasonal gifts and the launch of our newest Signature Collection fragrance, The Enchanted. We're excited about the assortment and the visual appeal of our stores. Our overall focus continues to be about getting faster and better understanding and satisfying our customer needs while providing them with a world-class in-store experience. In addition to focusing on products and fragrance launches, we will continue to test results of new products offering and promotional strategies while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to  our customers' needs. With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."

As most of you know, Martin Waters have covered a complete update on our overall international strategy, including our accomplishments to date and our plans for 2011 and 2012  at our October Investor Update",682,"Well, thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. As most of you know, Martin Waters have covered a complete update on our overall international strategy, including our accomplishments to date and our plans for 2011 and 2012  at our October Investor Update Meeting in New York. So today, I'll just hit the highlights. 
One of those highlights is that we, along with our partners, continue to be on track to open approximately 120 stores this year outside the United States. Taking a look at each of the businesses, let's start with our Victoria's Secret international business. In the third quarter, we opened 3 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and 1 PINK store in Canada, bringing in the total in Canada to 9 Victoria's Secret stores and 8 PINK stores. These stores continue to do very well for us, and we plan to open another 2 locations in the fourth quarter of this year. Our partners opened 8 Victoria's Secret Beauty and accessory stores in the third quarter bringing the total to 32 stores. In addition, our partners plan to open another 27 stores by the end of the year for a total of 59 stores at year-end. So productivity in these stores continue to be very impressive. We also continue to be on track to open our new store in London next summer along with another 2 to 3 full assortment model-based stores in the U.K. And as we announced at the Update Meeting, we also plan to open 3 mall-based full assortment stores in the Middle East in late 2012. So in summary, all of our Victoria's Secret stores outside the United States continue to perform very well, and we are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities for this brand. 
Turning to BBW. We opened 3 stores in Canada in the third quarter bringing our total to 65. These stores continue to achieve sales volumes well above our U.S. average. In fact, our most recent opening in Newfoundland broke the record for opening these sales across the chain. As a result, we plan to open another 4 stores over the remainder of the year. We opened another 6 stores, 6 new BBW stores under our partnership with Alshaya in the Middle East in the third quarter bringing the total of 14. These stores also continue to do very well. Our partners will open another 6 stores in the Middle East and Turkey in the fourth quarter, and we are on track to open in Russia in early 2012. 
Now turning to La Senza. You recall that this brand operates through company-owned stores in Canada and under our franchise partnership model in the rest of the world. Although the business is not significant to our overall results, our Canadian business has been slower to turn around than we would've liked and is also being impacted in part by a very challenging Canadian retail environment. La Senza's comparable store sales decreased 4% in the quarter. The La Senza International business has been strong with retail sales up significantly in the quarter. Our partners opened another 5 stores in the third quarter bringing the total to 267 stores. And our partners plan to open another 30 stores in the remainder of the year for a total of almost 300 stores. Total La Senza operating income was about flat to last year in the quarter and remains at about break even. So overall, we're very pleased with our progress towards developing the foundation for a sustainable international business model with outstanding long-term growth potential for all of our brands. In closing, I want to reiterate that we also continue to be very pleased with the company's overall performance, which has been driven by an intense focus on fundamentals, coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile, and of course, staying close to our customers. We remain focused on what we can control, and we will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to managing the business while also aggressively pursuing every opportunity to get even better. Thanks, and now I turn it back over to Amie."

It's not a distorted amount of newness that are going into that better price point, but we are seeing very good sell-through. So the key message is, yes, we are wishing the best price point, but the offering is still very balanced. The sales are still very balanced and the sell-throughs are very balanced in the good, better, best price point. As we think about, as you see, you do not see much change going into the fourth quarter, nor the first quarter in terms of the costing."

This was driven by promotional activity what I won't categorized as very tough retail environment. From what we can see in terms of reported results for Canada, the Canadian market in general remains very difficult. I mean, we see mall traffic down 10% in the quarter and most of the retailers in Canada are reporting negative comps. So it's a tough environment. That said, we continue to be very conservative of our plans for the business. We're applying learnings as we go to make sure that business for success in the future. Our inventories are very clean as we enter holiday, and we're optimistic about the prospects for La Senza in the fourth quarter. Your question about the international side of La Senza is interesting, different retail markets across to distributed across the world. And as I said, our La Senza International franchise business continues to show very good growth for us and even more indicated by the fact that partners are continuing to aggressively open new stores across the globe for a total of 55 stores this year alone and a lot more to come next year.

We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $0.25 per share versus $0.18 last year. Our reported result was $0.31 per share versus $0.18 last year. This year'",1255,"Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $0.25 per share versus $0.18 last year. Our reported result was $0.31 per share versus $0.18 last year. This year's reported third quarter result included an income tax benefit primarily due to resolutions of certain tax matters of $16.7 million or $0.06 per share. All results discussed on this call excludes this significant item.
To take you through the third quarter results as detailed on Page 3 of the presentation. Net sales were $2.173 billion versus $1.983 billion last year, and comps increased 9%. The gross margin rate increased 10 basis points to 36.1% as leveraged on [indiscernible] occupancy expense offset it's decline in the merchandise margin rate. As expected, our third quarter merchandise margin rate was negatively impacted by increased cost. We continue to focus on managing total expense growth at a rate that is lower than sales. Total expenses, the combination of buying and occupancy and SG&A, increased by 5% and leveraged as a percent of sales. SG&A dollars increased by $34 million or 6%, and the SG&A rate leverage by 90 basis points. A significant portion of our SG&A is variable and we will continue to manage that proactively throughout the quarter in response to our sales trends. Principally, all of our SG&A expense growth in the third quarter relates to investments that we make in store selling to support and drive sales growth. These investments include higher selling payroll related to the growth in sales, increased investment in training, and investment in other store initiatives, including technology. 
Turning to operating income on Page 5 of the presentation. Total operating income increased $37 million or 25%, and 100 basis points as a percent of sales to $186.1 million or 8.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $25.6 million or 90 basis points as a percent of sales to $148.8 million or 11.3% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $8.9 million or 130 basis points as a percent of sales to $40.6 million or 8.1% of sales. And the other segment operating loss improved by $2.5 million to $3.3 million driven by improved profitability at Mast. Total nonoperating expenses increased by $16.6 million driven by increased interest expense associated with the $1 billion bond issuance.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 9. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 2% versus last year. We repurchased 4.8 million shares of stock in the third quarter for $172 million. We completed our previous $500 million share repurchase program and the board authorized a new $250 million program on November 3.
Turning to Page 10 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011, adjusted earnings per share between $1.28 and $1.43 in the fourth quarter against last year's record $1.26 result. This forecast reflects a low-single digit comp increase. Also, as we previously announced, at the beginning of November we sold a 51% interest in our third-party sourcing business. We retained 100% ownership of our intimate apparel and personal care and beauty sourcing business. We received $125 million in net pretax cash, and we expect to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $115 million in the fourth quarter. This gain is not included in our guidance.
We have included a scheduled in your materials, on Page 11, which describes the anticipated impacts of this sale on our reported results. Essentially, we will no longer consolidate results related to the third-party sourcing business, and will account for our 49% ownership under the equity method of accounting. Sales and profits related to the third-party sourcing business will come out of the other segment. The third-party -- as you know, the third-party sourcing business is a lower-margin business, at approximate a mid-single digit operating margin rate, so our gross margin rate and the operating income rate will be positively impacted while our SG&A rate will be negatively impacted. The transaction will have a dilutive impact of roughly $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our guidance. We expect the fourth quarter merchandise margin rate to be up significantly as the sale of the third-party sourcing business will benefit our merchandise margin rate by approximately 300 basis points. Absent this impact, we expect the merchandise margin rate to continue to be down, negatively impacted by cost increases. We expect the buying and occupancy rate to increase slightly, driven by the negative impact of the sale of the third-party sourcing business. Excluding this impact, buying and occupancy cost would leverage on a low-single digit comp in the high-volume fourth quarter. We expect the gross margin rate to be up significantly given the merchandise margin and buying and occupancy result I just discussed. This sale will favorably impact our gross margin rate by about 250 basis points and again, absent this impact, our gross margin rate would be down slightly. We expect the fourth quarter SG&A rate to increase, driven by a negative impact related to the third-party sourcing business sale of about 150 basis points. Excluding this impact, the SG&A rate would leverage on low-single digit comps. The sale of third-party sourcing business will favorably impact our fourth quarter operating income rate by about 100 basis points. 
Moving to inventories. We expect to end fourth quarter with the inventory per square foot roughly up low- to mid-single digit to last year. The end of quarter fourth cash includes a full quarter of inventory related to the timing of Chinese New Year this year, which has an impact of approximately 4 percentage points per foot. For the full year, we are projecting mid- to high-single digit positive comps. We expect our gross margin rate to be up, driven roughly equally by improvement in the merchandise margin rate, and buying and occupancy leverage. The third-party sourcing business sale will benefit our full year gross margin rate by roughly 70 basis points. Excluding this impact, our gross margin rate would still be up for the year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to be roughly flat, negatively impacted by the sale, by about 50 basis points. Nonoperating expenses are projected, for the year, at about $250 million consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discreet items, our tax rate would be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about $306 million in the fourth quarter and $315 million for the full year. So assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.38 and $2.53 per share. Versus our previous guidance, this forecast reflects our third quarter fee plus the dilutive impact of the third-party sourcing business sale. We are projecting 2011 CapEx of about $425 million. As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 55 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year.
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $700 million, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

I'll be review third",690,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. The Victoria's Secret segment achieved both record sales and profit in the third quarter, a result of which we are proud. This morning, I'll share with you the key drivers of our success. I'll be review third quarter financial results and end by briefly discussing how we're thinking about fourth quarter.  Let's begin with what we've been doing to deliver our results.
We continue to stay focused on our core categories, bras and panties, supported by a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile everyday. We remain purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and conservatism. We brought this together in a well-told brand story across channel. We told that story through innovative product, steady newness, the right fashion, and excellent in-store and online execution. And finally, critical to our success is our customer connection. We work everyday to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction.
Now turning to our store financial performance. Our third quarter results are detailed on Page 13 of your presentation material. In the Victoria's Secret store channel, third quarter comps were up 13% and total sales were up 12%, increasing to $942 million with a 2-year comp of 27%. This result was driven by strength across the assortment. Customers continue to respond favorably to the fresh and fashion wide assortment that we are providing. Examples of our third quarter launches that continued to -- that contributed to this include the Showstopper Bra, the PINK Heartbreaker Bra, the Unforgettable Bra, and our Gorgeous Bra. All launches were strong and met our expectation. We found success by complementing our bra launches with the Beauty fragrance launch. A great example is the Gorgeous fragrance which landed concurrently with our launch of the Gorgeous Bra, driving sales up for both the bra and fragrance business to last year. As with prior quarters in-store execution have been critical to our sales growth and we, again, achieved record conversion for the quarter. This is the ninth consecutive quarter we have achieved record conversion. The third quarter merchandise margin rate was down significantly to last year. Margin rate was impacted by cost pressures in PINK and positive response to our customer programs, including different purchase offers. We leveraged buying occupancy and SG&A expense, and this combined with our top line growth, drove our operating profit up over 15% versus last year.
Now let's review performance at Direct. Third quarter sales increased by 8% to $277 million with a 2-year sales growth of 11%. Top line growth was driven across the assortment with particular strength in PINK, sleepwear, panties, and knit clothing. The merchandise margin rate declined with the product cost increases and increased use of shipping offers. Total expenses leveraged in the quarter, so operating income dollars increased by over 30%, and the operating income rate improve. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter. We've been preparing for holiday and are ready. We are looking forward to Black Friday and the balance of fourth quarter. Our assortments continue to be fashion-right and are coupled with excellent in-store and online execution. We are cautiously optimistic. Following the all important Black Friday weekend, we are very excited about Victoria's Secret fashion show, which will air on November 29 with Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, and Maroon 5 performing as our musical entertainment. We will not lose focus on our bra and panty business, nor we will lose focus in our -- on our robust business options such as beauty and sleepwear. These categories are our primary investments heading in to the all-important holiday time period. We will maintain maximum agility to chase what is working. We will stay balanced in our approach by managing our inventory and expenses to grow at a rate slower than sales, and we will chase aggressively where appropriate.
In closing, we are pleased with our performance that continue to see opportunities for improvement. We will stay close to our customers and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thank you, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."
285544,142489050,193516,"Limited Brands, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2011",2011-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sharon, and good morning, everyone.At Bath & Body Works, we're pleased with the results of the third quarter. We delivered sales on operating income growth versus last year's strong performance. We continued to -- continue to deliver improved",495,"Thank you, Sharon, and good morning, everyone.
At Bath & Body Works, we're pleased with the results of the third quarter. We delivered sales on operating income growth versus last year's strong performance. We continued to -- continue to deliver improved results by maintaining focus on 3 key categories: our Signature Collection, the anti-bac soap and sanitizing business, and our home fragrance assortment. The customer also responded well to the increased presence of seasonally relevant fragrances and forms. Performance improved versus last year, in Signature Collection, driven by the successful launch of the new fragrance Paris Amour. The anti-bac business delivered growth in our soap and PocketBac collections by increasing novelty and fashion newness in our seasonally-relevant fragrances. Home fragrance performance continues to be driven by candles in new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in forms and novelty in our diffuser and SCENTPORTABLE categories. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by traffic and continued improvement in our conversion rate.
So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter as detailed on Page 15 of your materials. Bath & Body Works third quarter comps were up 9%. Total sales for the quarter were $504 million, up 8% or $36 million -- up $36 million versus last year. For the quarter, the operating income was $41 million, up $9 million or 28% from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales is 8% in the quarter and up  to last year. Gross margin rate in the quarter was flat to last year. Merchandise margin rate declined somewhat but was offset by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The decline in merchandise margin rate was driven primarily by increasing costs, and we were able to leverage SG&A expenses versus last year. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. We continue to drive inventories down year-over-year while maintaining a high stock -- high in-stock positions. The BBW Direct channels have delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrances. This month, we began our holiday theme with animation in windows and front-of-shop focus on our holiday collections, home fragrance items, and gifts. Throughout the month, the shop will be focused on new fragrances, great seasonal gifts, and the launch of our newest Signature Collection fragrance, the Enchanted. We're excited about the assortment and the visual appeal of our stores. Our overall focus continues to be about getting faster and better understanding in satisfying our customer needs while providing them with a world-class in-store experience. In addition to focusing on products and fragrant launches -- fragrance launches, we will continue to test and weigh the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to act quickly to our customers' needs.
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."
285544,142489050,193516,"Limited Brands, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2011",2011-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Well, thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. As most of you know, Martin Waters have covered a complete update on our overall international strategy, including our accomplishments to date and our plans for 2011 and 2012 at our October Investor Update M",689,"Well, thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. As most of you know, Martin Waters have covered a complete update on our overall international strategy, including our accomplishments to date and our plans for 2011 and 2012 at our October Investor Update Meeting in New York. So today, I'll just hit the highlights.
One of those highlights is that we, along with our partners, continue to be on track to open approximately 120 stores this year, outside the United States. Now, taking a look at each of the businesses, let's start with our Victoria's Secret international business. In the third quarter, we opened 3 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and 1 PINK store in Canada, bringing in to the total in Canada to 9 Victoria's Secret stores and 8 PINK stores. These stores continue to do very well for us and we plan to open another 2 locations in the fourth quarter of this year. Our partners opened 8 Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in the third quarter, bringing the total to 32 stores. In addition, our partners plan to open another 27 stores by the end of the year for a total of 59 stores at year-end. Sale productivity in these stores continue to be very impressive. We also continue to be on track to open our new Bond Street store in London next summer, along with another 2 to 3 full assortment mall-based stores in the U.K. And as we announced at the update meeting, we also plan to open 3 mall-based full assortment stores in the Middle East in late 2012. So in summary, all of our Victoria's Secret stores outside the United States continue to perform very well, and we are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities for this brand.
Turning to BBW. We opened 3 stores in Canada in the third quarter, bringing our total to 65. These stores continue to achieve sales volumes well above our U.S. average. In fact, our most recent opening in Newfoundland broke the record for opening week sales across the chain. As a result, we plan to open another 4 stores over the remainder of the year. We opened another 6 stores, 6 new BBW stores, under our partnership with Alshaya in the Middle East in the third quarter, bringing the total of 14. These stores also continue to do very well. Our partners will open another 6 stores in the Middle East and Turkey in the fourth quarter, and we are on track to open in Russia in early 2012.
Now turning to La Senza. You will recall that this brand operates through company-owned stores in Canada and under our franchise partnership model in the rest of the world. Although the business is not significant to our overall results, our Canadian business has been slower to turn around than we would have liked. And is also being impacted, in part, by a very challenging Canadian retail environment. La Senza's comparable store sales decreased 4% in the quarter. The La Senza International business has been strong with retail sales up significantly in the quarter. Our partners opened another 5 stores in the third quarter, bringing the total to 267 stores. And our partners plan to open another 30 stores in the remainder of the year for almost -- a total of almost 300 stores. Total La Senza operating income was about flat to last year in the quarter and remains at about breakeven.
So overall, we're very pleased with our progress towards developing the foundation for a sustainable international business model, with outstanding long-term growth potential for all of our brands. In closing, I want to reiterate that we also continue to be very pleased with the company's overall performance, which has been driven by an intense focus on fundamentals, coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile and, of course, staying close to our customers. We remain focused on what we can control, and we will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to managing the business while also aggressively pursuing every opportunity to get even better.
Thanks, and now I turn it back over to Amie."

As we think about -- as you see, do not see much change going into the fourth quarter, nor the first quarter in terms of the costing."

This was driven by a bit more of a promotional activity what I won't categorized as very tough retail environment. From what we can see, in terms of reported results for Canada, the Canadian market in general remains very difficult. I mean, we see mall traffic down 10% in the quarter and most of retailers in Canada are reporting negative comps. So it's a tough environment. That said, we continue to be very conservative about our plans for the business. We're applying learnings as we go to make sure that we're positioning the business for success in the future. Our inventories are very clean as we enter holiday and we're optimistic about the prospects for La Senza in the fourth quarter. Your question about the international side of La Senza is interesting, different retail markets distributed across the world. And as I said, our La Senza International franchise business continues to show very good growth for us, and even more indicated by the fact that partners are continuing to aggressively open new stores across the globe for a total of 55 stores this year alone.

One is about being the brand that relates a well-told story and having the right amount of compelling assortment. Number two would be the compelling assortments focus in our core categories, being able to test, read, react into the right fashion at the right time. One of the good pieces that we have is really our selling and service models that we are really trying to improve on, everyday, within the stores. So when we think about how to train our people, how do we really think about doing things differently than we have in the past, which we're also seeing great results in terms of driving that productivity. We also believe that as we continue to move to have a seamless interaction between store channels and Direct channel, such as buying online, returning in stores, which we have rolled that out the for this fall season, is also another opportunity for us to continue to improve the productivity. Nothing works on us well towards our seasoned agility, constant flow, constant newness, that I believe we're just at the beginning of the beginning on this journey as we go-forward. Nick?"

We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $0.25 per share versus $0.18 last year. Our reported result was $0.31 per share versus $0.18 last year. This year",1256,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $0.25 per share versus $0.18 last year. Our reported result was $0.31 per share versus $0.18 last year. This year's reported third quarter result included an income tax benefit primarily due to resolutions of certain tax matters of $16.7 million or $0.06 per share. All results discussed on this call exclude this significant item.
To take you through the third quarter results as detailed on Page 3 of the presentation. Net sales were $2.173 billion versus $1.983 billion last year, and comps increased 9%. The gross margin rate increased 10 basis points to 36.1% as leveraged on [indiscernible] occupancy expense offset a decline in the merchandise margin rate. As expected, our third quarter merchandise margin rate was negatively impacted by increased costs. We continue to focus on managing total expense growth at a rate that is lower than sales. Total expenses, the combination of buying and occupancy and SG&A increased by 5% and leveraged as a percent of sales. SG&A dollars increased by $34 million or 6%, and the SG&A rate leverage by 90 basis points. A significant portion of our SG&A is variable and we will continue to manage that proactively throughout the quarter in response to our sales trends. Principally all of our SG&A expense growth in the third quarter relates to investments that we make in store selling to support and drive sales growth. These investments include higher selling payroll related to the growth in sales, increased investment in training and investment in other store initiatives, including technology. 
Turning to operating income on Page 5 of the presentation, total operating income increased $37 million or 25% and 100 basis points as a percent of sales to $186.1 million or 8.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $25.6 million or 90 basis points as a percent of sales to $148.8 million or 11.3% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $8.9 million or 130 basis points as a percent of sales to $40.6 million or 8.1% of sales. And the other segment operating loss improved by $2.5 million to $3.3 million driven by improved profitability at Mast. Total nonoperating expenses increased by $16.6 million driven by increased interest expense associated with the $1 billion bond issuance.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 9. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 2% versus last year. We repurchased 4.8 million shares of stock in the third quarter for $172 million. We completed our previous $500 million share repurchase program and the Board authorized a new $250 million program on November 3.
Turning to Page 10 of the presentation for our forecast for 2011, adjusted earnings per share between $1.28 and $1.43 in the fourth quarter against last year's record $1.26 result. This forecast reflects a low-single digit comp increase. Also as we previously announced, at the beginning of November we sold a 51% interest in our third-party sourcing business. We retain 100% ownership of our intimate apparel and personal care and beauty sourcing business. We received $125 million in net pretax cash, and we expect to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $115 million in the fourth quarter. This gain is not included in our guidance.
We have included a scheduled in your materials, on Page 11, which describes the anticipated impacts of this sale on our reported results. Essentially, we will no longer consolidate results related to the third-party sourcing business and will account for our 49% ownership under the equity method of accounting. Sales and profits related to the third-party sourcing business will come out of the other segment. The third-party -- as you know, the third-party sourcing business is a lower-margin business at approximate a mid-single digit operating margin rate, so our gross margin rate and the operating income rate will be positively impacted, while our SG&A rate will be negatively impacted. The transaction will have a dilutive impact of roughly $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our guidance. We expect the fourth quarter merchandise margin rate to be up significantly as the sale of the third-party sourcing business will benefit our merchandise margin rate by approximately 300 basis points. Absent this impact, we expect the merchandise margin rate to continue to be down, negatively impacted by cost increases. We expect the buying and occupancy rate to increase slightly, driven by the negative impact of the sale of the third-party sourcing business. Excluding this impact, buying and occupancy cost would leverage on a low-single digit comp in the high-volume fourth quarter. We expect the gross margin rate to be up significantly given the merchandise margin and buying and occupancy result I just discussed. This sale will favorably impact our gross margin rate by about 250 basis points and again absent this impact, our gross margin rate would be down slightly. We expect the fourth quarter SG&A rate to increase, driven by a negative impact related to the third-party sourcing business sale of about 150 basis points. Excluding this impact, the SG&A rate would leverage on low-single digit comps. The sale of the third-party sourcing business will favorably impact our fourth quarter operating income rate by about 100 basis points. 
Moving to inventories, we expect to end fourth quarter with the inventory per square foot roughly up low- to mid-single digits to last year. The end of quarter fourth cash includes a full quarter of inventory related to the timing of Chinese New Year this year, which has an impact of approximately 4 percentage points per foot. For the full year, we are projecting mid- to high-single digit positive comps. We expect our gross margin rate to be up, driven roughly equally by improvement in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy leverage. The third-party sourcing business sale will benefit our full year gross margin rate by roughly 70 basis points. Excluding this impact, our gross margin rate would still be up for the year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to be roughly flat, negatively impacted by the sale by about 50 basis points. Nonoperating expenses are projected for the year at about $250 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discreet items, our tax rate would be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about $306 million in the fourth quarter and $315 million for the full year. So assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2011 to be between $2.38 and $2.53 per share. Versus our previous guidance, this forecast reflects our third quarter fee plus the dilutive impact of the third-party sourcing business sale. We are projecting 2011 CapEx of about $425 million. As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, we plan to open roughly 40 stores this year and close roughly 55 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year.
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2011 of about $700 million, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

The Victoria's Secret segment achieved both record sales and profit in the third quarter, a result of which we are proud. This morning, I'll share with you the key drivers of our success, I'll then review third quarter financial results and end by briefly discussing how we're thinking about fourth quarter. Let's begin with what we've been doing to deliver our results.
We continue to stay focused on our core categories, bras and panties, supported by a culture that emphasizes getting faster and more agile every day. We remain purposeful in our balanced approach between managing the business with optimism and conservatism. We brought this together in a well-told brand story across channel. We told that story through innovative product, steady newness, the right fashion and excellent in-store and online execution. And finally, critical to our success is our customer connection. We work every day to stay close to her and deliver an emotional and positive experience with every interaction.
Now turning to our store financial performance. Our third quarter results are detailed on Page 13 of your presentation material. In the Victoria's Secret store channel, third quarter comps were up 13% and total sales were up 12%, increasing to $942 million with a 2-year comp of 27%. This result was driven by strength across the assortment. Customers continue to respond favorably to the fresh and fashion wide assortment that we are providing. Examples of our third quarter launches that continued to -- that contributed to this include the Showstopper Bra, the PINK Heartbreaker Bra, the Unforgettable Bra and our Gorgeous Bra. All launches were strong and met our expectations. We found success by complementing our bra launches with the Beauty fragrance launch. A great example is the Gorgeous fragrance, which landed concurrently with our launch of the Gorgeous Bra, driving sales up for both the bra and fragrance business to last year. As with prior quarters, in-store execution has been critical to our sales growth and we again achieved record conversion for the quarter. This is the ninth consecutive quarter we have achieved record conversion. The third quarter merchandise margin rate was down significantly to last year. Margin rate was impacted by cost pressures in PINK and positive response to our customer programs, including gift with purchase offers. We leveraged buying occupancy and SG&A expense and this combined with our top line growth, drove our operating profit up over 15% versus last year.
Now let's review performance at Direct. Third quarter sales increased by 8% to $277 million with a 2-year sales growth of 11%. Top line growth was driven across the assortment with particular strength in PINK, sleepwear, panties and knit clothing. The merchandise margin rate declined with the product cost increases and increased use of shipping offers. Total expenses leveraged in the quarter, so operating income dollars increased by over 30% and the operating income rate improved. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter. We've been preparing for holiday and are ready. We are looking forward to Black Friday and the balance of fourth quarter. Our assortments continue to be fashion-right and are coupled with excellent in-store and online execution. We are cautiously optimistic. Following the all-important Black Friday weekend, we are very excited about the Victoria's Secret fashion show which will air on November 29 with Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, and Maroon 5 performing as our musical entertainment. We will not lose focus on our bra and panty business, nor we will lose focus in our -- on our robust business options such as beauty and sleepwear. These categories are our primary investments heading in to the all-important holiday time period. We will maintain maximum agility to chase what is working. We will stay balanced in our approach by managing our inventory and expenses to grow at a rate slower than sales and we will chase aggressively where appropriate.
In closing, we are pleased with our performance but continue to see opportunities for improvement. We will stay close to our customers and work to drive sustained, profitable growth as our top priority. Thank you, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

The anti-bac business delivered growth in our soap and PocketBac collections by increasing novelty and fashion newness in our seasonally relevant fragrances. Home fragrance performance continues to be driven by candles in new seasonal fragrances, as well as growth in forms and novelty in our diffuser and SCENTPORTABLE categories. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by traffic and continued improvement in our conversion rate.
So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter as detailed on Page 15 of your materials. Bath & Body Works third quarter comps were up 9%. Total sales for the quarter were $504 million, up 8% or $36 million -- up $36 million versus last year. For the quarter, the operating income was $41 million, up $9 million or 28% from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 8% in the quarter and up to last year. Gross margin rate in the quarter was flat to last year. Merchandise margin rate declined somewhat, but was offset by leverage on buying and occupancy expense. The decline in merchandise margin rate was driven primarily by increasing costs, and we were able to leverage SG&A expenses versus last year. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. We continue to drive inventories down year-over-year while maintaining a high stock -- high in-stock positions. The BBW Direct channels have delivered strong sales and operating income growth versus last year.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrances. This month, we began our holiday theme with animation in the windows and front-of-shop focus on our holiday collections, home fragrance items, and gifts. Throughout the month, the shop will be focused on new fragrances, great seasonal gifts and the launch of our newest Signature Collection fragrance, the Enchanted. We're excited about the assortment and the visual appeal of our stores. Our overall focus continues to be about getting faster and better understanding in satisfying our customer needs, while providing them with a world-class in-store experience. In addition to focusing on products and fragrant launches -- fragrance launches, we will continue to test and weigh the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies while maintaining flexibility in our inventory to act quickly to our customers' needs.
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martyn."

As most of you know, Martin Waters covered a complete update on our overall international strategy, including our accomplishments to date and our plans for 2011 and 2012 at our October Investor Update Meeting",686,"Well thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. As most of you know, Martin Waters covered a complete update on our overall international strategy, including our accomplishments to date and our plans for 2011 and 2012 at our October Investor Update Meeting in New York. So today, I'll just hit the highlights.
One of those highlights is that we, along with our partners, continue to be on track to open approximately 120 stores this year outside the United States. Now, taking a look at each of the businesses, let's start with our Victoria's Secret international business. In the third quarter, we opened 3 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and 1 PINK store in Canada, bringing the total in Canada to 9 Victoria's Secret stores and 8 PINK stores. These stores continue to do very well for us and we plan to open another 2 locations in the fourth quarter of this year. Our partners opened 8 Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in the third quarter, bringing the total to 32 stores. In addition, our partners plan to open another 27 stores by the end of the year for a total of 59 stores at year-end. Sale productivity in these stores continue to be very impressive. We also continue to be on track to open our new Bond Street store in London next summer, along with another 2 to 3 full assortment mall-based stores in the U.K. And as we announced at the update meeting, we also plan to open 3 mall-based full assortment stores in the Middle East in late 2012. So in summary, all of our Victoria's Secret stores outside the United States continue to perform very well and we are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities for this brand.
Turning to BBW. We opened 3 stores in Canada in the third quarter, bringing our total to 65. These stores continue to achieve sales volumes well above our U.S. average. In fact, our most recent opening in Newfoundland broke the record for opening week sales across the chain. As a result, we plan to open another 4 stores over the remainder of the year. We opened another 6 stores, 6 new BBW stores under our partnership with Alshaya in the Middle East in the third quarter, bringing the total of 14. These stores also continue to do very well. Our partners will open another 6 stores in the Middle East and Turkey in the fourth quarter, and we are on track to open in Russia in early 2012.
Now turning to La Senza, you will recall that this brand operates through company-owned stores in Canada and under our franchise partnership model in the rest of the world. Although the business is not significant to our overall results, our Canadian business has been slower to turn around than we would have liked and is also being impacted, in part, by a very challenging Canadian retail environment. La Senza's comparable store sales decreased 4% in the quarter. The La Senza International business has been strong with retail sales up significantly in the quarter. Our partners opened another 5 stores in the third quarter, bringing the total to 267 stores and our partners plan to open another 30 stores in the remainder of the year for almost -- a total of almost 300 stores. Total La Senza operating income was about flat to last year in the quarter and remains at about breakeven.
So overall, we're very pleased with our progress towards developing the foundation for a sustainable international business model with outstanding long-term growth potential for all of our brands. In closing, I want to reiterate that we also continue to be very pleased with the company's overall performance, which has been driven by an intense focus on fundamentals, coupled with an orientation of getting faster and more agile and, of course, staying close to our customers. We remain focused on what we can control, and we will continue our disciplined and conservative approach to managing the business while also aggressively pursuing every opportunity to get even better.
Thanks, and now I turn it back over to Amie."

It's not a distorted amount of newness that are going into that better price point, but we are seeing very good sell-through. So the key message is yes, we are pushing the best price point, but the offering is still very balanced. The sales are still very balanced and the sell-throughs are very balanced in the good, better, best price point.

So all of those details are still getting sorted out a bit but at this point, we don't judge it to be material to any particular period. So that's why that is. With respect to deployment of that cash, I hope that you recognize what we do over time, which is we're very committed to returning excess cash to shareholders.

This was driven by a bit more of a promotional activity what I won't categorized as very tough retail environment.

I mean we see mall traffic down 10% in the quarter and most of retailers in Canada are reporting negative comps. So it's a tough environment. That said, we continue to be very conservative about our plans for the business. We're applying learnings as we go to make sure that we're positioning the business for success in the future. Our inventories are very clean as we enter holiday and we're optimistic about the prospects for La Senza in the fourth quarter. Your question about the international side of La Senza is interesting, different retail markets distributed across the world.
