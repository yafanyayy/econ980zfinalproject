I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.And if you",2856,"Thank you, Clayton, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for Masco's fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings call. I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you please flip to Slide #3, we'll start with the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were off 9%. Excluding unusual items in the quarter, business rationalization charges, impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles and normalizing our tax rate to 36%, we would have lost $0.08 in the quarter compared to a nickel of income in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an as reported basis, including those items and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, we would have lost approximately $2.96 in the fourth quarter. Gross margins adjusted for the items that I described earlier decreased 370 basis points to 23.2%. And for those of you who have had a chance to look at the appendix, we do have a reconciliation of EPS, gross margins, as well as operating income in the appendix. 
If you flip to Slide #4, please. We did have some significant charges in the fourth quarter. We had a goodwill and other intangible impairment of $721 million that primarily relates to our Installation-related business. I think you're all aware that on an annual basis, we do a goodwill impairment cash that's discounted cash flow, has a lot of assumptions in it. We did tweak a couple of the assumptions in terms of the terminal year reducing housing starts from 1.6 million to 1.5 million. That's about a 6% reduction and an increase in the discount rate and those two essentially drove the impairment charge. In terms of deferred tax assets, this is a very highly technical accounting area. The fact that we are in a three-year cumulative loss position in large part driven by some of the charges that we've taken over the course of the last couple of years negates previously identified tax strategies and puts us in a position where we had to record a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets of $370 million. 
Those assets incidentally are still available to us from an economic standpoint in terms of limiting tax cash taxes going forward. Both of those items cost about $2.76 in the quarter. That's the EPS impact, and I would point out that very importantly that we were able to amend our credit agreement just a couple of days ago. So we continue to have significant availability I think about $1.1 billion in terms of availability under the line. 
If you flip to Slide #5, take a quick look at the full year. Net sales on a full year basis were down 3%. Again, excluding the items I mentioned earlier, adjusting for those, our earnings per share would have been $0.16 in 2010 compared to $0.31 in 2009. I would point out and this is on the reconciliation in the back that we did have increased other expense year over last year of about $72 million pretax. That's about $0.13 in terms of earnings per share. That reflects interest, currency translation, losses and impairments for financial investments. 
Our loss on an as reported basis in the year would have been $3 per share, and gross margins as adjusted would have been down only 10 basis points to 26.4%. Working capital as a percent of sales improved to 13.4%. I'll talk a little more about that later. We generated $290 million of free cash flow and very importantly, ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash. 
If you please turn to Slide #6. Obviously, 2010 was a very challenging year for us. We came out of 2009 with a relatively strong operating performance offsetting a lot of volume drop with cost reductions and improvement in price commodity relationships and had some nice momentum going into 2010. The first half was a little more positive. I think our sales were up 2%, 32% and the second half was much more challenging. We saw housing starts slow in the second half. We saw expenditures for big-ticket repair/remodel items continue to be deferred, and I think it's a good point for me to talk about our sales to key retailers. 
In the fourth quarter, our sales to key retailers were off mid-teens. About 2/3 of that decline relates to our Cabinet-related businesses and as you know, we're exiting some products related to Cabinets. That would put our non-Cabinet business off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter. That's up against the pretty tough comp in the fourth quarter of 2009 when sales to key retail customers were up 8%, and we had pretty strong Cabinet results in the fourth quarter of '09. From a trend standpoint, if you take a look at the third quarter, we were off 4% in terms of sales to key retailers. About half of that related to our Cabinet business, which would put our non-Cabinet business off about 2% in the third quarter. So for comparative purposes, off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter for non-Cabinet business, off about 2% in the third quarter for non-Cabinet business.
Full year adjusted gross margins and operating margins were pretty comparable to the prior year as you can see on the slide, and that was somewhat of a positive for us. Obviously, a difficult year, but we were able to keep our decremental margin to about 2%. On an adjusted basis, our operating profit was down from $435 million to $430 million on a $200 million decline in sales. And so we were able to offset volume decline, negative price commodity relationships, those were both about $60 million roughly with about $110 million net of cost-related reduction. So kind of pretty tough year, but one we were able to offset some of the negative items impacting our business. 
If you flip to Slide #7. In addition to holding our decremental margin to 2%, we continue to do a lot of positive things to position Masco for success down the road. We continue to strengthen our brands. We're working very hard on fixed cost reductions. We've shared that with you in the past. We estimate by the end of 2010, we had achieved about $500 million of fixed cost reduction. We've got a lot of good initiatives going on from a supply chain standpoint. And innovation, again, is a major driver for us. So we've talked about the Watkins Ace Sanitizer, the R.E.D. at Arrow and some of the sensing technology at Delta. Those have all been very positively received in the marketplace, and we continue to focus on new products at value price points. The Milgard support the Simplicity window, the Watkins Hotspot spa, Kilz Pro-X, which we recently announced have all been, all will be positive as we set the lower price point area and we've got some exciting things going on in Cabinets and Plumbing targeted for later this year. 
If you flip to Slide #8, we'll take a look at our segments, and we'll start with Cabinets. Cabinets had another very tough quarter in the fourth quarter. Our sales were down 29% in the quarter. For the full year, we were off 13% in terms of Cabinet sales. Excluding sales related to products that we're exiting, we would have been down 22% in the fourth quarter and about 10% on a full year basis. Decremental margin was 45% in the fourth quarter. Obviously, that's very high. Our contribution margin normally is around 30%. But we did in addition to volume reductions, we had under absorption of fixed cost impacting us, increases in promotional activity and less favorable price commodity relationships. We've seen some particular challenges in Europe relative to particleboard. On a full year basis, our decremental margin of 24% is very much in line with our contribution margin. 
If you flip to Slide #9. Just taking a look at Cabinets, we've talked a lot about our Cabinet business over the last several quarters at investor conferences, talked about our strategy and we feel like we've got a lot of things going in the right direction there. Our integration is on plan, and we are focusing on about $180 million of fixed cost reduction by the time we complete that process with a much more nimble footprint. We think our brand strategy is resonating well with customers, particularly with dealers. Our three brand strategy really covers very effectively the market needs from one vendor, which gives us a little bit of leverage in terms of being able to expand that innovation and brand building. We've got a lot of innovation in the pipeline. We've shared some of that at the International Builders' Show, and we continue to believe that the countertop solution that we're developing, ProCision, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We believe that with housing starts in a range of 1.1 million to 1.3 million with more normalized repair/remodel environment that this segment can get back to double-digit margins, and we feel very confident about that.
If you flip to Slide #10, talk about Plumbing. Sales in the fourth quarter were off 1%, down slightly. Our decremental margin was pretty high in the quarter. As you can see, the $10 million job in sales, we had a $10 million drop in profit compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That includes the decline in sales, some product mix that was somewhat unfavorable in the quarter and expenditures for increased promotional activities. We did have a decline in margin in the quarter from 11.9% to 10.6%, still relatively strong. On a full year basis, we were up 5% in this particular segment, and we saw 140 basis point improvement in our operating margins with an incremental margin of 41%. So we feel real good about the Plumbing business, feel really good about the prospects going forward, we feel real good about our full year performance. 
If you flip to Slide #11, Installation and Other Services. Again, one of our segments that has been most challenged by the downturn and as a reminder, I think most of you are aware that the lion's share of the sales in this segment are tied directly to new home construction. We were off 7% in the fourth quarter, and our operating loss was constant with the prior year at $25 million. We were able to offset the volume declines with cost reductions. And as a reminder, I would mention to you on a full year basis, incremental losses related to the launch of our new WellHome business were $12 million on a full year basis and incrementally, $1 million in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, sales were down 9% and again, we did a very good job there in terms of holding operating losses relatively constant obviously, still very high. But a lot of good work in terms of cost reductions offsetting volume decline. 
If you flip to Slide #12. We've talked about Installation and this segment from an ongoing basis, we have lowered our fixed costs by approximately $180 million. We did announce late yesterday a new partnership, if you will, with Owens Corning that we think has some significant opportunities for us in terms of supply chain management combining together to look at building designs and applications to better develop products, techniques, if you will, for Installation and really an opportunity to better serve our customers. I'm sure you'll have a couple of questions about that, and Donnie can elaborate on that a little bit later on. 
We expected our ERP system will be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter again, giving us some significant capabilities in terms of efficiency and productivity. We continue to do a good job on the retrofits side. That business continues to grow. We've reduced complexity in this business and I think have done a very good job of enhancing our ability to execute in terms of some of the structural changes that we've made organizationally. We also have expanded our Service Partners footprint in terms of distribution opportunities, which we think will be very positive going forward. With housing starts in this particular segment at 1.1 million to 1.3 million, we think we can return to a minimum of high single digit margins. 
If you flip to Slide 13, our Decorative Architectural business was down 4% in the fourth quarter and on a full year basis was down 1%. Reduced sales of builders' hardware offset a modest increase in paint and stains sales for the full year. Decremental margins in this segment are relatively high, and as we've communicated previously reflect unfavorable price commodity relationships. I would point out in this segment that we had significant impact this year, but the group did a really nice job of offsetting a fair amount of that with productivity, cost management, expense management and that type of thing. So we're very pleased with that, and they also managed very well through a tight supply situation relative to raw materials.
We talked about that in the past obviously. Margins on a full year basis were down from 21.9% to 20.7% still obviously, a very, very solid performance, a very significant contribution, and we're very, very pleased with the work that took place in this particular segment over the course of the last year. 
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 3% and on a full year basis, we were up 2%. Those sales increases were driven by share gains, geographic expansion and new products. Having said that, we also have an inverse relationship in terms of increased sales and reduced profitability. Those decremental margins in both the full year and the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to new product launches, geographic expansion, less favorable product mix and unfavorable price commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide 15, I mentioned working capital a little bit earlier. We've seen some nice improvement here. Working capital as a percent of sales, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, decreased to 13.4% from 14.7% and just really an outstanding job across the enterprise. We started to focus on working capital management pretty intensely about I'd say about 10 years ago or so. This is the lowest relationship of 13.4% at least in recent memory. So we feel very good about that. We continue to believe that we can continue to improve our working capital management. We've got, as I mentioned earlier, some supply chain initiatives in place, and we think there's more opportunity here, but just a really outstanding job across the enterprise. Donnie, John, our group guys, our business unit leaders very, very pleased with the management here.
If you flip to Slide 16, I want to make just a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. We're anticipating a relatively slow start to 2011. Housing starts in the last half of 2010 were pretty slow, and we tend to operate on a lag basis of about 90 days typically. So as we go into 2011, we're anticipating a little bit of a slow start. Obviously, the weather's been a little bit of a factor. We do think repair/remodel activity will be a little bit better this year, modestly improved. We continue to believe that bigger-ticket items will probably continue to be deferred at least for a while until home prices stabilize and we see a little bit of movement in terms of job creation. Having said that, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control, driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, continuing to focus on our cost structure. And in particular, we'll continue to focus on the Installation business and the Cabinet business. Obviously, last year was a tough year for both of these segments. We anticipate that we'll see some bottom line improvement this year. Our sense is that if the economic numbers come in where we think they will and again, we're anticipating housing starts to be up about 15%, which is pretty much in line with the blue-chip consensus, if we see that kind of activity, our feeling is that we can cut the losses that we incurred in these segments last year by $60 million to $80 million and certainly anticipate making some very good progress in both of those segments. We continue to be very optimistic about the longer term. Household formations, population growth, the age of the housing stock, all of those are positives we think for our business, and we don't know when but when we get back to a stronger situation relative to housing, relative to repair/remodel activity and we can see ourselves at $10 billion to $12 billion in sales, we certainly believe that we can generate low double to mid-teen margins at those kinds of sales levels. And we think we're laying a very good foundation, a very good base to get us there. 
And with that, we will open up the lines for Q&A."

We look at market share in the Cabinets, I mean, clearly, in the retail side of the business, we've had some challenges there with price points and we've seen that consumer really, we've seen more activity at the lower price point through some heavy promotional activities. Consumers are getting better value at lower prices, and with our retail presence with KraftMaid that creates a little bit of a challenge for us getting into some of lower-priced buckets where we're seeing a higher percentage of sales. We're working on that. We believe we've got some things we'll be launching share in the second quarter to really address some of those lower prices, and we have our team really focused on how we might attack that at retail. Within the dealer community, a little bit of mixed results. We've seen a little bit of share loss on quality as we went through our Q back initiative, which was really getting all of the Merillat and Quality product out of the same chassis. We completed the first phase of that and began shipping product in December on the new cabinet we think that it was a temporary share loss that we'll get back. Merillat really had a strong year. We're gaining share both at dealers and new home construction, so we feel good about where we're at with dealers. Plus as we've talked about before, our Dealer Advantage Program, we've had 279 dealers commit to the Dealer Advantage Program, I mean, representing 92 new customers and 187 existing customers added additional brands.  So we feel really good about where we're at on the dealers side and on the builders side, we think we've held our share if not grown our share, particularly with Merillat."

We're anticipating at this point from a price commodity standpoint, obviously, we're seeing a fair amount of pressure pretty much across the spectrum.

We're anticipating at this point from a price commodity standpoint, obviously, we're seeing a fair amount of pressure pretty much across the spectrum. Metals prices, zinc and copper have continued to move up. We've had tightness in supply related to the components that go into paint, both resins and TiO2. But having said that, we're in about relatively good position. We estimate, at this point in time, that the headwinds going into 2011 represent about $30 million to $40 million in total. In other words, that would be the unfavorable relationship, if you will, between price and commodity based on what we sort of see on the horizon. Now having said that, we fully expect that we can offset that $30 million to $40 million either through productivity, either through working with our suppliers or through pricing-related activities. The areas that are probably the most significant for us, again, would be paint and Plumbing. I mentioned earlier we have seen some real challenges from a particleboard standpoint in Europe related to our operation over there. We estimate that we've got about $65 million of rationalization charges as we go into 2011. About $35 million of that relates to our Cabinet business, about $10 million in Install and about $20 million in Plumbing. From a cost saving standpoint, on a gross basis at this point in time, we estimate that our lean activities, productivity focus, as well as some of the cost reductions that we've been driving across the enterprise should, on a gross basis, represent about $150 million. Most of that would be in the Cabinet, Installation and Plumbing related business say, $40 million to $45 million in each of those segments with the other approximate $20 million spread among the decorative art and the Other segment. And I think that gives you pretty good perspective. One of the other areas that you folks have probably noticed is that we had a very good outcome in our general corp. expense in 2010. We came in at $110 million, and we're estimating that, that number will be more like $140 million in 2011. Hopefully, we've got a little bit of conservatism in there, but we had a very good experience in 2010 related to general insurance, workers comp and some other accruals related to performance compensation were down. We do anticipate those moving back up and again, a lot of that's based on experience. We continue to manage all those areas very aggressively, and we've got a little bit of health care-related inflation as well. But I think from a big picture standpoint, that gives you a pretty good perspective of some of the components that we see going into 2011. I would point out that just from a modeling standpoint if you're anticipating incremental sales in 2011, we would suggest the contribution margin of approximately 30% continues to give a pretty good feel in terms of where the bottom line would fall out."

Certainly, we still have a tough Installation market as far as demand goes. We still see competitive pricing there. But I will tell you on the Installation side, we've really moved from continuing to rationalize that business and take costs out to really more of an offensive approach. We've put more people on the streets, we're leveraging our new ERP system and driving efficiencies and really looking to grow our share this year, and we think that we started to see some of those results in the fourth quarter and we're optimistic going into '11. If you move over to paint, really in paint, we've got a three-pronged strategy. We have enhanced our core DIY paint, and that's our Premium Plus where we brought out our new low VOC formula at 50 or less. We have our TTY business, which continues to perform extremely well at rates above the conversion rates above what we had originally anticipated. We're growing an adjacent Pro categories with Kilz, which really gives us the right product at the right price for the Pro. But it has a tremendous value where directed job site it's available in stock at the Home Depot, and it's supported by both inside and outside sales. The rollout of that new product really starts next week and continues into the second quarter. And then we're penetrating markets outside of the U.S. So we've got really doing a lot of work how they limit their concentration in North America. So I feel pretty good about paint. On Cabinet side, we've talked about Cabinets. Cabinets still been a very high promotional category. Competitors, as well as ourselves, are having promotion to drive sales. We're seeing that those promotions that kind of a lingering effect, meaning that there's a lot more value at opening price points. So we're seeing consumers who seeing a shift down there not necessarily where consumers are moving off of volume products but they're just get a better value at lower prices. And we've got to respond to that with some different products, and we're in the midst of coming up with a response to really that change in marketplace. On the Plumbing side, we've really done a lot of good work in Plumbing. As a matter fact that say our shares up on the wholesale channel, as well as on the commercial side our high-end products are selling well. Our technology is resonating. Our continue to do extremely well, and we'll be touch in the lavatory faucets in April of this year where we think it may be more of a compelling value proposition. Our DIAMOND Seal Technology has really been a real win for us in Plumbing. We have in our single-handle faucets we're moving into our two-handle faucets. DIAMOND Seal does a lot of things for us but by converting that waterway from brass, it allows us to really change the dynamic related to the impact of some of the commodity costs, so we're looking at alternative materials that we can use in the construction of the faucet body that helps mitigate some of the effects. And so we feel really good faucets at that we've really worked hard is really at the opening price point, and then the opening price point we've done a lot of work there to kind of retool the line. We did a lot of work back really in '07 '08 '09 to get our cost structure right, and we've been relaunching both the low end Delta product and the peerless product and had a new launch recently at Menards that we're pretty excited about.

We have incurred some cost in both of those segments in the fourth quarter. Plumbing, that's basically related to Hansgrohe. We've talked about that in the past. They continue to do just a very good job of moving into other geographies, if you will, and our Milgard Window business has done a very nice job of penetrating the Western Canadian markets, as well as in Texas. I think they've got about 68 dealers currently signed up in Texas. So we've incurred some costs in both those segments related to geographic expansion and in the Cab area, we had expense in the fourth quarter that last year was in the third quarter in terms of some major promotional activities just relative to where the costs kind of fell. So hopefully that helps a little bit."

When I read your comments gained back to a double digit margins and at 1.1 million, 1.3 million housing start environment and whether you use our forecast or consensus that something that might not happen for five years. I realize that this is a business that did mid-teens we're sort of waiting quite a while just to get back to double digits. If I look at the business prior to the restructuring of lost about $20 million over six quarters but two quarters since restructuring we've taken costs out it lost over $70 million. So really just trying to get a handle on how we should we think about this business if it's just a wait per volume approached and it's going to be multiple years until we can think about it as a normal run rate or if there's going to be dramatic changes that we're going to see ultimately flow through here in 2011."

In terms of getting back to that double-digit margin, we mentioned that we think we can do that at 1.1 million to 1.3 million in terms of starts, and most forecasts have starts getting to 1 million in 2013. So obviously, that's the ways off but having said that, I don't think there's any question in our mind that we could see some significant improvement in terms of reducing the losses in 2011. Obviously, this is a business that is very sensitive to volume. We mentioned that we believe the break even is $1.6 million in terms of sales and generally speaking, what probably makes the most sense is the contribution margin around 30% for this particular business. As we continue to push on the dealers side, we've mentioned this in the past, the dealer represents about 70% of the market. Donnie talked about some wins that we've had there that we're very encouraged by. Our three brand strategy continues to resonate. The problem is we just haven't seen a lot of impact on the top line. Just to get your perspective, we estimate that the dealers that we've been able to penetrate with an additional brand as Donnie mentioned earlier that represents about $50 million in annual revenue opportunity again, and that's based on current market conditions. The other thing that we think can help differentiate us is the ProCision investment that we've made in the countertop solution, which we can marry up with the Cabinets. So we think as we continue to roll the strategy out, continue to focus on expanding our offerings price at price points as Donnie mentioned earlier that we've got a chance to pick up share with the two leading brands in that particular category."

Seeing the results of that in Installation where we're moving from really restructuring to offensive positioning here in 2011 and like what we're seeing as far as early results. We certainly are seeing more bidding activity so far in 2011 than we thought the end of 2010. We're encouraged by that now whether that's turning into projects and work we'll see but we're encouraged by the level of bidding activity. Tim mentioned the Owens Corning agreements, and we're excited about the relationship that we announced with Owens Corning. We see tremendous opportunity with our new ERP system around supply chain by giving them forward-looking visibility to our demand and how we might think about taking costs out. I think there's tremendous opportunities between Masco and Owens Corning we are the leaders in Building Science. We've run out the Environments For Living program. We have 140,000 homes built to that specification where we can guarantee energy costs, drive efficiencies really improve our take per unit. Owens Corning is a leader in building signs with some of their programs and we've started looking more from a solutions point of view, not a product and install point of view of what can we do together we think it's pretty staggering. And then the work we can do on governmental affairs and really driving the right type of legislation get behind things that really makes sense for energy efficiency, greenhouse gases, we just see a tremendous partnership here with Owens Corning.

Certainly the number of associates that we can really have promoting this product is both in-store and out of store, we feel really good about what Behr is able to accomplish in 2010. It was a great year for Behr."

That's across the company. The toughest areas are definitely going to be Plumbing, as well as the paint side of things. And I think we've managed very well so far through that. As we mentioned earlier, we were able last year to offset a major portion of that. We did have negative price commodity impact of about $60 million on a full year basis. But we did have savings of about $100 million, $110 million, which substantially offset that and the volume drop. We continue to be confident going into 2011 that we'll be able to address the $30 million to $40 million of headwind and one of the key issues for us is availability as it relates to paint. That's an area that has been challenging. We see resins a little better position from an availability standpoint going into 2011. TiO2 continues to be probably a little bit more of a challenge there's been some pretty significant cost increases in both of those areas. But given our relationships with our suppliers, the fact that we have shown some nice growth over the last few years and certainly anticipate growth going forward with our new Kilz Pro-X offering on the pro side, we think we'll be able to get the amount of raw supply that we need and certainly be able to manage through that process. And with that, we'll wrap up the call. I appreciate you being with us today. If we didn't get to your question, we certainly will be available the rest of the day and just check in with Maria, and we'll be happy to talk one-on-one. Thank you very much."

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.And if you",2859,"Thank you, Clayton, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for Masco's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you please flip to Slide #3, we'll start with the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were off 9%. Excluding unusual items in the quarter, business rationalization charges, impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles and normalizing our tax rate to 36%, we would have lost $0.08 in the quarter compared to a nickel [$0.05] of income in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an as-reported basis, including those items any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, we would have lost approximately $2.96 in the fourth quarter. Gross margins adjusted for the items that I described earlier decreased 370 basis points to 23.2%. And for those of you who have had a chance to look at the Appendix, we do have a reconciliation of EPS, gross margins, as well as operating income in the appendix. 
If you flip to Slide #4, please. We did have some significant charges in the fourth quarter. We had a goodwill and other intangible impairment of $721 million that primarily relates to our Installation-related business. I think you're all aware that on an annual basis, we do a goodwill impairment cash, that's a discounted cash flow, has a lot of assumptions in it. We did tweak a couple of the assumptions in terms of the terminal year reducing housing starts from 1.6 million to 1.5 million. That's about a 6% reduction and an increase in the discount rate and those two essentially drove the impairment charge. 
In terms of deferred tax assets, this is a very highly technical accounting area. The fact that we are in a three-year cumulative loss position, in large part, driven by some of the charges that we've taken over the course of the last couple of years negates previously identified tax strategies and puts us in a position where we had to record a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets of $370 million. Those assets incidentally are still available to us from an economic standpoint in terms of limiting cash taxes going forward. Both of those items cost about $2.76 in the quarter. That's the EPS impact, and I would point out very importantly that we were able to amend our credit agreement just a couple of days ago. So we continue to have significant availability, I think about $1.1 billion in terms of availability under the line. 
If you flip to Slide #5, take a quick look at the full year. Net sales on a full year basis were down 3%. Again, excluding the items I mentioned earlier, adjusting for those, our earnings per share would have been $0.16 in 2010 compared to $0.31 in 2009. I would point out to you and it is on the reconciliation in the back that we did have increased other expense this year over last year of about $72 million pretax. That's about $0.13 in terms of earnings per share. That reflects interest, currency translation, losses and impairments for financial investments. Our loss on an as-reported basis in the year would have been $3 per share. And gross margins, as adjusted, would have been down only 10 basis points to 26.4%. Working capital, as a percent of sales, improved to 13.4%. I'll talk a little more about that later. We generated $290 million of free cash flow and very importantly, ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash. 
If you please turn to Slide #6. Obviously, 2010 was a very challenging year for us. We came out of 2009 with a relatively strong operating performance offsetting a lot of volume drop with cost reductions and improvement in price commodity relationships and had some nice momentum going into 2010. The first half was a little more positive. I think our sales were up 2%, 3%, and the second half was much more challenging. We saw housing starts slow in the second half. We saw expenditures for big ticket repair/remodel items continue to be deferred. And I think it's a good point for me to talk about our sales to key retailers. 
In the fourth quarter, our sales to key retailers were off mid-teens. About 2/3 of that decline relates to our Cabinet-related businesses and as you know, we're exiting some products related to Cabinets. That would put our non-Cabinet business off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter. That's up against the pretty tough comp in the fourth quarter of 2009 when sales to key retail customers were up 8%, and we had pretty strong Cabinet results in the fourth quarter of '09. From a trend standpoint, if you take a look at the third quarter, we were off 4% in terms of sales to key retailers. About half of that related to our Cabinet business, which would put our non-Cabinet business off about 2% in the third quarter. So for comparative purposes, off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter for non-Cabinet business, off about 2% in the third quarter for non-Cabinet business.
Full year adjusted gross margins and operating margins were pretty comparable to the prior year as you can see on the slide, and that was somewhat of a positive for us. Obviously, a difficult year, but we were able to keep our decremental margin to about 2%. On an adjusted basis, our operating profit was down from $435 million to $430 million on a $200 million decline in sales. And so we were able to offset volume declines, negative price commodity relationships, those were both about $60 million roughly, with about $110 million net of cost-related reductions. So kind of pretty tough year, but one where we were able to offset some of the negative items impacting our business. 
If you flip to Slide #7. In addition to holding our decremental margin to 2%, we continue to do a lot of positive things to position Masco for success down the road. We continue to strengthen our brands. We're working very hard on fixed cost reductions. We've shared that with you in the past. We estimate by the end of 2010, we had achieved about $500 million of fixed cost reductions. We've got a lot of good initiatives going on from a supply chain standpoint. And innovation, again, is a major driver for us. So we've talked about the Watkins Ace Sanitizer, the RED line at Arrow and some of the sensing technology at Delta. Those have all been very positively received in the marketplace, and we continue to focus on new products at value price points. The Milgard Simplicity window, the Watkins Hotspot spa, Kilz Pro-X, which we recently announced have all been, all will be positive as we set the lower price point area and we've got some exciting things going on in Cabinets and Plumbing targeted for later this year. 
If you flip to Slide #8, we'll take a look at our segments, and we'll start with Cabinets. Cabinets had another very tough quarter in the fourth quarter. Our sales were down 29% in the quarter. For the full year, we were off 13% in terms of Cabinet sales. Excluding sales related to products that we're exiting, we would have been down 22% in the fourth quarter and about 10% on a full year basis. Decremental margin was 45% in the fourth quarter. Obviously, that's very high. Our contribution margin normally is around 30%. But we did in addition to volume reductions, we had under-absorption of fixed costs impacting us, increases in promotional activity and less favorable price/commodity relationships. We've seen some particular challenges in Europe relative to particleboard. On a full year basis, our decremental margin of 24% is very much in line with our contribution margin. 
If you flip to Slide #9. Just taking a look at Cabinets, we've talked a lot about our Cabinet business over the last several quarters at investor conferences, talked about our strategy and we feel like we've got a lot of things going in the right direction there. Our integration is on plan, and we are focusing on about $180 million of fixed cost reduction by the time we complete that process with a much more nimble footprint. We think our brand strategy is resonating well with customers, particularly with dealers. Our three brand strategy really covers very effectively the market needs from one vendor, which gives us a little bit of leverage in terms of being able to expand that innovation and brand building. We've got a lot of innovation in the pipeline. We shared some of that at the International Builders' Show, and we continue to believe that the countertop solution that we're developing, ProCision, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We believe that with housing starts in a range of 1.1 million to 1.3 million and with a more normalized repair and remodel environment, that this segment can get back to double-digit margins, and we feel very confident about that.
If you flip to Slide #10, talk about Plumbing. Sales in the fourth quarter were off 1%, down slightly. Our decremental margin was pretty high in the quarter. As you can see, the $10 million drop in sales, we had a $10 million drop in profit compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That includes the decline in sales, some product mix that was somewhat unfavorable in the quarter and expenditures for increased promotional activities. We did have a decline in margin in the quarter from 11.9% to 10.6%, still relatively strong. On a full year basis, we were up 5% in this particular segment, and we saw 140 basis point improvement in our operating margins with an incremental margin of 41%. So we feel real good about the Plumbing business, feel real good about the prospects going forward and feel real good about our full year performance. 
If you flip to Slide #11, Installation and Other Services. Again, one of our segments that has been most challenged by the downturn. And as a reminder, I think most of you are aware that the lion's share of the sales in this segment are tied directly to new home construction. We were off 7% in the fourth quarter, and our operating loss was constant with the prior year at $25 million. We were able to offset the volume declines with cost reductions. And as a reminder, I would mention to you on a full year basis, incremental losses related to the launch of our new WellHome business were $12 million on a full year basis and incrementally, $1 million in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, sales were down 9% and again, we did a very good job there in terms of holding operating losses relatively constant obviously, still very high. But a lot of good work in terms of cost reductions offsetting volume declines. 
If you flip to Slide #12. We've talked about Installation and this segment from an ongoing basis, we have lowered our fixed costs by approximately $180 million. We did announce late yesterday, enter a new partnership, if you will, with Owens Corning that we think has some significant opportunities for us in terms of supply chain management, combining together to look at building designs and applications to better develop products, techniques, if you will, for Installation and really an opportunity to better serve our customers. I'm sure you'll have a couple of questions about that, and Donnie can elaborate on that a little bit later on. 
We expected our ERP system will be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter again, giving us some significant capabilities in terms of efficiency and productivity. We continue to do a good job on the retrofit side. That business continues to grow. We've reduced complexity in this business, and I think have done a very good job of enhancing our ability to execute in terms of some of the structural changes that we've made organizationally. We also have expanded our Service Partners footprint in terms of distribution opportunities, which we think will be very positive going forward. With housing starts in this particular segment at 1.1 million to 1.3 million, we think we can return to a minimum of high single digit margins. 
If you flip to Slide 13, our Decorative Architectural business was down 4% in the fourth quarter, and on a full year basis was down 1%. Reduced sales of builders' hardware offset a modest increase in paint sales for the full year. Decremental margins in this segment are relatively high, and as we've communicated previously reflect unfavorable price/commodity relationships. I would point out in this segment that we had significant impact this year, but the group did a really nice job of offsetting a fair amount of that with productivity, cost management, expense management and that type of thing. So we're very pleased with that, and they also managed very well through a tight supply situation relative to raw materials. We talked about that in the past obviously. Margins on a full year basis were down from 21.9% to 20.7% still obviously, a very, very solid performance, a very significant contribution, and we're very, very pleased with the work that took place in this particular segment over the course of the last year. 
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 3% and on a full year basis, we were up 2%. Those sales increases were driven by share gains, geographic expansion and new products. Having said that, we also have an inverse relationship in terms of increased sales and reduced profitability. Those decremental margins in both the full year and the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to new product launches, geographic expansion, less favorable product mix and unfavorable price/commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide 15, I mentioned working capital a little bit earlier. We've seen some nice improvement here. Working capital, as a percent of sales, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, decreased to 13.4% from 14.7% and just really an outstanding job across the enterprise. We started to focus on working capital management pretty intensely about I'd say about 10 years ago or so. This is the lowest relationship of 13.4% at least in recent memory. So we feel very good about that. We continue to believe that we can continue to improve our working capital management. We've got, as I mentioned earlier, some supply chain initiatives in place, and we think there's more opportunity here, but just a really outstanding job across the enterprise. Donnie, John, our group guys, our business unit leaders very, very pleased with the management here.
If you flip to Slide 16, I want to make just a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. We're anticipating a relatively slow start into 2011. Housing starts in the last half of 2010 were pretty slow, and we tend to operate on a lag basis of about 90 days typically. So as we go into 2011, we're anticipating a little bit of a slow start. Obviously, the weather has been a little bit of a factor. We do think repair/remodel activity will be a little bit better this year, modestly improved. We continue to believe that bigger ticket items will probably continue to be deferred at least for a while until home prices stabilize and we see a little bit of movement in terms of job creation. 
Having said that, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control, driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, continuing to focus on our cost structure. And in particular, we'll continue to focus on the Installation business and the Cabinet business. Obviously, last year was a tough year for both of these segments. We anticipate that we'll see some bottom line improvement this year. Our sense is that if the economic numbers come in where we think they will and again, we're anticipating housing starts to be up about 15%, which is pretty much in line with the blue-chip consensus, if we see that kind of activity, our feeling is that we can cut the losses that we incurred in these segments last year by $60 million to $80 million and certainly anticipate making some very good progress in both of those segments. 
We continue to be very optimistic about the longer term. Household formations, population growth, the age of the housing stock, all of those are positives we think for our business, and we don't know when but when we get back to a stronger situation relative to housing, relative to repair/remodel activity and we can see ourselves at $10 billion to $12 billion in sales, we certainly believe that we can generate low double to mid-teen margins at those kinds of sales levels. And we think we're laying a very good foundation, a very good base to get us there. 
And with that, we will open up the lines for Q&A."

We look at market share in the Cabinets. I mean, clearly, in the retail side of the business, we've had some challenges there with price points and we've seen that consumer really -- we've seen more activity at the lower price points were through some heavy promotional activities. Consumers are getting better value at lower prices, and with our retail presence with KraftMaid, that creates a little bit of a challenge for us getting into some of those lower-priced buckets where we're seeing a higher percentage of sales. We're working on that. We believe we've got some things we'll be launching here in the second quarter to really address some of those lower prices, and we have our team really focused on how we might attack that at retail. Within the dealer community, a little bit of mixed results. We've seen a little bit of share loss on quality as we went through our Q back initiative, which was really getting all of the Merillat and Quality product out of the same chassis. We've completed the first phase of that and began shipping product in December on the new chassis, so we think that it was a temporary share loss that we'll get back. Merillat really had a strong year. We're gaining share both at dealers and new home construction, so we feel really good about where we're at with dealers. Plus as we've talked about before, our Dealer Advantage Program, we've had 279 dealers commit to the Dealer Advantage Program, representing 92 new customers and 187 existing customers added additional brands. So we feel really good about where we're at on the dealers side. And on the builders side, we think we've held our share if not grown our share, particularly with Merillat."

What we're anticipating at this point from a price commodity standpoint, obviously, we're seeing a fair amount of pressure pretty much across the spectrum. Metals prices, zinc and copper have continued to move up. We've had tightness in supply related to the components that go into paint, both resins and TiO2. But having said that, we're in a relatively good position. We estimate, at this point in time, that the headwinds going into 2011 represent about $30 million to $40 million in total. In other words, that would be the unfavorable relationship, if you will, between price and commodity based on what we sort of see on the horizon. Now having said that, we fully expect that we can offset that $30 million to $40 million either through productivity, either through working with our suppliers or through pricing-related activities. The areas that are probably the most significant for us, again, would be paint and Plumbing. I mentioned earlier we have seen some real challenges from a particleboard standpoint in Europe related to vellum operation over there. We estimate that we've got about $65 million of rationalization charges as we go into 2011. About $35 million of that relates to our Cabinet business, about $10 million in Install [Installation] and about $20 million in Plumbing. From a cost saving standpoint, on a gross basis at this point in time, we estimate that our lean activities, productivity focus, as well as some of the cost reductions that we've been driving across the enterprise should, on a gross basis, represent about $150 million. Most of that would be in the Cabinet, Installation and Plumbing-related business say, $40 million to $45 million in each of those segments with the other approximate $20 million spread among the Decorative Art and the Other segment. And I think that gives you pretty good perspective. One of the other areas that you folks have probably noticed is that we had a very good outcome in our general corp [corporate] expense in 2010. We came in at $110 million, and we're estimating that, that number will be more like $140 million in 2011. Hopefully, we've got a little bit of conservatism in there but we had a very good experience in 2010 related to general insurance, workers' comp and some other accruals related to performance compensation were down. We do anticipate those moving back up and again, a lot of that's based on experience. We continue to manage all those areas very aggressively, and we've got a little bit of healthcare-related inflation as well. But I think from a big picture standpoint, that gives you a pretty good perspective of some of the components that we see going into 2011. I would point out that just from a modeling standpoint if you're anticipating incremental sales in 2011, we would suggest the contribution margin of approximately 30% continues to give a pretty good feel in terms of where the bottom line would fall out."

Certainly, we still have a tough Installation market as far as demand goes. We've still seen competitive pricing there. But I will tell you on the Installation side, we've really moved from continuing to rationalize that business and take costs out to really more of an offensive approach. We've put more people on the streets, we're leveraging our new ERP system and really driving efficiencies and really looking to grow our share this year, and we think that we started to see some of those results in the fourth quarter and we're optimistic going into '11. If you move over to paint, really in paint, we've got a three-pronged strategy. We have enhanced our core DIY [do it yourself] paint, and that's our Premium Plus where we brought out our new low VOC [Volatile Organic Compound] formula at 50 or less. We have our PPUI [Premium Plus Ultra Interior] business, which continues to perform extremely well at rates above the conversion rates above what we had originally anticipated. We're growing an adjacent Pro categories with Kilz, which really gives us the right product at the right price for the Pro. But it has a tremendous value prop [proposition], where we've got factory tinting, direct to job site. It's available in stock at the Home Depot, and it's supported by both inside and outside sales. And the rollout of that new product really starts next week and continues into the second quarter. And then we're penetrating markets outside of the U.S. So we've got Behr really doing a lot of work to really look at how do they limit their concentration in North America. So I feel pretty good about paint. On the Cabinets side, we've talked about Cabinets. Cabinets still been a very high promotional category. Competitors, as well as ourselves, are having a run promotion to drive sales. We're seeing that those promotions that kind of a lingering effect, meaning that there's a lot more value at opening price points. So we're seeing consumers -- we're seeing a shift down there not necessarily where consumers are moving off of high-end products, but they're just getting better value at lower prices. And we've got to respond to that with some different products, and we're in the midst of coming up with a response to really that changing marketplace. On the Plumbing side, we've really done a lot of good work in Plumbing. As a matter fact, I would say, our shares up on the wholesale channel, as well as on the commercial side. Our high-end products are selling well. Our technology is resonating. Our Touch faucets continue to do extremely well, and we'll be launching Touch into the lavatory faucets in April of this year where we think it may be more of a compelling value proposition. Our DIAMOND Seal Technology has really been a real win for us in Plumbing. We have it in our single-handle faucets. We're moving it into our two-handle faucets. And DIAMOND Seal does a lot of things for us, but by converting that waterway from brass to PEX, it allows us to really change the dynamic related to the impact of some of the commodity costs. So we're looking at alternative materials that we can use in the construction of the faucet body that helps mitigate some of the effects. And so we feel really good, probably the area in faucets that we've really worked hard is really at the opening price point. And then the opening price point, we've done a lot of work there to kind of retool the line. We did a lot of work back really in '07, '08, '09 to get our cost structure right, and we've been relaunching both the low-end Delta product and the Peerless product and had us a new launch just recently at Menards that we're pretty excited about. So doing a lot of good work across all the segments."

We have incurred some costs in both of those segments in the fourth quarter. Plumbing, that's basically related to Hansgrohe we've talked about that in the past. They continue to do just a very good job of moving into other geographies, if you will, and our Milgard Window business has done a very nice job of penetrating the Western Canadian markets, as well as in Texas. I think they've got about 68 dealers currently signed up in Texas. So we've incurred some costs in both those segments related to geographic expansion. And in the Cab [Cabinets] area, we had expense in the fourth quarter that last year was in the third quarter in terms of some major promotional activities just relative to where the costs kind of fell. So hopefully that helps a little bit."

When I read your comments of getting back to double-digit margins in a 1.1 million, 1.3 million housing start environment and whether you use our forecast or consensus that something that might not happen for five years. I realize that this is a business that did mid-teens we're sort of waiting quite a while just to get back to double digits. And if I look at the business prior to the restructuring it lost about $20 million over six quarters, the two quarters since restructuring where we've taken costs out, it lost over $70 million. So really just trying to get a handle on how we should really think about this business if it's just a wait for volume approach and it's going to be multiple years until we can think about it as a normal run rate or if there's going to be dramatic changes that we're going to see ultimately flow through here in 2011."

But having said that, I don't think there's any question in our mind that we could see some significant improvement in terms of reducing the losses in 2011. Obviously, this is a business that is very sensitive to volume. We mentioned that we believe the break even is $1.6 million in terms of sales and generally speaking, what probably makes the most sense is the contribution margin around 30% for this particular business. As we continue to push on the dealers side, we've mentioned this in the past, the dealer represents about 70% of the market. Donnie talked about some wins that we've had there that we're very encouraged by. Our three brand strategy continues to resonate. The problem is we just haven't seen a lot of impact on the top line. Just to get your perspective, we estimate that the dealers that we've been able to penetrate with an additional brand, as Donnie mentioned earlier, that represents about $50 million in annual revenue opportunity again, and that's based on current market conditions. The other thing that we think can help differentiate us is the ProCision investment that we've made in the countertop solution, which we can marry up with the Cabinets. So we think as we continue to roll the strategy out, continue to focus on expanding our offerings at price points, as Donnie mentioned earlier, that we've got a chance to pick up share with the two leading brands in that particular category."

Clearly, it's going to be a different market going forward. We see smaller home sizes. We see smaller kitchens. We've got to have the right product and portfolio to be able to address that and do so on a meaningful way. We're attacking the dealer. 70% of the sales here are to new construction, we really have to get after that larger dealer segment, where we think our branding strategy gives us a huge advantage.

I mean, there's no question about that. These businesses were built for a much different environment. But having said that, our feeling is that continuing to manage aggressively to do the best job we can on a near-term basis to limit the losses and negative cash flow, but to continue to invest and position these businesses for the future makes a whole lot more sense to us from a shareholder perspective, just in terms of value creation. We think very good leadership teams in both businesses. We've got a lot of good things going on from an organizational standpoint, just in terms of the way the business is structured and managed.

Tim mentioned the Owens Corning agreement, and we're excited about the relationship that we announced with Owens Corning. We see tremendous opportunity with our new ERP system around supply chain by giving them forward-looking visibility to our demand and how we might think about taking costs out. I think there's tremendous opportunities between Masco and Owens Corning. We are the leaders in Building Science. We've brought out the Environments For Living program. We have 140,000 homes built to that specification where we can guarantee energy costs, drive efficiencies really improve our take per unit. Owens Corning is a leader in Building Science with some of their programs, and we've started looking more from a solutions point of view, not a product and install point of view, what can we do together we think it's pretty staggering.

And as we look at the type of kitchen that's going into the foreclosure, that's really related to price point, as we know, if you look at the price point of the foreclosure and whether or not it's an investor or a homeowner that ultimately made the purchase, so a lot of variables there. I would tell you that when we have a tremendous opening price point product and that's our quality product. And that product was hampered by our initiative to go to account in chassis. That's behind us. So in December, we started shipping over 50% of line on the new chassis. We've seen dealers come back and we've been able to attack that market through our dealer network. The quality product is also made available to the builders, so we feel really good about where we're at with the builders and where we're at with the dealers of having the right product and then being able to trade people up into features, into to Merillat and for those people who really want that dream kitchen, we've got our KraftMaid brand. Where we really have been lagging is our ability to get to those lower price points in retail, and I don't want to give out any secrets yet, but we're really excited about what we're going to bring to our customers here in early 2011 to address some of those lower price points and then really talk about how do we take those customers and provide opportunity for them to get better features, and we think some or a lot of that foreclosure business is running through our large home center customers. So we really need to work on being able to have the whole spectrum within those home centers."

So we'll add that retrofit spending, good market for us in 2010 and our retrofit sales within that segment were up north of 60% in 2010 over 2009, so it's been a nice source for growth for us, and we think it positions that segment even stronger going forward, if we can continue to increase our mix of retrofit, add that to our new construction leadership position, we think we can be the leader in both retrofit and new construction coming out of this downturn."

The toughest areas are definitely going to be Plumbing, as well as the paint side of things. And I think we've managed very well so far through that. As we mentioned earlier, we were able last year to offset a major portion of that. We did have negative price commodity impact to about $60 million on a full year basis. But we did have savings of about $100 million, $110 million, which substantially offset that and the volume drop. We continue to be confident going into 2011 that we'll be able to address the $30 million to $40 million of headwind, and one of the key issues for us is availability as it relates to paint. That's an area that has been challenging. We see resins a little better position from an availability standpoint going into 2011. TiO2 continues to be probably a little bit more of a challenge. There's been some pretty significant cost increases in both of those areas. But given our relationships with our suppliers, the fact that we have shown some nice growth over the last few years and certainly anticipate growth going forward with our new Kilz Pro-X offering on the Pro side, we think we'll be able to get the amount of raw supply that we need and certainly be able to manage through that process.

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.And if you",2860,"Thank you, Clayton, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for Masco's fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings call. I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you please flip to Slide #3, we'll start with the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were off 9%. Excluding unusual items in the quarter, business rationalization charges, impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles and normalizing our tax rate to 36%, we would have lost $0.08 [per common share] in the quarter compared to $0.05 of income in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an as-reported basis, including those items and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, we would have lost approximately $2.96 in the fourth quarter. Gross margins, adjusted for the items that I described earlier, decreased 370 basis points to 23.2%. And for those of you who have had a chance to look at the appendix, we do have a reconciliation of EPS, gross margins, as well as operating income in the appendix. 
If you flip to Slide #4, please. We did have some significant charges in the fourth quarter. We had a goodwill and other intangible impairment of $721 million. That primarily relates to our Installation-related business. I think you're all aware that on an annual basis, we do a goodwill impairment test. That's a discounted cash flow, has a lot of assumptions in it. We did tweak a couple of the assumptions in terms of the terminal year, reducing housing starts from 1.6 million to 1.5 million -- that's about a 6% reduction -- and an increase in the discount rate, and those two essentially drove the impairment charge. 
In terms of deferred tax assets, this is a very highly technical accounting area. The fact that we are in a three-year cumulative loss position, in large part driven by some of the charges that we've taken over the course of the last couple of years, negates previously identified tax strategies and puts us in a position where we had to record a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets of $370 million (sic) [$371 million]. Those assets, incidentally, are still available to us from an economic standpoint in terms of limiting cash taxes going forward. Both of those items cost about $2.76 in the quarter. That's the EPS impact, and I would point out, very importantly, that we were able to amend our credit agreement just a couple of days ago. So we continue to have significant availability, I think about $1.1 billion in terms of availability under the line. 
If you flip to Slide #5, take a quick look at the full year. Net sales on a full year basis were down 3%. Again, excluding the items I mentioned earlier, adjusting for those, our earnings per share would have been $0.16 in 2010 compared to $0.31 in 2009. I would point out to you, and it is on the reconciliation in the back, that we did have increased other expense this year over last year of about $72 million pretax. That's about $0.13 in terms of earnings per share. That reflects interest, currency translation, losses and impairments for financial investments. Our loss on an as-reported basis in the year would have been $3 per share. And gross margins, as adjusted, would have been down only 10 basis points to 26.4%. Working capital, as a percent of sales, improved to 13.4%. I'll talk a little more about that later. We generated $290 million of free cash flow and very importantly, ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash.
If you please [audio gap] Slide #6. Obviously, 2010 was a very challenging year for us. We came out of 2009 with a relatively strong operating performance offsetting a lot of volume drop with cost reductions and improvement in price/commodity relationships and had some nice momentum going into 2010. The first half was a little more positive. I think our sales were up 2%, 3%, and the second half was much more challenging. We saw housing starts slow in the second half. We saw expenditures for big ticket repair/remodel items continue to be deferred. And I think it's a good point for me to talk about our sales to key retailers. 
In the fourth quarter, our sales to key retailers were off mid-teens. About 2/3 of that decline relates to our Cabinet-related businesses and as you know, we're exiting some products related to Cabinets. That would put our non-Cabinet business off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter. That's up against the pretty tough comp in the fourth quarter of 2009 when sales to key retail customers were up 8%, and we had pretty strong Cabinet results in the fourth quarter of '09. From a trend standpoint, if you take a look at the third quarter, we were off 4% in terms of sales to key retailers. About half of that related to our Cabinet business, which would put our non-Cabinet business off about 2% in the third quarter. So for comparative purposes, off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter for non-Cabinet business, off about 2% in the third quarter for non-Cabinet business.
Full year adjusted gross margins and operating margins were pretty comparable to the prior year, as you can see on the slide, and that was somewhat of a positive for us. Obviously a difficult year, but we were able to keep our decremental margin to about 2%. On an adjusted basis, our operating profit was down from $435 million to $430 million on a $200 million decline in sales. And so we were able to offset volume declines, negative price commodity relationships. Those were both about $60 million roughly, with about $110 million net of cost-related reductions. So we had a pretty tough year, but one where we were able to offset some of the negative items impacting our business. 
If you flip to Slide #7. In addition to holding our decremental margin to 2%, we continued to do a lot of positive things to position Masco for success down the road. We continue to strengthen our brands. We're working very hard on fixed-cost reductions. We've shared that with you in the past. We estimate by the end of 2010, we had achieved about $500 million of fixed-cost reductions. We've got a lot of good initiatives going on from a supply chain standpoint. And innovation, again, is a major driver for us. So we've talked about the Watkins Ace Sanitizer, the RED line at Arrow and some of the sensing technology at Delta. Those have all been very positively received in the marketplace, and we continue to focus on new products at value price points. The Milgard Simplicity window, the Watkins Hotspot spa, Kilz Pro-X, which we recently announced, all will be positive entries at the lower price point area and we've got some exciting things going on in Cabinets and Plumbing targeted for later this year.
If you flip to Slide #8, we'll take a look at our segments, and we'll start with Cabinets. Cabinets had another very tough quarter in the fourth quarter. Our sales were down 29% in the quarter. For the full year, we were off 13% in terms of Cabinet sales. Excluding sales related to products that we're exiting, we would have been down 22% in the fourth quarter and about 10% on a full year basis. Decremental margin was 45% in the fourth quarter. Obviously, that's very high. Our contribution margin normally is around 30%. In addition to volume reductions, we had under-absorption of fixed costs impacting us, increases in promotional activity and less favorable price/commodity relationships. We’ve [audio gap] challenges in Europe relative to particleboard. On a full year basis, our decremental margin of 24% is very much in line with our contribution margin. 
If you flip to Slide #9. Just taking a look at Cabs [Cabinets], we've talked a lot about our Cabinet business over the last several quarters at investor conferences, talked about our strategy, and we feel like we've got a lot of things going in the right direction there. Our integration is on plan, and we are focusing on about $180 million of fixed-cost reduction by the time we complete that process with a much more nimble footprint. We think our brand strategy is resonating well with customers, particularly with dealers. Our three-brand strategy really covers very effectively the market needs from one vendor, which gives us a little bit of leverage in terms of being able to expand that innovation and brand building. We've got a lot of innovation in the pipeline. We shared some of that at the International Builders' Show, and we continue to believe that the countertop solution that we're developing, ProCision, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We believe that with housing starts in a range of 1.1 million to 1.3 million and with a more normalized repair and remodel environment, that this segment can get back to double-digit margins, and we feel very confident about that.
If you flip to Slide #10, talk about Plumbing. Sales in the fourth quarter were off 1%, down slightly. Our decremental margin was pretty high in the quarter. As you can see, the $10 million drop in sales, we had a $10 million drop in profit compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That includes the decline in sales, some product mix that was somewhat unfavorable in the quarter and expenditures for increased promotional activities. We did have a decline in margin in the quarter from 11.9% to 10.6%, still relatively strong. On a full year basis, we were up 5% in this particular segment, and we saw a 140-basis-point improvement in our operating margins with an incremental margin of 41%. So we feel real good about the Plumbing business, feel real good about the prospects going forward and feel real good about our full year performance. 
If you flip to Slide #11, Installation and Other Services. Again, one of our segments that has been most challenged by the downturn. And as a reminder, I think most of you are aware that the lion's share of the sales in this segment are tied directly to new home construction. We were off 7% in the fourth quarter, and our operating loss was constant with the prior year at $25 million. We were able to offset the volume declines with cost reductions. And as a reminder, I would mention to you on a full year basis, incremental losses related to the launch of our new WellHome business were $12 million on a full year basis and incrementally, $1 million in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, sales were down 9% and again, we did a very good job there in terms of holding operating losses relatively constant -- obviously, still very high. But a lot of good work in terms of cost reductions offsetting volume declines. 
If you flip to Slide #12. We've talked about Installation and this segment from an ongoing basis. We have lowered our fixed costs by approximately $180 million. We did announce late yesterday [audio gap] enter a new partnership, if you will, with Owens Corning that we think has some significant opportunities for us in terms of supply chain management; combining together to look at Building Science and applications to better develop products, techniques if you will, for Installation; and really an opportunity to better serve our customers. I'm sure you'll have a couple of questions about that and Donnie can elaborate on that a little bit later on. 
We expect that our ERP system will be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter, again giving us some significant capabilities in terms of efficiency and productivity. We continue to do a good job on the retrofit side. That business continues to grow. We've reduced complexity in this business and, I think, have done a very good job of enhancing our ability to execute in terms of some of the structural changes that we've made organizationally. We also have expanded our Service Partners footprint in terms of distribution opportunities, which we think will be very positive going forward. With housing starts in this particular segment at 1.1 million to 1.3 million, we think we can return to a minimum of high-single digit margins.
If you flip to Slide 13, our Decorative Architectural business was down 4% in the fourth quarter, and on a full year basis was down 1%. Reduced sales of builders' hardware offset a modest increase in paint sales for the full year. Decremental margins in this segment are relatively high and, as we've communicated previously, reflect unfavorable price/commodity relationships. I would point out in this segment that we had significant impact this year, but the group did a really nice job of offsetting a fair amount of that with productivity, cost management, expense management and that type of thing. So we're very pleased with that, and they also managed very well through a tight supply situation relative to raw materials. We talked about that in the past obviously. Margins on a full year basis were down from 21.9% to 20.7%, still obviously a very, very solid performance, a very significant contribution, and we're very, very pleased with the work that took place in this particular segment over the course of the last year. 
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 3% and on a full year basis, we were up 2%. Those sales increases were driven by share gains, geographic expansion and new products. Having said that, we also have an inverse relationship in terms of increased sales and reduced profitability. Those decremental margins in both the full year and the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to new product launches, geographic expansion, less favorable product mix and unfavorable price/commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide 15, I mentioned working capital a little bit earlier. We've seen some nice improvement here. Working capital as a percent of sales, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, decreased to 13.4% from 14.7% and just really an outstanding job across the enterprise. We started to focus on working capital management pretty intensely about I'd say about 10 years ago or so. This is the lowest relationship, the 13.4%, at least in recent memory, so we feel very good about that. We continue to believe that we can continue to improve our working capital management. We've got, as I mentioned earlier, some supply chain initiatives in place and we think there's more opportunity here, but just a really outstanding job across the enterprise. Donnie, John, our group guys, our business unit leaders -- very, very pleased with the management here.
If you flip to Slide 16, I want to make just a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. We're anticipating a relatively slow start to 2011. Housing starts in the last half of 2010 were pretty slow, and we tend to operate on a lag basis of about 90 days typically. So as we go into 2011, we're anticipating a little bit of a slow start. Obviously, the weather has been a little bit of a factor. We do think repair/remodel activity will be a little bit better this year, modestly improved. We continue to believe that bigger ticket items will probably continue to be deferred at least for a while until home prices stabilize and we see a little bit of movement in terms of job creation. 
Having said that, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control: driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, continuing to focus on our cost structure. And in particular, we'll continue to focus on the Installation business and the Cabinet business. Obviously, last year was a tough year for both of these segments. We anticipate that we'll see some bottom line improvement this year. Our sense is that if the economic numbers come in where we think they will and again, we're anticipating housing starts to be up about 15%, which is pretty much in line with the blue-chip consensus -- if we see that kind of activity, our feeling is that we can cut the losses that we incurred in these segments last year by $60 million to $80 million and certainly anticipate making some very good progress in both of those segments.
We continue to be very optimistic about the longer term. Household formations, population growth, the age of the housing stock -- all of those are positives, we think, for our business and we don't know when, but when we get back to a stronger situation relative to housing, relative to repair/remodel activity and we can see ourselves at $10 billion to $12 billion in sales -- we certainly believe that we can generate low-double to mid-teen margins at those kinds of sales levels. And we think we're laying a very good foundation, a very good base to get us there.
And with that, we will open up the lines for Q&A."

We look at market share in the Cabinets. I mean, clearly, in the retail side of the business, we've had some challenges there with price points and we've seen the consumer really -- we've seen more activity at the lower price points were through some heavy promotional activities. Consumers are getting better value at lower prices and with our retail presence with KraftMaid, that creates a little bit of a challenge for us -- getting into some of those lower-priced buckets where we're seeing a higher percentage of sales. We're working on that. We believe we've got some things we'll be launching here in the second quarter to really address some of those lower prices, and we have our team really focused on how we might attack that at retail. Within the dealer community, a little bit of mixed results. We've seen a little bit of share loss on quality as we went through our Q [ph] back initiative, which was really getting all of the Merillat and Quality product on the same chassis. We've completed the first phase of that and began shipping product in December on the new chassis, so we think that it was a temporary share loss that we'll get back. Merillat really had a strong year. We're gaining share both at dealers and new home construction, so we feel really good about where we're at with dealers. Plus as we've talked about before, our Dealer Advantage Program, we've had 279 dealers commit to the Dealer Advantage Program, representing 92 new customers, and 187 existing customers added additional brands. So we feel really good about where we're at on the dealer side. And on the builder side, we think we've held our share if not grown our share, particularly with Merillat."

What we're anticipating at this point from a price commodity standpoint -- obviously, we're seeing a fair amount of pressure pretty much across the spectrum. Metals prices, zinc and copper, have continued to move up. We've had tightness in supply related to the components that go into paint, both resins and TiO2. But having said that, we're in a relatively good position. We estimate, at this point in time, that the headwinds going into 2011 represent about $30 million to $40 million in total. In other words, that would be the unfavorable relationship, if you will, between price and commodity based on what we sort of see on the horizon. Now having said that, we fully expect that we can offset that $30 million to $40 million either through productivity, either through working with our suppliers or through pricing-related activities. The areas that are probably the most significant for us, again, would be paint and Plumbing. I mentioned earlier we have seen some real challenges from a particleboard standpoint in Europe related to vellum operation over there. We estimate that we've got about $65 million of rationalization charges as we go into 2011. About $35 million of that relates to our Cabinet business, about $10 million in Install [Installation] and about $20 million in Plumbing. From a cost saving standpoint, on a gross basis at this point in time, we estimate that our lean activities, productivity focus, as well as some of the cost reductions that we've been driving across the enterprise should, on a gross basis, represent about $150 million. Most of that would be in the Cabinet, Installation and Plumbing-related business, say, $40 million to $45 million in each of those segments with the other approximate $20 million spread among the Decorative Art and the Other segment. And I think that gives you pretty good perspective. One of the other areas that you folks have probably noticed is that we had a very good outcome in our general corp [corporate] expense in 2010. We came in at $110 million and we're estimating that, that number will be more like $140 million in 2011. Hopefully, we've got a little bit of conservatism in there but we had a very good experience in 2010 related to general insurance. Workers' comp and some other accruals related to performance compensation were down. We do anticipate those moving back up and again, a lot of that's based on experience. We continue to manage all those areas very aggressively and we've got a little bit of healthcare-related inflation as well. But I think from a big-picture standpoint, that gives you a pretty good perspective of some of the components that we see going into 2011. I would point out that, just from a modeling standpoint, if you're anticipating incremental sales in 2011 we would suggest a contribution margin of approximately 30% continues to give a pretty good feel in terms of where the bottom line would fall out."

Certainly, we still have a tough Installation market as far as demand goes. We've still seen competitive pricing there. But I will tell you, on the Installation side we've really moved from continuing to rationalize that business and take costs out to really more of an offensive approach. We've put more people on the streets. We're leveraging our new ERP system and really driving efficiencies and really looking to grow our share this year, and we think that we started to see some of those results in the fourth quarter and we're optimistic going into '11. If you move over to paint, really in paint we've got a three-pronged strategy. We have enhancing our core DIY [do it yourself] paint, and that's our Premium Plus where we brought out our new low VOC [Volatile Organic Compound] formula at 50 or less. We have our PPUI [Premium Plus Ultra Interior] business, which continues to perform extremely well at rates above the conversion rates above what we had originally anticipated. We're growing in adjacent Pro categories with Kilz, which really gives us the right product at the right price for the Pro. But it has a tremendous value prop [proposition], where we've got factory tinting, direct to job site. It's available in stock at the Home Depot and it's supported by both inside and outside sales. And the rollout of that new product really starts next week and continues into the second quarter. And then we're penetrating markets outside of the U.S, so we've got Behr really doing a lot of work to really look at, “How do they limit their concentration in North America?” So we feel pretty good about paint. On the Cabinets side, we've talked about Cabinets. Cabinet’s still been a very high promotional category. Competitors, as well as ourselves, are having to run promotions to drive sales. We're seeing that those promotions had kind of a lingering effect, meaning that there's a lot more value at opening price points. So we're seeing consumers -- we're seeing a shift down there, not necessarily where consumers are moving off of high-end products, but they're just getting better value at lower prices. And we've got to respond to that with some different products, and we're in the midst of coming up with a response to, really, that changing marketplace. On the Plumbing side, we've really done a lot of good work in Plumbing. As a matter fact, I would say, our share’s up on the wholesale channel as well as on the commercial side. Our high-end products are selling well. Our technology is resonating. Our Touch [Touch2O] faucets continue to do extremely well, and we'll be launching Touch into the lavatory faucets in April of this year where we think it may even be more of a compelling value proposition. Our DIAMOND Seal Technology has really been a real win for us in Plumbing. We have it in our single-handle faucets. We're moving it into our two-handle faucets. And DIAMOND Seal does a lot of things for us, but by converting that waterway from brass to PEX, it allows us to really change the dynamic related to the impact of some of the commodity costs. So we're looking at alternative materials that we can use in the construction of the faucet body that helps mitigate some of the effects. And so we feel really good. Probably the area in faucets that we've really worked hard is really at the opening price point. And then the opening price point, we've done a lot of work there to kind of retool the line. We did a lot of work back really in '07, '08, '09 to get our cost structure right, and we've been relaunching both the low-end Delta product and the Peerless product and had us a new launch just recently at Menards that we're pretty excited about. So doing a lot of good work across all the segments."

We have incurred some costs in both of those segments in the fourth quarter. Plumbing, that's basically related to Hansgrohe. We've talked about that in the past. They continue to do just a very good job of moving into other geographies, if you will, and our Milgard Window business has done a very nice job of penetrating the Western Canadian markets, as well as in Texas. I think they've got about 68 dealers currently signed up in Texas. So we've incurred some costs in both those segments related to geographic expansion. And in the Cab [Cabinets] area, we had expense in the fourth quarter that last year was in the third quarter in terms of some major promotional activities, just relative to where the costs kind of fell. So hopefully that helps a little bit."

I realize that this is a business that did mid-teens. We're sort of waiting quite a while just to get back to double digits. And if I look at the business prior to the restructuring, it lost about $20 million over six quarters. The two quarters since restructuring where we've taken costs out, it lost over $70 million. So really just trying to get a handle on how we should really think about this business, if it's just a wait-for-volume approach and it's going to be multiple years until we can think about it as a normal run rate or if there's going to be dramatic changes that we're going to see ultimately flow through here in 2011."

But having said that, I don't think there's any question in our mind that we could see some significant improvement in terms of reducing the losses in 2011. Obviously, this is a business that is very sensitive to volume. We mentioned that we believe the breakeven is $1.6 million (sic) [$1.6 billion] in terms of sales and generally speaking, what probably makes the most sense is a contribution margin around 30% for this particular business. As we continue to push on the dealers side, we've mentioned this in the past. The dealer represents about 70% of the market. Donnie talked about some wins that we've had there that we're very encouraged by. Our three-brand strategy continues to resonate. The problem is we just haven't seen a lot of impact on the top line. Just to get your perspective, we estimate that the dealers that we've been able to penetrate with an additional brand -- as Donnie mentioned earlier, that represents about $50 million in annual revenue opportunity, again, and that's based on current market conditions. The other thing that we think can help differentiate us is the ProCision investment that we've made in the countertop solution, which we can marry up with the Cabinets. So we think as we continue to roll the strategy out, continue to focus on expanding our offerings at price points, as Donnie mentioned earlier, that we've got a chance to pick up share with the two leading brands in that particular category."

That's Cabinets and that's Installation. And I guess from a big picture perspective given your question, there are probably three things to think about. One would be closure. One might be divestiture. The other might be trying to balance the short term and manage the short term as aggressively as you can and position the business for the future. From our perspective, we think there's a lot of value creation opportunity in both of these segments. Obviously, volume is very important to us in both of these segments. I mean, there's no question about that. These businesses were built for a much different environment. But having said that, our feeling is that continuing to manage aggressively, to do the best job we can on a near-term basis to limit the losses and negative cash flow -- but to continue to invest and position these businesses for the future makes a whole lot more sense to us from a shareholder perspective, just in terms of value creation. We’ve got, we think, very good leadership teams in both businesses. We've got a lot of good things going on from an organizational standpoint, just in terms of the way the business is structured and managed. We should be much more nimble. We should be much more flexible going forward. And I think my sense is we'll be very, very efficient as we work our way into a more normalized environment. So we think there's a huge value creation opportunity here. I don't know, Donnie, if you want to mention a little bit about the OC [Owens Corning] [audio gap] to Install. It may be something that folks haven't focused on maybe as much as -- go ahead."

These are segment-leading businesses within their segments. We feel very, very good about the teams. Tim talked about what we've done to really improve our leadership teams and drive accountability and execution. Seeing the results of that in Installation, where we're moving from really restructuring to offensive positioning here in 2011, and like what we're seeing as far as early results. We certainly are seeing more bidding activity so far in 2011 than we saw at the end of 2010. We're encouraged by that. Now whether that turns into projects and work we'll see, but we're encouraged by the level of bidding activity. Tim mentioned the Owens Corning agreement, and we're excited about the relationship that we announced with Owens Corning. We see tremendous opportunity, with our new ERP system, around supply chain by giving them forward-looking visibility to our demand and how we might think about taking costs out. I think there's tremendous opportunities between Masco and Owens Corning. We are the leaders in Building Science. We've brought out the Environments For Living program. We have 140,000 homes built to that specification where we can guarantee energy costs, drive efficiencies, really improve our take per unit. Owens Corning is a leader in Building Science with some of their programs and we've started looking more from a solutions point of view, not a product and install point of view, “What can we do together?” We think it's pretty staggering. And then the work we can do on governmental affairs and really driving the right type of legislation and getting behind things that make sense for energy efficiency, greenhouse gases -- we just see a tremendous partnership here with Owens Corning. So we're really excited about where we're at in those two segments and we think there's a tremendous opportunity to create value, continue to take costs out. We're doing the right things and we're hoping that's going to pay off very shortly."

Donnie talked about more feet on the street. That should help us from a top line perspective. You saw we talked a little bit some of the cost takeout last year. The guys did a great job offsetting volume declines, which incidentally reminds me that you should point out that across the company -- not just in Installation, but across the company -- we had about an 8% headcount reduction in 2010.

As we know, if you look at the price point of the foreclosure and whether or not it's an investor or a homeowner that ultimately made the purchase, so a lot of variables there. I would tell you that when we [audio gap] we have a tremendous opening price-point product and that's our quality product. And that product was hampered by our initiative to go to account in chassis. That's behind us. So in December, we started shipping over 50% of line on the new chassis. We've seen dealers come back and we've been able to attack that market through our dealer network. The quality product is also made available to the builders, so we feel really good about where we're at with the builders and where we're at with the dealers of having the right product and then being able to trade people up into features, into Merillat. And for those people who really want that dream kitchen, we've got our KraftMaid brand. Where we really have been lagging is our ability to get to those lower price points in retail, and I don't want to give out any secrets yet, but we're really excited about what we're going to bring to our customers here in early 2011, to address some of those lower price points and then really talk about, “How do we take those customers and provide opportunities for them to get better features?” And we think some or a lot of that foreclosure business is running through our large home center customers.

We continue to be confident going into 2011 that we'll be able to address the $30 million to $40 million of headwind, and one of the key issues for us is availability as it relates to paint. That's an area that has been challenging. We see resins in a little better position from an availability standpoint going into 2011. TiO2 continues to be probably a little bit more of a challenge.

And if you please flip to Slide #3, we'll start with the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were off 9%. Excluding unusual items in the quarter, business rationalization charges, impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles and normalizing our tax rate to 36%, we would have lost $0.08 [per common share] in the quarter compared to $0.05 of income in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an as-reported basis, including those items and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, we would have lost approximately $2.96 in the fourth quarter. Gross margins, adjusted for the items that I described earlier, decreased 370 basis points to 23.2%. And for those of you who have had a chance to look at the appendix, we do have a reconciliation of EPS, gross margins, as well as operating income in the appendix.

That primarily relates to our Installation-related business. I think you're all aware that on an annual basis, we do a goodwill impairment test. That's a discounted cash flow, has a lot of assumptions in it. We did tweak a couple of the assumptions in terms of the terminal year, reducing housing starts from 1.6 million to 1.5 million -- that's about a 6% reduction -- and an increase in the discount rate, and those two essentially drove the impairment charge. 
In terms of deferred tax assets, this is a very highly technical accounting area. The fact that we are in a three-year cumulative loss position, in large part driven by some of the charges that we've taken over the course of the last couple of years, negates previously identified tax strategies and puts us in a position where we had to record a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets of $370 million (sic) [$371 million]. Those assets, incidentally, are still available to us from an economic standpoint in terms of limiting cash taxes going forward. Both of those items cost about $2.76 in the quarter. That's the EPS impact, and I would point out, very importantly, that we were able to amend our credit agreement just a couple of days ago. So we continue to have significant availability, I think about $1.1 billion in terms of availability under the line. 
If you flip to Slide #5, take a quick look at the full year. Net sales on a full year basis were down 3%. Again, excluding the items I mentioned earlier, adjusting for those, our earnings per share would have been $0.16 in 2010 compared to $0.31 in 2009. I would point out to you, and it is on the reconciliation in the back, that we did have increased other expense this year over last year of about $72 million pretax. That's about $0.13 in terms of earnings per share. That reflects interest, currency translation, losses and impairments for financial investments. Our loss on an as-reported basis in the year would have been $3 per share. And gross margins, as adjusted, would have been down only 10 basis points to 26.4%. Working capital, as a percent of sales, improved to 13.4%. I'll talk a little more about that later. We generated $290 million of free cash flow and very importantly, ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash.
If you please [audio gap] Slide #6. Obviously, 2010 was a very challenging year for us. We came out of 2009 with a relatively strong operating performance offsetting a lot of volume drop with cost reductions and improvement in price/commodity relationships and had some nice momentum going into 2010. The first half was a little more positive. I think our sales were up 2%, 3%, and the second half was much more challenging. We saw housing starts slow in the second half. We saw expenditures for big ticket repair/remodel items continue to be deferred. And I think it's a good point for me to talk about our sales to key retailers. 
In the fourth quarter, our sales to key retailers were off mid-teens. About 2/3 of that decline relates to our Cabinet-related businesses and as you know, we're exiting some products related to Cabinets. That would put our non-Cabinet business off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter. That's up against the pretty tough comp in the fourth quarter of 2009 when sales to key retail customers were up 8%, and we had pretty strong Cabinet results in the fourth quarter of '09. From a trend standpoint, if you take a look at the third quarter, we were off 4% in terms of sales to key retailers. About half of that related to our Cabinet business, which would put our non-Cabinet business off about 2% in the third quarter. So for comparative purposes, off mid-single digit in the fourth quarter for non-Cabinet business, off about 2% in the third quarter for non-Cabinet business.
Full year adjusted gross margins and operating margins were pretty comparable to the prior year, as you can see on the slide, and that was somewhat of a positive for us. Obviously a difficult year, but we were able to keep our decremental margin to about 2%. On an adjusted basis, our operating profit was down from $435 million to $430 million on a $200 million decline in sales. And so we were able to offset volume declines, negative price commodity relationships. Those were both about $60 million roughly, with about $110 million net of cost-related reductions. So we had a pretty tough year, but one where we were able to offset some of the negative items impacting our business. 
If you flip to Slide #7. In addition to holding our decremental margin to 2%, we continued to do a lot of positive things to position Masco for success down the road. We continue to strengthen our brands. We're working very hard on fixed-cost reductions. We've shared that with you in the past. We estimate by the end of 2010, we had achieved about $500 million of fixed-cost reductions. We've got a lot of good initiatives going on from a supply chain standpoint. And innovation, again, is a major driver for us. So we've talked about the Watkins Ace Sanitizer, the RED line at Arrow and some of the sensing technology at Delta. Those have all been very positively received in the marketplace, and we continue to focus on new products at value price points. The Milgard Simplicity window, the Watkins Hotspot spa, Kilz Pro-X, which we recently announced, all will be positive entries at the lower price point area and we've got some exciting things going on in Cabinets and Plumbing targeted for later this year.
If you flip to Slide #8, we'll take a look at our segments, and we'll start with Cabinets. Cabinets had another very tough quarter in the fourth quarter. Our sales were down 29% in the quarter. For the full year, we were off 13% in terms of Cabinet sales. Excluding sales related to products that we're exiting, we would have been down 22% in the fourth quarter and about 10% on a full year basis. Decremental margin was 45% in the fourth quarter. Obviously, that's very high. Our contribution margin normally is around 30%. In addition to volume reductions, we had under-absorption of fixed costs impacting us, increases in promotional activity and less favorable price/commodity relationships. We’ve [audio gap] challenges in Europe relative to particleboard. On a full year basis, our decremental margin of 24% is very much in line with our contribution margin. 
If you flip to Slide #9. Just taking a look at Cabs [Cabinets], we've talked a lot about our Cabinet business over the last several quarters at investor conferences, talked about our strategy, and we feel like we've got a lot of things going in the right direction there. Our integration is on plan, and we are focusing on about $180 million of fixed-cost reduction by the time we complete that process with a much more nimble footprint. We think our brand strategy is resonating well with customers, particularly with dealers. Our three-brand strategy really covers very effectively the market needs from one vendor, which gives us a little bit of leverage in terms of being able to expand that innovation and brand building. We've got a lot of innovation in the pipeline. We shared some of that at the International Builders' Show, and we continue to believe that the countertop solution that we're developing, ProCision, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We believe that with housing starts in a range of 1.1 million to 1.3 million and with a more normalized repair and remodel environment, that this segment can get back to double-digit margins, and we feel very confident about that.
If you flip to Slide #10, talk about Plumbing. Sales in the fourth quarter were off 1%, down slightly. Our decremental margin was pretty high in the quarter. As you can see, the $10 million drop in sales, we had a $10 million drop in profit compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That includes the decline in sales, some product mix that was somewhat unfavorable in the quarter and expenditures for increased promotional activities. We did have a decline in margin in the quarter from 11.9% to 10.6%, still relatively strong. On a full year basis, we were up 5% in this particular segment, and we saw a 140-basis-point improvement in our operating margins with an incremental margin of 41%. So we feel real good about the Plumbing business, feel real good about the prospects going forward and feel real good about our full year performance. 
If you flip to Slide #11, Installation and Other Services. Again, one of our segments that has been most challenged by the downturn. And as a reminder, I think most of you are aware that the lion's share of the sales in this segment are tied directly to new home construction. We were off 7% in the fourth quarter, and our operating loss was constant with the prior year at $25 million. We were able to offset the volume declines with cost reductions. And as a reminder, I would mention to you on a full year basis, incremental losses related to the launch of our new WellHome business were $12 million on a full year basis and incrementally, $1 million in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, sales were down 9% and again, we did a very good job there in terms of holding operating losses relatively constant -- obviously, still very high. But a lot of good work in terms of cost reductions offsetting volume declines. 
If you flip to Slide #12. We've talked about Installation and this segment from an ongoing basis. We have lowered our fixed costs by approximately $180 million. We did announce late yesterday [audio gap] enter a new partnership, if you will, with Owens Corning that we think has some significant opportunities for us in terms of supply chain management; combining together to look at Building Science and applications to better develop products, techniques if you will, for Installation; and really an opportunity to better serve our customers. I'm sure you'll have a couple of questions about that and Donnie can elaborate on that a little bit later on. 
We expect that our ERP system will be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter, again giving us some significant capabilities in terms of efficiency and productivity. We continue to do a good job on the retrofit side. That business continues to grow. We've reduced complexity in this business and, I think, have done a very good job of enhancing our ability to execute in terms of some of the structural changes that we've made organizationally. We also have expanded our Service Partners footprint in terms of distribution opportunities, which we think will be very positive going forward. With housing starts in this particular segment at 1.1 million to 1.3 million, we think we can return to a minimum of high-single digit margins.
If you flip to Slide 13, our Decorative Architectural business was down 4% in the fourth quarter, and on a full year basis was down 1%. Reduced sales of builders' hardware offset a modest increase in paint sales for the full year. Decremental margins in this segment are relatively high and, as we've communicated previously, reflect unfavorable price/commodity relationships. I would point out in this segment that we had significant impact this year, but the group did a really nice job of offsetting a fair amount of that with productivity, cost management, expense management and that type of thing. So we're very pleased with that, and they also managed very well through a tight supply situation relative to raw materials. We talked about that in the past obviously. Margins on a full year basis were down from 21.9% to 20.7%, still obviously a very, very solid performance, a very significant contribution, and we're very, very pleased with the work that took place in this particular segment over the course of the last year. 
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 3% and on a full year basis, we were up 2%. Those sales increases were driven by share gains, geographic expansion and new products. Having said that, we also have an inverse relationship in terms of increased sales and reduced profitability. Those decremental margins in both the full year and the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to new product launches, geographic expansion, less favorable product mix and unfavorable price/commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide 15, I mentioned working capital a little bit earlier. We've seen some nice improvement here. Working capital as a percent of sales, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, decreased to 13.4% from 14.7% and just really an outstanding job across the enterprise. We started to focus on working capital management pretty intensely about I'd say about 10 years ago or so. This is the lowest relationship, the 13.4%, at least in recent memory, so we feel very good about that. We continue to believe that we can continue to improve our working capital management. We've got, as I mentioned earlier, some supply chain initiatives in place and we think there's more opportunity here, but just a really outstanding job across the enterprise. Donnie, John, our group guys, our business unit leaders -- very, very pleased with the management here.
If you flip to Slide 16, I want to make just a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. We're anticipating a relatively slow start to 2011. Housing starts in the last half of 2010 were pretty slow, and we tend to operate on a lag basis of about 90 days typically. So as we go into 2011, we're anticipating a little bit of a slow start. Obviously, the weather has been a little bit of a factor. We do think repair/remodel activity will be a little bit better this year, modestly improved. We continue to believe that bigger ticket items will probably continue to be deferred at least for a while until home prices stabilize and we see a little bit of movement in terms of job creation. 
Having said that, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control: driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, continuing to focus on our cost structure. And in particular, we'll continue to focus on the Installation business and the Cabinet business. Obviously, last year was a tough year for both of these segments. We anticipate that we'll see some bottom line improvement this year. Our sense is that if the economic numbers come in where we think they will and again, we're anticipating housing starts to be up about 15%, which is pretty much in line with the blue-chip consensus -- if we see that kind of activity, our feeling is that we can cut the losses that we incurred in these segments last year by $60 million to $80 million and certainly anticipate making some very good progress in both of those segments.
We continue to be very optimistic about the longer term. Household formations, population growth, the age of the housing stock -- all of those are positives, we think, for our business and we don't know when, but when we get back to a stronger situation relative to housing, relative to repair/remodel activity and we can see ourselves at $10 billion to $12 billion in sales -- we certainly believe that we can generate low-double to mid-teen margins at those kinds of sales levels. And we think we're laying a very good foundation, a very good base to get us there.
And with that, we will open up the lines for Q&A."

We look at market share in the Cabinets. I mean, clearly, in the retail side of the business, we've had some challenges there with price points and we've seen the consumer really -- we've seen more activity at the lower price points were through some heavy promotional activities. Consumers are getting better value at lower prices and with our retail presence with KraftMaid, that creates a little bit of a challenge for us -- getting into some of those lower-priced buckets where we're seeing a higher percentage of sales. We're working on that. We believe we've got some things we'll be launching here in the second quarter to really address some of those lower prices, and we have our team really focused on how we might attack that at retail. Within the dealer community, a little bit of mixed results. We've seen a little bit of share loss on quality as we went through our Q [ph] back initiative, which was really getting all of the Merillat and Quality product on the same chassis. We've completed the first phase of that and began shipping product in December on the new chassis, so we think that it was a temporary share loss that we'll get back. Merillat really had a strong year. We're gaining share both at dealers and new home construction, so we feel really good about where we're at with dealers. Plus as we've talked about before, our Dealer Advantage Program, we've had 279 dealers commit to the Dealer Advantage Program, representing 92 new customers, and 187 existing customers added additional brands. So we feel really good about where we're at on the dealer side. And on the builder side, we think we've held our share if not grown our share, particularly with Merillat."

What we're anticipating at this point from a price commodity standpoint -- obviously, we're seeing a fair amount of pressure pretty much across the spectrum. Metals prices, zinc and copper, have continued to move up. We've had tightness in supply related to the components that go into paint, both resins and TiO2. But having said that, we're in a relatively good position. We estimate, at this point in time, that the headwinds going into 2011 represent about $30 million to $40 million in total. In other words, that would be the unfavorable relationship, if you will, between price and commodity based on what we sort of see on the horizon. Now having said that, we fully expect that we can offset that $30 million to $40 million either through productivity, either through working with our suppliers or through pricing-related activities. The areas that are probably the most significant for us, again, would be paint and Plumbing. I mentioned earlier we have seen some real challenges from a particleboard standpoint in Europe related to vellum operation over there. We estimate that we've got about $65 million of rationalization charges as we go into 2011. About $35 million of that relates to our Cabinet business, about $10 million in Install [Installation] and about $20 million in Plumbing. From a cost saving standpoint, on a gross basis at this point in time, we estimate that our lean activities, productivity focus, as well as some of the cost reductions that we've been driving across the enterprise should, on a gross basis, represent about $150 million. Most of that would be in the Cabinet, Installation and Plumbing-related business, say, $40 million to $45 million in each of those segments with the other approximate $20 million spread among the Decorative Art and the Other segment. And I think that gives you pretty good perspective. One of the other areas that you folks have probably noticed is that we had a very good outcome in our general corp [corporate] expense in 2010. We came in at $110 million and we're estimating that, that number will be more like $140 million in 2011. Hopefully, we've got a little bit of conservatism in there but we had a very good experience in 2010 related to general insurance. Workers' comp and some other accruals related to performance compensation were down. We do anticipate those moving back up and again, a lot of that's based on experience. We continue to manage all those areas very aggressively and we've got a little bit of healthcare-related inflation as well. But I think from a big-picture standpoint, that gives you a pretty good perspective of some of the components that we see going into 2011. I would point out that, just from a modeling standpoint, if you're anticipating incremental sales in 2011 we would suggest a contribution margin of approximately 30% continues to give a pretty good feel in terms of where the bottom line would fall out."

Certainly, we still have a tough Installation market as far as demand goes. We've still seen competitive pricing there. But I will tell you, on the Installation side we've really moved from continuing to rationalize that business and take costs out to really more of an offensive approach. We've put more people on the streets. We're leveraging our new ERP system and really driving efficiencies and really looking to grow our share this year, and we think that we started to see some of those results in the fourth quarter and we're optimistic going into '11. If you move over to paint, really in paint we've got a three-pronged strategy. We have enhancing our core DIY [do it yourself] paint, and that's our Premium Plus where we brought out our new low VOC [Volatile Organic Compound] formula at 50 or less. We have our PPUI [Premium Plus Ultra Interior] business, which continues to perform extremely well at rates above the conversion rates above what we had originally anticipated. We're growing in adjacent Pro categories with Kilz, which really gives us the right product at the right price for the Pro. But it has a tremendous value prop [proposition], where we've got factory tinting, direct-to-job-site. It's available in stock at the Home Depot and it's supported by both inside and outside sales. And the rollout of that new product really starts next week and continues into the second quarter. And then we're penetrating markets outside of the U.S, so we've got Behr really doing a lot of work to really look at, “How do they limit their concentration in North America?” So we feel pretty good about paint. On the Cabinets side, we've talked about Cabinets. Cabinet’s still been a very high promotional category. Competitors, as well as ourselves, are having to run promotions to drive sales. We're seeing that those promotions had kind of a lingering effect, meaning that there's a lot more value at opening price points. So we're seeing consumers -- we're seeing a shift down there, not necessarily where consumers are moving off of high-end products, but they're just getting better value at lower prices. And we've got to respond to that with some different products, and we're in the midst of coming up with a response to, really, that changing marketplace. On the Plumbing side, we've really done a lot of good work in Plumbing. As a matter fact, I would say, our share’s up on the wholesale channel as well as on the commercial side. Our high-end products are selling well. Our technology is resonating. Our Touch [Touch2O] faucets continue to do extremely well, and we'll be launching Touch into the lavatory faucets in April of this year where we think it may even be more of a compelling value proposition. Our DIAMOND Seal Technology has really been a real win for us in Plumbing. We have it in our single-handle faucets. We're moving it into our two-handle faucets. And DIAMOND Seal does a lot of things for us, but by converting that waterway from brass to PEX, it allows us to really change the dynamic related to the impact of some of the commodity costs. So we're looking at alternative materials that we can use in the construction of the faucet body that helps mitigate some of the effects. And so we feel really good. Probably the area in faucets that we've really worked hard is really at the opening price point. And then the opening price point, we've done a lot of work there to kind of retool the line. We did a lot of work back really in '07, '08, '09 to get our cost structure right, and we've been relaunching both the low-end Delta product and the Peerless product and had us a new launch just recently at Menards that we're pretty excited about. So doing a lot of good work across all the segments."

We have incurred some costs in both of those segments in the fourth quarter. Plumbing, that's basically related to Hansgrohe. We've talked about that in the past. They continue to do just a very good job of moving into other geographies, if you will, and our Milgard Window business has done a very nice job of penetrating the Western Canadian markets, as well as in Texas. I think they've got about 68 dealers currently signed up in Texas. So we've incurred some costs in both those segments related to geographic expansion. And in the Cab [Cabinets] area, we had expense in the fourth quarter that last year was in the third quarter in terms of some major promotional activities, just relative to where the costs kind of fell. So hopefully that helps a little bit."

When I read your comments of getting back to double-digit margins in a 1.1 million, 1.3 million housing start environment and whether you use our forecast or consensus that some of that might not happen for five years. I realize that this is a business that did mid-teens. We're sort of waiting quite a while just to get back to double digits. And if I look at the business prior to the restructuring, it lost about $20 million over six quarters. The two quarters since restructuring where we've taken costs out, it lost over $70 million. So really just trying to get a handle on how we should really think about this business, if it's just a wait-for-volume approach and it's going to be multiple years until we can think about it as a normal run rate or if there's going to be dramatic changes that we're going to see ultimately flow through here in 2011."

In terms of getting back to that double-digit margin, we mentioned that we think we can do that at 1.1 million to 1.3 million in terms of starts, and most forecasts have starts getting to 1 million in 2013, so obviously that's a ways off. But having said that, I don't think there's any question in our mind that we could see some significant improvement in terms of reducing the losses in 2011. Obviously, this is a business that is very sensitive to volume. We mentioned that we believe the breakeven is $1.6 million (sic) [$1.6 billion] in terms of sales and generally speaking, what probably makes the most sense is a contribution margin around 30% for this particular business. As we continue to push on the dealers side, we've mentioned this in the past. The dealer represents about 70% of the market. Donnie talked about some wins that we've had there that we're very encouraged by. Our three-brand strategy continues to resonate. The problem is we just haven't seen a lot of impact on the top line. Just to get your perspective, we estimate that the dealers that we've been able to penetrate with an additional brand -- as Donnie mentioned earlier, that represents about $50 million in annual revenue opportunity, again, and that's based on current market conditions. The other thing that we think can help differentiate us is the ProCision investment that we've made in the countertop solution, which we can marry up with the Cabinets. So we think as we continue to roll the strategy out, continue to focus on expanding our offerings at price points, as Donnie mentioned earlier, that we've got a chance to pick up share with the two leading brands in that particular category."

We've got to have the right product and portfolio to be able to address that and do so in a meaningful way. We're attacking the dealer. 70% of the sales here are to new construction.

One might be divestiture. The other might be trying to balance the short term and manage the short term as aggressively as you can and position the business for the future. From our perspective, we think there's a lot of value creation opportunity in both of these segments. Obviously, volume is very important to us in both of these segments. I mean, there's no question about that. These businesses were built for a much different environment. But having said that, our feeling is that continuing to manage aggressively, to do the best job we can on a near-term basis to limit the losses and negative cash flow -- but to continue to invest and position these businesses for the future makes a whole lot more sense to us from a shareholder perspective, just in terms of value creation. We’ve got, we think, very good leadership teams in both businesses. We've got a lot of good things going on from an organizational standpoint, just in terms of the way the business is structured and managed. We should be much more nimble.

Now whether that turns into projects and work we'll see, but we're encouraged by the level of bidding activity. Tim mentioned the Owens Corning agreement, and we're excited about the relationship that we announced with Owens Corning. We see tremendous opportunity, with our new ERP system, around supply chain by giving them forward-looking visibility to our demand and how we might think about taking costs out. I think there's tremendous opportunities between Masco and Owens Corning. We are the leaders in Building Science. We've brought out the Environments For Living program. We have 140,000 homes built to that specification where we can guarantee energy costs, drive efficiencies, really improve our take per unit. Owens Corning is a leader in Building Science with some of their programs and we've started looking more from a solutions point of view, not a product and install point of view, “What can we do together?” We think it's pretty staggering. And then the work we can do on governmental affairs and really driving the right type of legislation and getting behind things that make sense for energy efficiency, greenhouse gases -- we just see a tremendous partnership here with Owens Corning.

The toughest areas are definitely going to be Plumbing, as well as the paint side of things. And I think we've managed very well so far through that. As we mentioned earlier, we were able last year to offset a major portion of that. We did have negative price commodity impact to about $60 million on a full year basis. But we did have savings of about $100 million, $110 million, which substantially offset that and the volume drop. We continue to be confident going into 2011 that we'll be able to address the $30 million to $40 million of headwind, and one of the key issues for us is availability as it relates to paint. That's an area that has been challenging. We see resins in a little better position from an availability standpoint going into 2011. TiO2 continues to be probably a little bit more of a challenge. There's been some pretty significant cost increases in both of those areas. But given our relationships with our suppliers, the fact that we have shown some nice growth over the last few years and certainly anticipate growth going forward with our new Kilz Pro-X offering on the Pro side, we think we'll be able to get the amount of raw supply that we need and certainly be able to manage through that process.

I'm joined today by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.And if you would please flip to S",2794,"Thank you, David, and thank you for joining us today for Masco's first quarter 2011 earnings call. I'm joined today by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. Sales in the quarter were down 4%. Excluding rationalization charges, gains from financial investments and normalizing our tax rate at 36%, our loss for the quarter would have been $0.05 a share and that compares to $0.03 of income on the same basis in the first quarter of 2010. On an as-reported basis, we lost $0.13 in the quarter compared to a $0.02-cent loss in the first quarter of 2010. We had a nice job of managing working capital I'll talk a bit more about that later on and we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash. If you flip to Slide #4. Both gross profit and operating income reconciled for rationalization charges, our gross margin would have been down 140 basis points to 25.3%. And on that same basis again, reconciling for rationalization charges, our operating profit would have decreased from 5% last year to 3% this year. 
I mentioned that sales were down 4%. That equates to about $80 million of sales decline. Of that decline, about $53 million relates to cabinet products that we previously announced that we were exiting. So if you exclude that we would have been down a little less than a 1.5% rounding down to 1%. As I mentioned in the press release, if we exclude the exited cabinet products both February and March would have been relatively flat in terms of sales last year, again, across the entire company. 
Our international sales performed well. We were up 5% in terms of local currencies, had pretty good margins on those sales just a little bit less than 10% last year a little over 10%. And our sales to our key retail customers were down high single digits. A big portion of that well, almost all of that relates to Cabinets, and a big portion of that relates to the products that we announced that we were exiting. Without the product exit, we would have been down just slightly low single digits in terms of sales to key retailers. 
On an $80 million, we would anticipated based on contribution margin about a $25 million drop in profitability. We're down again on an adjusted basis about $39 million year-over-year, and the additional $15 million or so is represented by about $10 million of price/commodity relationship that is unfavorable in this quarter versus last year's first quarter, and we also had some new product and program launch-related costs in the quarter, as well as a negative product mix. So that pretty much explains the decremental margin, which approximated 50% in the quarter. 
If you flip to Slide #5. Again, taking a quick look at our earnings per share as we mentioned reconciling for rationalization charges and also taking out the positive impact of the gains on the financial investments, we would have lost about $0.05 in the quarter compared to the $0.03 of the income last year. 
If you flip to Slide #6. In terms of our Cabinet business, we were down about 24% in the quarter compared to last year. If we exclude the cabinet-related products that we're exiting, we would have been off about 13%. We had a decremental margin of 26%, which pretty much approximates our contribution margin. We did have slightly less favorable price/commodity relationship in the quarter. As we've mentioned in the past or last quarter, we've got some particleboard challenges in Europe. We also have under absorption of fixed cost but also had some cost reductions that offset a good portion of that. 
If you flip to Slide #7. We continue to be on track with the cabinet integration. We believe in the first quarter that on a sequential basis compared to the fourth quarter that we were able to increase our share position so again, if we compare the first quarter of '11 versus the first quarter of 2010, probably down still a little bit in terms of share. But on a sequential basis coming from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we have some nice gains in the home center channel driven largely by promotions. We continue to do well in the builder channel and in the dealer channel, we feel like we more than held our own in the first quarter. 
We continue to add dealers under our Dealer Advantage Program. We now have almost 350 dealers that have added a Masco brand, another Masco brand, if you will and about 125 of those dealers are new. We've also done some very good work from a process improvement standpoint, reducing our boarding time, on boarding time for new dealers from weeks to days. So we feel very good about that, and we continue to get some good traction, particularly with builders with our current stock position model. We continue to believe that break even for this segment is about $1.6 million in terms of revenue, and we've talked about that in the past, and we've also talked about the fixed cost reduction of approximately $180 million.
If you flip to Slide #8, Plumbing Products. It had another solid quarter. We were up 7% in the quarter. Margins were flat, relatively flat with last year just slightly down. Generally speaking, we would have anticipated a little higher incremental margin on these sales. Our contribution margin approximate 30%. But we did price/commodity relationships in this particular segment. I mentioned about $10 million roughly overall, about $4 million of that would have related to Plumbing and less favorable product mix in terms of the profitability in this segment.
If you flip to Slide #9. Again, another solid quarter for our Plumbing business. It continues to be driven by the work we're doing around our brands, innovation, design, global expansion. We believe we have a good quarter from a share perspective in terms of North America both at wholesale and retail, and I would point out that our 2 flagship brands Hansgrohe and Delta had very strong quarters with sales up mid to low teens in terms of those 2 businesses. 
We continue to emphasize innovation. Our Touch2O Technology has been applied to for the bathroom, and those were launched in April. And we anticipate some very favorable response to that product launch.
We also have some nice recognition in the quarter. Delta has been nominated as the finalist for an Effie Award, which is 1 of the most prestigious awards relative to advertising. And we've talked a little bit about the improvements we've made there in terms of unaided brand awareness. They've done a very good job of positioning and promoting the brand. And Hansgrohe again received a Product Design Award from the Federal Republic of Germany. So again, those are important recognitions, and we're very proud of both of those businesses.
If you flip to Slide #10, Installation and Other Services. We were off in this segment 7% in terms of sales. We did a modest improvement in terms of profitability in the quarter compared to last year's quarter, notwithstanding the fact that we were down $19 million in sales. We continue to benefit from a very good job of cross management in this segment and a little bit of help from mix as well just in terms of comparison into the first quarter of last year.
If you flip to Slide #11. We continue to improve our position from an Installation, Installation standpoint. We mentioned before that we thought that we may have cut a little bit too deep. We've added some salespeople. We talked about the expansion with Owens Corning last quarter. The result of that is we're seeing a lot of positive bidding activity. We think we've got a very good chance in terms of improvement from a share perspective going forward. This continues to be a competitive environment. Our feeling is a lot of our competitors are struggling at this point. So we think we've got some really good opportunities from a share perspective and believe that from the fourth quarter again, looking sequentially, that we were able to gain share in the first quarter of 2011. Still probably a little bit below where we were in the first quarter of 2010 but making some good progress.
We think with the ERP system, the leadership changes that we've talked about some of the other organizational changes that we're heading in the right direction relative to the Installation segment and anticipate improving performance going forward. From a break-even standpoint, we estimate break even at 700,000 to 750,000 starts as we've mentioned in the past, probably a little closer to the 750,000. 
If you flip to Slide #12 please, Decorative Architectural Products. Sales in this segment were off 4%, and essentially all of that decline is explained by programs that we launched at Wal-Mart both in paint, which we announced last year, as well as builders' hardware. Our paint without that Wal-Mart sales loss would have been up slightly in the quarter. Decremental margin continues to be in excess of our contribution margin, and we're down about $17 million in terms of profit versus last year on a $14 million sales decline, obviously, with still very strong margins in this segment. And I would suggest that, that $17 million think about that maybe in 3 buckets about 1/3 of that would relate to volume decline, a little less than 1/3 relates to unfavorable price/commodity relationships and the remainder would be program cost related to new opportunities that we're pursuing. 
Having said that, we continue to face raw material supply challenges relative to paint. We think we're managing through that very well at this point in time, but it is a situation where supply of both resins and TiO2 continues to be tight.
If you flip to Slide #13. As I mentioned, we expended some money and continue to pursue top line opportunities in both paint and hardware. We've talked about the Direct to Pro and as part of that, we've launched Kilz Pro-X earlier this year, and we should have all the Home Depot stores set by the end of the second quarter. I think we're a little over halfway there. So we're excited about the opportunities there. 
We also had some very good recognition in terms of both the Behr and the Kilz brand. Behr as we mentioned previously achieved #1 rankings in a recent independent consumer study. Kilz also fared very well in that study I might add, and the recent Harris Poll, Kilz was ranked highest among paint brands for the second year in a row. Behr did very well in that particular poll as well. And both of those brands do very well in terms of performance, quality assessments and that type of thing. We also believe that in the quarter based on track line that they continued to increase share across all do-it-yourself codings-related categories.
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales 2% just up a little bit continue to benefit from share gains, as well as new product introductions, geographic expansion. We did have an increase in the loss in this segment notwithstanding the fact that sales were up slightly. That reflects some unfavorable price/commodity relationship, a minor amount there, relatively insignificant, new product launch and geographic expansion costs and some unfavorable mix. 
We continue to do well in terms of share for both Milgard in the Western United States. They continue to do very well. The U.K. Window Group in the United Kingdom continues to gain share, and as I mentioned we've done some things with the Milgard brand in terms of expanding into both Western Canada, as well as Texas.
If you flip to Slide 16. I mentioned earlier that we had some nice improvements in terms of working capital. And as you can see when we take inventories plus receivables less payables, we were able to and compare that the last 12 months sales, we were down about 80 basis points. So I continue to see some very good performance across all of our businesses, really appreciate the effort from our folks across the company not only in managing working capital, but in continuing to address some of the challenges in the marketplace and certainly the continued implementation of the Masco Business System. So a lot of positives relative to balance sheet management and as I mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash.
I want to make a couple of comments before we go to the Q&A to wrap up. Obviously, economic signals at this point in time are relatively mixed, and most of the economists have reduced their expectations for 2011. And we currently see a less robust year than we might have anticipated just a couple of months ago, and currently anticipate that starts will probably be up somewhere around 10% for the full year. I would remind folks that we tend to operate on a lag basis. And with most of about 90-day lag basis I would point out and with most of those starts probably generated in the second half, we won't seen a lot of positive impact necessarily this year. 
The blue chip consensus I think I think it's for 630,000 starts here recently and a 10% improvement pretty much equates to a number in that ballpark. Having said that, as we have been, we'll continue to focus on those things that we have control over. We'll continue to drive the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continue to focus on innovation. We've done a very good job there and continue to manage our cost structure to fit the circumstance that we're in. While it's way, way too early to talk to any specifics, I'm excited about some of the opportunities that are developing across our businesses in a variety of product lines. We'll have more to say about that later this year. But we are looking at some very good opportunities again, and a variety of products that when time comes, we'll share some more specifics about that. 
We continue to make some progress on the Installation and Cabinets side. Last time we were together mid-April or mid-February, we talked about our anticipation that we could improve the operating performance there fairly significantly this year and reduce losses from last year, adjusted losses by $60 million to $80 million. Our sense is right now that we still anticipate some significant improvement in both of these segments. But given the decline on housing starts, we anticipate those numbers are probably going to be somewhere in the $40 million to $60 million range. But again, still some very good improvement.
We also believe that on a full year basis that we will be successful in terms of offsetting commodity costs and other inflation. Again, that's on a full year basis. We had a little bit of a negative impact in the first quarter as I mentioned roughly $10 million. But based on work that we've already done and other items we've got a couple of things we have to do but we feel very confident about our ability to be successful there. But our feeling is that we should be in very good shape. 
We talked about headwinds on our last conference call of $30 million to $40 million, but our feeling right now is that we have those covered. Obviously, commodities tend to be a fluid situation. There could be some additional increases going forward that we'll have to deal with, and we will, but we have been very successful working with suppliers, working on productivity, cost reduction and implementing price increases. So we feel very good about where we are at this point in time, and I would say for modeling purposes, if you were to use our overall contribution margin of 30% on whatever you think revenue changes might be, that's probably a pretty good proxy. 
From a long-term standpoint, continue to feel very comfortable, very confident about the fundamentals for our markets. Obviously, things are a little slower than we would have hoped or liked did this year, but we still feel that over the long term fundamentals are positive for both repair/remodel, new home construction and feel very confident that when we get back to top line sales in that $10 million to $12 million range that we'll be able to generate double-digit return on sales and also drive value and returns that are consistent with our shareholders' desire. 
And with that, we'll open up the lines for Q&A."

We have narrowed that gap and do feel that going into the first quarter that we were again, on a sequential basis we're probably still down a bit from last year's first quarter but again closing the gap and did make some progress fourth quarter to first quarter."

So we feel really good about the work we've done at Delta. Hansgrohe is doing well, and has been doing well for a long time. They really our focus on the high end market design and style and really the solid German engineering, the product and it's really resonated well in the emerging markets. Hansgrohe has expanded internationally now for the last 15 years and really has a very unique system for prioritizing markets, market entry and really going out from an organic basis to get into markets, penetrate the existing channels and understand the consumer have the right product assortment. And we really have focused heavily on international development for our North American businesses for about the last 2 years. Delta and Hansgrohe have been working very closely together in identifying target markets. Based on consumer segmentation, those 2 brands play very well with Hansgrohe really on the design high end side, Delta in that mid-market technology play. And they've been doing some of these things. So a lot of the gain we're seeing here in the quarter is related to the Hansgrohe global expansion, Delta more about what's going on in North America.

Into the Texas market, Texas historically been more of a low end aluminum market. That had transitioned into a vinyl market very similar to the products that we sell into Arizona and Nevada, New Mexico. So we feel really good about our expansion into Texas. We have some customer service locations there, as well as some sales reps and we have some dealers set up, and we're currently shipping product out of Arizona and feel really good about that. We also have been able to work with Milgard and Behr to come up with some colors on our vinyl windows to get some dark colors extrusion that doesn't absorb any heat, which stops the actual extrusion from creating from Boeing or really any size variation really to some of the heat that we get related to the sun in this climate.

So that happens to be more of a timing kind of issue. In terms of Plumbing, we do have some new product launches. We talked about the application of the Touch 2 technology to lab deposits for the bathroom. We are launching product. We've got window product that we've launched. We've launched the R.E.D. line at Arrow and other specialty. So those will be a couple of areas where promotional activities have kicked in. We've recently in the paint category again, seasonally we've got some things that kicked in.

We've got productivity initiatives, supply chain initiatives, a lot of different things going on. At this point, don't necessarily see a big item that would generate a restructuring charge that would be of a significant magnitude. We talked about the West Jordan Cabinet facility but last year early first quarter. That was a pretty big in terms of a charge. But at this point, I wouldn't necessarily see anything but again, I wouldn't rule that out. There could be opportunities for us to do some things to enhance the cost structure whether they might be a combination of a couple of businesses or whatever that we haven't thought of at this point that may come up down the road. But so I wouldn't really rule anything out. But that this time I think the $65 million is a pretty good estimate."

And so from our standpoint, as we've said to investors in the past, when we've returned about $50 million of what was the $850 million of original issuance and when you take that with the $300 million that we retired in March of 2010, that's $1.150 billion. What we've indicated to investors is that we believe that's on a net basis, that we'll retire about $300 million of that $1.150 billion debt. That requires some refinancing, if you will, obviously, of the remaining portion. And that obviously, is something that has to be developed over the course of the next year or so. Having said that, from our standpoint continuing to be somewhat conservative from a balance sheet perspective, making sure we've got a strong cash balance in case we don't refinance that debt for whatever reason, and we certainly would anticipate being successful there. I don't think that it makes sense for us to be thinking at this point about increases in the dividend or share repurchases. Obviously, as we get into the recovery, we see some expansion in terms of our business. We certainly have had a very strong history of cash flow generation. That 5-year period '03 to '07, we averaged about $1 billion of free cash flow a year, and that's with $1.5 billion of CapEx and another $300 million of investment in displays during that same 5-year period. We were able to reduce our shares outstanding by about 30%. And so just to get folks a little reminder I guess in terms of the capacity and capability that we have to generate cash.

Unfortunately going into April, based on what we know right now, it looks like April sales will be off. I'm going to guess probably mid-single digits at least the way things look right now. Again, we've had some we don't like to talk about weather but a lot of people have been talking about weather. Weather's been horrible and most areas and I think that's probably had some impact although I know it was pretty tough in March as well.

As I did mention relative to Wal-Mart, we had both some builders' hardware, as well as paint declines in the first quarter. And as I mentioned, if we excluded the implications to paint we would have been up a little bit in terms of paint. But our sense is they prefer that we not quantify that paint program. In terms of cab dealers, we did mention that we have been able to add 25 dealers, and we have been able to add a Masco brand at almost 350 dealers. So obviously, some of those are existing. And our sense is that we have not lost any dealers. So I think that was part of your question that we had a little bit of static on the line, and so I think I'm reading into it a little bit. But so we haven't lost any dealers, and I think I mentioned that our estimate of what we've been able to impact from added brand standpoint equates to an annual basis and again, not necessarily going to affect 2010 top line but about $55 million in terms of sales. And your question your last question was on Plumbing with Delta and Hansgrohe up low to mid-teens, does that suggest that the remaining Plumbing business is down? And I would say that's not necessarily the case. We continue to do well with hot tubs, which obviously continues to be a surprise to us, but I think is really reflective of a very strong market position, an excellent job of bringing out an opening price point product and just a very well-run business. And the fact that we've seen some guys go out of business, if you will, in terms of competitors. So I would say that's been a bright spot as well. Most of the rest of the businesses, as you know, we did supply things and some valves and that type of thing to that. I would say we're modestly better. Probably the only area where we saw any significant decline would have been in Canada in the Plumbing segment. We were down in Canada. We enjoyed a really, really strong 2010 in Canada as we mentioned last year. So we saw a little bit of a falloff there and again, their economy is slowing down a bit. So from that standpoint, I think that certainly is explainable. But for the most part, I think we feel like we're holding our own from a share standpoint in Plumbing, and I can't tell you have any, off the top of my head, any category that we're concerned about from a share perspective. So we feel pretty good about what's going on across that entire segment."

I'm joined today by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. Sales in the quarter were down 4%. Excluding rationalization charges, gains from financial investments and normalizing our tax rate at 36%, our loss for the quarter would have been $0.05 a share, and that compares to $0.03 of income on the same basis in the first quarter of 2010. On an as reported basis, we lost $0.13 in the quarter compared to a $0.02 loss in the first quarter of 2010. We had a nice job of managing working capital. I'll talk a bit more about that later on, and we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash. 
If you flip to Slide #4. [indiscernible] both gross profit and operating income reconciled for rationalization charges, our gross margin would have been down 140 basis points to 25.3%. And on that same basis again, reconciling for rationalization charges, our operating profit would have decreased from 5% last year to 3% this year.  I mentioned that sales were down 4%. That equates to about $80 million of sales decline. Of that decline, about $53 million relates to cabinet products that we previously announced that we were exiting. So if you exclude that, we would have been down a little less than a 1.5%, rounding down to 1%. As I mentioned in the press release, if we exclude the exited cabinet products, both February and March would have been relatively flat in terms of sales with last year, again, across the entire company. 
Our international sales performed well. We were up 5% in terms of local currencies, had pretty good margins on those sales, just a little bit less than 10%, last year, a little over 10%. And our sales to our key Retail customers were down high single digit. A big portion of that, well, almost all of that, relates to Cabinets, and a big portion of that relates to the products that we announced that we were exiting. Without the product exit, we would have been down just slightly low single digits in terms of sales to key retailers. 
On an $80 million [indiscernible] would anticipated based on contribution margin about a $25 million drop in profitability. We're down again on an adjusted basis, about $39 million year-over-year, and the additional $15 million or so is represented by about $10 million of price/commodity relationship that is unfavorable in this quarter versus last year's first quarter, and we also had some new product and program launch-related costs in the quarter, as well as a negative product mix. So that pretty much explains the decremental margin, which approximated 50% in the quarter. 
If you flip to Slide #5. Again, taking a quick look at our earnings per share, as we mentioned reconciling for rationalization charges and also taking out the positive impact of the gains on the financial investments, we would have lost about $0.05 in the quarter compared to the $0.03 of the income last year. 
If you flip to Slide #6. In terms of our Cabinet business, we were down about 24% in the quarter compared to last year. If we exclude the Cabinet-related products that we're exiting, we would have been off about 13%. We had a decremental margin of 26%, which pretty much approximates our contribution margin. We did have slightly less favorable price/commodity relationship in the quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, during the last quarter, we've got some particleboard challenges in Europe. We also had under absorption of fixed cost, but also had some cost reductions that offset a good portion of that. 
If you flip to Slide #7. We continue to be on track with the cabinet integration. We believe in the fourth quarter -- or excuse me, in the first quarter, that on a sequential basis compared to the fourth quarter, that we were able to increase our share position. So again, if we compare the first quarter of '11 versus the first quarter of 2010, probably down still a little bit in terms of share. But on a sequential basis, coming from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we have some nice gains in the home center channel, driven largely by promotions. We continue to do well in the builder channel and in the dealer channel, we feel like we more than held our own in the first quarter. 
We continue to add dealers under our Dealer Advantage Program. We now have almost 350 dealers that have added a Masco brand, another Masco brand, if you will, and about 125 of those dealers are new. We've also done some very good work from a process improvement standpoint, reducing our boarding time, on-boarding time for new dealers from weeks to days. So we feel very good about that, and we continue to get some good traction, particularly with builders with our current shop precision model. We continue to believe that breakeven for this segment is about $1.6 million in terms of revenue, and we've talked about that in the past, and we've also talked about the fixed cost reduction of approximately $180 million.
If you flip to Slide #8, Plumbing Products. It had another solid quarter. We were up 7% in the quarter. Margins were flat, relatively flat with last year, just slightly down. Generally speaking, we would have anticipated a little higher incremental margin on these sales. Our contribution margin approximate 30%. But we did a favorable price/commodity relationships in this particular segment. I mentioned about $10 million roughly overall. About $4 million of that would have related to Plumbing, and less favorable product mix in terms of the profitability in this segment.
If you flip to Slide #9. Again, another solid quarter for our Plumbing business. It continues to be driven by the work we're doing around our brands, innovation, design, global expansion. We believe we had a good quarter from a share perspective in terms of North America both at wholesale and Retail, and I would point out that our 2 flagship brands, Hansgrohe and Delta, had very strong quarters, with sales up mid-to-low teens in terms of those 2 businesses.  We continue to emphasize innovation. Our Touch2O Technology is being applied to lab process for the bathroom, and those were launched in April, and we anticipate some very favorable response to that product launch.
We also have some nice recognition in the quarter. Delta has been nominated as the finalist for an Effie Award, which is 1 of the most prestigious awards relative to advertising. And we've talked a little bit about the improvements we've made there in terms of unaided brand awareness. They've done a very good job of positioning and promoting the brand. And Hansgrohe, again, received a Product Design Award from the Federal Republic of Germany. So again, those are important recognitions, and we're very proud of both of those businesses.
If you flip to Slide #10, Installation and Other Services. We were off in this segment 7% in terms of sales. We did a modest improvement in terms of profitability in the quarter compared to last year's quarter, notwithstanding the fact that we were down $19 million in sales. We continue to benefit from a very good job of cost management in this segment, and a little bit of help from mix as well, just in terms of comparison to the first quarter of last year.
If you flip to Slide #11. We continue to improve our position from an Insulation Installation standpoint. We mentioned before that we thought that we may have cut a little bit too deep. We've added some salespeople. We talked about the expanded strategic relationship with Owens Corning last quarter. The result of that is we're seeing a lot of positive bidding activity. We think we've got a very good chance in terms of improvement from a share perspective going forward. This continues to be a competitive environment. Our feeling is a lot of our competitors are struggling at this point. So we think we've got some really good opportunities from a share perspective, and believe that from the fourth quarter again, looking sequentially, that we were able to gain share in the first quarter of 2011, still probably a little bit below where we were in the first quarter of 2010, but making some good progress.
We think with the ERP system, the leadership changes that we've talked about, some of the other organizational changes that we're heading in the right direction relative to the Installation segment, and anticipate improving performance going forward. From a breakeven standpoint, we estimate breakeven at 700,000 to 750,000 starts as we've mentioned in the past, probably a little closer to the 750,000. 
If you flip to Slide #12, please, Decorative Architectural Products. Sales in this segment were off 4%, and essentially all of that decline is explained by programs that we launched at Wal-Mart both in Paint, which we announced last year, as well as builders' hardware. Our Paint without that Wal-Mart sales loss would have been up slightly in the quarter. Decremental margin continues to be in excess of our contribution margin, and we're down about $17 million in terms of profit versus last year on a $14 million sales decline, obviously, with still very strong margins in this segment. And I would suggest that, that $17 million -- think about that maybe in 3 buckets. About 1/3 of that would relate to volume decline. A little less than 1/3 relates to unfavorable price/commodity relationships, and the remainder would be program cost related to new opportunities that we're pursuing.  Having said that, we continue to face raw material supply challenges relative to Paint. We think we're managing through that very well at this point in time, but it is a situation where supply of both resins and TiO2 continues to be tight.
If you flip to Slide #13. As I mentioned, we've expended some money, and continue to pursue top line opportunities in both Paint and hardware. We've talked about the Direct to Pro program and as part of that, we launched Kilz Pro-X earlier this year, and we should have all the Home Depot stores set by the end of the second quarter. I think we're a little over halfway there, so we're excited about the opportunities there. 
We also had some very good recognition in terms of both the Behr and the Kilz brand. Behr, as we mentioned previously, achieved #1 rankings in a recent independent consumer study. Kilz also fared very well in that study, I might add. And in the recent Harris Poll, Kilz was ranked highest among Paint brands for the second year in a row. Behr did very well in that particular poll as well. And both of those brands do very well in terms of performance, quality assessments and that type of thing. We also believe that in the quarter, based on track line, that Behr continued to increase share across all do-it-yourself codings-related categories.
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales, 2%, just up a little bit, continue to benefit from share gains, as well as new product introductions, geographic expansion. We did have increase in the loss in this segment, notwithstanding the fact that sales were up slightly. That reflects some unfavorable price/commodity relationship, a minor amount there, relatively insignificant, new product launch, and geographic expansion costs and some unfavorable mix.  We continue to do well in terms of share for both Milgard in the Western United States. They continue to do very well. The U.K. Window Group in the United Kingdom continues to gain share. And as I mentioned, we've done some things with the Milgard brand in terms of expanding into both Western Canada, as well as Texas.
If you flip to Slide 16. I mentioned earlier that we had some nice improvements in terms of working capital. And as you can see, when we take inventories plus receivables, less payables, we were able to -- and compare that to last 12 months sales, we were down about 80 basis points. So I continue to see some very good performance across all of our businesses, really appreciate the effort from our folks across the company, not only in managing working capital, but in continuing to address some of the challenges in the marketplace and certainly, the continued implementation of the Masco Business System. So a lot of positives relative to balance sheet management and as I mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash.
I want to make a couple of comments before we go to the Q&A to wrap up. Obviously, economic signals at this point in time are relatively mixed, and most economists have reduced their expectations for 2011. And we currently see a less robust year than we might have anticipated just a couple of months ago, and currently anticipate that starts will probably be up somewhere around 10% for the full year. I would remind folks that we tend to operate on a lag basis, and with most of a 90-day lag basis I would point out. And with most of those starts probably generated in the second half, we won't see a lot of positive impact necessarily this year. 
The blue chip consensus, I think, is for 630,000 starts that came down here recently, and a 10% improvement pretty much equates to a number in that ballpark. Having said that, as we have been, we'll continue to focus on those things that we have control over. We'll continue to drive the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continue to focus on innovation. We've done a very good job there, and continue to manage our cost structure to fit the circumstance that we're in. While it's way, way too early to talk to any specifics, I'm excited about some of the opportunities that are developing across our businesses in a variety of product lines. We'll have more to say about that later this year. But we are looking at some very good opportunities again, and a variety of products that when the time comes, we'll share some more specifics about that. 
We continue to make some progress on the Installation and Cabinets side. Last time, we were together mid-April -- or excuse me, mid-February, we talked about our anticipation that we could improve the operating performance there fairly significantly this year and reduce losses from last year, adjusted losses by $60 million to $80 million. Our sense is, right now, that we still anticipate some significant improvement in both of these segments. But given the decline on housing starts, we anticipate those numbers are probably going to be somewhere in the $40 million to $60 million range. But again, still some very good improvement.
We also believe that on a full-year basis, that we will be successful in terms of offsetting commodity cost and other inflation. Again, that's on a full-year basis. We had a little bit of a negative impact in the first quarter, as I mentioned, roughly $10 million. But based on work that we've already done and other items, we've got a couple of things yet to do, but feel very confident about our ability to be successful there, but our feeling is that we should be in very good shape.  We talked about headwinds on our last conference call of $30 million to $40 million, but our feeling right now is that we have those covered. Obviously, commodities tend to be a fluid situation. There could be some additional increases, going forward, that we'll have to deal with, and we will. But we have been very successful working with suppliers, working on productivity, cost reductions and implementing price increases. So we feel very good about where we are at this point in time. And I would say for modeling purposes, if you were to use our overall contribution margin of 30% on whatever you think revenue changes might be, that's probably a pretty good proxy. 
From a long-term standpoint, continue to feel very comfortable, very confident about the fundamentals for our markets. Obviously, things are a little slower than we would have hoped or liked this year, but we still feel that over the long term, well, fundamentals are positive for both repair/remodel, new home construction, and feel very confident that when we get back to top line sales in that $10 million to $12 million range, that we'll be able to generate double digit return on sales, and also drive value and returns that are consistent with our shareholders' desire.  And with that, we'll open up the lines for Q&A."

We've done some things from an incentive standpoint. We've got the ERP system implementation that will be finalized here in the next couple of months. So we feel pretty good about where we are from just a managerial standpoint, if you will, and we've seen a significant increase in bidding activity. We've been able to be successful there. We also are developing some opportunities with some of the larger builders at this point in time, too early to talk about.

We've done a lot of hard work on our supply chain to reposition some of our lower SKUs more competitively, and that's really paid off both in top line and bottom line. So we feel really good about the work we've done at Delta. Hansgrohe is doing well, and has been doing well for a long time. They really are focused at the high-end market and design and style and really, the solid German engineering, the product, and it's really resonated well in the emerging markets. Hansgrohe has expanded internationally now for about the last 15 years, and really has a very unique system for prioritizing markets, market entry, and really going at it from an organic basis to get into markets, penetrate the existing channels, and understand the consumer, have the right product assortment. And we really have focused heavily on international development for our North American businesses for about the last 2 years. Delta and Hansgrohe have been working very closely together at identifying target markets. We think based on consumer segmentation, those 2 brands play very well, with Hansgrohe really on the design high-end side, Delta in that mid-market technology play. And they've been doing some new things. So a lot of the gain we're seeing here in the quarter is related to the Hansgrohe global expansion, Delta, more about what's going on in North America. But we have really laid the seeds for a strong Delta-Hansgrohe partnership outside of North America. So we feel really good about that."

But I think it would be erroneous to not assume that Delta hasn't done very well over the course of the last couple of years in terms of top line growth. We've talked a lot about the innovation that they brought out. They've done a really nice job of repositioning the brand. As we've mentioned in the past, I think if you go back, unaided brand awareness was up 9 points in a 2-year period of time, which is basically unheard of. So we've got good contribution from both of the flagship brands, if you will, and along with some of the other brands in that segment over the course of the last couple of years."

And Tim, when you think of -- what the product that we have in the Pacific Northwest and coming out of Tacoma, Western Canada, this is a national extension for us. It's a nice shifting radius from our manufacturing facilities, and the product in Western Canada is very similar to the product that we sell into the Pacific Northwest. Into the Texas market, Texas tends to historically been more of a low-end aluminum market. That had transitioned into a vinyl market, very similar to the products that we sell into Arizona and Nevada, New Mexico. So we feel really good about our expansion into Texas. We have some customer service locations there, as well as some sales reps, and we have some dealers set up, and we're currently shipping products out of Arizona, and feel really good about that. We also have been able to work with Milgard and Behr to come up with some colors on our vinyl windows, where we get some dark color extrusion that doesn't absorb any heat, which stops the actual extrusion from creating any -- from bow in -- or really any size variation related to some of the heat that we get related to the sun in those climates. So we think we have a differentiated product that we can bring into Texas, with the Milgard value proposition, and Pacific Northwest going into Canada, just a national extension for us."

We don't think that makes any sense. 1 might be to try to sell it, or maybe spin it out or is to something else, and a third alternative with a situation like that is to hold and try to improve. And our sense has been that there is a much more significant value-creation opportunity by continuing to manage the business as best we can, trying to take as much share as possible. And that over the longer term, given the investment we've got, the scale we've got, the capabilities we've got, we think that will generate a more significant return for shareholders over the long run, and 1 that we think will be very attractive. And obviously, we're enduring some short-term pain to get there, and we continue to manage that as aggressively as we possibly can. But our feeling is that we still have a relatively unique capability, that from a marketplace standpoint, brings a lot of differentiation.

We had a promotion that initiated in early March that winds up later this week. So that's got a timing issue, if you will. We typically have a couple of promotional endeavors there annually. So that happens to be more of a timing kind of issue. In terms of Plumbing, we do have some new product launches. We talked about the application of the Touch2O Technology to lab faucets for the bathroom. We're launching product. We've got window product that we've launched. We've launched the R.E.D. line at Arrow and other specialty. So those will be a couple of areas, where promotional activities have kicked in. We've recently, in the Paint category, again, seasonally, we've got some things that have kicked in. So I would say that if -- when thinking about where we are right now, we're probably with new product launches, which include Windows, as well as the R.E.D. line, and other specialty with what we're doing in the launch, the Pro-X program. And seasonally, there's probably a little bit more activity now. I wouldn't call it necessarily extraordinary but again, I think that you'll see us continue to promote.

And when you take that with the $300 million that we tracked -- we retired in March of 2010, that's $1.150 billion, but we -- what I indicated to investors is that we believe that on a net basis, that we'll retire about $300 million of that $1.150 billion debt. That requires some refinancing, if you will, obviously, of the remaining portion. And that, obviously, is something that has to be developed over the course of the next year or so. Having said that, from our standpoint, continuing to be somewhat conservative from a balance sheet perspective, making sure we've got a strong cash balance in case we don't refi [refinance] that debt for whatever reason, and we certainly would anticipate being successful there, I don't think that it makes sense for us to be thinking at this point about increases in the dividend or share repurchases. Obviously, as we get into the recovery, we see some expansion in terms of our business. We certainly have had a very strong history of cash flow generation. That 5-year period '03 through '07, we averaged about $1 billion free cash flow a year, and that's with $1.5 billion of CapEx, and another $300 million of investment in displays during that same 5-year period. We were able to reduce our shares outstanding by about 30%, and so just to give folks a little reminder, I guess, in terms of the capacity and capability that we have to generate cash. But I think it's probably a little bit too early in the cycle to be thinking about share repo and/or dividend increase at this point in time."

And then so with that said, we are expanding a couple of our facilities, Hansgrohe, overseas, and is expanding a couple of their facilities to meet the demand that they're facing in the emerging markets. So while there might be plenty of opportunity for that number to down, I wouldn't say it's going to be dramatic."

Unfortunately, going into April, based on what we know right now, it looks like April sales will be off. And I'm going to guess, probably mid-single digits, at least, the way things look right now. And again, we've had some -- we don't like to talk about weather, but a lot of people have been talking about weather. Weather's been horrible in most areas, and I think that's probably had some impact, although it was pretty tough in March as well. So based on what we know right now, April looks like it's going to come in probably mid-single digit, down from last year, strong last year in April."

As I did mentioned, relative to Wal-Mart add, we had both some builders' hardware, as well as Paint declines in the first quarter. And as I mentioned, if we excluded the implications to Paint, we would have been up a little bit in terms of Paint. But our sense is they prefer that we not quantify that Paint program. In terms of cab dealers, we did mention that we have been able to add 25 dealers, and we have been able to add a Masco brand at almost 350 dealers. So obviously, some of those are existing. And our sense is that we have not lost any dealers. So I think that was part of your question. We had a little bit of static on the line, and so I think I'm reading into it a little bit. So we haven't lost any dealers, and I think I mentioned that our estimate of what we've been able to impact from added-brand standpoint equates to, on an annual basis, and again, not necessarily going to affect 2010 top line, but about $55 million in terms of sales. And your question, your last question was on Plumbing, with Delta and Hansgrohe up low to mid-teens, does that suggest that the remaining Plumbing business is down? And I would say that's not necessarily the case. We continue to do well with hot tubs, which obviously continues to be a surprise to us, but I think is really reflective of a very strong market position, an excellent job of bringing out an opening price point product, and just a very well-run business. And the fact that we've seen some guys go out of business, if you will, in terms of competitors. So I would say that's been a bright spot as well. Most of the rest of the businesses, we do some supply things and some valves and that type of thing. I would say we're modestly better. Probably, the only area where we saw any significant decline would have been in Canada in the Plumbing segment. We were down in Canada. We enjoyed a really, really strong 2010 in Canada as we mentioned last year. So we saw a little bit of a falloff there and again, their economy is slowing down a bit. So from that standpoint, I think that certainly is explainable. But for the most part, I think we feel like we're holding our own from a share standpoint in Plumbing. And I can't tell you of any -- off the top of my head, any category that we're concerned about from a margin or a share perspective. So we feel pretty good about what's going on across that entire segment."

I'm joined today by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. Sales in the quarter were down 4%. Excluding rationalization charges, gains from financial investments and normalizing our tax rate at 36%, our loss for the quarter would have been $0.05 a share, and that compares to $0.03 of income on the same basis in the first quarter of 2010. On an as reported basis, we lost $0.13 in the quarter compared to a $0.02 loss in the first quarter of 2010. We did a nice job of managing working capital. I'll talk a little bit more about that later on, and we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash. 
If you flip to Slide #4. 
[Audio Gap] 
both gross profit and operating income reconciled for rationalization charges, our gross margin would have been down 140 basis points to 25.3%. And on that same basis again, reconciling for rationalization charges, our operating profit would have decreased from 5% last year to 3% this year. I mentioned that sales were down 4%. That equates to about $80 million of sales decline. Of that decline, about $53 million relates to cabinet products that we previously announced that we were exiting. So if you exclude that, we would have been down a little less than 1.5%, rounding down to 1%. As we mentioned in the press release, if we exclude the exited cabinet products, both February and March would have been relatively flat in terms of sales with last year, again across the entire company. 
Our International sales performed well. We were up 5% in terms of local currencies, had pretty good margins on those sales, just a little bit less than 10%; last year, a little over 10%. And our sales to our key Retail customers were down high-single digit. A big portion of that, well, almost all of that, relates to Cabinets, and a big portion of that relates to the products that we announced that we were exiting. Without the product exit, we would have been down just slightly low-single digits in terms of sales to key retailers. 
On an $80 million 
[Audio Gap] 
would have anticipated based on contribution margin about a $25 million drop in profitability. We're down again on an adjusted basis, about $39 million year-over-year, and the additional $15 million or so is represented by about $10 million of price/commodity relationship that is unfavorable in this quarter versus last year's first quarter, and we also had some new product and program launch-related costs in the quarter, as well as a negative product mix. So that pretty much explains the decremental margin, which approximated 50% in the quarter. 
If you flip to Slide #5. Again, taking a quick look at our earnings per share, as we mentioned reconciling for rationalization charges and also taking out the positive impact of the gains on the financial investments, we would have lost about $0.05 in the quarter compared to the $0.03 of income last year. 
If you flip to Slide #6. In terms of our Cabinet business, we were down about 24% in the quarter compared to last year. If we exclude the Cabinet-related products that we're exiting, we would have been off about 13%. We had a decremental margin of 26%, which pretty much approximates our contribution margin. We did have slightly less favorable price/commodity relationship in the quarter. As we've mentioned in the past or last quarter, we've got some particleboard challenges in Europe. We also had under absorption of fixed cost, but also had some cost reductions that offset a good portion of that. 
If you flip to Slide #7. We continue to be on track with the cabinet integration. We believe in the fourth quarter -- or excuse me, in the first quarter, that on a sequential basis compared to the fourth quarter, that we were able to increase our share position. So again, if we compare the first quarter of '11 versus the first quarter of 2010, probably down still a little bit in terms of share. But on a sequential basis, coming from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we had some nice gains in the home center channel, driven largely by promotions. We continue to do well in the builder channel and in the dealer channel, we feel like we more than held our own in the first quarter. 
We continue to add dealers under our Dealer Advantage Program. We now have almost 350 dealers that have added a Masco brand, another Masco brand, if you will, and about 125 of those dealers are new. We've also done some very good work from a process improvement standpoint, reducing our boarding time, on-boarding time for new dealers from weeks to days. So we feel very good about that, and we continue to get some good traction, particularly with builders with our countertop precision model. We continue to believe that breakeven for this segment is about $1.6 billion in terms of revenue, and we've talked about that in the past, and we've also talked about the fixed cost reduction of approximately $180 million.
If you flip to Slide #8, Plumbing Products. Had another solid quarter. We were up 7% in the quarter. Margins were flat, relatively flat with last year, just slightly down. Generally speaking, we would have anticipated a little higher incremental margin on these sales. Our contribution margin approximate 30%. But we did 
[Audio Gap] 
favorable price/commodity relationships in this particular segment. I mentioned about $10 million roughly overall. About $4 million of that would have related to Plumbing and less favorable product mix in terms of the profitability in this segment.
If you flip to Slide #9. Again, another solid quarter for our Plumbing business. It continues to be driven by the work we're doing around our brands, innovation, design, global expansion. We believe we had a good quarter from a share perspective in terms of North America both at Wholesale and Retail, and I would point out that our 2 flagship brands, Hansgrohe and Delta, had very strong quarters, with sales up mid-to-low teens in terms of those 2 businesses. We continue to emphasize innovation. Our Touch2O Technology is being applied to lav faucets for the bathroom, and those were launched in April, and we anticipate some very favorable response to that product launch.
We also had some nice recognition in the quarter. Delta has been nominated as a finalist for an Effie Award, which is one of the most prestigious awards relative to advertising. And we talked a little bit about the improvements we've made there in terms of unaided brand awareness. They've done a very good job of positioning and promoting the brand. And Hansgrohe, again, received a Product Design Award from the Federal Republic of Germany. So again, those are important recognitions, and we're very proud of both of those businesses.
If you flip to Slide #10, Installation and Other Services. We were off in this segment 7% in terms of sales. We did a modest improvement in terms of profitability in the quarter compared to last year's quarter, notwithstanding the fact that we were down $19 million in sales. We continue to benefit from a very good job of cost management in this segment, had a little bit of help from mix as well, just in terms of comparison to the first quarter of last year.
If you flip to Slide #11. We continue to improve our position from an Insulation Installation standpoint. We mentioned before that we thought that we may have cut a little bit too deep. We've added some salespeople. We talked about the expanded strategic relationship with Owens Corning last quarter. The result of that is we're seeing a lot of positive bidding activity. We think we've got a very good chance in terms of improvement from a share perspective going forward. This continues to be a competitive environment. Our feeling is a lot of our competitors are struggling at this point. So we think we've got some really good opportunities from a share perspective, and believe that from the fourth quarter, again looking sequentially, that we were able to gain share in the first quarter of 2011, still probably a little bit below where we were in the first quarter of 2010, but making some good progress.
We think with the ERP system, the leadership changes that we've talked about, some of the other organizational changes that we're heading in the right direction relative to the Installation segment and anticipate improving performance going forward. From a breakeven standpoint, we estimate breakeven at 700,000 to 750,000 starts as we've mentioned in the past, probably a little closer to the 750,000. 
If you flip to Slide #12, please, Decorative Architectural Products. Sales in this segment were off 4%, and essentially all of that decline is explained by programs that we launched at Wal-Mart both in Paint, which we announced last year, as well as builders' hardware. Our Paint without that Wal-Mart sales loss would have been up slightly in the quarter. Decremental margin continues to be in excess of our contribution margin, and we're down about $17 million in terms of profit versus last year on a $14 million sales decline, obviously, with still very strong margins in this segment. And I would suggest that, that $17 million -- think about that maybe in 3 buckets. About 1/3 of that would relate to volume decline. A little less than 1/3 relates to unfavorable price/commodity relationships, and the remainder would be program cost related to new opportunities that we're pursuing. Having said that, we continue to face raw material supply challenges relative to Paint. We think we're managing through that very well at this point in time, but it is a situation where supply of both resins and TiO2 continues to be tight.
If you flip to Slide #13. As I mentioned, we've expended some money and continue to pursue top line opportunities in both Paint and hardware. We've talked about the Direct to Pro program and as part of that, we launched Kilz Pro-X earlier this year, and we should have all the Home Depot stores set by the end of the second quarter. I think we're a little over halfway there, so we're excited about the opportunities there. 
We also had some very good recognition in terms of both the Behr and the Kilz brand. Behr, as we mentioned previously, achieved #1 rankings in a recent independent consumer study. Kilz also fared very well in that study, I might add. And in a recent Harris poll, Kilz was ranked highest among Paint brands for the second year in a row. Behr did very well in that particular poll as well. And both of those brands do very well in terms of performance, quality assessments and that type of thing. We also believe that in the quarter, based on track line, that Behr continued to increase share across all do-it-yourself codings-related categories.
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales, 2%, just up a little bit, continue to benefit from share gains, as well as new product introductions, geographic expansion. We did have a increase in the loss in this segment, notwithstanding the fact that sales were up slightly. That reflects some unfavorable price/commodity relationship, a minor amount there, relatively insignificant, new product launch and geographic expansion costs and some unfavorable mix. We continue to do well in terms of share for both Milgard in the Western United States. They continue to do very well. The U.K. Window Group in the United Kingdom continues to gain share. And as I mentioned, we've done some things with the Milgard brand in terms of expanding into both Western Canada, as well as Texas.
If you flip to Slide 15. I mentioned earlier that we had some nice improvements in terms of working capital. And as you can see, when we take inventories plus receivables, less payables, we were able to -- and compare that to last 12 months’ sales, we were down about 80 basis points. So continue to see some very good performance across all of our businesses, really appreciate the effort from our folks across the company, not only in managing working capital, but in continuing to address some of the challenges in the marketplace and certainly, the continued implementation of the Masco Business System. So a lot of positives relative to balance sheet management and as I mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash.
I want to make a couple of comments before we go to the Q&A to wrap up. Obviously, economic signals at this point in time are relatively mixed, and most economists have reduced their expectations for 2011. And we currently see a less robust year than we might have anticipated just a couple of months ago, and currently anticipate that starts will probably be up somewhere around 10% for the full year. I would remind folks that we tend to operate on a lag basis, and with most of – about a 90-day lag basis I would point out. And with most of those starts probably generated in the second half, we won't see a lot of positive impact necessarily this year. 
The blue chip consensus, I think, is for 630,000 starts. That came down here recently, and a 10% improvement pretty much equates to a number in that ballpark. Having said that, as we have been, we'll continue to focus on those things that we have control over. We'll continue to drive the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continue to focus on innovation. We've done a very good job there, and continue to manage our cost structure to fit the circumstance that we're in. While it's way, way too early to talk to any specifics, I'm excited about some of the opportunities that are developing across our businesses in a variety of product lines. We'll have more to say about that later this year. But we are looking at some very good opportunities again in a variety of products, that when the time comes, we'll share some more specifics about that. 
We continue to make some progress on the Installation and Cabinets side. Last time, we were together mid-April -- or excuse me, mid-February, we talked about our anticipation that we could improve the operating performance there fairly significantly this year and reduce losses from last year, adjusted losses by $60 million to $80 million. Our sense is, right now, that we still anticipate some significant improvement in both of these segments. But given the decline on housing starts, we anticipate those numbers are probably going to be somewhere in the $40 million to $60 million range. But again, still some very good improvement.
We also believe that on a full-year basis, that we will be successful in terms of offsetting commodity cost and other inflation. Again, that's on a full-year basis. We had a little bit of a negative impact in the first quarter, as I mentioned, roughly $10 million. But based on work that we've already done and other items, we've got a couple of things yet to do, but feel very confident about our ability to be successful there, but our feeling is that we should be in very good shape. We talked about headwinds on our last conference call of $30 million to $40 million, but our feeling right now is that we have those covered. Obviously, commodities tend to be a fluid situation. There could be some additional increases, going forward, that we'll have to deal with, and we will. But we have been very successful working with suppliers, working on productivity, cost reductions and implementing price increases. So we feel very good about where we are at this point in time. And I would say for modeling purposes, if you were to use our overall contribution margin of 30% on whatever you think revenue changes might be, that's probably a pretty good proxy. 
From a long-term standpoint, continue to feel very comfortable, very confident about the fundamentals for our markets. Obviously, things are a little slower than we would have hoped or liked this year, but we still feel that over the long term, those fundamentals are positive for both repair/remodel, new home construction, and feel very confident that when we get back to top line sales in that $10 million to $12 million range, that we'll be able to generate double digit return on sales and also drive value and returns that are consistent with our shareholders' desire.

We've done a lot of hard work on our supply chain to reposition some of our lower SKUs more competitively, and that's really paid off both in top line and bottom line. So we feel really good about the work we've done at Delta. Hansgrohe is doing well and has been doing well for a long time. They really are focused at the high-end of the market in design and style and really, the solid German engineering, the product, and it's really resonated well in the emerging markets. Hansgrohe has been expanding internationally now for about the last 15 years and really have a very unique system for prioritizing markets, market entry and really going at it from an organic basis to get into markets, penetrate the existing channels and understand the consumer, have the right product assortment. And we really have focused heavily on international development for our North American businesses for about the last 2 years. Delta and Hansgrohe have been working very closely together at identifying target markets. We think based on consumer segmentation, those 2 brands play very well, with Hansgrohe really on the design high-end side, Delta in that mid-market technology play. And they've been doing some neat things. So a lot of the gain we're seeing here in the quarter is related to the Hansgrohe global expansion; Delta, more about what's going on in North America.

Into the Texas market, Texas tends to – has historically been more of a low-end aluminum market. That has transitioned into a vinyl market, very similar to the products that we sell into Arizona and Nevada, New Mexico. So we feel really good about our expansion into Texas. We have some customer service locations there, as well as some sales reps, and we have some dealers set up, and we're currently shipping product out of Arizona, and feel really good about that. We also have been able to work with Milgard and Behr to come up with some colors on our vinyl windows, to where we had some dark color extrusion that doesn't absorb any heat, which stops the actual extrusion from creating any -- from bowing or really any size variation related to some of the heat that we get related to the sun in those climates. So we think we have a differentiated product that we can bring into Texas, with the Milgard value proposition, and Pacific Northwest going into Canada, is just a natural extension for us."

So that happens to be more of a timing kind of issue. In terms of Plumbing, we do have some new product launches. We talked about the application of the Touch2O Technology to lav faucets for the bathroom. We're launching product. We've got window product that we've launched. We've launched the R.E.D. line at Arrow in Other Specialty. So those will be a couple of areas where promotional activities have kicked in. We've recently, in the Paint category, again seasonally, we've got some things that have kicked in. So I would say that if we’re thinking about where we are right now, we're probably with new product launches, which include Windows, as well as the R.E.D. line and Other Specialty, with what we're doing in the launch, the Pro-X program and seasonally, there's probably a little bit more activity now. I wouldn't call it necessarily extraordinary but again, I think that you'll see us continue to promote. I don't anticipate this year will be an unusual year compared to prior years, and those things tend to go up and down a little bit based on the facts and circumstances that you're dealing with. But I don't know, Donnie, if there's anything you want to add to that."

And so from our standpoint, as we've said to investors in the past, when you have that initial -- we've retired about $50 million of what was $850 million of original issuance. And when you take that with the $300 million that we retired in March of 2010, that's $1.150 billion. What we’ve indicated to investors is that we believe that on a net basis, that we'll retire about $300 million of that $1.150 billion debt. That requires some refinancing, if you will, obviously, of the remaining portion. And that, obviously, is something that has to be developed over the course of the next year or so. Having said that, from our standpoint, continuing to be somewhat conservative from a balance sheet perspective, making sure we've got a strong cash balance in case we don't refi that debt for whatever reason, and we certainly would anticipate being successful there, I don't think that it makes sense for us to be thinking at this point about increases in the dividend or share repurchases. Obviously, as we get into the recovery, we see some expansion in terms of our business. We certainly have had a very strong history of cash flow generation. That 5-year period '03 through '07, we averaged about $1 billion free cash flow a year, and that's with $1.5 billion of CapEx, and another $300 million of investment in displays during that same 5-year period. We were able to reduce our shares outstanding by about 30%, and so just to give folks a little reminder, I guess, in terms of the capacity and capability that we have to generate cash. But I think it's probably a little bit too early in the cycle to be thinking about share repo and/or dividend increase at this point in time."

Unfortunately, going into April, based on what we know right now, it looks like April sales will be off, and I'm going to guess, probably mid-single digits, at least, the way things look right now. And again, we've had some -- we don't like to talk about weather, but a lot of people have been talking about weather. Weather's been horrible in most areas, and I think that's probably had some impact, although it was pretty tough in March as well.

As I did mention, relative to Wal-Mart, we had both some builders' hardware, as well as Paint declines in the first quarter. And as I mentioned, if we excluded the implications to Paint, we would have been up a little bit in terms of Paint. But our sense is they prefer that we not quantify that Paint program. In terms of cab dealers, we did mention that we have been able to add 25 dealers, and we have been able to add a Masco brand at almost 350 dealers. So obviously, some of those are existing. And our sense is that we have not lost any dealers. So I think that was part of your question. Now we had a little bit of static on the line, and so I think I'm reading into it a little bit. So we haven't lost any dealers, and I think I mentioned that our estimate of what we've been able to impact from a added-brand standpoint equates to, on an annual basis, and again, not necessarily going to affect 2010 top line, but about $55 million in terms of sales. And your question, your last question was on Plumbing, with Delta and Hansgrohe up low to mid-teens, does that suggest that the remaining Plumbing business is down? And I would say that's not necessarily the case. We continue to do well with hot tubs, which obviously continues to be a surprise to us, but I think is really reflective of a very strong market position, an excellent job of bringing out an opening price point product, and just a very well-run business. And the fact that we've seen some guys go out of business, if you will, in terms of competitors. So I would say that's been a bright spot as well. Most of the rest of the businesses, we do some supply things and some valves and that type of thing. I would say we're modestly better. Probably, the only area where we saw any significant decline would have been in Canada in the Plumbing segment. We were down in Canada. We enjoyed a really, really strong 2010 in Canada as we mentioned last year. So we saw a little bit of a falloff there and again, their economy is slowing down a bit. So from that standpoint, I think that certainly is explainable. But for the most part, I think we feel like we're holding our own from a share standpoint in Plumbing. And I can't tell you of any -- off the top of my head, any category that we're concerned about from a margin or a share perspective. So we feel pretty good about what's going on across that entire segment."

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.And if you would please flip to",2980,"Thank you, Connie, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco second quarter 2011 earnings call. I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. Sales in the quarter were down 1%. Excluding rationalization charges, gains and impairments from financial investments and adjusting for a normalized tax rate of 36%, income as reconciled would have been $0.05 a share compared to $0.16 in the second quarter of 2010. On an as reported basis, we earned $0.02 in the second quarter compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Working capital improved in the quarter to 15.6%. We'll talk about that a little later on, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
If you flip to Slide #4, please. Gross profit and operating profit as reconciled for the rationalization charges and for a litigation charge in the second quarter, gross profit would have been down about 150 basis points to 26.9%, and our operating margin would have been 5.5%, a 280 basis point decline. A little bit of color in terms of our overall financial performance. I mentioned that sales were down 1%. That equates to about $26 million. That includes an unfavorable change in terms of product exits. As we've announced previously, we have exited the ready-to-assemble product group that ended in the second quarter, and that was a reduction of about $49 million in terms of sales. Offsetting that was positive impact from foreign currency of $54 million. 
Our International operations were up 5% in the quarter in local currencies and had another very strong quarter in terms of operating performance with margins at 9.8%. That compares to 9.5% last year. Sales to key Retail customers were down mid-single digits in the quarter. All of that is represented by the exit of the ready-to-assemble product group. Without that impact, we would have been flat in the quarter in terms of key Retail sales, and that includes some declines of Wal-Mart that we'll talk about in a little bit. 
Just to give you a perspective, in the first quarter, if you eliminate the exited products, we would have been down low single digit as we communicated a while back. Sales off $26 million. Our operating profit on a reconciled basis was down $59 million. We think volume accounted for about $25 million of that. And obviously we did benefit from foreign currency translation. So that masks some of the volume decline. Price/commodity relationships in aggregate cost us about $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Cabinets and Plumbing. Mix was about a negative $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Plumbing. We did have a little bit of combined mix and price/commodity impacting Other Specialty Products. In addition, we incurred some expenditures for some of the growth initiatives that include our international expansion in Paint and Plumbing, some new Retail programs, innovation and the dealer initiative in Cabinets and the Pro initiative in our Paint group. And we'll talk about those as we go through the segments. 
If you would please flip to Slide #5 where we reconcile earnings per share. As you can see here, this takes into account the reconciliation for the rationalization charges, as well as the litigation charge. And pretty significant impact in both quarters related to financial investments. In the second quarter of 2010, we had an impairment charge of $33 million. In the second quarter of 2011, we had gains from the disposition of financial investments of $33 million. Those are coincident numbers. As I mentioned, adjusting or reconciling if you will, we made $0.05 in the second quarter compared to $0.16 last year. And on as reported basis, just as a reminder, earnings per share were $0.02 compared to $0.01 in the prior year.
Please flip to Slide #6. We'll talk about the Cabinet segment. Our sales in Cabinets were down in the quarter 18%, and again, that includes the impact of the products that we exited. Without those impact, we would have been off about 6% in the quarter. Decremental margin in the quarter was inflated above our contribution margin. The decline in margin reflects volume, the under absorption of fixed costs. We had about $6 million related to the $49 million of product exit. In this segment, as I mentioned earlier, we had about $5 million of unfavorable price/commodity relationship, and we did incur some increased costs relative to promotion related to the dealer initiative, brand building and some promotions at Retail.
If you flip to Slide #7. In terms of Cabinets, just a quick update. We have a lot of things accomplished in the second quarter. We completed the common architecture program that affected the Merillat and Quality brands. And we also, as I mentioned earlier, finished the exit of ready-to-assemble related products. And again, we're very happy to have those behind us. We continue to benefit from the Cabinet integration. We're tracking the savings that we've communicated previously. We believe we'll be on track to show about $35 million to $40 million of savings by the end of 2012. And we continue to add dealers or have dealers that have added a Masco Cabinet brand. Over 400 dealers we estimate have done so, and my memory tells me that about 180 or so of those are new dealers to Masco. So we're pleased with that. We did idle another manufacturing facility in the quarter, and KraftMaid was awarded the highest ranking in terms of customer satisfaction related to Cabinets in a J.D. Power study. And obviously, that relates to the U.S. and obviously, we're very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #8, our Plumbing-related business. We had another solid quarter in Plumbing. Plumbing was up 12%. We did benefit from foreign currency in this particular segment, about $42 million of the $54 million positive currency translation relates to Plumbing. Without that, we would have been up about 5%. We did see a modest decline in terms of margin, down about 40 basis points, and profitability is impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationship. We talked about that a little bit earlier, unfavorable mix as I mentioned and some investments, incremental investments in the quarter in terms of international brand and some other marketing related programs. 
If you flip to Slide #9. We continue to invest in the Plumbing segment and brand-building innovation and design and pursuing international growth. And we had very strong performance in the quarter in our faucet brands in the U.S., Delta, Peerless and Brizo. And Hansgrohe just had a fabulous quarter, in fact, a record quarter in terms of their operations as they continue to expand in global markets. We continue to innovate. Our Touch technology has now been applied to bathroom faucets. Those were introduced, and we're really excited about the opportunities there. We continue to gain share in tubs and spas, hot tubs and spas with our HotSprings and Caldera brands. And we mentioned last time that Delta was nominated for an Effie Award, and they were recognized with a Silver Effie in the quarter. And again, that's prestigious on a related to advertising and communication and certainly very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #10, Installation and other services. We were down about 5% in sales in the quarter, and that compares to a 7% decline in 90-day lag starts. In addition, we were off about $3 million in terms of profitability. That 20% decremental margin pretty much explains or pretty much approximates our contribution margin in that particular segment.
If you flip to Slide #11. We did believe we had some sequential share gains from first quarter 2011. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have we believe sequential gains from the fourth quarter of last year, and obviously that's an important topic. I think last year at this time with some of the compression in the build cycle, some of the contenting that was going on in terms of housing. We had a lot of discussion around share in this business, and we're really pleased with some of the progress we've been able to make in terms of Insulation. We continue to benefit from increased retrofit sales, and we've got some really good opportunities that we're developing with some of the larger builders going forward. Unfortunately, not a lot of that showing up on the top line at this point in time because of the decline or depressed activity. But we certainly are encouraged going forward relative to some of the opportunities that have developed. 
We also completed the implementation of the ERP system in this segment, and we believe that initiative and some of the things we're doing from a lean standpoint should continue to drive efficiencies and cost savings going forward. So making a lot of progress in terms of Installation.
If you flip to Slide #12. Decorative Architectural Products were off 3% in the quarter. We had a pretty significant drop relative to sales in terms of profitability. We continue to see commodity cost pressure, but in this segment in this quarter, price/commodity was basically neutral. Decremental margin includes the timing of advertising spend, which was up compared to the second quarter of last year of $5 million, $6 million. And we also incurred $6 million or so for program costs related to new opportunities in Builders' Hardware, the investment in the Pro and international expansion and some work we're doing to reformulate some of our Paint-related products. 
So if you flip to Slide #13. We continue to be very excited about some of the top line opportunities in this segment. Our Direct to Pro program with Home Depot continues to gain traction. We have all the Home Depot stores are set, along with the Kilz Pro-X product. We've got that accomplished in the second quarter. So feel really good about that. And Liberty is in the process of launching some new programs at Retail in both bath and Cabinet-related hardware, and we'll talk more about that later this year as those programs develop. But a lot going on in terms of top line opportunity in this segment.
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales were off 5% in this segment, about $7 million, and we had a pretty significant decline in terms of operating profit in relation to the sales. First and foremost, I would point out that last year, we had an exceptional second quarter. We had about a 7% margin in terms of last year in the quarter, as you can see here. So very good second quarter last year. And those of you who have followed us know that we've seen declining performance in this segment since that point in time. We continue to believe that we're being impacted negatively by declines in new home construction in the Western U.S., lower repair/remodel activity. And we believe that that's in part driven by the exploration of the Homebuyer Tax Credit last year, as well as the exploration of some of the energy tax credits that were available. Our operating profit reflects volume, about a $4 million spend on geographic expansion, product launch promotions and trade shows, some loss of leverage, additional freight costs in the quarter. And we did, when you look at price/commodity and mix combined, we were down probably in this quarter in this particular segment $1 million to $2 million. So again, not a real solid performance in this segment, but a lot of work going on in terms of product launch. 
And if you flip to Slide #15, a couple of comments relative to this segment. We continue to believe that in Windows in both the Western United States, as well as the United Kingdom that we're gaining share. That's been a fact for us we think over the course of the last 6 quarters or so. Unfortunately, the pie is much smaller. Milgard continues to expand in geographies in Texas and Western Canada. The expansion into Texas has cost us a little bit, including some additional freight. And Arrow Fastener has come out with a couple of product lines. We've talked about the R.E.D. line. They've also come out with a new Elite tool line. So we're excited about that opportunity. And as it develops, we'll be able to share some information with you about the outcomes there.
If you flip to Slide #16. I mentioned working capital earlier. We improved from 16.1% to 15.6% in terms of receivables plus inventories less payables as relationship to last 12 months sales. And you can see that in terms of the components here, we're up a little bit here in terms of inventory days, don't feel like there's anything there that is of concern and continue to do a very, very good job in terms of accounts payable management. And really would want to take this time to kind of thank the team, the Masco Team for the effort here, as well as the effort across the other aspects of our business. Obviously, the environment continues to be very challenging, but we're very pleased with some of the opportunities that we're developing and really encouraged by the effort our folks are putting forward. 
If you flip to Slide #17. Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Market conditions certainly continue to be challenging. The only economic signals continue to be somewhat mixed, but basically most economists have reduced their expectations for 2011. And we currently see a much less robust year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. You might remember our housing start assumption early on was around 690. At the end of the first quarter, we adjusted that to about 640. And more recently at least at this point in time, our view is that housing starts appear to be relatively flat with last year. Having said that, for us, lag starts are every important. And on a 90-day lag basis, our sense is that starts will be flat on that same basis. 
We're not seeing a lot of pickup in terms of repair/remodel activity for bigger-ticket items. So that continues to be slow. And having said that, as we've said in the past, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control and influence. That includes driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, our leadership brands, global expansion and continuing to manage our cost structure.
We've got a lot going on operationally. Obviously, 2 of our major priorities are the Cabinets and Installation businesses, and I continue to be pleased with the progress we've made there. As I mentioned earlier, we've completed several key initiatives. The ERP Installation at Installation services, the product exits, the common architecture program, obviously, all of those have required significant time and attention. And we're certainly glad they're behind us. In addition, as I mentioned, we did idle another manufacturing plant in Cabinets. And although the economy is not as robust as we had anticipated earlier this year, we still anticipate significant improvement in terms of the operating performance of both of these businesses. We currently anticipate that on a full year basis that we can reduce the operating loss by $20 million to $40 million in terms of Installation and Cabinets combined, and we will continue to push very hard to reduce our breakeven point, and we expect to make more progress in 2012 irrespective of the economic environment.
We also continue to believe that we will successfully offset commodity costs and other inflation on a full year basis. As I mentioned last time we were together, that's certainly a fluid situation. And since we last talked, we do face some additional challenges as it relates to lumber, particleboard, TiO2, resins for paints and windows, as well as metals and other commodities. But we continue to be confident that as we work with suppliers focusing on supply chain, working on cost reduction and implement pricing that on a full year basis that we'll have these costs covered and neutralized. Year-to-date, we're negative about $20 million in terms of price/commodity relationship. There's a lot more work to do, but we feel confident that we'll be in good shape as the year continues to unfold. We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our market, and we continue to invest. We're increasing our penetration in North America from a -- in terms of dealers for Cabinets in that particular channel and with the professional painter. We continue to develop international opportunities for Paint and Plumbing, and we're launching several new programs this year in Plumbing, Cabinets and Builders' Hardware. While it's too early to talk about specifics, we think we see opportunities are very exciting, and we'll be able to share some of the details with you as these develop over the next couple of quarters. 
We're incurring some incremental cost, as I mentioned earlier and covered when we talk about the segments as we execute on these opportunities. But we anticipate that they will add significantly to our top line as they mature over time. Longer term, we continue to feel very positive about our ability to create value for our shareholders. We believe that when we can get volumes back to on a top line basis the $10 billion to $12 billion area that we enjoyed previously, there's no question in our minds that we can deliver double-digit margins at that kind of level, and certainly produce the kinds of returns that shareholders are looking for as they think about Masco as an investment. 
And with that, we'll open up the lines for questions."

But I'm very certain that you'll be pleased as we are able to communicate more about those programs going forward, and we will do so at the appropriate time.

On the Installation services although the take per unit is lower, we believe our market share is at least the same as it is on the single family side. So we think we're positioned to win there. We're certainly a better balance sheet, a strong capital base is really important to do those bigger projects. And on the Cabinet side, we've really been focused on doing more in smaller spaces that applies both to multifamily, but also to what we're seeing in the single-family market today. We're dealing with smaller kitchens and so how do we do more in smaller spaces and really bring out more value to the consumer? So we see this trend as one that we think we're positioned to win, and we're going after it aggressively."

You've got the near-term reality of higher energy costs, higher food costs, which impact disposable income for consumers. And you've also got the near-term uncertainty that seems to emanate from the discussions that come out of Washington in terms of a variety of economic topics that I think people think are important. So when you think about that, the consumer does not appear to be very actively engaged at this point in time. So our feeling is the macro side of things is going to be pretty tough. Having said that, from our perspective as I mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of new product opportunities that we'll be launching in the second half. And we certainly expect to have some positive impact from that. So our concern about the environment is more on the macro side, the things that we can influence, the things that we have the ability to control, which include some of the new products that we're bringing to market certainly, we believe, put us in a great position. We've done a lot to strengthen our brands over the course of the last couple of 3 years. We're in a very good position there. We continue to be in an extremely good position from a share standpoint. One of our strategies has been through innovation, through a lot of the work that we've been doing with the consumer to increase our very strong market position. And as we sit here today, I don't think there's any area given the fact that we've seen some good improvement in terms of Installation and Cabinets over the course of the last couple of quarters, at least on a sequential basis, that puts us in a position where from a share standpoint, we continue to grow. So we think the environment is going to be challenging, but we certainly think that the opportunities that we'll be rolling out will be a plus. And your comment about easier comps in the second half is certainly accurate, and we'll see how things unfold.

The integration has been going well, and I think as we have looked at expectations for volumes out there, having an operation on the West Coast was important for us from a freight standpoint at one point in time. But as we've reviewed our footprint, reviewed the economics, we felt like we could eliminate some of the capacity there. And we'll have a little bit of a penalty in terms of freight, but we think that's certainly manageable. I think the cost was about $1 million, John, in terms of charge.

Now when I think about that division, the first thing I think about is the -- one of the first things I think about is the success of Hansgrohe. Obviously, at the higher end now with the decline in big-ticket remodeling that obviously would have shifted your mix there to probably more replacement Retail type stuff. But I would have thought that the Hansgrohe effect would have been stronger than the countervailing effect. So how should we look at that negative mix effect that you were talking about?"

And a fair amount of that relates to their movement from principally a shower head manufacturer to a faucet manufacturer. That transitioned well, actually I shouldn't say moving away from showerheads, but basically getting more balanced with faucets and faucets versus showerheads in terms of the products that they manufacture tend to have a little bit lower margin. The other issue that affects them is the expansion that they've had into geographic areas. Typically, as they go into geographic areas and I think they're in what about 30, 70 different geographic areas with what 30 different subsidiaries at this point in time. Typically, when they enter a new market, there tends to be a little bit of a shift there, if you will, or a little bit of pressure in terms of margin. So that would be primarily where the mix shift is taking place. Now we've also seen a little bit of shift in terms of hot tubs, for example, to opening price points. But basically Hansgrohe would be the one area where mix has probably been more of the issue. But having said that, they continue to perform at just a fabulous rate, if you will. As I mentioned, they had a record quarter in both sales and profitability. And so even though there's a little bit of a mix shift, we're still seeing some very good top line growth there."

I think that others in the industry have talked about those in terms of mid to high teen type increases. Because of the fact that we deal with a lot of large suppliers and have one large customer, we don't typically get specific about price/commodity detail in this particular segment. But I think you can certainly assume that we continue to face cost pressures. And as we've talked in the past, there are availability issues, if you will, relative to supply. And we've been able to manage through that and have done a very good job. So that would be part of the answer to your question. The rest of the question related to promotional activity, and we did have incremental in the second quarter about $5 million, $6 million of incremental promotional spend. And typically, the second quarter, Chris, is when we have the majority, if you will, of some of the promotional activity related to Paint. You've got Memorial Day, typically the Fourth of July starts sometime in late June. We also do some things around other dates like Labor Day and Presidents' Day. But the second quarter tends to be the quarter when most of the advertising budget is spent. And if you look at the sequential change in profitability versus the change in sales from the first quarter, you can see that impact. And we talked about that last year on the call as well.

And I think that if you think back late last year, we saw a real slowdown in terms of housing starts. Obviously, the first part of this year was pretty slow. So to the extent that we're going to end up about flat with last year, that would suggest that the latter part of the year should be a little bit stronger in terms of that activity. We've also got some of the other major initiatives out of the way that certainly took time and attention. We've got some top line opportunities that we're developing in Cabinets, particularly with the countertop solution that we've talked about in the past. And we've got some excitement there that we'll be able to share with you over the course of the next few months. So we've got some top line opportunities. We've also got some top line opportunities in the Installation side of the business. We expanded the footprint for our distribution business a couple of years ago with a couple of greenfields. So we've got opportunity there. We've also got some opportunity with larger builders, and we talked about that. So I think both the combination of top line, additional cost reductions in the second half. We've got the ERP system fully implemented in Installation. So we feel like we've got a very good opportunity to make that happen, and you are correct as you look at the first couple of quarters. Most of that improvement is slated for the second half."

I think if we were to go back and roll the tape back 3 or 4 years, I'm guessing that we're probably neutral over that long period of time.

And so I don't think it gets a whole lot tougher than that, but I think when you've got the focus we've had on innovation, the focus we've had on the work we've done around customer intimacy, the strength of our brands, it certainly puts us in a good position.

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. Sales in the quarter were down 1%. Excluding rationalization charges, gains and impairments from financial investments and adjusting for a normalized tax rate of 36%, income as reconciled would have been $0.05 a share compared to $0.16 in the second quarter of 2010. On an as reported basis, we earned $0.02 in the second quarter compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Working capital improved in the quarter to 15.6%. We'll talk about that a little later on, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
If you flip to Slide #4, please. Gross profit and operating profit as reconciled for the rationalization charges and for a litigation charge in the second quarter, gross profit would have been down about 150 basis points to 26.9%, and our operating margin would have been 5.5%, a 280 basis point decline. A little bit of color in terms of our overall financial performance. I mentioned that sales were down 1%. That equates to about $26 million. That includes an unfavorable change in terms of product exits. As we've announced previously, we have exited the ready-to-assemble product group that ended in the second quarter, and that was a reduction of about $49 million in terms of sales. Offsetting that was positive impact from foreign currency of $54 million. 
Our International operations were up 5% in the quarter in local currencies, and had another very strong quarter in terms of operating performance with margins at 9.8%. That compares to 9.5% last year. Sales to key Retail customers were down mid-single digits in the quarter. All of that is represented by the exit of the ready-to-assemble product group. Without that impact, we would have been flat in the quarter in terms of key Retail sales, and that includes some declines of Wal-Mart that we'll talk about in a little bit. 
Just to give you a perspective, in the first quarter, if you eliminate the exited products, we would have been down low single digit as we communicated a while back, sales of $26 million. Our operating profit on a reconciled basis was down $59 million. We think volume accounted for about $25 million of that. And obviously, we did benefit from foreign currency translation. So that masks some of the volume decline. Price/commodity relationships in aggregate cost us about $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Cabinets and Plumbing. Mix was about negative $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Plumbing. We did have a little bit of combined mix and price/commodity impacting Other Specialty Products. In addition, we incurred some expenditures for some of the growth initiatives that include our international expansion in Paint and Plumbing, some new Retail programs, innovation and the dealer initiative in Cabinets and the Pro initiative in our Paint group. And we'll talk about those as we go through the segments. 
If you would please flip to Slide #5, where we reconcile earnings per share. As you can see here, this takes into account the reconciliation for the rationalization charges, as well as the litigation charge. And the pretty significant impact in both quarters related to financial investments. In the second quarter of 2010, we had an impairment charge of $33 million. In the second quarter of 2011, we had gains from the disposition of financial investments of $33 million. Those are coincident numbers. As I mentioned, adjusting or reconciling, if you will, we made $0.05 in the second quarter compared to $0.16 last year. And on as reported basis, just as a reminder, earnings per share were $0.02 compared to $0.01 in the prior year.
Please flip to Slide #6. We'll talk about the Cabinet segment. Our sales in Cabinets were down in the quarter 18% and again, that includes the impact of the products that we exited. Without those impact, we would have been off about 6% in the quarter. Decremental margin in the quarter was inflated above our contribution margin. The decline in margin reflects volume, the under absorption of fixed costs. We had about $6 million related to the $49 million of product exit. In this segment, as I mentioned earlier, we had about $5 million of unfavorable price/commodity relationship, and we did incur some increased costs relative to promotion related to the dealer initiative, brand building and some promotions at Retail.
If you flip to Slide #7. In terms of Cabinets, just a quick update. We have a lot of things accomplished in the second quarter. We completed the common architecture program that affected the Merillat and Quality brands. And we also, as I mentioned earlier, finished the exit of the ready-to-assemble related products. And again, we're very happy to have those behind us. We continue to benefit from the Cabinet integration. We're tracking the savings that we've communicated previously. We believe we'll be on track to show about $35 million to $40 million of savings by the end of 2012. And we continue to add dealers or have dealers that have added a Masco Cabinet brand. Over 400 dealers we estimate have done so, and my memory tells me that about 180 or so of those are new dealers to Masco. So we're pleased with that. We did idle another manufacturing facility in the quarter, and KraftMaid was awarded the highest ranking in terms of customer satisfaction related to Cabinets in a J.D. Power study. And obviously, that relates to the U.S. and obviously, we're very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #8, our Plumbing-related business. We had another solid quarter in Plumbing. Plumbing was up 12%. We did benefit from foreign currency in this particular segment, about $42 million of the $54 million positive currency translation relates to Plumbing. Without that, we would have been up about 5%. We did see a modest decline in terms of margin, down about 40 basis points, and profitability is impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationship. We talked about that a little bit earlier, unfavorable mix, as I mentioned, and some investments, incremental investments in the quarter in terms of international brand and some other marketing-related programs. 
If you flip to Slide #9. We continue to invest in the Plumbing segment and brand-building innovation and design, and pursuing international growth. And we had very strong performance in the quarter in our faucet brands in the U.S., Delta, Peerless and Brizo. And Hansgrohe just had a fabulous quarter, in fact, a record quarter in terms of their operations as they continue to expand in global markets. We continue to innovate. Our Touch Technology has now been applied to bathroom faucets. Those were introduced, and we're really excited about the opportunities there. We continue to gain share in tubs and spas, hot tubs and spas with our HotSprings and Caldera brands. And we mentioned last time that Delta was nominated for an Effie Award, and they were recognized with a Silver Effie in the quarter. And again, that's prestigious honor related to advertising and communication, and certainly very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #10, Installation and Other Services. We were down about 5% in sales in the quarter, and that compares to a 7% decline in 90-day lag starts. In addition, we were off about $3 million in terms of profitability. That 20% decremental margin pretty much explains or pretty much approximates our contribution margin in that particular segment.
If you flip to Slide #11. We did believe we had some sequential share gains from the first quarter 2011. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have we believe sequential gains from the fourth quarter of last year, and obviously that's an important topic. I think last year at this time with some of the compression in the build cycle, some of the decontenting that was going on in terms of housing. We had a lot of discussion around share in this business, and we're really pleased with some of the progress we've been able to make in terms of Installation. And we continue to benefit from increased retrofit sales, and we've got some really good opportunities that are developing with some of the larger builders going forward. Unfortunately, not a lot of that showing up on the top line at this point in time because of the decline or depressed activity. But we certainly are encouraged going forward relative to some of the opportunities that have developed. 
We also completed the implementation of the ERP system in this segment, and we believe that initiative and some of the things we're doing from a lean standpoint should continue to drive efficiencies and cost savings going forward. So making a lot of progress in terms of Installation.
If you flip to Slide #12. Decorative Architectural Products were off 3% in the quarter. We had a pretty significant drop relative to sales in terms of profitability. We continue to see commodity cost pressure, but in this segment in this quarter, price/commodity was basically neutral. Decremental margin includes the timing of advertising spend, which was up compared to the second quarter of last year of $5 million, $6 million. And we also incurred $6 million or so for program cost related to new opportunities in builders' hardware, the investment in the Pro and international expansion and some work we're doing to reformulate some of our Paint-related products. 
So if you flip to Slide #13. We continue to be very excited about some of the top line opportunities in this segment. Our Direct to Pro program with Home Depot continues to gain traction. We have all the Home Depot stores are set now with the Kilz Pro-X product. We've got that accomplished in the second quarter. So feel really good about that. And Liberty is in the process of launching some new programs at Retail in both bath and Cabinet-related hardware, and we'll talk more about that later this year as those programs develop, but a lot going on in terms of top line opportunity in this segment.
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales were off 5% in this segment, about $7 million, and we had a pretty significant decline in terms of operating profit in relation to the sales. First and foremost, I would point out that last year, we had an exceptional second quarter. We had about a 7% margin in terms of last year in the quarter, as you can see here. So very good second quarter last year. And those of you who have followed us know that we've seen declining performance in this segment since that point in time. We continue to believe that we're being impacted negatively by declines in new home construction in the Western U.S., lower repair/remodel activity. And we believe that that's in part driven by the exploration of the home buyer tax credit last year, as well as the exploration of some of the energy tax credits that were available. Our overall operating profit reflects volume, about a $4 million spend on geographic expansion, product loss, promotions and trade shows, some loss of leverage, additional freight costs in the quarter. And we did -- when you look at price/commodity and mix combined, we were down probably in this quarter or in this particular segment $1 million to $2 million. So again, not a real solid performance in this segment, but a lot of work going on in terms of product launch. 
And if you flip to Slide #15, a couple of comments relative to this segment. We continue to believe that in windows in both the western United States, as well as the United Kingdom that we're gaining share. That's been a fact for us, we think, over the course of the last 6 quarters or so. Unfortunately, the pie is much smaller. Milgard continues to expand in geographies in Texas and Western Canada. The expansion into Texas has cost us a little bit, including some additional freight. And Arrow Fastener has come out with a couple of product lines. We've talked about the R.E.D. line. They've also come out with a new Elite tool line. So we're excited about that opportunity. And as it develops, we'll be able to share some information with you about the outcomes there.
If you flip to Slide #16. I mentioned working capital earlier. We improved from 16.1% to 15.6% in terms of receivables plus inventories less payables as the relationship to the last 12 months sales. And you can see that in terms of the components here, we're up a little bit here in terms of inventory days. Don't feel like there's anything there that is of concern and continue to do a very, very good job in terms of accounts payable management. And really would want to take this time to kind of thank the team, the Masco Team for the effort here, as well as the effort across the other aspects of our business. Obviously, the environment continues to be very challenging, but we're very pleased with some of the opportunities that we're developing, and really encouraged by the effort our folks are putting forward. 
If you flip to Slide #17. Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Market conditions certainly continue to be challenging. The only economic signals continue to be somewhat mixed. But basically, most economists have reduced their expectations for 2011. And we currently see a much less robust year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. You might remember our housing start assumption early on was around 690. At the end of the first quarter, we adjusted that to about 640. And more recently, at least at this point in time, our view is that housing starts appear to be relatively flat with last year. Having said that, for us, lag starts are every important. And on a 90-day lag basis, our sense is that starts will be flat on that same basis. 
We're not seeing a lot of pickup in terms of repair/remodel activity for bigger-ticket items. So that continues to be slow. And having said that, as we've said in the past, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control and influence. That includes driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, our leadership brands, global expansion and continuing to manage our cost structure.
We've got a lot going on operationally. Obviously, 2 of our major priorities are the Cabinets and Installation businesses, and I continue to be pleased with the progress we've made there. As I mentioned earlier, we've completed several key initiatives. The ERP Installation at Installation services, the product exits, the common architecture program, obviously, all of those have required significant time and attention. And we're certainly glad they're behind us. In addition, as I mentioned, we did idle another manufacturing plant in Cabinets. And although the economy is not as robust as we had anticipated earlier this year, we still anticipate significant improvement in terms of the operating performance of both of these businesses. We currently anticipate that on a full year basis, that we can reduce the operating loss by $20 million to $40 million in terms of Installation and Cabinets combined, and we will continue to push very hard to reduce our breakeven point, and we expect to make more progress in 2012, irrespective of the economic environment.
We also continue to believe that we will successfully offset commodity costs and other inflation on a full year basis. As I mentioned last time we were together, that's certainly a fluid situation. And since we last talked, we do face some additional challenges as it relates to lumber, particleboard, TiO2, resins for paints and windows, as well as metals and other commodities. But we continue to be confident that as we work with suppliers focusing on supply chain, working on cost reduction and implement pricing, that on a full year basis, that we'll have these costs covered and neutralized. Year-to-date, we're negative about $20 million in terms of price/commodity relationship. There's a lot more work to do, but we feel confident that we'll be in good shape as the year continues to unfold. 
We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our market, and we continue to invest. We're increasing our penetration in North America from a -- in terms of dealers for Cabinets in that particular channel, and with the professional painter. We continue to develop international opportunities for Paint and Plumbing, and we're launching several new programs this year in Plumbing, Cabinets and builders' hardware. While it's too early to talk about specifics, we think these opportunities are very exciting, and we'll be able to share some of the details with you as these develop over the next couple of quarters. 
We're incurring some incremental cost, as I mentioned earlier and covered when we talk about the segments, as we execute on these opportunities. But we anticipate that they will add significantly to our top line as they mature over time. Longer term, we continue to feel very positive about our ability to create value for our shareholders. We believe that when we can get volumes back to on a top line basis, the $10 billion to $12 billion area that we enjoyed previously, there's no question in our minds that we can deliver double-digit margins at that kind of level, and certainly produce the kinds of returns that shareholders are looking for as they think about Masco as an investment. 
And with that, Connie, we'll open up the lines for questions."

Again, to your point, Josh, weather has been commented on by several folks in the industry, and I don't think there's any question that weather has been a factor in terms of certainly impacting consumers' involvement in projects over the late -- early part of the first quarter or late part of the first quarter, excuse me, early part of the second quarter.

You've got the near-term reality of higher energy costs, higher food costs, which impact disposable income for consumers. And you've also got the near-term uncertainty that seems to emanate from the discussions that come out of Washington in terms of a variety of economic topics that I think people think are important. So when you think about that, the consumer does not appear to be very actively engaged at this point in time. So our feeling is the macro side of things is going to be pretty tough. Having said that, from our perspective as I mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of new product opportunities that we'll be launching in the second half. And we certainly expect to have some positive impact from that. So our concern about the environment is more on the macro side, the things that we can influence, the things that we have the ability to control, which include some of the new products that we're bringing to market certainly, we believe, put us in a great position. We've done a lot to strengthen our brands over the course of the last couple of 3 years. We're in a very good position there. We continue to be in an extremely good position from a share standpoint. One of our strategies has been through innovation, through a lot of the work that we've been doing with the consumer to increase our very strong market position. And as we sit here today, I don't think there's any area given the fact that we've seen some good improvement in terms of Installation and Cabinets over the course of the last couple of quarters, at least on a sequential basis, that puts us in a position where from a share standpoint, we continue to grow. So we think the environment is going to be challenging, but we certainly think that the opportunities that we'll be rolling out will be a plus. And your comment about easier comps in the second half is certainly accurate, and we'll see how things unfold. But we feel very, very comfortable with the opportunities that we're developing inside."

And we've been able to manage through that and have done a very good job. So that would be part of the answer to your question. The rest of the question related to promotional activity, and we did have incremental in the second quarter about $5 million, $6 million of incremental promotional spend. And typically, the second quarter, Chris, is when we have the majority, if you will, of some of the promotional activity related to Paint. You've got Memorial Day, typically the 4th of July starts sometime in late June. We also do some things around other dates like Labor Day and Presidents' Day. But the second quarter tends to be the quarter when most of the advertising budget is spent.

Outside of that, we've got opportunities in hand tools. We've been doing things with Arrow Fasteners to get outside of North America, and have had some good success. And some of the success we've talked about a little bit earlier with hot tubs is really is our ability to ship and sell products internationally. So we're doing quite a bit in hot tubs now too. So a lot of our businesses where we have a reason to believe we've put some very hard to get after it organically. So we're making a lot of progress."

We'll take about -- because the $200 million is overfunding on that maturity, we'll take about roughly $400 million off the balance sheet to pay down that maturity and then we'd refinance the balance of it. So we feel pretty confident we can do that. With respect to the cash over in Europe, there is some cash over in Hansgrohe. We do have an operating agreement between ourselves and the other shareholders of Hansgrohe to get at that cash if we need to. We do have a dividend policy in place in a manner with fairly efficient cash structure to get to try to minimize as much of the tax cost and bring in that cash back. So we've got some plans in place too in the future to bring that cash back tax efficiently."

That would suggest another financing at some point of $300 million to $400 million, just to add a little bit of color to John's comment, with a net debt decline of $200 million to $300 million.

So we've got pressure in all the segments, Cabinets, the particleboard in Europe, as well as lumber here in the U.S., is certainly a challenge. Metals impact us in Plumbing in terms of zinc and copper, which go into brass. We've talked about inputs for Paint. And in the Window business, resins, glass costs certainly are items that we need to manage through. But having said that, I feel very good about our ability across all of the product groups to make that happen. Again, in innovation, strong brands certainly facilitate that."

So to the extent that we're going to end up about flat with last year, that would suggest that the latter part of the year should be a little bit stronger in terms of that activity. We've also got some of the other major initiatives out of the way that certainly took time and attention. We've got some top line opportunities that we're developing in Cabinets, particularly with the countertop solution that we've talked about in the past. And we've got some excitement there that we'll be able to share with you over the course for the next few months. So we've got some top line opportunities. We've also got some top line opportunities in the Installation side of the business. We expanded the footprint for our distribution business a couple of years ago with a couple of greenfields. So we've got opportunity there. We've also got some opportunity with the larger builders, and we've talked about that. So I think both the combination of top line, additional cost reductions in the second half, we've got the ERP system fully implemented in Installation. So we feel like we've got a very good opportunity to make that happen, and you are correct as you look at the first couple of quarters. Most of that improvement is related for the second half."

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. Sales in the quarter were down 1%. Excluding rationalization charges, gains and impairments from financial investments and adjusting for a normalized tax rate of 36%, income as reconciled would have been $0.05 a share compared to $0.16 in the second quarter of 2010. On an as reported basis, we earned $0.02 in the second quarter compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Working capital improved in the quarter to 15.6%. We'll talk about that a little later on, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
If you flip to Slide #4, please. Gross profit and operating profit as reconciled for the rationalization charges and for a litigation charge in the second quarter, gross profit would have been down about 150 basis points to 26.9%, and our operating margin would have been 5.5%, a 280 basis point decline. A little bit of color in terms of our overall financial performance. I mentioned that sales were down 1%. That equates to about $26 million. That includes an unfavorable change in terms of product exits. As we've announced previously, we have exited the ready-to-assemble product group that ended in the second quarter, and that was a reduction of about $49 million in terms of sales. Offsetting that was positive impact from foreign currency of $54 million. 
Our International operations were up 5% in the quarter in local currencies, and had another very strong quarter in terms of operating performance with margins at 9.8%. That compares to 9.5% last year. Sales to key Retail customers were down mid-single digits in the quarter. All of that is represented by the exit of the ready-to-assemble product group. Without that impact, we would have been flat in the quarter in terms of key Retail sales, and that includes some declines of Wal-Mart that we'll talk about in a little bit. 
Just to give you a perspective, in the first quarter, if you eliminate the exited products, we would have been down low single digit as we communicated a while back. Sales off $26 million. Our operating profit on a reconciled basis was down $59 million. We think volume accounted for about $25 million of that. And obviously, we did benefit from foreign currency translation, so that masks some of the volume decline. Price/commodity relationships in aggregate cost us about $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Cabinets and Plumbing. Mix was about negative $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Plumbing. We did have a little bit of combined mix and price/commodity impacting Other Specialty Products. In addition, we incurred some expenditures for some of the growth initiatives that include our international expansion in Paint and Plumbing, some new Retail programs, innovation and the dealer initiative in Cabinets and the Pro initiative in our Paint group. And we'll talk about those as we go through the segments. 
If you would please flip to Slide #5, where we reconcile earnings per share. As you can see here, this takes into account the reconciliation for the rationalization charges, as well as the litigation charge, and a pretty significant impact in both quarters related to financial investments. In the second quarter of 2010, we had an impairment charge of $33 million. In the second quarter of 2011, we had gains from the disposition of financial investments of $33 million. Those are coincident numbers. As I mentioned, adjusting or reconciling, if you will, we made $0.05 in the second quarter compared to $0.16 last year. And on as reported basis, just as a reminder, earnings per share were $0.02 compared to $0.01 in the prior year.
Please flip to Slide #6. We'll talk about the Cabinet segment. Our sales in Cabinets were down in the quarter 18% and again, that includes the impact of the products that we exited. Without that impact, we would have been off about 6% in the quarter. Decremental margin in the quarter was inflated above our contribution margin. The decline in margin reflects volume, the under absorption of fixed costs. We had about $6 million related to the $49 million of product exit. In this segment, as I mentioned earlier, we had about $5 million of unfavorable price/commodity relationship, and we did incur some increased costs relative to promotion related to the dealer initiative, brand building and some promotions at Retail.
If you flip to Slide #7. In terms of Cabinets, just a quick update. We have a lot of things accomplished in the second quarter. We completed the common architecture program that affected the Merillat and Quality brands. And we also, as I mentioned earlier, finished the exit of the ready-to-assemble related products. And again, we're very happy to have those behind us. We continue to benefit from the Cabinet integration. We're tracking the savings that we've communicated previously. We believe we'll be on track to show about $35 million to $40 million of savings by the end of 2012. And we continue to add dealers or have dealers that have added a Masco Cabinet brand. Over 400 dealers we estimate have done so, and my memory tells me that about 180 or so of those are new dealers to Masco, so we're pleased with that. We did idle another manufacturing facility in the quarter, and KraftMaid was awarded the highest ranking in terms of customer satisfaction related to Cabinets in a J.D. Power's study and obviously, that relates to the U.S. and obviously, we're very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #8, our Plumbing-related business. We had another solid quarter in Plumbing. Plumbing was up 12%. We did benefit from foreign currency in this particular segment, about $42 million of the $54 million positive currency translation relates to Plumbing. Without that, we would have been up about 5%. We did see a modest decline in terms of margin, down about 40 basis points, and profitability is impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationship. We talked about that a little bit earlier, unfavorable mix, as I mentioned, and some investments, incremental investments in the quarter in terms of international brand and some other marketing-related programs. 
If you flip to Slide #9. We continue to invest in the Plumbing segment and brand-building innovation and design, and pursuing international growth. And we had very strong performance in the quarter in our faucet brands in the U.S., Delta, Peerless and Brizo. And Hansgrohe just had a fabulous quarter; in fact, a record quarter in terms of their operations as they continue to expand in global markets. We continue to innovate. Our Touch Technology has now been applied to bathroom faucets. Those were introduced, and we're really excited about the opportunities there. We continue to gain share in tubs and spas, hot tubs and spas with our HotSprings and Caldera brands. And we mentioned last time that Delta was nominated for an Effie Award, and they were recognized with a Silver Effie in the quarter. Again, that's a prestigious honor related to advertising and communication, and certainly very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #10, Installation and Other Services. We were down about 5% in sales in the quarter, and that compares to a 7% decline in 90-day lag starts. In addition, we were off about $3 million in terms of profitability. That 20% decremental margin pretty much explains or pretty much approximates our contribution margin in that particular segment.
If you flip to Slide #11. We did -- I believe we had some sequential share gains from first quarter 2011. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have we believe sequential gains from the fourth quarter of last year, and obviously that's an important topic. I think last year at this time with some of the compression in the build cycle, some of the decontenting that was going on in terms of housing, we had a lot of discussion around share in this business and we're really pleased with some of the progress we've been able to make in terms of Installation. We continue to benefit from increased retrofit sales, and we've got some really good opportunities that are developing with some of the larger builders going forward. Unfortunately, not a lot of that showing up on the top line at this point in time because of the decline or depressed activity. But we certainly are encouraged going forward relative to some of the opportunities that have developed. 
We also completed the implementation of the ERP system in this segment, and we believe that initiative and some of the things we're doing from a lean standpoint should continue to drive efficiencies and cost savings going forward, so making a lot of progress in terms of Installation.
If you flip to Slide #12. Decorative Architectural Products were off 3% in the quarter. We had a pretty significant drop relative to sales in terms of profitability. We continue to see commodity cost pressure, but in this segment in this quarter, price/commodity was basically neutral. Decremental margin includes the timing of advertising spend, which was up compared to the second quarter of last year of $5 million, $6 million. And we also incurred $6 million or so for program costs related to new opportunities in builders' hardware, the investment in the Pro and international expansion and some work we're doing to reformulate some of our Paint-related products. 
So if you flip to Slide #13. We continue to be very excited about some of the top line opportunities in this segment. Our Direct to Pro program with Home Depot continues to gain traction. We have all the Home Depot stores are set now with the Kilz Pro-X product. We got that accomplished in the second quarter, so feel really good about that. And Liberty is in the process of launching some new programs at Retail in both bath and Cabinet-related hardware, and we'll talk more about that later this year as those programs develop, but a lot going on in terms of top line opportunity in this segment.
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales were off 5% in this segment, about $7 million. And we had a pretty significant decline in terms of operating profit in relation to the sales. First and foremost, I would point out that last year, we had an exceptional second quarter. We had about a 7% margin in terms of last year in the quarter as you can see here, so very good second quarter last year. And those of you who have followed us know that we've seen declining performance in this segment since that point in time. We continue to believe that we're being impacted negatively by declines in new home construction in the Western U.S., lower repair/remodel activity. And we believe that that's in part driven by the exploration of the homebuyer tax credit last year, as well as the expiration of some of the energy tax credits that were available. Our lower operating profit reflects volume, about a $4 million spend on geographic expansion, product loss, promotions and trade shows, some loss of leverage, additional freight costs in the quarter. And we did -- when you look at price/commodity and mix combined, we were down probably in this quarter or in this particular segment $1 million to $2 million. So again, not a real solid performance in this segment, but a lot of work going on in terms of product launch. 
And if you flip to Slide #15, a couple of comments relative to this segment. We continue to believe that in windows in both the western United States as well as the United Kingdom that we're gaining share. That's been a fact for us, we think, over the course of the last 6 quarters or so. Unfortunately, the pie is much smaller. Milgard continues to expand in geographies in Texas and Western Canada. The expansion into Texas has cost us a little bit, including some additional freight. And Arrow Fastener has come out with a couple of product lines. We've talked about the R.E.D. line. They've also come out with a new Elite tool line, so we're excited about that opportunity. And as it develops, we'll be able to share some information with you about the outcomes there.
If you flip to Slide #16. I mentioned working capital earlier. We improved from 16.1% to 15.6% in terms of receivables plus inventories less payables as the relationship to the last 12 months sales. And you can see that in terms of the components here, we're up a little bit here in terms of inventory days. Don't feel like there's anything there that is of concern and continue to do a very, very good job in terms of accounts payable management. And really, we want to take this time to kind of thank the team, the Masco Team for the effort here as well as the effort across the other aspects of our business. Obviously, the environment continues to be very challenging, but we're very pleased with some of the opportunities that we're developing, and really encouraged by the effort our folks are putting forward. 
If you flip to Slide #17. Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Market conditions certainly continue to be challenging. The only economic signals continue to be somewhat mixed. But basically, most economists have reduced their expectations for 2011. And we currently see a much less robust year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. You might remember our housing start assumption early on was around 690. At the end of the first quarter, we adjusted that to about 640. And more recently, at least at this point in time, our view is that housing starts appear to be relatively flat with last year. Having said that, for us, lag starts are every important. And on a 90-day lag basis, our sense is that starts will be flat on that same basis. 
We're not seeing a lot of pickup in terms of repair/remodel activity for bigger-ticket items. So that continues to be slow. And having said that, as we've said in the past, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control and influence. That includes driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, our leadership brands, global expansion and continuing to manage our cost structure.
We've got a lot going on operationally. Obviously, 2 of our major priorities are the Cabinets and Installation businesses, and I continue to be pleased with the progress we've made there. As I mentioned earlier, we've completed several key initiatives. The ERP Installation at Installation services, the product exits, the common architecture program, obviously all of those have required significant time and attention. And we're certainly glad they're behind us. In addition, as I mentioned, we did idle another manufacturing plant in Cabinets. And although the economy is not as robust as we had anticipated earlier this year, we still anticipate significant improvement in terms of the operating performance of both of these businesses. We currently anticipate that on a full year basis that we can reduce the operating loss by $20 million to $40 million in terms of Installation and Cabinets combined, and we will continue to push very hard to reduce our breakeven point, and we expect to make more progress in 2012, irrespective of the economic environment.
We also continue to believe that we will successfully offset commodity costs and other inflation on a full year basis. As I mentioned last time we were together, that's certainly a fluid situation. And since we last talked, we do face some additional challenges as it relates to lumber, particleboard, TiO2, resins for paints and windows, as well as metals and other commodities. But we continue to be confident that as we work with suppliers focusing on supply chain, working on cost reductions and implement pricing, that on a full year basis that we'll have these costs covered and neutralized. Year-to-date, we're negative about $20 million in terms of price/commodity relationship. There's a lot more work to do, but we feel confident that we'll be in good shape as the year continues to unfold. 
We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our market, and we continue to invest. We're increasing our penetration in North America from a -- in terms of dealers for Cabinets in that particular channel, and with a professional painter. We continue to develop international opportunities for Paint and Plumbing, and we're launching several new programs this year in Plumbing, Cabinets and builders' hardware. While it's too early to talk about specifics, we think these opportunities are very exciting, and we'll be able to share some of the details with you as these develop over the next couple of quarters. 
We're incurring some incremental costs, as I mentioned earlier and covered when we talked about the segments, as we execute on these opportunities. But we anticipate that they will add significantly to our top line as they mature over time. Longer term, we continue to feel very positive about our ability to create value for our shareholders. We believe that when we can get volumes back to on a top line basis, the $10 billion to $12 billion area that we enjoyed previously, there's no question in our minds that we can deliver double-digit margins at that kind of level, and certainly produce the kinds of returns that shareholders are looking for as they think about Masco as an investment. 
And with that, Connie, we'll open up the lines for questions."

So we think we're positioned to win there, where surely a better balance sheet, strong capital base is really important to do those bigger projects. And on the Cabinet side, we've really been focused on doing more in smaller spaces that applies both to multi-family, but also to what we're seeing in the single-family market today. We're dealing with smaller kitchens, and so how do we do more in smaller spaces and really bring out more value to consumers.

You've got the near-term reality of higher energy costs, higher food costs, which impact disposable income for consumers. And you've also got the near-term uncertainty that seems to emanate from the discussions that come out of Washington in terms of a variety of economic topics that I think people think are important. So when you think about that, the consumer does not appear to be very actively engaged at this point in time. So our feeling is the macro side of things is going to be pretty tough. Having said that, from our perspective as I mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of new product opportunities that we'll be launching in the second half. And we certainly expect to have some positive impact from that. So our concern about the environment is more on the macro side, the things that we can influence, the things that we have the ability to control, which include some of the new products that we're bringing to market certainly, we believe, put us in a great position. We've done a lot to strengthen our brands over the course of the last couple of 3 years. We're in a very good position there. We continue to be in an extremely good position from a share standpoint. One of our strategies has been through innovation, through a lot of the work that we've been doing with the consumer to increase our very strong market position. And as we sit here today, I don't think there's any area given the fact that we've seen some good improvement in terms of Installation and Cabinets over the course of the last couple of quarters, at least on a sequential basis, that puts us in a position where from a share standpoint, we continue to grow. So we think the environment is going to be challenging, but we certainly think that the opportunities that we'll be rolling out will be a plus. And your comment about easier comps in the second half is certainly accurate, and we'll see how things unfold.

You've got Memorial Day, typically the 4th of July starts sometime in late June. We also do some things around other dates like Labor Day and Presidents' Day.

I'm just wondering if I could -- if you could give any color as to -- when I view hot tubs, I view it as a very discretionary item and certainly a bigger-ticket type discretionary item. So I'm curious as to why you might be seeing strength in that market, but not so much in some of the other big-ticket items?"

That started probably about a year ago, and I think it has a lot to do with the strength of the brands. Our hot tub business, HotSprings and the Caldera brand are both leading brands in that segment. We also have taken a lot of share. A lot of folks have gone out of business in that segment. There's been a lot of folks, unfortunately, that haven't been able to make it or from our perspective, I guess, fortunately. And so we've been able to pick up share, and that is one of the bright spots for us. But you are right, it is a very discretionary purchase. It tends to be a bigger-ticket purchase. As we mentioned, we have seen a little bit of migration to opening price point, and we came out with a new product called HotShot, I think. And yes, and John points out that we did develop a -- the ACE System, which automatically regulates the chemicals in the spa. We brought that out about just a little less than a year ago. So it's been a fair amount of innovation and a lot of good work in terms of brand positioning in that segment."

And now, we're doing as much in -- outside of Europe as we are in Europe. And yes, they have a great model, and we've had the Delta folks and the Hansgrohe folks working on some joint initiatives. John Sznewajs and I were in China earlier this year to announce the launch of the Delta brand in China. And we're bringing our technology there with our Touch2O, and we think that's going to resonate really well, especially in the Asian market. We're also doing -- we're looking at opportunities in Paint. We sell paint today in Canada, Mexico, South America. We have a large R&D facility in India, and we put together a team to really explore what's our best opportunities and where should we go next. So we really see those 2 platforms as global platforms. Outside of that, we've got opportunities in hand tools. We've been doing things with Arrow Fasteners to get outside of North America, and have had some good success. And some of the success we've talked about a little bit earlier with hot tubs is really is our ability to ship and sell products internationally. So we're doing quite a bit in hot tubs now, too.

We'll take about -- because the $200 million is overfunding on that maturity, we'll take about roughly $400 million off the balance sheet to pay down that maturity and then we'd refinance the balance of it. So we feel pretty confident we can do that. With respect to the cash over in Europe, there is some cash over in Hansgrohe. We do have an operating agreement between ourselves and the other shareholders of Hansgrohe to get at that cash if we need to. We do have a dividend policy in place in a manner with fairly efficient cash structure to get to try to minimize as much of the tax cost in bringing that cash back.

So we've got pressure in all the segments; Cabinets, particleboard in Europe, as well as lumber here in the U.S., is certainly a challenge. Metals impact us in Plumbing in terms of zinc and copper, which go into brass. We've talked about inputs for Paint.

So to the extent that we're going to end up about flat with last year, that would suggest that the latter part of the year should be a little bit stronger in terms of that activity. We've also got some of the other major initiatives out of the way that certainly took time and attention. We've got some top line opportunities that we're developing in Cabinets, particularly with the countertop solution that we've talked about in the past. And we've got some excitement there that we'll be able to share with you over the course for the next few months. So we've got some top line opportunities. We've also got some top line opportunities in the Installation side of the business. We expanded the footprint for our distribution business a couple of years ago with a couple of greenfields. So we've got opportunity there. We've also got some opportunity with the larger builders, and we've talked about that. So I think both the combination of top line, additional cost reductions in the second half, we've got the ERP system fully implemented in Installation.

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. Sales in the quarter were down 1%. Excluding rationalization charges, gains and impairments from financial investments and adjusting for a normalized tax rate of 36%, income as reconciled would have been $0.05 a share compared to $0.16 in the second quarter of 2010. On an as reported basis, we earned $0.02 in the second quarter compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Working capital improved in the quarter to 15.6%. We'll talk about that a little later on, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
If you flip to Slide #4, please. Gross profit and operating profit as reconciled for the rationalization charges and for a litigation charge in the second quarter, gross profit would have been down about 150 basis points to 26.9%, and our operating margin would have been 5.5%, a 280 basis point decline. A little bit of color in terms of our overall financial performance. I mentioned that sales were down 1%. That equates to about $26 million. That includes an unfavorable change in terms of product exits. As we've announced previously, we have exited the ready-to-assemble product group that ended in the second quarter, and that was a reduction of about $49 million in terms of sales. Offsetting that was positive impact from foreign currency of $54 million. 
Our International operations were up 5% in the quarter in local currencies, and had another very strong quarter in terms of operating performance with margins at 9.8%. That compares to 9.5% last year. Sales to key Retail customers were down mid-single digits in the quarter. All of that is represented by the exit of the ready-to-assemble product group. Without that impact, we would have been flat in the quarter in terms of key Retail sales, and that includes some declines of Wal-Mart that we'll talk about in a little bit. 
Just to give you a perspective, in the first quarter, if you eliminate the exited products, we would have been down low single digit as we communicated a while back. Sales off $26 million. Our operating profit on a reconciled basis was down $59 million. We think volume accounted for about $25 million of that. And obviously, we did benefit from foreign currency translation, so that masks some of the volume decline. Price/commodity relationships in aggregate cost us about $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Cabinets and Plumbing. Mix was about negative $10 million in the quarter, and almost all of that is in Plumbing. We did have a little bit of combined mix and price/commodity impacting Other Specialty Products. In addition, we incurred some expenditures for some of the growth initiatives that include our international expansion in Paint and Plumbing, some new Retail programs, innovation and the dealer initiative in Cabinets and the Pro initiative in our Paint group. And we'll talk about those as we go through the segments. 
If you would please flip to Slide #5, where we reconcile earnings per share. As you can see here, this takes into account the reconciliation for the rationalization charges, as well as the litigation charge, and a pretty significant impact in both quarters related to financial investments. In the second quarter of 2010, we had an impairment charge of $33 million. In the second quarter of 2011, we had gains from the disposition of financial investments of $33 million. Those are coincident numbers. As I mentioned, adjusting or reconciling, if you will, we made $0.05 in the second quarter compared to $0.16 last year. And on as reported basis, just as a reminder, earnings per share were $0.02 compared to $0.01 in the prior year.
Please flip to Slide #6. We'll talk about the Cabinet segment. Our sales in Cabinets were down in the quarter 18% and again, that includes the impact of the products that we exited. Without that impact, we would have been off about 6% in the quarter. Decremental margin in the quarter was inflated above our contribution margin. The decline in margin reflects volume, the under absorption of fixed costs. We had about $6 million related to the $49 million of product exit. In this segment, as I mentioned earlier, we had about $5 million of unfavorable price/commodity relationship, and we did incur some increased costs relative to promotion related to the dealer initiative, brand building and some promotions at Retail.
If you flip to Slide #7. In terms of Cabinets, just a quick update. We have a lot of things accomplished in the second quarter. We completed the common architecture program that affected the Merillat and Quality brands. And we also, as I mentioned earlier, finished the exit of the ready-to-assemble related products. And again, we're very happy to have those behind us. We continue to benefit from the Cabinet integration. We're tracking the savings that we've communicated previously. We believe we'll be on track to show about $35 million to $40 million of savings by the end of 2012. And we continue to add dealers or have dealers that have added a Masco Cabinet brand. Over 400 dealers we estimate have done so, and my memory tells me that about 180 or so of those are new dealers to Masco, so we're pleased with that. We did idle another manufacturing facility in the quarter, and KraftMaid was awarded the highest ranking in terms of customer satisfaction related to Cabinets in a J.D. Power's study and obviously, that relates to the U.S. and obviously, we're very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #8, our Plumbing-related business. We had another solid quarter in Plumbing. Plumbing was up 12%. We did benefit from foreign currency in this particular segment, about $42 million of the $54 million positive currency translation relates to Plumbing. Without that, we would have been up about 5%. We did see a modest decline in terms of margin, down about 40 basis points, and profitability is impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationship. We talked about that a little bit earlier, unfavorable mix, as I mentioned, and some investments, incremental investments in the quarter in terms of international brand and some other marketing-related programs. 
If you flip to Slide #9. We continue to invest in the Plumbing segment and brand-building innovation and design, and pursuing international growth. And we had very strong performance in the quarter in our faucet brands in the U.S., Delta, Peerless and Brizo. And Hansgrohe just had a fabulous quarter; in fact, a record quarter in terms of their operations as they continue to expand in global markets. We continue to innovate. Our Touch Technology has now been applied to bathroom faucets. Those were introduced, and we're really excited about the opportunities there. We continue to gain share in tubs and spas, hot tubs and spas with our HotSprings and Caldera brands. And we mentioned last time that Delta was nominated for an Effie Award, and they were recognized with a Silver Effie in the quarter. Again, that's a prestigious honor related to advertising and communication, and certainly very proud of that. 
If you flip to Slide #10, Installation and Other Services. We were down about 5% in sales in the quarter, and that compares to a 7% decline in 90-day lag starts. In addition, we were off about $3 million in terms of profitability. That 20% decremental margin pretty much explains or pretty much approximates our contribution margin in that particular segment.
If you flip to Slide #11. We did -- I believe we had some sequential share gains from first quarter 2011. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have we believe sequential gains from the fourth quarter of last year, and obviously that's an important topic. I think last year at this time with some of the compression in the build cycle, some of the decontenting that was going on in terms of housing, we had a lot of discussion around share in this business and we're really pleased with some of the progress we've been able to make in terms of Installation. We continue to benefit from increased retrofit sales, and we've got some really good opportunities that are developing with some of the larger builders going forward. Unfortunately, not a lot of that showing up on the top line at this point in time because of the decline or depressed activity. But we certainly are encouraged going forward relative to some of the opportunities that have developed. 
We also completed the implementation of the ERP system in this segment, and we believe that initiative and some of the things we're doing from a lean standpoint should continue to drive efficiencies and cost savings going forward, so making a lot of progress in terms of Installation.
If you flip to Slide #12. Decorative Architectural Products were off 3% in the quarter. We had a pretty significant drop relative to sales in terms of profitability. We continue to see commodity cost pressure, but in this segment in this quarter, price/commodity was basically neutral. Decremental margin includes the timing of advertising spend, which was up compared to the second quarter of last year of $5 million, $6 million. And we also incurred $6 million or so for program costs related to new opportunities in builders' hardware, the investment in the Pro and international expansion and some work we're doing to reformulate some of our Paint-related products. 
So if you flip to Slide #13. We continue to be very excited about some of the top line opportunities in this segment. Our Direct to Pro program with Home Depot continues to gain traction. We have all the Home Depot stores are set now with the Kilz Pro-X product. We got that accomplished in the second quarter, so feel really good about that. And Liberty is in the process of launching some new programs at Retail in both bath and Cabinet-related hardware, and we'll talk more about that later this year as those programs develop, but a lot going on in terms of top line opportunity in this segment.
If you flip to Slide #14, Other Specialty Products. Sales were off 5% in this segment, about $7 million. And we had a pretty significant decline in terms of operating profit in relation to the sales. First and foremost, I would point out that last year, we had an exceptional second quarter. We had about a 7% margin in terms of last year in the quarter as you can see here, so very good second quarter last year. And those of you who have followed us know that we've seen declining performance in this segment since that point in time. We continue to believe that we're being impacted negatively by declines in new home construction in the Western U.S., lower repair/remodel activity. And we believe that that's in part driven by the exploration of the homebuyer tax credit last year, as well as the expiration of some of the energy tax credits that were available. Our lower operating profit reflects volume, about a $4 million spend on geographic expansion, product loss, promotions and trade shows, some loss of leverage, additional freight costs in the quarter. And we did -- when you look at price/commodity and mix combined, we were down probably in this quarter or in this particular segment $1 million to $2 million. So again, not a real solid performance in this segment, but a lot of work going on in terms of product launch. 
And if you flip to Slide #15, a couple of comments relative to this segment. We continue to believe that in windows in both the western United States as well as the United Kingdom that we're gaining share. That's been a fact for us, we think, over the course of the last 6 quarters or so. Unfortunately, the pie is much smaller. Milgard continues to expand in geographies in Texas and Western Canada. The expansion into Texas has cost us a little bit, including some additional freight. And Arrow Fastener has come out with a couple of product lines. We've talked about the R.E.D. line. They've also come out with a new Elite tool line, so we're excited about that opportunity. And as it develops, we'll be able to share some information with you about the outcomes there.
If you flip to Slide #16. I mentioned working capital earlier. We improved from 16.1% to 15.6% in terms of receivables plus inventories less payables as the relationship to the last 12 months sales. And you can see that in terms of the components here, we're up a little bit here in terms of inventory days. Don't feel like there's anything there that is of concern and continue to do a very, very good job in terms of accounts payable management. And really, we want to take this time to kind of thank the team, the Masco Team for the effort here as well as the effort across the other aspects of our business. Obviously, the environment continues to be very challenging, but we're very pleased with some of the opportunities that we're developing, and really encouraged by the effort our folks are putting forward. 
If you flip to Slide #17. Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Market conditions certainly continue to be challenging. The only economic signals continue to be somewhat mixed. But basically, most economists have reduced their expectations for 2011. And we currently see a much less robust year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. You might remember our housing start assumption early on was around 690. At the end of the first quarter, we adjusted that to about 640. And more recently, at least at this point in time, our view is that housing starts appear to be relatively flat with last year. Having said that, for us, lag starts are every important. And on a 90-day lag basis, our sense is that starts will be flat on that same basis. 
We're not seeing a lot of pickup in terms of repair/remodel activity for bigger-ticket items. So that continues to be slow. And having said that, as we've said in the past, we'll continue to focus on the things that we can control and influence. That includes driving the Masco Business System across the enterprise, continuing to invest in innovation, our leadership brands, global expansion and continuing to manage our cost structure.
We've got a lot going on operationally. Obviously, 2 of our major priorities are the Cabinets and Installation businesses, and I continue to be pleased with the progress we've made there. As I mentioned earlier, we've completed several key initiatives. The ERP Installation at Installation services, the product exits, the common architecture program, obviously all of those have required significant time and attention. And we're certainly glad they're behind us. In addition, as I mentioned, we did idle another manufacturing plant in Cabinets. And although the economy is not as robust as we had anticipated earlier this year, we still anticipate significant improvement in terms of the operating performance of both of these businesses. We currently anticipate that on a full year basis that we can reduce the operating loss by $20 million to $40 million in terms of Installation and Cabinets combined, and we will continue to push very hard to reduce our breakeven point, and we expect to make more progress in 2012, irrespective of the economic environment.
We also continue to believe that we will successfully offset commodity costs and other inflation on a full year basis. As I mentioned last time we were together, that's certainly a fluid situation. And since we last talked, we do face some additional challenges as it relates to lumber, particleboard, TiO2, resins for paints and windows, as well as metals and other commodities. But we continue to be confident that as we work with suppliers focusing on supply chain, working on cost reductions and implement pricing, that on a full year basis that we'll have these costs covered and neutralized. Year-to-date, we're negative about $20 million in terms of price/commodity relationship. There's a lot more work to do, but we feel confident that we'll be in good shape as the year continues to unfold. 
We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our market, and we continue to invest. We're increasing our penetration in North America from a -- in terms of dealers for Cabinets in that particular channel, and with a professional painter. We continue to develop international opportunities for Paint and Plumbing, and we're launching several new programs this year in Plumbing, Cabinets and builders' hardware. While it's too early to talk about specifics, we think these opportunities are very exciting, and we'll be able to share some of the details with you as these develop over the next couple of quarters. 
We're incurring some incremental costs, as I mentioned earlier and covered when we talked about the segments, as we execute on these opportunities. But we anticipate that they will add significantly to our top line as they mature over time. Longer term, we continue to feel very positive about our ability to create value for our shareholders. We believe that when we can get volumes back to on a top line basis, the $10 billion to $12 billion area that we enjoyed previously, there's no question in our minds that we can deliver double-digit margins at that kind of level, and certainly produce the kinds of returns that shareholders are looking for as they think about Masco as an investment. 
And with that, Connie, we'll open up the lines for questions."

So we think we're positioned to win there, where surely a better balance sheet, strong capital base is really important to do those bigger projects. And on the Cabinet side, we've really been focused on doing more in smaller spaces that applies both to multi-family, but also to what we're seeing in the single-family market today. We're dealing with smaller kitchens, and so how do we do more in smaller spaces and really bring out more value to consumers. So we see this trend as one that we think we're positioned to win, and we're going after it aggressively."

You've got the near-term reality of higher energy costs, higher food costs, which impact disposable income for consumers. And you've also got the near-term uncertainty that seems to emanate from the discussions that come out of Washington in terms of a variety of economic topics that I think people think are important. So when you think about that, the consumer does not appear to be very actively engaged at this point in time. So our feeling is the macro side of things is going to be pretty tough. Having said that, from our perspective as I mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of new product opportunities that we'll be launching in the second half. And we certainly expect to have some positive impact from that. So our concern about the environment is more on the macro side, the things that we can influence, the things that we have the ability to control, which include some of the new products that we're bringing to market certainly, we believe, put us in a great position. We've done a lot to strengthen our brands over the course of the last couple of 3 years. We're in a very good position there. We continue to be in an extremely good position from a share standpoint. One of our strategies has been through innovation, through a lot of the work that we've been doing with the consumer to increase our very strong market position. And as we sit here today, I don't think there's any area given the fact that we've seen some good improvement in terms of Installation and Cabinets over the course of the last couple of quarters, at least on a sequential basis, that puts us in a position where from a share standpoint, we continue to grow. So we think the environment is going to be challenging, but we certainly think that the opportunities that we'll be rolling out will be a plus. And your comment about easier comps in the second half is certainly accurate, and we'll see how things unfold.

Typically, when they enter a new market, there tends to be a little bit of a shift there, if you will, or a little bit of pressure in terms of margin. So that would be primarily where the mix shift is taking place. Now we've also seen a little bit of shift in terms of hot tubs, for example, to opening price points. But basically, Hansgrohe would be the one area where mix has probably been more of the issue. But having said that, they continue to perform at just a fabulous rate, if you will. As I mentioned, they had a record quarter in both sales and profitability. And so even though there's a little bit of a mix shift, we're still seeing some very good top line growth there."

I think that others in the industry have talked about those in terms of mid-to-high teen type increases. Because of the fact that we deal with a lot of large suppliers and have one large customer, we don't typically get specific about price/commodity detail in this particular segment. But I think you can certainly assume that we continue to face cost pressures. And as we've talked in the past, there are availability issues, if you will, relative to supply. And we've been able to manage through that and have done a very good job. So that would be part of the answer to your question. The rest of the question related to promotional activity, and we did have incremental in the second quarter about $5 million, $6 million of incremental promotional spend. And typically, the second quarter, Chris, is when we have the majority, if you will, of some of the promotional activity related to Paint. You've got Memorial Day, typically the 4th of July starts sometime in late June. We also do some things around other dates like Labor Day and Presidents' Day. But the second quarter tends to be the quarter when most of the advertising budget is spent. And if you look at the sequential change in profitability versus the change in sales from the first quarter, you can see that impact. And we talked about that last year on the call as well. But second quarter is a very, very heavy period of time in terms of advertising spend."

I mean, we've been able to successfully offset commodity costs. I think if we were to go back and roll the tape back 3 or 4 years, I'm guessing that we're probably neutral over that long period of time. And we've seen a $5 billion decline in sales from $12.5 billion in '06 to about $7.5 billion last year. And so I don't think it gets a whole lot tougher than that, but I think when you've got the focus we've had on innovation, the focus we've had on the work we've done around customer intimacy, the strength of our brands, it certainly puts us in a good position. We've got a supply chain initiative in place that is getting a lot of good traction. So yes, we feel comfortable that even in a tough environment, we should be able to make that happen. 
Thank you. And I'd like to thank all of you for participating today, we appreciate that. And as Connie mentioned earlier, if we didn't get to your question, please give us a call, and we'll try to get back to you as quickly as we can. Thank you."

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. The operating environment for our businesses continues to be challenging as commodity cost pressures, a very competitive retail environment and depressed consumer confidence continue to impact our performance. In this challenging environment, we continue to strengthen our market position. We believe that we maintained or gain share in our major product categories. We've introduced new products and programs and got some very nice industry recognition, which we'll talk about as we work our way through the presentation. And we've taken some additional actions to strengthen our position in several of our markets. And if you flip to Slide #4, I want to talk about some of the things that have transpired here over the last couple of months. 
As it relates to Milgard, our Window business in the Western United States. In September, we exited our glass business. We also, in October, closed -- announced the closure of 3 of our manufacturing facilities. That's going to cost us, we estimate about $30 million, of which, about $5 million will be cash and we expect to save an annual basis of about $7 million number, give or take. Those actions, together with some other actions that we've taken in other business units, should result in headcount reductions of about 750 for the period September through the end of the year. Obviously, those will continue to be very, very difficult issues, difficult decisions, but certainly necessary in the environment that we're in. 
We also announced in our press release the divestiture of 4 of our noncore diversified products businesses and service businesses in our Installation segment, that include framing, commercial drywall and millwork. Those businesses will show up in our discontinued ops line in the fourth quarter, we'll be restating prior year periods. From a modeling perspective, I think you can assume about $100 million of top line in terms of sales and about $20 million of operating losses related to those businesses. Now that operating loss number could move a little bit as we get into some of the details based on allocations, may be intercompany activity, that type of thing. But again, I think that's pretty good guidance in terms of modeling. 
If you flip to Slide #5, our sales in the quarter were up 3%. We benefited from foreign currency by about $40 million and that basically offsets the plant product exits in Cabinets for our ready-to-assemble business, which was a negative 38 in the quarter. If you exclude the rationalization charges, gains on financial investments, impairment charges and normalize our tax rate, our earnings would have been $0.08 a share compared to $0.11 in the third quarter of 2010. We did not include in that reconciliation the impact of the metal hedge. We lost $10 million in the third quarter of 2011. We had income of $4 million in the third quarter of 2010. And again, those are not in the reconciliation of EPS. That cost us about $0.02 in the third quarter of 2011 and eliminating the gain in the third quarter of 2010 would not move $0.11. It's still around $0.11. 
On a reported basis, we made $0.10 a share compared to a loss of $0.02 last year. And we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
And if you flip through Slide #6, please. In terms of gross profit and operating profit, on an adjusted basis, we were down 180 basis points in gross margin and again that does not include any impact from the hedge. If you were to pro forma the hedge into that adjusted number, the difference would have been about 100 basis points. 
In terms of operating profit, down 110 basis points as adjusted on this slide. Again, if we include the hedge impact, that would narrow to about 40 basis points third quarter last year to third quarter this year. 
A couple of additional comments that I'd like to make. International sales were up 4% in local currency and we continue to have double-digit margins there, although down from last year. We've got some negative mix and we'll talk about that when we get to the Plumbing segment. Sales to key retail customers were down low-single digit and if you back out the impact of the product exit, we would have been up low-single digit. And from a trend standpoint, the first quarter on that same basis, again, without the impact of the RTA exiting Cabinet, first quarter sales to key retail customers would have been down low-single digits, second quarter would have been flat and third quarter would have been up low-single digit. Now again, second half of the year comparisons are up easier than the first half this year.
Sales up $50 million. We expect about $15 million of incremental operating profit. We're down $18 million, so that really suggest about a $33 million shortfall, if you will, on that kind of basis. That's really explain in 3 different buckets. Low-priced commodity, including the hedge, was negative, slightly below $10 million. Our mix was negative in the quarter, about $16 million and we have program costs and again, we'll talk about those items as we work our way through the segments. But almost all of that on a net basis is reflected in the Plumbing segment.
If you flip to Slide #7, a couple of points here. We talked about the reconciled numbers. We also mentioned that the hedge is not in the $0.08 and $0.11, including that would be $0.10 this year versus $0.11 last year. We did have on the pro forma here, we backed out $0.03 of gains from portfolio of financial investments. We're making a lot of good progress there [indiscernible] I think we're really anything we are down about $100 million in terms of assets on the balance sheet. So we're making good progress there. 
If you flip to Slide #8, Cabinets. We were down 14%. Excluding the planned product exits, we would have down about 4% and we had about $8 million benefit in terms of foreign currency translation on the top line. We were able to hold even with the sales down, we had no incremental loss. We had a nice job in the quarter, related to profit improvement programs. That offset a bit of unfavorable mix and a modest negative in terms of price/commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide #9, we continue to benefit from the integration of our North American Cabinet businesses. We're on track to realize the approximate $35 million plus of savings by the end of next year. In the Retail and dealer channels in North America, still a lot of promotional activity. European markets continue to be very, very challenging for our businesses. Obviously, were aware of some of the discussions in here relative to the Greece and some of the other issues around the European Union. But our businesses are having a difficult time. 
We believe from a share perspective relative to Cabinets, that we continue to gain traction in the dealer and big builders segment. We continue to have a bit of a challenge at lower price point in terms of our big box customers, but did have a very good quarter at the higher end as it relates to the KraftMaid brand for the big box consumers. 
Countertop model continues to gain some traction and, if you will, flip to Slide #10, we've got some highlights here from 3 programs that we have 2 at Lowe's, one with Home Depot. One of the Lowe's program, one of the Home Depot programs for vanities and tops. And given a lot of good traction here, really working out well for us and for our key customers here. And vanity programs are really driven more towards Bath remodeling, which typically is a little bit smaller projects, which consumers are a little bit more likely at this point in time in the cycle to undertake as opposed to maybe a major kitchen remodel program. But again, getting a lot of good traction here and the top and bottom program also as we mentioned in the past resonating with larger builders.
If you flip to Slide #11, Plumbing Products, our sales were up 12% in the quarter. We did have about $30 million of benefit from foreign currency translation. Without that benefit, we would have been up about 8%. So that was certainly a plus. Margins as adjusted for rationalization charges are down from 14.6% to 12%. But I would point out that the hedge impacts these numbers. If we were to exclude the negative $10 million in the third quarter of 2011 and exclude the $4 million positive in the third quarter of 2010, we'd be comparing 14% to 13.3% in terms of margin. We did have unfavorable price/commodity relationship in this segment from the quarter driven in large part by the hedge. Had we not had the hedge, we would have been a little bit positive. Mix continues to be unfavorable in this segment, that was about $13 million. And we continue to incur cost for some of the programs that we're launching and including faucet programs, as well as plumbing supply-related programs.
If you flip to Slide #12, we continue to invest in brand building, new product development and international growth and feel really good about the traction we're getting in North America in terms of share with the Delta, Peerless and Brizo brands. Also doing a good job from a share standpoint with HotSpring. We continue to extend the Peerless and Delta brands around building systems and hardware. 
And we're really, really proud, if you flip to Slide 13, that Delta was recognized as the WaterSense Partner of the Year by the EPA. And again, very proud of that distinction. I guess that's the first time that we've been recognized for that award and certainly very proud of that and certainly appreciate the efforts of our [indiscernible] Delta Faucet. 
If you flip to Slide #14, Installation and Other Services. Net sales were up 8% and I think it's been a while since we were able to make that comments. But we were up 8% in the quarter, against lag starts of a negative 5%. So we saw some very good movement there in terms of share gains. Margins continue to be impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationships and that really relates more to products that we distribute as opposed to products that we install and we had a slight mix negative in the quarter. 
If you flip to Slide #15, we gained share year-over-year. You might remember last year at this time, we talked about may be being underrepresented in certain areas we've added some people in terms of sell side of things and that's starting to pay off. We continue to a do really good job in the retrofit side and, in fact, we integrated our WellHome business into the Masco Contracting Services business to eliminate some costs and some of overhead and also to help leverage our capabilities in WellHome as we continue to pursue retrofit opportunities and that's going really, really well for us. We increased our penetration of multi-family and continue to do a good job with the larger builders. And I mentioned earlier that we our divesting our core businesses that are noncore in terms of diversified products. 
If you flip to Slide #16, Decorative Architectural Products, sales were down 2% in that segment and I would point out that we continue to be impacted by the lost of the Walmart business and that affects both paints and builders hardware. And the markets for Paint have been relatively soft. I think in the first half of the year, gallons were down about 8% as a recall and my sense is that's probably continued into the third quarter to a certain degree. 
Commodity pressures continue. We've talked about the issues around TiO2 in terms of availability as well as cost. Resins continue to be a bit of a challenge, but we were neutral in this segment in terms of price/commodity relationship in the quarter. We continue to be impacted by investments, costs that we're incurring for new programs and costs that we're incurring and that include international expansion and our pursuit in terms of a professional painter. But a relatively good performance just in terms of overall operating performance in that segment. 
If you flip to Slide 17, we continue to incur near-term costs to expand the top line in both paint and hardware. We did a good with the direct to Pro program at the Home Depot. We continue to invest in new products and merchandising innovation and we're focused on international expansion in terms of Paint, as I mentioned earlier. Liberty has got some new programs that we'll be launching and we'll be talking more about them in those in the subsequent quarters. And we're really proud that Home Depot recognized Behr in their recent vendor meeting as a partner of the year for the Paint department. Good job for the Behr team there as well.
If you flip to Slide #18, Other Specialty Products. Sales in this segment were up about $2 million and that was really driven by foreign currency translation which increased sales by $2 million. So essentially flat with that. And a really good performance year in terms of operating profit. We had favorable price/commodity relationships, which are really driven by a reduction in rebates and also had a nice job in this segment from a cost standpoint in terms of profit improvement program. 
And if you flip to Slide #19, we believe that Milgard continues to outperform the Western market in terms of repair/remodel new home construction. We're gaining share. We also continue to expand into Texas and Western Canada. And we've had some really good product introductions. Milgard was recognized by Window and Door magazine for the most innovative new window for a large manufacturer and we're really pleased with that. We talked earlier about the exit of the glass business. That business in September, the closure of the plants in the October time frame. Our U.K. Window Group continues to do a nice job in terms of share and, in fact, it's a little early, but we'd probably be able to talk about a pretty nice win they've got going, that's developing for them in terms of a retail opportunity in the next couple of quarters. And we launched at Lowe's the Arrow T50 Elite staple gun.
If you flip to Slide 20, this gives you a little bit of a perspective in terms of the essence Windows series, which won the award I mentioned earlier from Window and Door magazine. We also have come out with some premium colors for our vinyl window and frame offerings. That was really a nice collaboration with Behr. And those premium colors represent an upgrade opportunity for consumers.
If you flip to Slide 21, working capital. We continue to see some good improvement when we take receivables plus inventory less payables and compare that to the last 12 months of sales. We're down from 16.2% last year in the third quarter to 14.8%. We've got a little bit of a tick up in terms of inventory. We're not overly concerned about that and we'll probably work part of that down in the fourth quarter. That's offset substantially by improvement in accounts payable days as we continue to aggressively manage our supply chain. I'd like to thank our team across the enterprise for the work they're doing and from the working capital prospect you. And also just in terms of some of the other positive things that we've got going in terms of new programs, new products that we're launching, some of the cost takeouts, et cetera. A lot of good work being done across the enterprise.
If you flip to Slide #22, I'd like to make a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. And as I mentioned earlier, market conditions remain very challenging. And for the most part, it was a pretty tough third quarter, no question about that. Having said that, we grew our top line, launched a lot of new products and we believe we continue to gain share, as I mentioned earlier or at least maintain our major product categories. As we've previously communicated to you, we'll continue to focus on the things that we have control over, improving our execution, continuing to invest in innovation, leadership brands, global expansion and aggressively managing our cost structure.
2 of our major operational priorities continue to be the improvement of our Installation and Cabinets business. Earlier this year, we anticipated that we would see aggregate improvement in these segments in terms of reduced operating losses. And at this point, it does not appear that we're going to get there. We anticipated a stronger top line in the second half of 2011 and we might have been a little bit optimistic in terms of market conditions, particularly as it relates to Europe in Cabinets. 
And while we successfully completed a lot of key initiatives, as we've discussed in previous calls, we're extremely disappointed that we did not improve about the bottom line. And as we plan for 2012, we're pushing the businesses in these segments very hard to significantly reduce their breakeven points, irrespective of their economic environment. 
In addition, we now expect to have a negative relationship in terms of price commodities for the year. While we have successfully offset hundreds of millions of dollars in increased commodity costs in 2011, working with suppliers, working on Lean and our supply chain and through pricing actions, we have about $30 million negative price/commodity relationship through the first 9 months. Now that does include the hedge loss in the third quarter, which I think I mentioned earlier comments we hadn't had the hedge lost we would have a positive relationship in the third quarter. We also had mentioned a little earlier in our last call, lumber, particleboard, financial material, resins, TiO2 continue to be very challenging. And we'll continue to work hard on these. We've got some good things going on from a supply-chain standpoint and we expect to see some benefits from that continuing as we go forward.
We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our markets and we continue to invest in penetrating the North American Cabinet dealer and in terms of that channel and the professional painter. Developing international opportunities in Paint and Plumbing and expanding our leadership position in the do-it-yourself coatings market. We're launching new programs and plumbing cabinets and builders hardware and we'll continue to discuss those as they develop and mature over time. Obviously, we're incurring some incremental costs to execute on these opportunities but our feeling is they'll add significantly to the top line going forward and should create good value for our shareholders. 
And with that, Debbie, we'll open up the lines for Q&A."

And really pushing them to do everything they can to get as close to breakeven as possible. It's a little bit too early to declare that we think we can get. We are in our planning process as we speak. We have not reviewed some of the plans and obviously, a part of that is to the extent we can get there whether some of the things that we might not be able to do that might have some longer-term implications to us. So I  -- we're pushing them very, very aggressively. I think the wild card in Cabinets is probably Europe. The environment over there is very, very difficult and as we've indicated in the past, we've got 2 new leaders there that have been at more and at development in Denmark that have been basically in the businesses now for about 9 or 10 months. And so we're pleased with the folks we have. We've got some additional changes in the leadership teams but the environment there continues to be very, very difficult. So we're pushing the businesses very hard. My sense is if the Blue Chip consensus is right relative to housing starts and there are a lot of folks that are very good at projecting significantly above the 700,000 units number for next year. If we get closer to that number in terms of starts, I think we've got a real good chance to show some substantial improvement in both of those segments. And I guess for at this point in time, I'd rather not get anymore aggressive than that. We'll give you a better update in February when we get together in the fourth quarter call."

We also have a couple of, on the commercial drywall side, we've got a couple of contracts that we recently completed. And those businesses in 2010 in aggregate were basically profitable as well.

So we have to mark-to-market contract on copper and zinc at the end of every period. So as you think about copper prices for the third quarter of 2011, on average, per pound, they were up 24% versus the third quarter of 2010. Though at the end of the quarter, they fell [indiscernible] highest felt pretty dramatically on period and so mark-to-market to a relatively low number. That said, copper since that point in time, is up about 10% and since the end of September. So we don't want to commit copper prices, metal prices will tend to rise more than fall. So if this does occur, we should recognize gains on these contracts in future periods. So overall, if you think about how much we had right now, as we said we got into last year a little bit, overall less than 20% of our metals consumption is currently hedged."

But there's a couple of aspects there that I think are important to understand. We do have service organizations. We've got at Behr, we've got a large sales self-service force that is in the field and they tend to be a fixed number, if you will. We also have the same thing in terms of Masco retail sales service support for Lowe's and we have service support for Home Depot as well. As we respective in general those guys are in the stores, working on our sets, our displays, et cetera. And so that's a little bit like kind of a large fixed cost and the number of stores doesn't change dramatically and revenue maybe Donna Rob a little bit about that tends to be a cost that is fairly fixed across the enterprise. Having said that, we have leveraged our sales folks. You might remember last year that the talk a little bit in terms of installation business may be underrepresented in a couple of locations where we didn't have the sales representation that we would have liked to have. We did have some folks there, we added some people on the Pro Paint side. So as we pursue some of the opportunities, Bob, my sense is that there is a bit of in investments that will make in that area. You might have heard me comment earlier to a question making from some about incremental spend on programs that were up about $20 million in the quarter versus last year. And my sense is I think on a year-to-date basis, that number might be around $50 million, John? Right around $50 million. So we do incur expense for new opportunities, sometimes go and hit the top line in the same period. But you can rest assure that when you look at some of the headcount reductions that we've made across the company over the last several years, a lot of that has been in the SG&A category we're going to think as this stuff that to pick up a little bit, there should be some really good leveraging opportunities for us."

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. The operating environment for our businesses continues to be challenging as commodity cost pressures, a very competitive retail environment and depressed consumer confidence continue to impact our performance. In this challenging environment, we continue to strengthen our market positions. We believe that we maintained or gain share in our major product categories. We've introduced new products and programs and got some very nice industry recognition, which we'll talk about as we work our way through the presentation. And we've taken some additional actions to strengthen our position in several of our markets. 
And if you flip to Slide #4, I want to talk about some of the things that have transpired here over the last couple of months.  As it relates to Milgard, our window business in the Western United States, in September, we exited our glass business. We also, in October, closed -- announced the closure of 3 of our manufacturing facilities. That's going to cost us, we estimate about $30 million, of which about $5 million will be cash. And we expect to save, on an annual basis, about $7 million, give or take. Those actions, together with some other actions that we've taken in other business units, should result in headcount reductions of about 750 for the period September through the end of the year. Obviously, those continue to be very, very difficult issues, difficult decisions, but certainly necessary in the environment that we're in. 
We also announced in our press release the divestiture of 4 of our non-core diversified products businesses and service businesses in our installation segment that include framing, commercial drywall and millwork. Those businesses will show up in our discontinued ops line in the fourth quarter. We'll be restating the prior year periods. From a modeling perspective, I think you can assume about $100 million of top line in terms of sales and about $20 million of operating losses related to those businesses. Now that operating loss number could move a little bit as we get into some of the detail based on allocations, may be intercompany activity, that type of thing. But again, I think that's pretty good guidance in terms of modeling. 
If you flip to Slide #5, our sales in the quarter were up 3%. We benefited from foreign currency by about $40 million and that basically offsets the plant product exits in cabinets for our ready-to-assemble business, which was a negative 38 in the quarter. If you exclude the rationalization charges, gains on financial investments, impairment charges and normalize our tax rate, our earnings would have been $0.08 a share compared to $0.11 in the third quarter of 2010. We did not include in that reconciliation the impact of the metal hedge. We lost $10 million in the third quarter of 2011. We had income of $4 million in the third quarter of 2010. And again, those are not in the reconciliation of EPS. That cost us about $0.02 in the third quarter of 2011, and eliminating the gain in the third quarter of 2010 would not move the $0.11. It's still around to $0.11. On a reported basis, we made $0.10 a share compared to a loss of $0.02 last year, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
And if you flip through Slide #6, please. In terms of gross profit and operating profit, on an adjusted basis, we were down 180 basis points in gross margin, and again that does not include any impact from the hedge. If you were to pro forma the hedge into that adjusted number, the difference would have been about 100 basis points.  In terms of operating profit, down 110 basis points, as adjusted on this slide. Again, if we include the hedge impact, that would've narrow to about 40 basis points, third quarter last year to third quarter this year. 
A couple of additional comments that I'd like to make. International sales were up 4% in local currency and we continue to have double-digit margins there, although down from last year. We've got some negative mix and we'll talk about that when we get to the plumbing segment. Sales to key retail customers were down low-single digit. And if you back out the impact of the product exit, we would have been up low-single digit. And from a trend standpoint, the first quarter on that same basis, again, without the impact of the RTA exiting cabinet, first quarter sales to key retail customers would have been down low-single digits, second quarter would have been flat and third quarter would have been up low-single digit. Now, again, the second half of the year comparisons are a bit easier than the first half this year.
Sales, up $50 million. We expect about $15 million of incremental operating profit. We're down $18 million, so that really suggest about a $33 million shortfall, if you will, on that kind of basis. That's really explained in 3 different buckets. Price commodity, including the hedge, was negative, slightly below $10 million. Our mix was negative in the quarter, about $16 million and we had program cost. And again, we'll talk about those items as we work our way through the segments. But almost all of that on a net basis is reflected in the plumbing segment.
If you flip to Slide #7, a couple of points here. We talked about the reconciled numbers. We also mentioned that the hedge is not in the $0.08 and $0.11, including that would be $0.10 this year versus $0.11 last year. We did have on the pro forma here, we backed out $0.03 of gains from our portfolio of financial investments. We're making a lot of good progress there incidentally, and I think we're down below $100 million in terms of assets on the balance sheet. So we're making very good progress there. 
If you flip to Slide #8, cabinets. We were down 14%. Excluding the planned product exits, we would have been down about 4%, and we had about $8 million benefit in terms of foreign currency translation on the top line. We were able to hold even with sales down, we had no incremental loss. We had a nice job in the quarter related to profit improvement programs. That offset a little bit of unfavorable mix and a modest negative in terms of price/commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide #9, we continue to benefit from the integration of our North American cabinet businesses. We're on track to realize the approximate $35 million-plus of savings by the end of next year. In the retail and dealer channels in North America, still a lot of promotional activity. European markets continue to be very, very challenging for our businesses. Obviously, we're all aware of some of the discussions in Europe relative to Greece and some of the other issues around the European Union, but our businesses are having a difficult time. 
We believe from a share perspective relative to cabinets, that we continue to gain traction in the dealer and big builders segment. We continue to have a bit of a challenge at lower price points in terms of our big-box customers, but did have a very good quarter at the higher end as it relates to the KraftMaid brand at -- for the big-box consumers.  Countertop model continues to gain some traction. 
And if you would flip to Slide #10. We've got some highlights here from 3 programs that we have: 2 with Lowe's, 1 with Home Depot; 1 of the Lowe's program, 1 of the Home Depot programs for vanities and tops. And getting a lot of good traction here, really working out well for us and for our key customers here. And the vanity programs are really driven more towards bath remodeling, which typically is a little bit smaller project which consumers are a little bit more likely at this point in time in the cycle to undertake as opposed to maybe a major kitchen remodel program. But again, getting a lot of good traction here. And the top-bottom program is also, as we mentioned in the past, resonating with larger builders.
If you flip to Slide #11. Plumbing products, our sales were up 12% in the quarter. We did have about $30 million of benefit from foreign currency translation. Without that benefit, we would have been up about 8%. So that was certainly a plus. Margins, as adjusted for rationalization charges, are down from 14.6% to 12%, but I would point out that the hedge impacts these numbers. If we were to exclude the negative $10 million in the third quarter of 2011 and exclude the $4 million positive in the third quarter of 2010, we'd be comparing 14% to 13.3% in terms of margin. We did have unfavorable price/commodity relationship in this segment from the quarter, driven in large part by the hedge. Had we not had the hedge, we would have been a little bit positive. Mix continues to be unfavorable in this segment. That was about $13 million. And we continue to incur cost for some of the programs that we're launching and including faucet programs, as well as plumbing supply-related programs.
If you flip to Slide #12. We continue to invest in brand building, new product development and international growth and feel really good about the traction we're getting in North America in terms of share with the Delta, Peerless and Brizo brands. Also doing a good job from a share standpoint with hot tubs. We continue to extend the Peerless and Delta brands to additional product categories, including tubs, shower surround, bathing systems and hardware. 
And we're really, really proud, if you flip to Slide 13, that Delta was recognized as the WaterSense Partner of the Year brought by the EPA. And again, very proud of that distinction. I think that's the first time that we've been recognized for that award, and certainly very proud of that and certainly appreciate the efforts of our Faucet Delta closet.
If you flip to Slide #14, installation and other services. Net sales were up 8% and I think it's been a while since we were able to make that comments. But we were up 8% in the quarter against lag starts of a negative 5%. So we saw some very good movement there in terms of share gains. Margins continue to be impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationships, and that really relates more to products that we distribute as opposed to products that we install and we had a slight mix negative in the quarter. 
If you flip to Slide #15, we gained share year-over-year. You might remember last year at this time, we talked about maybe being underrepresented in certain areas. We've added some people in terms of sell side of things and that's starting to pay off. We continue to a do really good job on the retrofit side and in fact, we integrated our WellHome business into the Masco Contracting Services business to eliminate some costs and some of overhead, and also to help leverage our capabilities in WellHome as we continue to pursue retrofit opportunities and that's going really, really well for us. We increased our penetration of multi-family and continue to do a good job with the larger builders. And I mentioned earlier that we are divesting businesses at our non-core in terms of diversified products. 
If you flip to Slide #16, decorative architectural products. Sales were down 2% in that segment and I would point out that we continue to be impacted by the loss of the Wal-Mart business, and that affects both paint and builders hardware. And the markets for paint have been relatively soft. I think in the first half of the year, gallons were down about 8%, as I recall and I -- my sense is that's probably continued into the third quarter to a certain degree. 
Commodity pressures continue. We've talked about the issues around TiO2 in terms of availability as well as cost. Resins continue to be a bit of a challenge, but we were neutral in this segment in terms of price/commodity relationship in the quarter. We continue to be impacted by investments, costs that we're incurring for new programs and costs that we're incurring to -- that include international expansion and our pursuit in terms of the professional painter. But a relatively good performance just in terms of overall operating performance in that segment. 
If you flip to Slide 17. We continue to incur near-term costs to expand the top line in both paint and hardware. And we had good traction with the Direct to Pro Program at The Home Depot. We continue to invest in new products and merchandising innovation, and we're focused on international expansion in terms of paint, as I mentioned earlier. Liberty has got some new programs that they'll be launching and we'll be talking more about them -- those in subsequent quarters. And we're really proud that Home Depot recognized Behr in their recent vendor meeting as the ""Partner of the Year"" for the paint department, and a good job by the Behr team there as well.
If you flip to Slide #18, other specialty products. Sales in this segment were up about $2 million and that was really driven by foreign currency translation, which increased sales by $2 million. So essentially flat with our bath. Had a really good performance here in terms of operating profit. We had favorable price/commodity relationships, which are really driven by a reduction in rebates and also had a nice job in this segment from a cost standpoint in terms of profit improvement program. 
And if you flip to Slide #19. We believe that Milgard continues to outperform the Western market in terms of repair/remodel new home construction. We're gaining share. We also continue to expand into Texas and Western Canada, and we've had some really good product introductions. Milgard was recognized by Window & Door magazine for the most innovative new window for a large manufacturer, and we're really pleased with that. We talked earlier about the exit of the glass business. The business in September, the closure of the plants in the October time frame. Our U.K. Window Group continues to do a nice job in terms of share and in fact, it's a little early, but we'll probably be able to talk about a pretty nice win they've got going that's developing for them in terms of a retail opportunity in the next couple of quarters, and we launched at Lowe's the Arrow T50 Elite staple gun.
If you flip to Slide 20. This gives you a little bit of a perspective in terms of the essence windows series, which won the award that I mentioned earlier from Window & Door magazine. We also have come out with some premium colors for our vinyl window and frame offerings. That was really a nice collaboration with Behr. And those premium colors represent an upgrade opportunity for consumers.
If you flip to Slide 21, working capital. We continue to see some good improvement when we take receivables plus inventory less payables and compare that to the last 12 months of sales. We're down from 16.2% last year in the third quarter to 14.8%. We've got a little bit of a tick-up in terms of inventory. We're not overly concerned about that, and we'll probably work part of that down in the fourth quarter. That's offset substantially by improvement in accounts payable days as we continue to aggressively manage our supply chain. I'd like to thank our team across the enterprise for the work they're doing and from a working capital prospective. And also just in terms of some of the other positive things that we've got going in terms of new programs, new products that we're launching, some of the cost takeouts, et cetera. A lot of good work being done across the enterprise.
If you flip to Slide #22. I'd like to make a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. And as I mentioned earlier, market conditions remain very challenging. And for the most part, it was a pretty tough third quarter, no question about that. Having said that, we grew our top line, launched a lot of new products and we believe that we continue to gain share, as I mentioned earlier or at least maintain in our major product categories. As we've previously communicated to you, we'll continue to focus on the things that we have control over, improving our execution, continuing to invest in innovation, leadership brands, global expansion and aggressively managing our cost structure.
Two of our major operational priorities continue to be the improvement of our installation and cabinets business. Earlier this year, we anticipated that we would see aggregate improvement in these segments in terms of reduced operating losses. And at this point, it does not appear that we're going to get there. We anticipated a stronger top line in the second half of 2011, and we might have been a little bit optimistic in terms of market conditions, particularly as it relates to Europe and cabinets.  And while we've successfully completed a lot of key initiatives, as we've discussed in previous calls, we're extremely disappointed that we did not improve the bottom line. As we plan for 2012, we're pushing the businesses in these segments very hard to significantly reduce their breakeven points, irrespective of the economic environment. 
In addition, we now expect to have a negative relationship in terms of price commodities for the year. While we have successfully offset hundreds of millions of dollars in increased commodity costs in 2011, working with suppliers, working on Lean and our supply chain and through pricing actions, we have about $30 million negative price/commodity relationship through the first 9 months. Now that does include the hedge loss in the third quarter, which is I think I mentioned earlier. If we hadn't had the hedge loss, we would have had a positive relationship in the third quarter.  We also had mentioned a little earlier in our last call, lumber, particleboard, finishing material, resins, TiO2 continue to be very challenging. And we'll continue to work hard on these. We've got some good things going on from a supply-chain standpoint, and we expect to see some benefits from that continuing as we go forward.
We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our markets, and we continue to invest in penetrating the North American Cabinet dealer and in terms of that channel and the professional painter, developing international opportunities in paint and plumbing and expanding our leadership position in the do-it-yourself coatings market. We're launching new programs in plumbing cabinets and builders hardware, and we'll continue to discuss those as they develop and mature over time. Obviously, we're incurring some incremental costs to execute on these opportunities but our feeling is they'll add significantly to the top line going forward, and should create good value for our shareholders. 
And with that, Debbie, we'll open up the lines for Q&A."

And again, we'll talk about that in a second in terms of where blue chip is relative to starts, and really pushing them to do everything they can to get as close to breakeven as possible. It's a little bit too early to declare that we think we can get there. We're in our planning process as we speak. We have not reviewed some of the plans and obviously, a part of that is going to be to the extent that we think we can get there, what are some of the things that we might not be able to do that might have some longer-term implications to us. So I -- we're pushing them very, very aggressively. I think the one wild card in cabinets is probably Europe. The environment over there is very, very difficult. And as we've indicated in the past, we've got 2 new leaders there that have been at Moores, and at development in Denmark that have been basically in the businesses now for about 9 or 10 months. And so we're pleased with the folks we have. We've got some additional changes in the leadership teams, but the environment there continues to be very, very difficult. So we're pushing the businesses very hard. My sense is if the blue chip consensus is right relative to housing starts and there are a lot of folks that are very good at projecting that are significantly above the 700,000-unit number for next year, if we get close to that number in terms of starts, I think we've got a real good chance to show some substantial improvement in both of those segments. And I guess for this -- at this point in time, I'd rather not get anymore aggressive than that. We'll be able to give you a better update in February when we get together on the fourth quarter call."

It seems a little bit of a late decision. So what happens at the board meeting with the directors that you now decide after all this time to do it, when it could have been years ago? And, really, the same thing within windows, I mean, closing 4 plants this year, the year ago, the same situation, we exited that. And windows were doing better right, I guess, with the tax credit.

We've put in a new ERP system and these businesses, given their product mix and what they do kind of fallout side of that area, if you will. So from our standpoint, as we looked at opportunities going forward, didn't really feel like they -- we're going to have a lot. We also had a couple of -- on the commercial drywall side, we had a couple of contracts that we recently completed. And those businesses in 2010, in aggregate, were basically profitable as well. And as we think about the market going forward, the opportunities that we have from an installation side, driven more by the installation install, we really think it makes a whole lot more sense to get out of those at this point in time. And again, with the new management team, that was their feel, and we certainly support that. On the windows side, that really is a result of our perspective of the Western market going forward. We have had several plant closings previously in the window category.

The way I would think about that, Mike, is the likelihood is that there maybe -- as we continue to work that, there maybe other branch location opportunities that I would say are more likely than to focus on a particular product group. We have rationalized down to 6 core products: installation, fireplaces, gutters, garage doors and then what we call after paint, which includes mirrors, closet organizers, tubs and things of that nature. So we're, I think, in a pretty good spot now relative to diversified products. My sense is that installation, again, without factoring in the businesses that we're exiting, probably represents about 2/3 of what we installed. Donnie, does that sound about right?"

It's going to our plumbing products in the form of brass, and this is not a brass market. We don't get the hedge accounting treatment on this. So we have to mark-to-market our contract on copper and zinc at the end of every period. So as you think about copper prices for the third quarter of 2011, on average, per pound, they were up 24% versus the third quarter of 2010. Though at the end of the quarter, they fell, they came off their historic -- or near their historic highs, and it came down pretty dramatically on the period-end date. So it's a mark-to-market to a relatively low number. That said, copper since that point in time, is up about 10% since the end of September. As -- so we don't want to commit in copper price of -- metal prices will tend to rise more than fall. So if this does occur, we should recognize gains on these contracts in future periods. So overall, if you think about how much we had right now, as I've said, we got into this last year a little bit. And overall, less than 20% of our metals consumption is currently hedged."

But there's a couple of aspects there that I think are kind of important to understand. We do have service organizations. We've got -- at Behr, we've got a large sales self-service force that is in the field, and they tend to be a fixed number, if you will. We also have the same thing in terms of Masco retail sales service support for Lowe's and we have a sales service support for Home Depot as well. So irrespective -- and generally, those guys are in the stores, working on our sets, our displays, et cetera. And so that's a little bit like kind of a large fixed cost. And the number of stores doesn't change dramatically, and revenue maybe down or up a little bit. But that tends to be a cost that's fairly fixed across the enterprise. Having said that, we have leveraged our sales folks. You might remember last year that we talked a little bit in terms of the installation business that we -- we're maybe underrepresented in a couple of locations, where we didn't have the sales representation that we would have liked to have had. We did add some folks there. We've added some people on the Pro paint side. So as we pursue some of the new opportunities, Bob, my sense is there's a bit of an investments that we'll make in that area. You might have heard me comment earlier to a question, I think, from -- might have been from Sam or somebody about incremental spend on programs that were up about $20 million in the quarter versus last year.

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.And if you would please flip to Slide #",3221,"Thank you, Debbie, and thank all of you for joining us today for Masco's third quarter earnings call. I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. The operating environment for our businesses continues to be challenging as commodity cost pressures, a very competitive retail environment and depressed consumer confidence continue to impact our performance. In this challenging environment, we continue to strengthen our market positions. We believe that we maintained or gain share in our major product categories. We've introduced new products and programs and gotten some very nice industry recognition, which we'll talk about as we work our way through the presentation. And we've taken some additional actions to strengthen our position in several of our markets. 
And if you flip to Slide #4, I want to talk about some of the things that have transpired here over the last couple of months.  As it relates to Milgard, our window business in the Western United States, in September, we exited our glass business.  We also, in October, closed -- announced the closure of 3 of our manufacturing facilities. That's going to cost us, we estimate about $30 million, of which about $5 million will be cash. And we expect to save, on an annual basis, about $7 million, give or take. Those actions, together with some other actions that we've taken in other business units, should result in headcount reductions of about 750 for the period September through the end of the year. Obviously, those continue to be very, very difficult issues, difficult decisions, but certainly necessary in the environment that we're in. 
We also announced in our press release the divestiture of 4 of our non-core diversified products businesses and service businesses in our Installation segment that includes framing, commercial drywall and millwork. Those businesses will show up in our discontinued ops line in the fourth quarter. We'll be restating the prior year  periods. From a modeling perspective, I think you can assume about $100 million of top line in terms of sales and about $20 million of operating losses related to those businesses. Now that operating loss number could move a little bit as we get into some of the detail based on allocations, may be intercompany activity, that type of thing. But again, I think that's pretty good guidance in terms of modeling. 
If you flip to Slide #5, our sales in the quarter were up 3%. We benefited from foreign currency by about $40 million and that basically offsets the planned product exits in cabinets for our ready-to-assemble business, which was a negative 38 in the quarter. If you exclude the rationalization charges, gains on financial investments, impairment charges and normalize our tax rate, our earnings would have been $0.08 a share compared to $0.11 in the third quarter of 2010. We did not include in that reconciliation the impact of the metal hedge. We lost $10 million in the third quarter of 2011. We had income of $4 million in the third quarter of 2010. And again, those are not in the reconciliation of EPS. That cost us about $0.02 in the third quarter of 2011, and eliminating the gain in the third quarter of 2010 would not move the $0.11. It's still rounds to $0.11. On a reported basis, we made $0.10 a share compared to a loss of $0.02 last year, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
And if you flip to Slide #6, please. In terms of gross profit and operating profit, on an adjusted basis, we were down 180 basis points in gross margin, and again that does not include any impact from the hedge. If you were to pro forma the hedge into that adjusted number, the difference would have been about 100 basis points. In terms of operating profit, down 110 basis points, as adjusted on this slide. Again, if we include the hedge impact, that would've narrowed to about 40 basis points, third quarter last year to third quarter this year. 
A couple of additional comments that I'd like to make. International sales were up 4% in local currency and we continue to have double-digit margins there, although down from last year. We've got some negative mix and we'll talk about that when we get to the plumbing segment. Sales to key retail customers were down low-single digit. And if you back out the impact of the product exit, we would have been up low-single digit. And from a trend standpoint, the first quarter on that same basis, again, without the impact of the RTA exiting cabinet, first quarter sales to key retail customers would have been down low-single digits, second quarter would have been flat and third quarter would have been up low-single digit. Now, again, the second half of the year comparisons are a bit easier than the first half this year.
Sales, up $50 million. We expect about $15 million of incremental operating profit. We're down $18 million, so that really suggests about a $33 million shortfall, if you will, on that kind of basis. That's really explained in three different buckets. Price commodity, including the hedge, was negative, slightly below $10 million. Our mix was negative in the quarter, about $16 million and we had program cost. And again, we'll talk about those items as we work our way through the segments. But almost all of that on a net basis is reflected in the Plumbing segment.  
If you flip to Slide #7, a couple of points here. We talked about the reconciled numbers. We also mentioned that the hedge is not in the $0.08 and $0.11, including that would be $0.10 this year versus $0.11 last year. We did have on the pro forma here, we backed out $0.03 of gains from our portfolio of financial investments. We're making a lot of good progress there incidentally, and I think we're down below $100 million in terms of assets on the balance sheet. So we're making very good progress there. 
If you flip to Slide #8,cabinets. We were down 14%. Excluding the planned product exits, we would have been down about 4%, and we had about $8 million benefit in terms of foreign currency translation on the top line. We were able to hold even with sales down, we had no incremental loss. We had a nice job in the quarter related to profit improvement programs. That offset a little bit of unfavorable mix and a modest negative in terms of price/commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide #9, we continue to benefit from the integration of our North American cabinet businesses. We're on track to realize the approximate $35 million-plus of savings by the end of next year. In the retail and dealer channels in North America, still a lot of promotional activity. European markets continue to be very, very challenging for our businesses. Obviously, we're all aware of some of the discussions in Europe relative to Greece and some of the other issues around the European Union, but our businesses are having a difficult time. 
We believe from a share perspective relative to cabinets, that we continue to gain traction in the dealer and big builders segment. We continue to have a bit of a challenge at lower price points in terms of our big-box customers, but did have a very good quarter at the higher end as it relates to the KraftMaid brand at -- for the big-box consumers.  Countertop model continues to gain some traction. 
And if you would flip to Slide #10. We've got some highlights here from 3 programs that we have: 2 with Lowe's, 1 with Home Depot; 1 of the Lowe's program, 1 of the Home Depot programs are for vanities and tops. And getting a lot of good traction here, really working out well for us and for our key customers here. And the vanity programs are really driven more towards bath remodeling, which typically is a little bit smaller project which consumers are a little bit more likely at this point in time in the cycle to undertake as opposed to maybe a major kitchen remodel program. But again, getting a lot of good traction here. And the top-bottom program is also, as we mentioned in the past, resonating with larger builders.
If you flip to Slide #11. Plumbing products, our sales were up 12% in the quarter. We did have about $30 million of benefit from foreign currency translation. Without that benefit, we would have been up about 8%. So that was certainly a plus. Margins, as adjusted for rationalization charges, are down from 14.6% to 12%, but I would point out that the hedge impacts these numbers. If we were to exclude the negative $10 million in the third quarter of 2011 and exclude the $4 million positive in the third quarter of 2010, we'd be comparing 14% to 13.3% in terms of margin. We did have unfavorable price/commodity relationship in this segment from the quarter, driven in large part by the hedge. Had we not had the hedge, we would have been a little bit positive. Mix continues to be unfavorable in this segment. That was about $13 million. And we continue to incur cost for some of the programs that we're launching, including faucet programs, as well as plumbing supply-related programs.
If you flip to Slide #12.  We continue to invest in brand building, new product development and international growth and feel really good about the traction we're getting in North America in terms of share with the Delta, Peerless and Brizo brands.  Also doing a good job from a share standpoint with hot tubs. We continue to extend the Peerless and Delta brands to additional product categories, including tubs, shower surrounds, bathing systems and hardware. 
And we're really, really proud, if you flip to Slide 13, that Delta was recognized as the WaterSense Partner of the Year by the EPA. And again, very proud of that distinction. I think that's the first time that we've been recognized for that award, and certainly very proud of that and certainly appreciate the efforts of our full-set Delta faucet.
If you flip to Slide #14, installation and other services. Net sales were up 8% and I think it's been a while since we were able to make that comment. But we were up 8% in the quarter against lag starts of a negative 5%. So we saw some very good movement there in terms of share gains. Margins continue to be impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationships, and that really relates more to products that we distribute as opposed to products that we install and we had a slight mix negative in the quarter. 
If you flip to Slide #15, we gained share year-over-year. You might remember last year at this time, we talked about maybe being underrepresented in certain areas. We've added some people in terms of sale side of things and that's starting to pay off. We continue to a do really good job on the retrofit side and in fact, we integrated our WellHome business into the Masco Contracting Services business to eliminate some costs and some overhead, and also to help leverage our capabilities in WellHome as we continue to pursue retrofit opportunities and that's going really, really well for us. We increased our penetration of multi-family and continue to do a good job with the larger builders. And I mentioned earlier that we are divesting businesses at our non-core in terms of diversified products. 
If you flip to Slide #16, decorative architectural products. Sales were down 2% in that segment and I would point out that we continue to be impacted by the loss of the Wal-Mart business, and that affects both paint and builders hardware. And the markets for paint have been relatively soft. I think in the first half of the year, gallons were down about 8%, as I recall and I -- my sense is that's probably continued into the third quarter to a certain degree. 
Commodity pressures continue. We've talked about the issues around TiO2 in terms of availability as well as cost. Resins continue to be a bit of a challenge, but we were neutral in this segment in terms of price/commodity relationship in the quarter. We continue to be impacted by investments, costs that we're incurring for new programs and costs that we're incurring to -- that include international expansion and our pursuit in terms of the professional painter. But a relatively good performance just in terms of overall operating performance in that segment. 
If you flip to Slide 17. We continue to incur near-term costs to expand the top line in both paint and hardware. And we had good traction with the Direct to Pro program at The Home Depot. We continue to invest in new products and merchandising innovation, and we're focused on international expansion in terms of paint, as I mentioned earlier. Liberty has got some new programs that they'll be launching and we'll be talking more about them -- those in subsequent quarters. And we're really proud that Home Depot recognized Behr in their recent vendor meeting as the ""Partner of the Year"" for the paint department, and a good job by the Behr team there as well.
If you flip to Slide #18, other specialty products. Sales in this segment were up about $2 million and that was really driven by foreign currency translation, which increased sales by $2 million. So essentially flat with our bath. Had a really good performance here in terms of operating profit. We had favorable price/commodity relationships, which are really driven by a reduction in rebates and also had a nice job in this segment from a cost standpoint in terms of profit improvement program.  
And if you flip to Slide #19. We believe that Milgard continues to outperform the Western markets in terms of repair/remodel new home construction.   We're gaining share. We also continue to expand into Texas and Western Canada, and we've had some really good product introductions. Milgard was recognized by Window & Door magazine for the most innovative new window for a large manufacturer, and we're really pleased with that. We talked earlier about the exit of the glass business. The business in September, the closure of the plants in the October time frame. Our U.K. Window Group continues to do a nice job in terms of share and in fact, it's a little early, but we'll probably be able to talk about a pretty nice win they've got going that's developing for them in terms of a retail opportunity in the next couple of quarters, and we launched at Lowe's the Arrow T50 Elite staple gun.  
If you flip to Slide 20. This gives you a little bit of a perspective in terms of the Essence Windows Series, which won the award that I mentioned earlier from Window & Door magazine. We also have come out with some premium colors for our vinyl window and frame offerings. That was really a nice collaboration with Behr. And those premium colors represent an upgrade opportunity for consumers.
If you flip to Slide 21, working capital. We continue to see some good improvement when we take receivables plus inventory less payables and compare that to the last 12 months of sales. We're down from 16.2% last year in the third quarter to 14.8%. We've got a little bit of a tick-up in terms of inventory. We're not overly concerned about that, and we'll probably work part of that down in the fourth quarter. That's offset substantially by improvement in accounts payable days as we continue to aggressively manage our supply chain. I'd like to thank our team across the enterprise for the work they're doing and from a working capital perspective. And also just in terms of some of the other positive things that we've got going in terms of new programs, new products that we're launching, some of the cost takeouts, et cetera. A lot of good work being done across the enterprise.
If you flip to Slide #22. I'd like to make a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. And as I mentioned earlier, market conditions remain very challenging. And for the most part, it was a pretty tough third quarter, no question about that. Having said that, we grew our top line, launched a lot of new products and we believe that we continue to gain share, as I mentioned earlier or at least maintain in our major product categories. As we've previously communicated to you, we'll continue to focus on the things that we have control over, improving our execution, continuing to invest in innovation, leadership brands, global expansion and aggressively managing our cost structure.
Two of our major operational priorities continue to be the improvement of our Installation and Cabinets business. Earlier this year, we anticipated that we would see aggregate improvement in these segments in terms of reduced operating losses. And at this point, it does not appear that we're going to get there. We anticipated a stronger top line in the second half of 2011, and we might have been a little bit optimistic in terms of market conditions, particularly as it relates to Europe and cabinets.  And while we've successfully completed a lot of key initiatives, as we've discussed in previous calls, we're extremely disappointed that we did not improve the bottom line. As we plan for 2012, we're pushing the businesses in these segments very hard to significantly reduce their break-even points, irrespective of the economic environment. 
In addition, we now expect to have a negative relationship in terms of price commodities for the year. While we have successfully offset hundreds of millions of dollars in increased commodity costs in 2011, working with suppliers, working on Lean and our supply chain and through pricing actions, we have about $30 million negative price/commodity relationship through the first 9 months. Now that does include the hedge loss in the third quarter, which is I think I mentioned earlier. If we hadn't had the hedge loss, we would have had a positive relationship in the third quarter. As we also had mentioned a little earlier in our last call, lumber, particleboard, finishing material, resins, TiO2   continue to be very challenging. And we'll continue to work hard on these. We've got some good things going on from a supply-chain standpoint, and we expect to see some benefits from that continuing as we go forward.
We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our markets, and we continue to invest in penetrating the North American Cabinet Dealer and in terms of that channel and the professional painter, developing international opportunities in paint and plumbing and expanding our leadership position in the do-it-yourself coatings market. We're launching new programs in plumbing, cabinets and builders hardware, and we'll continue to discuss those as they develop and mature over time. Obviously, we're incurring some incremental costs to execute on these opportunities, but our feeling is they'll add significantly to the top line going forward, and should create good value for our shareholders. 
And with that, Debbie, we'll open up the lines for Q&A."

And again, we'll talk about that in a second in terms of where blue chip is relative to starts, and really pushing them to do everything they can to get as close to breakeven as possible. It's a little bit too early to declare that we think we can get there. We're in our planning process as we speak. We have not reviewed some of the plans and obviously, a part of that is going to be to the extent that we think we can get there, what are some of the things that we might not be able to do that might have some longer-term implications to us. So I -- we're pushing them very, very aggressively. I think the one wild card in cabinets is probably Europe. The environment over there is very, very difficult. And as we've indicated in the past, we've got 2 new leaders there that have been -- at Moores,   and at development in Denmark -- that have been basically in the businesses now for about 9 or 10 months. And so we're pleased with the folks we have. We've got some additional changes in the leadership teams, but the environment there continues to be very, very difficult. So we're pushing the businesses very hard. My sense is if the blue chip consensus is right relative to housing starts and there are a lot of folks that are very good at projecting that are significantly above the 700,000-unit number for next year, if we get close to that number in terms of starts, I think we've got a real good chance to show some substantial improvement in both of those segments. And I guess for this -- at this point in time, I'd rather not get anymore aggressive than that. We'll be able to give you a better update in February when we get together on the fourth quarter call."

We've done some good things from a productivity standpoint. We just completed and have -- the launch of the Essence products, which was a new product for us.

And so typically, when you have those kinds of costs, there's an expectation that you're going to get some additional revenue on the top line. So the paybacks, we think, tend to be pretty good.

So I think there's -- that tends to be a little bit more of a discretionary purchase as well. When it gets to plumbing for Hansgrohe, we continue to do a great job of global expansion. We're seeing a lot more pressure from a mix standpoint, as consumers seem to be trading down a little bit for lower price points.

It seems a little bit of a late decision. So what happens at the board meeting with the directors that you now decide after all this time to do it, when it could have been done years ago? And, really, the same thing within windows, I mean, closing 4 plants this year, the year ago, the same situation, we exited that. And windows were doing better right, I guess, with the tax credit. But it just seems like there's a lot of things that you're doing now that could have been done earlier. So what I'm trying to better understand is there even more stuff that can be done that is not being done like selling more of the installation services?  So I'm a little bit surprised about that into some of these late-stage restructurings."

And as you might remember last year, we talked a little bit about rationalizing some of the diversified products that we installed. Basically, at the businesses that we're talking about here, are not really core. We've tried to simplify that business immensely. We've put in a new ERP system and these businesses, given their product mix and what they do kind of fall outside of that area, if you will. So from our standpoint, as we looked at opportunities going forward, didn't really feel like they -- we're going to have a lot. We also had a couple of -- on the commercial drywall side, we had a couple of contracts that we recently completed. And those businesses in 2010, in aggregate, were basically profitable as well. And as we think about the market going forward, the opportunities that we have from an installation side, driven more by the installation install, we really think it makes a whole lot more sense to get out of those at this point in time. And again, with the new management team, that was their feel, and we certainly support that. On the windows side, that really is a result of our perspective of the Western market going forward. We have had several plant closings previously in the window category. But basically, given some of the supply chain work we're doing, some of the work particularly around logistics, distribution and freight, our feeling is that we can service that market with the 6 remaining plants, again, and do that in a way that maintains good lead times as well as service levels."

We've had a little bit in the first quarter and a little bit in the third, but not huge numbers. And in terms of the rest of your question, going forward, we have taken a lot of cost out and as you know, we've completed a lot of initiatives this year. We've completed the common architecture program, ERP system implementation, also the exit of the ready-to-assemble business, as well as the integration of the 2 businesses continuing to be on track. We do anticipate some additional profit improvement next year from a cost-reduction standpoint that I would guess, just if we look at -- and again, we haven't gone through the plan yet, but my sense is it would probably be similar to what we've done this year, somewhere in that $40 million to $50 million range, where they've been the last couple 3 years.

It's going to our plumbing products in the form of brass, and this is not a brass market. We don't get the hedge accounting treatment on this. So we have to mark-to-market our contract on copper and zinc at the end of every period. So as you think about copper prices for the third quarter of 2011, on average, per pound, they were up 24% versus the third quarter of 2010. Though at the end of the quarter, they fell, they came off their historic -- or near historic highs, and it came down pretty dramatically on the period-end date. So it's a mark-to-market to a relatively low number. That said, copper since that point in time, is up about 10% since the end of September. As -- so we don't want to commit in copper price of -- metal prices will tend to rise more than fall. So if this does occur, we should recognize gains on these contracts in future periods.

But there are a couple of aspects there that I think are kind of important to understand. We do have service organizations. We've got -- at Behr, we've got a large sales service force that is in the field, and they tend to be a fixed number, if you will. We also have the same thing in terms of Masco retail sales service support for Lowe's, and we have a sales service support for Home Depot as well. So irrespective -- and generally, those guys are in the stores, working on our sets, our displays, et cetera. And so that's a little bit like kind of a large fixed cost. And the number of stores doesn't change dramatically, and revenue may be down or up a little bit. But that tends to be a cost that's fairly fixed across the enterprise. Having said that, we have leveraged our sales folks. You might remember last year that we talked a little bit in terms of the installation business that we -- we're maybe underrepresented in a couple of locations, where we didn't have the sales representation that we would have liked to have had. We did add some folks there. We've added some people on the Pro paint side. So as we pursue some of the new opportunities, Bob, my sense is there's a bit of an investment that we'll make in that area.

I'm joined by Donnie Demarie, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; and John Sznewajs, our CFO.
And if you would please flip to Slide #3. The operating environment for our businesses continues to be challenging as commodity cost pressures, a very competitive retail environment and depressed consumer confidence continue to impact our performance. In this challenging environment, we continue to strengthen our market positions. We believe that we maintained or gain share in our major product categories. We've introduced new products and programs and gotten some very nice industry recognition, which we'll talk about as we work our way through the presentation. And we've taken some additional actions to strengthen our position in several of our markets. 
And if you flip to Slide #4, I want to talk about some of the things that have transpired here over the last couple of months.  As it relates to Milgard, our window business in the Western United States, in September, we exited our glass business.  We also, in October, closed -- announced the closure of 3 of our manufacturing facilities. That's going to cost us, we estimate about $30 million, of which about $5 million will be cash. And we expect to save, on an annual basis, about $7 million, give or take. Those actions, together with some other actions that we've taken in other business units, should result in headcount reductions of about 750 for the period September through the end of the year. Obviously, those continue to be very, very difficult issues, difficult decisions, but certainly necessary in the environment that we're in. 
We also announced in our press release the divestiture of 4 of our non-core diversified products businesses and service businesses in our Installation segment that includes framing, commercial drywall and millwork. Those businesses will show up in our discontinued ops line in the fourth quarter. We'll be restating the prior year  periods. From a modeling perspective, I think you can assume about $100 million of top line in terms of sales and about $20 million of operating losses related to those businesses. Now that operating loss number could move a little bit as we get into some of the detail based on allocations, may be intercompany activity, that type of thing. But again, I think that's pretty good guidance in terms of modeling. 
If you flip to Slide #5, our sales in the quarter were up 3%. We benefited from foreign currency by about $40 million and that basically offsets the planned product exits in cabinets for our ready-to-assemble business, which was a negative 38 in the quarter. If you exclude the rationalization charges, gains on financial investments, impairment charges and normalize our tax rate, our earnings would have been $0.08 a share compared to $0.11 in the third quarter of 2010. We did not include in that reconciliation the impact of the metal hedge. We lost $10 million in the third quarter of 2011. We had income of $4 million in the third quarter of 2010. And again, those are not in the reconciliation of EPS. That cost us about $0.02 in the third quarter of 2011, and eliminating the gain in the third quarter of 2010 would not move the $0.11. It's still rounds to $0.11. On a reported basis, we made $0.10 a share compared to a loss of $0.02 last year, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. 
And if you flip to Slide #6, please. In terms of gross profit and operating profit, on an adjusted basis, we were down 180 basis points in gross margin, and again that does not include any impact from the hedge. If you were to pro forma the hedge into that adjusted number, the difference would have been about 100 basis points. In terms of operating profit, down 110 basis points, as adjusted on this slide. Again, if we include the hedge impact, that would've narrowed to about 40 basis points, third quarter last year to third quarter this year. 
A couple of additional comments that I'd like to make. International sales were up 4% in local currency and we continue to have double-digit margins there, although down from last year. We've got some negative mix and we'll talk about that when we get to the plumbing segment. Sales to key retail customers were down low-single digit. And if you back out the impact of the product exit, we would have been up low-single digit. And from a trend standpoint, the first quarter on that same basis, again, without the impact of the RTA exiting cabinet, first quarter sales to key retail customers would have been down low-single digits, second quarter would have been flat and third quarter would have been up low-single digit. Now, again, the second half of the year comparisons are a bit easier than the first half this year.
Sales, up $50 million. We expect about $15 million of incremental operating profit. We're down $18 million, so that really suggests about a $33 million shortfall, if you will, on that kind of basis. That's really explained in 3 different buckets. Price commodity, including the hedge, was negative, slightly below $10 million. Our mix was negative in the quarter, about $16 million and we had program cost. And again, we'll talk about those items as we work our way through the segments. But almost all of that on a net basis is reflected in the plumbing segment.  
If you flip to Slide #7, a couple of points here. We talked about the reconciled numbers. We also mentioned that the hedge is not in the $0.08 and $0.11, including that would be $0.10 this year versus $0.11 last year. We did have on the pro forma here, we backed out $0.03 of gains from our portfolio of financial investments. We're making a lot of good progress there incidentally, and I think we're down below $100 million in terms of assets on the balance sheet. So we're making very good progress there. 
If you flip to Slide #8, cabinets. We were down 14%. Excluding the planned product exits, we would have been down about 4%, and we had about $8 million benefit in terms of foreign currency translation on the top line. We were able to hold even with sales down, we had no incremental loss. We had a nice job in the quarter related to profit improvement programs. That offset a little bit of unfavorable mix and a modest negative in terms of price/commodity relationships. 
If you flip to Slide #9, we continue to benefit from the integration of our North American cabinet businesses. We're on track to realize the approximate $35 million-plus of savings by the end of next year. In the retail and dealer channels in North America, still a lot of promotional activity. European markets continue to be very, very challenging for our businesses. Obviously, we're all aware of some of the discussions in Europe relative to Greece and some of the other issues around the European Union, but our businesses are having a difficult time. 
We believe from a share perspective relative to cabinets, that we continue to gain traction in the dealer and big builders segment. We continue to have a bit of a challenge at lower price points in terms of our big-box customers, but did have a very good quarter at the higher end as it relates to the KraftMaid brand at -- for the big-box consumers.  Countertop model continues to gain some traction. 
And if you would flip to Slide #10. We've got some highlights here from 3 programs that we have: 2 with Lowe's, 1 with Home Depot; 1 of the Lowe's program, 1 of the Home Depot programs are for vanities and tops. And getting a lot of good traction here, really working out well for us and for our key customers here. And the vanity programs are really driven more towards bath remodeling, which typically is a little bit smaller project which consumers are a little bit more likely at this point in time in the cycle to undertake as opposed to maybe a major kitchen remodel program. But again, getting a lot of good traction here. And the top-bottom program is also, as we mentioned in the past, resonating with larger builders.
If you flip to Slide #11. Plumbing products, our sales were up 12% in the quarter. We did have about $30 million of benefit from foreign currency translation. Without that benefit, we would have been up about 8%. So that was certainly a plus. Margins, as adjusted for rationalization charges, are down from 14.6% to 12%, but I would point out that the hedge impacts these numbers. If we were to exclude the negative $10 million in the third quarter of 2011 and exclude the $4 million positive in the third quarter of 2010, we'd be comparing 14% to 13.3% in terms of margin. We did have unfavorable price/commodity relationship in this segment from the quarter, driven in large part by the hedge. Had we not had the hedge, we would have been a little bit positive. Mix continues to be unfavorable in this segment. That was about $13 million. And we continue to incur cost for some of the programs that we're launching, including faucet programs, as well as plumbing supply-related programs.
If you flip to Slide #12.  We continue to invest in brand building, new product development and international growth and feel really good about the traction we're getting in North America in terms of share with the Delta, Peerless and Brizo brands.  Also doing a good job from a share standpoint with hot tubs. We continue to extend the Peerless and Delta brands to additional product categories, including tubs, shower surrounds, bathing systems and hardware. 
And we're really, really proud, if you flip to Slide 13, that Delta was recognized as the WaterSense Partner of the Year by the EPA. And again, very proud of that distinction. I think that's the first time that we've been recognized for that award, and certainly very proud of that and certainly appreciate the efforts of our full-set Delta faucet.
If you flip to Slide #14, installation and other services. Net sales were up 8% and I think it's been a while since we were able to make that comment. But we were up 8% in the quarter against lag starts of a negative 5%. So we saw some very good movement there in terms of share gains. Margins continue to be impacted by unfavorable price/commodity relationships, and that really relates more to products that we distribute as opposed to products that we install and we had a slight mix negative in the quarter. 
If you flip to Slide #15, we gained share year-over-year. You might remember last year at this time, we talked about maybe being underrepresented in certain areas. We've added some people in terms of sale side of things and that's starting to pay off. We continue to a do really good job on the retrofit side and in fact, we integrated our WellHome business into the Masco contracting services business to eliminate some costs and some overhead, and also to help leverage our capabilities in WellHome as we continue to pursue retrofit opportunities and that's going really, really well for us. We increased our penetration of multi-family and continue to do a good job with the larger builders. And I mentioned earlier that we are divesting businesses at our non-core in terms of diversified products. 
If you flip to Slide #16, decorative architectural products. Sales were down 2% in that segment and I would point out that we continue to be impacted by the loss of the Wal-Mart business, and that affects both paint and builders hardware. And the markets for paint have been relatively soft. I think in the first half of the year, gallons were down about 8%, as I recall and I -- my sense is that's probably continued into the third quarter to a certain degree. 
Commodity pressures continue. We've talked about the issues around TiO2 in terms of availability as well as cost. Resins continue to be a bit of a challenge, but we were neutral in this segment in terms of price/commodity relationship in the quarter. We continue to be impacted by investments, costs that we're incurring for new programs and costs that we're incurring to -- that include international expansion and our pursuit in terms of the professional painter. But a relatively good performance just in terms of overall operating performance in that segment. 
If you flip to Slide 17. We continue to incur near-term costs to expand the top line in both paint and hardware. And we had good traction with the Direct to Pro program at The Home Depot. We continue to invest in new products and merchandising innovation, and we're focused on international expansion in terms of paint, as I mentioned earlier. Liberty has got some new programs that they'll be launching and we'll be talking more about them -- those in subsequent quarters. And we're really proud that Home Depot recognized Behr in their recent vendor meeting as the ""Partner of the Year"" for the paint department, and a good job by the Behr team there as well.
If you flip to Slide #18, other specialty products. Sales in this segment were up about $2 million and that was really driven by foreign currency translation, which increased sales by $2 million. So essentially flat with our bath. Had a really good performance here in terms of operating profit. We had favorable price/commodity relationships, which are really driven by a reduction in rebates and also had a nice job in this segment from a cost standpoint in terms of profit improvement program.  
And if you flip to Slide #19. We believe that Milgard continues to outperform the Western markets in terms of repair/remodel new home construction.   We're gaining share. We also continue to expand into Texas and Western Canada, and we've had some really good product introductions. Milgard was recognized by Window & Door magazine for the most innovative new window for a large manufacturer, and we're really pleased with that. We talked earlier about the exit of the glass business. The business in September, the closure of the plants in the October time frame. Our U.K. Window Group continues to do a nice job in terms of share and in fact, it's a little early, but we'll probably be able to talk about a pretty nice win they've got going that's developing for them in terms of a retail opportunity in the next couple of quarters, and we launched at Lowe's the Arrow T50 Elite staple gun.  
If you flip to Slide 20. This gives you a little bit of a perspective in terms of the Essence Windows Series, which won the award that I mentioned earlier from Window & Door magazine. We also have come out with some premium colors for our vinyl window and frame offerings. That was really a nice collaboration with Behr. And those premium colors represent an upgrade opportunity for consumers.
If you flip to Slide 21, working capital. We continue to see some good improvement when we take receivables plus inventory less payables and compare that to the last 12 months of sales. We're down from 16.2% last year in the third quarter to 14.8%. We've got a little bit of a tick-up in terms of inventory. We're not overly concerned about that, and we'll probably work part of that down in the fourth quarter. That's offset substantially by improvement in accounts payable days as we continue to aggressively manage our supply chain. I'd like to thank our team across the enterprise for the work they're doing and from a working capital perspective. And also just in terms of some of the other positive things that we've got going in terms of new programs, new products that we're launching, some of the cost takeouts, et cetera. A lot of good work being done across the enterprise.
If you flip to Slide #22. I'd like to make a couple of comments before we move to Q&A. And as I mentioned earlier, market conditions remain very challenging. And for the most part, it was a pretty tough third quarter, no question about that. Having said that, we grew our top line, launched a lot of new products and we believe that we continue to gain share, as I mentioned earlier or at least maintain in our major product categories. As we've previously communicated to you, we'll continue to focus on the things that we have control over, improving our execution, continuing to invest in innovation, leadership brands, global expansion and aggressively managing our cost structure.
Two of our major operational priorities continue to be the improvement of our Installation and cabinets business. Earlier this year, we anticipated that we would see aggregate improvement in these segments in terms of reduced operating losses. And at this point, it does not appear that we're going to get there. We anticipated a stronger top line in the second half of 2011, and we might have been a little bit optimistic in terms of market conditions, particularly as it relates to Europe and cabinets.  And while we've successfully completed a lot of key initiatives, as we've discussed in previous calls, we're extremely disappointed that we did not improve the bottom line. As we plan for 2012, we're pushing the businesses in these segments very hard to significantly reduce their break-even points, irrespective of the economic environment. 
In addition, we now expect to have a negative relationship in terms of price commodities for the year. While we have successfully offset hundreds of millions of dollars in increased commodity costs in 2011, working with suppliers, working on Lean and our supply chain and through pricing actions, we have about $30 million negative price/commodity relationship through the first 9 months. Now that does include the hedge loss in the third quarter, which is I think I mentioned earlier. If we hadn't had the hedge loss, we would have had a positive relationship in the third quarter. As we also had mentioned a little earlier in our last call, lumber, particleboard, finishing material, resins, TiO2   continue to be very challenging. And we'll continue to work hard on these. We've got some good things going on from a supply-chain standpoint, and we expect to see some benefits from that continuing as we go forward.
We continue to be confident in the long-term fundamentals for our markets, and we continue to invest in penetrating the North American cabinet dealer and in terms of that channel and the professional painter, developing international opportunities in paint and plumbing and expanding our leadership position in the do-it-yourself coatings market. We're launching new programs in plumbing, cabinets and builders hardware, and we'll continue to discuss those as they develop and mature over time. Obviously, we're incurring some incremental costs to execute on these opportunities, but our feeling is they'll add significantly to the top line going forward, and should create good value for our shareholders. 
And with that, Debbie, we'll open up the lines for Q&A."

And again, we'll talk about that in a second in terms of where blue chip is relative to starts, and really pushing them to do everything they can to get as close to breakeven as possible. It's a little bit too early to declare that we think we can get there. We're in our planning process as we speak. We have not reviewed some of the plans and obviously, a part of that is going to be to the extent that we think we can get there, what are some of the things that we might not be able to do that might have some longer-term implications to us. So I -- we're pushing them very, very aggressively. I think the one wild card in cabinets is probably Europe. The environment over there is very, very difficult. And as we've indicated in the past, we've got 2 new leaders there that have been -- at Moores,   and at development in Denmark -- that have been basically in the businesses now for about 9 or 10 months. And so we're pleased with the folks we have. We've got some additional changes in the leadership teams, but the environment there continues to be very, very difficult. So we're pushing the businesses very hard. My sense is if the blue chip consensus is right relative to housing starts and there are a lot of folks that are very good at projecting that are significantly above the 700,000-unit number for next year, if we get close to that number in terms of starts, I think we've got a real good chance to show some substantial improvement in both of those segments. And I guess for this -- at this point in time, I'd rather not get anymore aggressive than that. We'll be able to give you a better update in February when we get together on the fourth quarter call."

And then as we enter some of the emerging markets, that tends to be at a little lower price point as well. Yes, I wouldn't say necessarily, I mean, it's always been competitive. And I don't know that I would say it's ratcheted up any more so than it has been in the past. But they've continue to do a very good job from that perspective. I mentioned our U.K. window business, we continue to take share there. And as I mentioned, we've got a really neat opportunity coming up that we think we're going to win, and we'll be able to talk a little bit more probably in February. But other than that, that pretty much covers the landscape, I think."

And it seems to me that now, at this stage of the downturn to first be deciding to divest out of those non-core Installation Services businesses is a bit surprising because you've stuck with it this long. It seems a little bit of a late decision. So what happens at the board meeting with the directors that you now decide after all this time to do it, when it could have been done years ago? And, really, the same thing within windows, I mean, closing 4 plants this year, the year ago, the same situation, we exited that. And windows were doing better right, I guess, with the tax credit. But it just seems like there's a lot of things that you're doing now that could have been done earlier.

And as you might remember last year, we talked a little bit about rationalizing some of the diversified products that we installed. Basically, at the businesses that we're talking about here, are not really core. We've tried to simplify that business immensely. We've put in a new ERP system and these businesses, given their product mix and what they do kind of fall outside of that area, if you will. So from our standpoint, as we looked at opportunities going forward, didn't really feel like they -- we're going to have a lot. We also had a couple of -- on the commercial drywall side, we had a couple of contracts that we recently completed. And those businesses in 2010, in aggregate, were basically profitable as well. And as we think about the market going forward, the opportunities that we have from an installation side, driven more by the installation install, we really think it makes a whole lot more sense to get out of those at this point in time. And again, with the new management team, that was their feel, and we certainly support that. On the windows side, that really is a result of our perspective of the Western market going forward. We have had several plant closings previously in the window category. But basically, given some of the supply chain work we're doing, some of the work particularly around logistics, distribution and freight, our feeling is that we can service that market with the 6 remaining plants, again, and do that in a way that maintains good lead times as well as service levels."

And in terms of the rest of your question, going forward, we have taken a lot of cost out and as you know, we've completed a lot of initiatives this year. We've completed the common architecture program, ERP system implementation, also the exit of the ready-to-assemble business, as well as the integration of the 2 businesses continuing to be on track. We do anticipate some additional profit improvement next year from a cost-reduction standpoint that I would guess, just if we look at -- and again, we haven't gone through the plan yet, but my sense is it would probably be similar to what we've done this year, somewhere in that $40 million to $50 million range, where they've been the last couple 3 years.

Though at the end of the quarter, they fell, they came off their historic -- or near historic highs, and it came down pretty dramatically on the period-end date. So it's a mark-to-market to a relatively low number. That said, copper since that point in time, is up about 10% since the end of September. As -- so we don't want to commit in copper price of -- metal prices will tend to rise more than fall. So if this does occur, we should recognize gains on these contracts in future periods.

So irrespective -- and generally, those guys are in the stores, working on our sets, our displays, et cetera. And so that's a little bit like kind of a large fixed cost. And the number of stores doesn't change dramatically, and revenue may be down or up a little bit. But that tends to be a cost that's fairly fixed across the enterprise. Having said that, we have leveraged our sales folks. You might remember last year that we talked a little bit in terms of the installation business that we -- we're maybe underrepresented in a couple of locations, where we didn't have the sales representation that we would have liked to have had. We did add some folks there. We've added some people on the Pro paint side. So as we pursue some of the new opportunities, Bob, my sense is there's a bit of an investment that we'll make in that area. You may have heard me comment earlier to a question, I think, from -- might have been from Sam or somebody about incremental spend on programs that were up about $20 million in the quarter versus last year. And my sense is, I think, on a year-to-date basis, that number might be around $50 million, John?"

So we do incur expense for new opportunities, sometimes those don't hit the top line in the same period. But you can rest assure that when you look at some of the headcount reductions that we've made across the company over the last several years, a lot of that has been in the SG&A category. And I think as things start to pick up a little bit, there should be some really good leveraging opportunities for us."

And if you factored out the hedge impact from both years, last year, we had $4 million of gains, this year, $10 million of loss. You'd be comparing 14% last year in the third quarter to 13.3% this year. And so we'd only be down 70 basis points in the segment. And that is really driven primarily by mix, which I think I mentioned was about $13 million negative in the quarter versus last year. And also some program costs that, as I recall, represented about $7 million.
Okay. Thank you, Bob. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We appreciate it and take care."
