Our discussion today will reference the earnings release that we issued earlier, along with the slide presentation titled Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Financial Review and Analysis. Both documents were furnished today with our 8-K and posted at the Investors section of our website at www.investors.averydennison.com. We remind you that these results are preliminary, as we have not yet filed our 10-K.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes interest expense, restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. 
Restructuring charges and integration transition costs tend to be fairly discreet in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. These numbers are reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty. The Safe Harbor statement included in the documents that we've provided today, along with our 2009 Form 10-K and 2010 Form 10-Q, address certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations.

We delivered on all key measures for the full year and we made progress on our longer-term goals as well. We saw strong top line growth in our two largest segments, Pressure-sensit",830,"Thanks, Eric, and hello, everyone. 2010 was a year of solid improvement. We delivered on all key measures for the full year and we made progress on our longer-term goals as well. 
We saw strong top line growth in our two largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services, which more than offset the decline in Office and Consumer Products. Both segments benefited from our strong position in emerging markets and an increased focus on marketing to end customers.
We expanded margin year-over-year. However, margin came under pressure in the second half of the year as raw material inflation outpaced price increases. While we narrowed the gap in the fourth quarter, we didn't close it. Our number one priority right now is to close that gap in the face of additional inflation by raising prices as well as accelerating material substitutions and taking productivity actions.
The highlight of the year was our improved financial strength. We generated $379 million of free cash flow, which we used to reduce debt by nearly $300 million, exceeding our targeted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The rating agencies have improved their outlooks. We also contributed more than required to our pension plans, $78 million, and continued to invest in growth and in infrastructure.
Putting ourselves in a position to return more cash to shareholders were the key objective for 2010, and we achieved our goal. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, and we have a new authorization per share repurchases.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares, offsetting dilution, and the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares. Now turning to the businesses.
Pressure-sensitive Materials had low double-digit organic sales growth with strength in all regions. Operating margin was up year-over-year but down sequentially as inflation continue to pressure margin. As I've said, we ended the year with a gap between price and raw material cost, and we intend to close not only with price increases but with material substitutions and productivity.
During the year, we saw the benefits of our investments in end-user marketing to specific segments such as food, beverage, pharma and durables. We built a large pipeline of projects with end users to accelerate the conversion to Pressure-sensitive for alternative forms. And as a result, we're capturing new business.
Our Roll Materials business announced two significant innovations last year. One is the new system for labeling curved surfaces, and the other is a new product platform that uses dramatically thinner liner materials that are lower cost and more sustainable. And our Graphics and Reflective Products business launched a new line of films for digital printers that are best in class. 
I'm very pleased with the progress Retail Information Services made last year. RIS delivered much stronger sales growth through dramatic improvements in service and quality. Margin improved as we saw the benefit of increased volumes on lower fixed costs.
We're starting to deliver on our value proposition to retailers and brand owners who responded very positively to the products and solutions we launched last year. RIS has further to go, but it's starting to realize its potential for sales growth and margin expansion. And although small, an important part of the long-term RIS success story is our RFID, shipments in that area of RFID inlays for apparel nearly doubled over last year, and we expect continued strong growth in 2011.
Office and Consumer Products here turned out as expected given the continued weakness in white-collar employment and the impact of new competition. We executed a solid December of our Labels business. We also invested in innovation and created a pipeline of new products that should be visible at Retail in the back half of 2011. 
In summary, we exceeded our targets for the year. Our employees did a great job executing on our strategies by serving customers well. And I'm really pleased to be in a position to deliver increased cash to shareholders.
For 2011, our business priorities are as follows. First, close the price inflation gap. We have a long history of recovering inflation-related margin loss over the cycle and fully expect to follow that pattern again, while further improve our IAS market position as well as sales and margin. We will continue to drive the conversion the Pressure-sensitive Materials in key segments with innovative new solutions, and we'll continue to invest in the turnaround of Office Products and start generating sales out of these new product pipeline.
We expect that capital expense will be higher in 2011, about $175 million, but still significantly below our depreciation rate and our run rate prior to the recession. Our priorities for capital are disciplined investment organic growth especially in emerging markets and ramping up the IT infrastructure investments that we deferred during the recession. 
Finally, we remain focused on generating strong free cash flow to support these investments and to return more cash to shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Mitch."
252978,116810685,98119,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 6 and talking to the Slide 9. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%.

Starting with Slide 6 and talking to the Slide 9. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%. As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services again delivered solid growth in all regions and more than offset the decline in Office Products. 
Our operating margin increased from the fourth quarter as expected to 5.9% as a benefit of higher volume more than offset the impact of the price inflation gap, reduced margin in Office Products and increased investments in growth in infrastructure. While raw materials came in the fourth quarter pretty much as expected, inflationary pressure did tick up in December, and that pressure has carried into this year. 
We previously said that we anticipated narrowing the price inflation gap early in 2011. The continued rise in raw material cost, however, has further delayed the timing of when we expect to close the price inflation gap. This inflation affects all of our segments. The majority of it though is in Pressure-sensitive Materials and the Other Specialty Converting businesses. we'll provide more color on that in a moment.
Before getting into the segments, I'd like to point out that the discrete tax planning event that we flagged in October came in at $0.42. This benefit will be realized through lower cash tax payments over the coming years. And without this benefit, our effective tax rate for the year would've been 23%.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 11%, driven primarily by volume gains in all regions of our Raw Materials business. While PSM's operating margin in the quarter was up 30 basis points year-over-year, margin versus the third quarter was down half a point due to the raw material inflation. 
The inflation that we're currently facing is primarily due to the rising cost of adhesive components, which is being driven by higher commodity prices as well as supplier capacity constraints. We are managing our global vendor network up this mitigate is it ablation seeking sensitive materials reduce costs, driving further productivity and working to offset the rest with price increases. In fact, we're planning around a price increases for the spring and this is on top of those that we just implemented. We're confident that the margin will expand from its current level in Pressure-sensitive as the combination of pricing and other protective measures offset rising input costs. 
Retail Information Services finished the year with organic sales growth of 11% in the quarter. This business, which was hit hard during the recession due to retail inventory destocking, is making great progress on the top and bottom lines. We are clearly building momentum in the marketplace, and with a strong operating leverage in this business, expect continued margin expansion as we grow. We've demonstrated this over the past year and operating margin Corp. focus on order in the early six points for the full year.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the fourth quarter reflected weak end-market demand and increased competition in the labels category. As expected, Office Products operating margins declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotions, investments in growth and lower volume. We've previously discussed the competitive situation here, and our strategy is to reverse the trajectory of the business. So the margins remained under pressure and actually further eroded in the near term as we feel a full effect of actions taken last year to defend our position in the labels category as well as investments in innovation.
Our Other Specialty Converting businesses again had solid sales growth in Q4, and margins have improved as a result of the benefit of increased volume and productivity gains. Now while margins improved, the overall margins for this collection of business has remained in the red in Q4 due primarily to the price inflation gap.
Moving to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 13, we've highlighted the key factors are looking at the door been out cash flow 2011. Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. 
We estimate organic revenue growth of approximately 6%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments in growth as well as some lift in pricing actions. Based on the estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, we expect adjusted EPS of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 million to $350 million.  
This guidance assumes $140 million to $150 million of inflation. As I said earlier, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, driving further productivity and planning additional price increases. That said, the uncertainty of about the timing of when we closed the price inflation gap is one of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. 
Now let me highlight some of the other key considerations affecting our guidance.  As mentioned earlier, we expect the operating margin and the Office and Consumer Products business to further erode in 2011 before rebounding. We anticipate Q1 EPS as a percent of full year earnings to be on the lower side of historical norms, that is, close to 15% of full year earnings. This is due to tougher comps and office product and the timing of the presentation gap in Pressure-sensitive as well as the fact that it is a seasonally lowest quarter for RIS. we expect that our ongoing pension expenses will be less than last year, reflecting changes made to our U.S. retirement plan, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $175 million.
This is well below D&A and the low prerecession levels. Our disciplined approach to capital management number Lean Sigma production effort should enable us to contribute to invest below D&A for the future.
Overall, we are confident our position and prospects and with good reason. Were expecting another year of solid revenue growth in 2011, driven by momentum in emerging markets and Retail Information Services. We expect to close the price inflation gap in Pressure-sensitive and CPS margin expense. RIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom lines. On a constant-tax basis, we expect 8% to 20% earnings growth in 2011 and free cash flow remain strong 
Given the strength of our balance sheet, we shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction returning to returning more cash to shareholders. We reduced net debt to less than 2x EBITDA, and both rating agencies recently indicated improved sentiment of our financial strength. This raising the dividend and buying back stock, great indicators our confidence and financial strength and growth prospects.  I'll now turn it over to questions."

I think last year, the label converters were getting fatigued by the price increases. And I believe it's because many of them, during 2010, were kind of locked in to fixed-price contracts for the year with a number of their customers across many sectors. And we've done, I think, the best we could in educating their marketplaces. That's not really a good idea in this environment. So my sense in talking to a lot of label converters is that they're reluctant now to sign up for full year price guarantees, because we can give them any kind of protection on raw material inflation. So I think 2011 will be a bit of a different game for most label converters. For my perspective, the innovation in the marketplace is really being driven by our end-user marketing efforts in terms of coming up with new solutions, like the Kirby container product and a thinner liner material innovation, which allows us to explore other types of applications that typically have not been pressure sensitive. Well, we've got a number of innovations that we'll be launching later this year at Labelexpo. So yes, I think 2010 was a tough year, but I think people now in the industry realize that this inflation is going to be with us for a while.

We remind you that these results are preliminary as we've not yet filed our 10-Q.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes interest expense, restructuring, and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency, and timing.
In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on pre-tax results before their effect and before interest expense. These numbers are reconciled with GAAP in schedules A2 to A5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty.]

We delivered on all key measures for the full year and we made progress on our longer term goals as well.
We say strong top-line growth in our two largest segment, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services, which more than offset the decline in office and consumer products. Both segments benefited from our strong position in emerging markets and an increased focus on marketing to end customers.
We expanded margins year-over-year. However, margins came under pressure in the second half of the year as raw material inflation outpaced price increases.
While we narrowed the gap in the fourth quarter, we didn’t close it. Our number one priority right now is to close that gap in the face of additional inflation, by raising prices, as well as accelerating material substitution and taking productivity actions.
The highlight of the year was our improved financial strength. We generated $379 million of free cash flow, which we used to reduce debt by nearly $300 million, exceeding our targeted net debt to EBITDA ratio. The radiation team hasn’t proved their outlook.
We also contributed more than required to our action plan $78 million and continued to invest in growth and in infrastructure. Putting ourselves in a position to return more cash to shareholders was a key objective for 2010.and we achieved our goal. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25% and we have a new authorization per share repurchases.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchase 3 million shares, offsetting dilution and the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares.
Now, turning to the businesses, pressure sensitive materials had low double digit organic sales growth with strength in all regions. Operating margins was up year-over-year, but down sequentially as inflation continued to pressure margins. As I said, the end of the year was a gap between price and raw material costs that we intend to close not only with price increases but with material substitution and productivity.
During the year, we saw the benefits of our investments in end user marketing to specific segments such as food, beverage, pharma and durables. We built a large pipeline of projects with end users to accelerate the conversion to pressure sensitive from alternative forms of packaged decoration. And as a result, we’re capturing new business.
Our raw materials business announced two significant innovations last year. One is a new system for labeling curved surfaces and the other is a new product platform that uses dramatically thinner liner materials that are lower cost and more sustainable.
And our graphics and reflective products business launched a new line of films for digital printers that are best in class. I am very pleased with the progress retail information services made last year. RIS delivered much stronger sales growth through dramatic improvements in service and quality. Margin improved as we saw the benefit of increased volumes on board this cost.
We are starting to deliver on our value proposition to retailers and brand owners who responded very positively to the products and solutions we launched last year. RIS has further to go but it’s starting to realize its potential for sales growth and margin expansion.
And although small, an important part of the long term RIS success story is RFID. Shipments in the year of RFID inlaying for apparel nearly doubled over last year. And we expect continued strong growth in 2011.
Our office and consumer products here turned out as expected given the continued weakness in white collar employment and the impact of new competition. We executed the solid defense of our labels business. We also invested in innovation and created a pipeline of new products that should be visible at retail in the back half of 2011.
In summary we exceeded our targets for the year. Our employees did a great job executing on our strategy by serving customers well. And I am really pleased to be in a position to deliver increased cash to share holders.
For 2011, our business priorities are as follows. First, close the price inflation gap. We had a long history of recovering inflation related margin loss over the cycle and we expect to follow that pattern again.
We’ll further improve our AFS market position as well as sales and margin. We’ll continue to drive the conversion to Pressure Sensitive materials in key segments with innovative new solutions. And we’ll continue to invest in the turnaround of Office Products and start generating sales out of this new product pipeline.
We expect that capital expense will be higher in 2011 about $175 million but still significantly below our depreciation range and our run rate prior to the recession. Our priorities for capital are disciplined investments for organic growth especially in emerging markets and ramping up the IT infrastructure investment that we deferred during the recession.
Finally, we remained focused on generating strong free cash flow to support the investment and to return more cash to shareholders.
Now I’ll turn it over to Mitch.

252978,116810685,98169,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with slide six and talking through to slide nine. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%. As Dean mentioned, Pressure Sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services again delivered solid growth in all regions",1141,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with slide six and talking through to slide nine. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%. As Dean mentioned, Pressure Sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services again delivered solid growth in all regions and more than offset the decline in office products.
Our operating margin increased in the fourth quarter as expected to 5.9%, as the benefit of higher volume was more than offset the impact of the price inflation gap, reduced margin in Office Products and increased investments in growth and infrastructure.
While raw materials came in the fourth quarter pretty much as expected, inflationary pressure did pick up in December and that pressure has carried into this year. We previously said that we anticipated narrowing the price inflation gap early in 2011. The continued rise in raw material cost however, has further delayed the timing of when we expect to close the price inflation gap.
This inflation affects all of our segments. The majority of it though, is in Pressure Sensitive Material and the Other Specialty Converting businesses. I’ll provide more color on that in a moment.
Before getting into the segments I want to point out that the discrete tax planning event that we flagged in October came in at $0.42. This benefit will be realized to lower cash tax payments over the coming years and without this benefit our effective tax rate for the year would have been 23%.
Turning to slide 10, our Pressure Sensitive Material segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 11%, driven primarily by volume gains in all of our raw materials business. While PSM’s operating margin in the quarter was up 30 basis points year-over-year, margin versus in the third quarter was down half a point due to the raw material inflation. The inflation that we are currently facing is primarily due to the rising cost of adhesive components, which is being driven by higher commodity prices as well as the prior capacity constraints.
We are managing global vendor network to help mitigate this inflation, seeking substitute materials to reduce cost, driving further productivity and working to offset the rest with price increases.
In fact, we are planning another of price increases for the spring and this is on top of those that we just implemented. We are confident that the margin will expand from this current level in Pressure Sensitive as a combination of pricing and other productivity measures offset rising input costs.
Retail Information Services finished the year with organic sales growth of 11% in the quarter. This business which was hit hard during the recession due to retail inventory de-stocking is making great progress on the top and bottom lines. We are clearly building momentum in the marketplace and with a strong operating leverage in this business expect continued margin expansion as we grow. We demonstrated this over the past year. The operating margin here has expanded four full points in the quarter and nearly six points for the full year.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the fourth quarter reflected weak end market demand and increased competition in the labels category. As expected Office Product operating margin declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotions, investments in growth and the lower volume.
We previously discussed the competitive situation here and our strategy is to reverse the trajectory of the business. So, the margins will remain under pressure and actually further erode in the near-term as we feel the full effect of action taken last year to defend our position in the labels category as well as investing in innovation.
Our other specialty converting business again had solid sales growth in Q4. And margins have improved as a result of the benefit of increased volume and productivity gains.
Now, while margins improved, the overall margin for this collection of businesses remained in the red in Q4 due primarily to the price inflation gap.
Moving on to the outlook for 2011; on slide 13, we highlighted the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011.
Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. We estimate organic revenue growth of approximately 6%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments and growth, as well as some lift in pricing actions.
Based on the estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, we expect adjusted EPS of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 million to $350 million. This guidance assumes a $140 million to $150 million of inflation.
As I said earlier, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, driving further productivity and planning additional price increases. That said, the uncertainty about the timing of when we close the price inflation gap is one of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. Now, let me highlight some of the other key considerations reflecting our guidance.
As mentioned earlier, we expect the operating margin and the Office and Consumer Products business to further erode in 2011 before rebounding. We anticipate Q1 EPS as a percent of full-year earnings to be on the lower side of historical norms that is closer to 15% of full-year earnings. This is due to tougher comps in Office Products and the timing of the price inflation gap in Pressure-Sensitive, as well as the fact that it is a seasonally lowest quarter for RIS
We expected our ongoing pension expenses will be less than last year reflecting changes made to our U.S. retirement plans and we expect CapEx to be approximately $175 million. This is well below D&A and below pre recession levels. Our disciplined approach to capital management and our Lean Sigma productivity efforts should enable us to continue to invest below D&A for the near future.
Overall, we are confident about our position and prospects and with good reason. We’re expecting another year of solid revenue growth in 2011 driven by momentum in emerging markets and Retail Information Services. We expect to close the price inflation gap in Pressure-Sensitive and see PSM’s margin’s expense, RIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom line.
On a constant tax basis, we expect 8% to 20% earnings growth in 2011 and free cash flow remained strong. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we’ve shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction to returning more cash to shareholders. We’ve reduced net debt to less than two times EBITDA and both rating agencies recently indicated improved sentiment of our financial strength.
It’s great to be back in the position of raising the dividend and buying back stock, great indicators of our confidence in our financial strength and growth prospects. I’ll now turn it over to questions.

I think last year the label converters were getting fatigued by the price increases and I believe it’s because many of them during 2010 were kind of locked into fixed price contracts for the year with a number of their customers across many sectors. And we’ve done, I think, the best job we could in educating that marketplace is to say that’s not really a good idea in this environment.
So my sense in talking to a lot of label converters is that they’re reluctant now to sign up for full year price guarantees, because we can’t give them any kind of protection on raw material inflation. So I think 2011 will be a bit of a different game for most label converters.
From my perspective, the innovation in the marketplace is really being driven by our end-use marketing efforts in terms of coming up with new solutions like the Curvy container product and thinner liner material innovation, which allows us to explore other types of applications that typically are not that pressure-sensitive.
So, we’ve got a number of innovations that we’ll be watching later this year at the Label Expo. So, yes, I think 2010 was a tough year. But I think people now in the industry realize that this inflation is going to be with us for while and I anticipate label converters actually having raw material price through contracts with their customers as best as they can.

We saw strong top line growth in our two largest segments, Pressure-sensit",832,"Thanks, Eric, and hello, everyone. 2010 was a year of solid improvement. We delivered on all key measures for the full year and we made progress on our longer-term goals as well. 
We saw strong top line growth in our two largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services, which more than offset the decline in Office and Consumer Products. Both segments benefited from our strong position in emerging markets and an increased focus on marketing to end customers.
We expanded margins year-over-year. However, margins came under pressure in the second half of the year as raw material inflation outpaced price increases. While we narrowed the gap in the fourth quarter, we didn't close it. Our number one priority right now is to close that gap in the face of additional inflation by raising prices as well as accelerating material substitutions and taking productivity actions.
The highlight of the year was our improved financial strength. We generated $379 million of free cash flow which we used to reduce debt by nearly $300 million, exceeding our targeted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The rating agencies have improved their outlooks. We also contributed more than required to our pension plans, $78 million, and continued to invest in growth and in infrastructure.
Putting ourselves in a position to return more cash to shareholders was the key objective for 2010, and we achieved our goal. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, and we have a new authorization per share repurchases.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares, offsetting dilution, and the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares. 
Now turning to the businesses. Pressure-sensitive Materials had low double-digit organic sales growth with strength in all regions. Operating margin was up year-over-year but down sequentially as inflation continue to pressure margin. As I've said, we ended the year with a gap between price and raw material costs, and we intend to close not only with price increases but with material substitutions and productivity.
During the year, we saw the benefits of our investments in end-user marketing to specific segments such as food, beverage, pharma and durables. We built a large pipeline of projects with end users to accelerate the conversion to pressure-sensitive from alternative forms of package decoration. And as a result, we're capturing new business.
Our Roll Materials business announced two significant innovations last year. One is the new system for labeling curved surfaces, and the other is a new product platform that uses dramatically thinner liner materials that are lower cost and more sustainable. And our Graphics and Reflective Products business launched a new line of films for digital printers that are best in class. 
I'm very pleased with the progress Retail Information Services made last year. RIS delivered much stronger sales growth through dramatic improvements in service and quality. Margin improved as we saw the benefit of increased volumes on lower fixed costs.
We're starting to deliver on our value proposition to retailers and brand owners who responded very positively to the products and solutions we launched last year. RIS has further to go, but it's starting to realize its potential for sales growth and margin expansion. And although small, an important part of the long-term RIS success story is RFID. Shipments in the year of RFID inlays for apparel nearly doubled over last year, and we expect continued strong growth in 2011.
Office and Consumer Products year turned out as expected, given the continued weakness in white collar employment and the impact of new competition. We executed a solid defense of our labels business. We also invested in innovation and created a pipeline of new products that should be visible at retail in the back half of 2011. 
In summary, we exceeded our targets for the year. Our employees did a great job executing on our strategies by serving customers well. And I'm really pleased to be in a position to deliver increased cash to shareholders.
For 2011, our business priorities are as follows. First, close the price inflation gap. We have a long history of recovering inflation-related margin loss over the cycle and fully expect to follow that pattern again, while further improve RIS' market position as well as sales and margin. We will continue to drive the conversion to Pressure-sensitive Materials in key segments with innovative new solutions. And we'll continue to invest in the turnaround of Office Products and start generating sales out of this new product pipeline.
We expect that capital expense will be higher in 2011, about $175 million, but still significantly below our depreciation rate and our run rate prior to the recession. Our priorities for capital are disciplined investments organic growth especially in emerging markets and ramping up the IT infrastructure investments that we deferred during the recession. 
Finally, we remain focused on generating strong free cash flow to support these investments and to return more cash to shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Mitch."
252978,116810685,98190,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 6 and talking through the Slide 9. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%.

Starting with Slide 6 and talking through the Slide 9. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%. As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services again delivered solid growth in all regions and more than offset the decline in Office Products. 
Our operating margin increased in the fourth quarter, as expected, to 5.9% as the benefit of higher volume more than offset the impact of the price inflation gap, reduced margin in office products and increased investments in growth and infrastructure. While raw materials came in the fourth quarter pretty much as expected, inflationary pressure did pick up in December, and that pressure has carried into this year. 
We previously said that we anticipated narrowing the price inflation gap early in 2011. The continued rise in raw material cost, however, has further delayed the timing of when we expect to close the price inflation gap. This inflation affects all of our segments. The majority of it though is in Pressure-sensitive Materials and the other specialty converting businesses. I'll provide more color on that in a moment.
Before getting into the segments, I want to point out that the discrete tax planning event that we flagged in October came in at $0.42. This benefit will be realized through lower cash tax payments over the coming years. And without this benefit, our effective tax rate for the year would have been 23%.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 11%, driven primarily by volume gains in all regions of our Raw Materials business. While PSM's operating margin in the quarter was up 30 basis points year-over-year, margin versus the third quarter was down half a point due to the raw material inflation. 
The inflation that we're currently facing is primarily due to the rising cost of adhesive components which is being driven by higher commodity prices as well as supplier capacity constraints. We are managing our global vendor network to help mitigate this inflation, seeking sensitive materials reduce costs, driving further productivity and working to offset the rest with price increases. 
In fact, we're planning another round of price increases for this spring. And this is on top of those that we just implemented. We're confident that the margin will expand from its current level in Pressure-sensitive as the combination of pricing and other protective measures offset rising input costs. 
Retail Information Services finished the year with organic sales growth of 11% in the quarter. This business, which was hit hard during the recession due to retail inventory destocking, is making great progress on the top and bottom lines. We are clearly building momentum in the marketplace. And with a strong operating leverage in this business, expect continued margin expansion as we grow. We've demonstrated this over the past year as the operating margin here has expanded four full points in the quarter and nearly six points for the full year.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the fourth quarter reflected weak end-market demand and increased competition in the labels category. As expected, Office Products' operating margins declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotions, investments in growth and lower volume. We've previously discussed the competitive situation here, and our strategy is to reverse the trajectory of the business. So the margins will reman under pressure and actually further erode in the near term as we feel the full effect of actions taken last year to defend our position in the labels category as well as investments in innovation.
Our other specialty converting businesses again had solid sales growth in Q4, and margins have improved as a result of the benefit of increased volume and productivity gains. Now while margins improved, the overall margin for this collection of businesses remained in the red in Q4 due primarily to that price inflation gap.
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 13, we've highlighted the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. 
We estimate organic revenue growth of approximately 6%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments in growth, as well as some lift in pricing actions. Based on the estimated sales and other assumptions including the listed factors, we expect adjusted EPS of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 million to $350 million.  
This guidance assumes $140 million to $150 million of inflation. As I said earlier, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, driving further productivity and planning additional price increases. That said, the uncertainty about the timing of when we close the price inflation gap is one of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. 
Now let me highlight some of the other key considerations reflecting our guidance. As mentioned earlier, we expect the operating margin in the Office and Consumer Products business to further erode in 2011 before rebounding. We anticipate Q1 EPS as a percent of full year earnings to be on the lower side of historical norms, that is close to the 15% of full year earnings. This is due to tougher comps in office products and the timing of the price inflation gap in Pressure-sensitive, as well as the fact that it is the seasonally lowest quarter for RIS. We expect that our ongoing pension expenses will be less than last year, reflecting changes made to our U.S. retirement plan. And we expect CapEx to be approximately $175 million.
This is well below D&A and below prerecession levels. Our disciplined approach to capital management and our Lean Sigma productivity effort should enable us to continue to invest below D&A for the near future.
Overall, we are confident about our position and prospects and with good reason. We're expecting another year of solid revenue growth in 2011, driven by momentum in emerging markets and Retail Information Services. We expect to close the price inflation gap in Pressure-sensitive and CPSM's margin expense. RIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom lines. On a constant-tax basis, we expect 8% to 20% earnings growth in 2011 and free cash flow remains strong. 
Given the strength of our balance sheet, we shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction to returning more cash to shareholders. We've reduced net debt to less than 2x EBITDA, and both rating agencies recently indicated improved sentiment of our financial strength. It's great to be back in the position of raising the dividend and buying back stock, great indicators of our confidence in our financial strength and growth prospects.  
I'll now turn it over to questions."

I think last year, the label converters were getting fatigued by the price increases. And I believe it's because many of them, during 2010, were kind of locked in to fixed-price contracts for the year with a number of their customers across many sectors. And we've done, I think, the best we could in educating their marketplaces. That's not really a good idea in this environment. So my sense in talking to a lot of label converters is that they're reluctant now to sign up for full year price guarantees because we can't give them any kind of protection on raw material inflation. So I think 2011 will be a bit of a different game for most label converters. For my perspective, the innovation in the marketplace is really being driven by our end user marketing efforts in terms of coming up with new solutions like the Curvy container product and a thinner liner material innovation which allows us to explore other types of applications that typically have not been pressure sensitive. Well, we've got a number of innovations that we'll be launching later this year at Labelexpo. So yes, I think 2010 was a tough year, but I think people now in the industry realize that this inflation is going to be with us for a while.

We remind you that these results are preliminary as we have not yet filed our 10-K.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes interest expense, restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. 
Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. These numbers are reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty.

We delivered on all key measures for the full year and we made progress on our longer-term goals as well. 
We saw strong top line growth in our two largest segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services, which more than offset the decline in Office and Consumer Products. Both segments benefited from our strong position in emerging markets and an increased focus on marketing to end customers.
We expanded margins year-over-year. However, margins came under pressure in the second half of the year as raw material inflation outpaced price increases. While we narrowed the gap in the fourth quarter, we didn't close it. Our number one priority right now is to close that gap in the face of additional inflation by raising prices as well as accelerating material substitutions and taking productivity actions.
The highlight of the year was our improved financial strength. We generated $379 million of free cash flow which we used to reduce debt by nearly $300 million, exceeding our targeted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The rating agencies have improved their outlooks. We also contributed more than required to our pension plans, $78 million, and continued to invest in growth and in infrastructure.
Putting ourselves in a position to return more cash to shareholders was the key objective for 2010, and we achieved our goal. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, and we have a new authorization for share repurchases.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares, offsetting dilution, and the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares. 
Now turning to the businesses. Pressure-sensitive Materials had low double-digit organic sales growth with strength in all regions. Operating margin was up year-over-year but down sequentially as inflation continued to pressure margin. As I've said, we ended the year with a gap between price and raw material costs, and we intend to close not only with price increases but with material substitutions and productivity.
During the year, we saw the benefits of our investments in end-user marketing to specific segments such as food, beverage, pharma and durables. We built a large pipeline of projects with end users to accelerate the conversion to pressure-sensitive from alternative forms of package decoration. And as a result, we're capturing new business.
Our Roll Materials business announced two significant innovations last year. One is the new system for labeling curved surfaces, and the other is a new product platform that uses dramatically thinner liner materials that are lower cost and more sustainable. And our Graphics and Reflective Products business launched a new line of films for digital printers that are best in class. 
I'm very pleased with the progress Retail Information Services made last year. RIS delivered much stronger sales growth through dramatic improvements in service and quality. Margin improved as we saw the benefit of increased volumes on lower fixed costs.
We're starting to deliver on our value proposition to retailers and brand owners who responded very positively to the products and solutions we launched last year. RIS has further to go, but it's starting to realize its potential for sales growth and margin expansion. And although small, an important part of the long-term RIS success story is RFID. Shipments in the year of RFID inlays for apparel nearly doubled over last year, and we expect continued strong growth in 2011.
Office and Consumer Products year turned out as expected, given the continued weakness in white collar employment and the impact of new competition. We executed a solid defense of our labels business. We also invested in innovation and created a pipeline of new products that should be visible at retail in the back half of 2011. 
In summary, we exceeded our targets for the year. Our employees did a great job executing on our strategies by serving customers well. And I'm really pleased to be in a position to deliver increased cash to shareholders.
For 2011, our business priorities are as follows. First, close the price inflation gap. We have a long history of recovering inflation-related margin loss over the cycle and fully expect to follow that pattern again. We'll further improve RIS' market position as well as sales and margin. We will continue to drive the conversion to Pressure-sensitive Materials in key segments with innovative new solutions. And we'll continue to invest in the turnaround of Office Products and start generating sales out of this new product pipeline.
We expect that capital expense will be higher in 2011, about $175 million, but still significantly below our depreciation rate and our run rate prior to the recession. Our priorities for capital are disciplined investments for organic growth especially in emerging markets and ramping up the IT infrastructure investments that we deferred during the recession. 
Finally, we remain focused on generating strong free cash flow to support these investments and to return more cash to shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Mitch."
252978,116810685,98359,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 6 and talking through to Slide 9. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%.

Starting with Slide 6 and talking through to Slide 9. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically about 9%. As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Information Services again delivered solid growth in all regions and more than offset the decline in Office Products. 
Our operating margin increased in the fourth quarter, as expected, to 5.9% as the benefit of higher volume more than offset the impact of the price inflation gap, reduced margin in office products and increased investments in growth and infrastructure. While raw materials came in the fourth quarter pretty much as expected, inflationary pressure did pick up in December, and that pressure has carried into this year. 
We previously said that we anticipated narrowing the price inflation gap early in 2011. The continued rise in raw material cost, however, has further delayed the timing of when we expect to close the price inflation gap. This inflation affects all of our segments. The majority of it though is in Pressure-sensitive Materials and the other specialty converting businesses. I'll provide more color on that in a moment.
Before getting into the segments, I want to point out that the discrete tax planning event that we flagged in October came in at $0.42. This benefit will be realized through lower cash tax payments over the coming years. And without this benefit, our effective tax rate for the year would have been 23%.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 11%, driven primarily by volume gains in all regions of our Roll Materials business. While PSM's operating margin in the quarter was up 30 basis points year-over-year, margin versus the third quarter was down half a point due to the raw material inflation. 
The inflation that we're currently facing is primarily due to the rising cost of adhesive components which is being driven by higher commodity prices as well as supplier capacity constraints. We are managing our global vendor network to help mitigate this inflation, seeking substitute materials reduce costs, driving further productivity and working to offset the rest with price increases. 
In fact, we're planning another round of price increases for this spring. And this is on top of those that we just implemented. We're confident that the margin will expand from its current level in Pressure-sensitive as the combination of pricing and other protective measures offset rising input costs. 
Retail Information Services finished the year with organic sales growth of 11% in the quarter. This business, which was hit hard during the recession due to retail inventory destocking, is making great progress on the top and bottom lines. We are clearly building momentum in the marketplace and with a strong operating leverage in this business, expect continued margin expansion as we grow. We've demonstrated this over the past year as the operating margin here has expanded four full points in the quarter and nearly six points for the full year.
Looking at Office Products, the decline in sales in the fourth quarter reflected weak end-market demand and increased competition in the labels category. As expected, Office Products' operating margins declined in the quarter due to increased consumer promotions, investments in growth and lower volume. We've previously discussed the competitive situation here, and our strategies to reverse the trajectory of the business. So the margins will remain under pressure and actually further erode in the near term as we feel the full effect of actions taken last year to defend our position in the labels category as well as investments in innovation.
Our other specialty converting businesses again had solid sales growth in Q4, and margin has improved as a result of the benefit of increased volume and productivity gains. Now while margins improved, the overall margin for this collection of businesses remained in the red in Q4 due primarily to that price inflation gap.
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 13, we've highlighted the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. 
We estimate organic revenue growth of approximately 6%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments in growth, as well as some lift in pricing actions. Based on the estimated sales and other assumptions including the listed factors, we expect adjusted EPS of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 million to $350 million.  
This guidance assumes $140 million to $150 million of inflation. As I said earlier, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, driving further productivity and planning additional price increases. That said, the uncertainty about the timing of when we close the price inflation gap is one of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. 
Now let me highlight some of the other key considerations reflecting our guidance. As mentioned earlier, we expect the operating margin in the Office and Consumer Products business to further erode in 2011 before rebounding. We anticipate Q1 EPS as a percent of full year earnings to be on the lower side of historical norms, that is closer to 15% of full year earnings. This is due to tougher comps in office products and the timing of the price inflation gap in Pressure-sensitive, as well as the fact that it is the seasonally lowest quarter for RIS. We expect that our ongoing pension expenses will be less than last year, reflecting changes made to our U.S. retirement plan. And we expect CapEx to be approximately $175 million.
This is well below D&A and below prerecession levels. Our disciplined approach to capital management and our Lean Sigma productivity effort should enable us to continue to invest below D&A for the near future.
Overall, we are confident about our position and prospects and with good reason. We're expecting another year of solid revenue growth in 2011, driven by momentum in emerging markets and Retail Information Services. We expect to close the price inflation gap in Pressure-sensitive and CPSM's margin expense. RIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom lines. On a constant-tax basis, we expect 8% to 20% earnings growth in 2011 and free cash flow remains strong. 
Given the strength of our balance sheet, we've shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction to returning more cash to shareholders. We've reduced net debt to less than 2x EBITDA, and both rating agencies recently indicated improved sentiment about our financial strength. It's great to be back in the position of raising the dividend and buying back stock, great indicators of our confidence in our financial strength and growth prospects.  
I'll now turn it over to questions."

I think last year, the label converters were getting fatigued by the price increases. And I believe it's because many of them, during 2010, were kind of locked in to fixed-price contracts for the year with a number of their customers across many sectors. And we've done, I think, the best job we could in educating that marketplace to say that's not really a good idea in this environment. So my sense in talking to a lot of label converters is that they're reluctant now to sign up for full year price guarantees because we can't give them any kind of protection on raw material inflation. So I think 2011 will be a bit of a different game for most label converters. From my perspective, the innovation in the marketplace is really being driven by our end use marketing efforts in terms of coming up with new solutions like the Curvy container product and a thinner liner material innovation which allows us to explore other types of applications that typically have not been pressure sensitive. Well, we've got a number of innovations that we'll be launching later this year at Labelexpo. So yes, I think 2010 was a tough year, but I think people now in the industry realize that this inflation is going to be with us for a while.

We remind you that these unaudited results are preliminary as we have not yet filed our 10-Q.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes the interest expense restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on non-GAAP operating margins, which reflects pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. This and other non-GAAP financial measures that we use are reconciled with GAAP and schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements  are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty. The safe harbor statement included in the documents that we've provided today, along with our 2010 Form 10-K address certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations.

First, to close the price inflation gap from the second half of 2010. Second, to continue the positive trajectory for RBIS, improving both sales and margins. Third, to invest in the turnaround of Office and Consumer Products by launching a pipeline of new products. I'll discuss the first quarter in terms of these priorities.
All of you know that the first quarter is our lowest revenue quarter because of the seasonality of RBIS and Office and Consumer Products. 
Given that seasonality, our results were consistent with our plan and we remain on track for 2011. Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered another quarter of solid topline growth with net sales up 10%, with continuing strength in emerging markets as well as in Europe. 
More important though, was the sequential improvement in margins for this segment. Our ability to pass through price increases make material substitutions and increased productivity all contributed to this sequential improvement. 
Inflation continues to accelerate in this sector as we see increases in paper, film and chemicals. As a result, we are increasing the magnitude and frequency of our price increases and as well as raising our target for material reengineering and productivity improvement. I'm confident we'll continue to make progress in margin improvement.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions had another strong quarter. The 9% sales growth was driven by market volume growth as well as customer program wins resulting from our improved service, RFID rollout and new products. There is some concern among retailers and brand owners about the consumer's reaction to higher apparel prices, as well as the pocketbooks squeeze from higher food and fuel prices. So far, apparel sales had held up well and the inventory to sales ratio for soft goods continues to be at historical low. We'll understand this trend better as the quarter unfolds. 
Also the solutions that RBIS provides not only enable brands to differentiate themselves, they also improved supply chain performance and help retailers manage their inventories more effectively. Given the current market environment, that's a real plus, so my confidence level in this business is its execution remains high.
As expected, our Office and Consumer Products had a tough quarter. Sales volumes were down 13% due to customer inventory reduction from prior year forward vies, plus a softer retail environment that was partially weather-related. Now our Q1 is always soft, this year's first quarter sales represent less than 20% of Office and Consumer Products full year sales volumes. And given the high variable margins in this segment, operating margins were very low in the first quarter. 
Our focus has been on locking new products with the goal of $20 million to $30 million in new product sales during 2011. Customer commitments for these new products are on track with our target. A combination of these new products plus the normal seasonal impact back-to-school will drive improved sales trends and enable us to achieve our full year margin targets for this business.
To sum up, despite the dramatic increase in inflation, we are maintaining the full year earnings guidance we provided in early February. We also expect to meet our free cash flow target for the year and we remain committed to returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now, Mitch will go through the quarter in more detail."

Sales in the first quarter were up as reported and organically about 7%, currency has little impact on sales in Q1. 
As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions again delivered solid topline growth, more than offsetting the decline in Office and Consumer Products. 
Our consolidated operating margin declined in the first quarter as expected to 5.4%, driven largely by inflation in PSM and margin compression at OCP, offset somewhat by another quarter of margin expansion and RBIS. 
Raw material cost in the first quarter came in pretty much as expected and we've made good progress offsetting the inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we discussed last quarter. Now inflationary pressure again picked up significantly in both March and April and we are implementing further actions to offset this new inflation. I'll talk more about that in a moment.
While our marketing general and administrative expense ratio was flat in the prior year, MD&A increased in absolute dollars. 
As we've discussed, we stepped up growth in IT infrastructure related investments. We also had a warehouse fire in Brazil that cost you s$4 million in the quarter. Now before getting into the segments, I just want to point out that our adjusted tax rate increased from 22% to 25% in the first quarter, reflecting our implication of reduced benefits from discrete tax events this year.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth at 10%, driven by volume gains in price in both our Label and Packaging Materials businesses and in Graphics and Reflective solutions. PSM's volume growth was a little over 5% led by emerging markets. While PSM's operating margin in the quarter was down 90 basis points year-over-year, margin versus the fourth quarter was up 130 basis points, due to our progress in offsetting raw material inflation. We talk a lot about our pricing ability and productivity gains in this business and we made great progress in offsetting inflation in the first quarter.
Retail branding and Information Solutions delivered organic sales growth of 9% in the quarter. This has been is making some great progress in the top and bottom line with operating margin expanding 250 basis points in the quarter. We continue to build momentum and with the strong operating leverage in this business, expect continued margin expansion as we grow. Keep in mind that the sequential decline in operating margin reference the seasonality of this business. The first quarter is typically the segment smallest and the second quarter typically is the largest.
Dean covered Office and Consumer Products which came in largely as expected. Q1 is also a seasonally low quarter for this business and was compounded by the Q4 customer inventory build, which reduce Q1 sales and profits. We continue to expect margins in this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year.
Our Other Specialty Converting businesses again had solid sales growth in the quarter. Most of the cost the warehouse fire in Brazil that I mentioned earlier impacted these businesses. 
Moving onto the outlook for 2011. On Slide 12, we summarized the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 13 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter.
We now estimate organic revenue growth in 2011 of approximately 7%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments and growth, as well as with some pricing actions. The increase in revenue assumption from last quarter is due primarily to price. 
Now obviously currency has moved since January and at March rates currency would add $18 million of EBIT year-over-year. 
As for inflation, last quarter, we expected $140 million to $150 million of inflation, but inflationary pressure rose dramatically in March and April as I mentioned earlier. We're now experiencing approximately $220 million of raw material inflation year-over-year and it's across most of the materials that we buy, paper is up, chemicals are up and films are up.
A sidenote from those how we drive our inflation assumption, our methodology is to project a continuation of what were currently experiencing for the remainder of the year. As we've demonstrated over the past couple of quarters, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, seeking substitute materials, driving further productivity and raising prices. We successfully narrowed the price inflation gap in Q1 as demonstrated by the sequential margin expansion of PSM. And given the magnitude of the continuing inflationary pressure, there should be no surprise that we're currently implementing further price increases and productivity initiatives.
As we said last quarter, the uncertainty about the timing of when we close the price inflation gap remains 1 of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. 
And as for the tax rate, we're now assuming it to be in the mid-20s at the high-end of our previous range. Netting the puts and takes based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, our EPS and free cash flow guidance are unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 to $350 million.
Overall, we remain confident about our position and prospects. We're expecting another year of solid revenue growth driven by strength in PSM and RBIS. We expect to close the price inflation gap and see margin expansion in PSM. RBIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom lines. Free cash flow will remain strong and reflecting the strength of our balance sheet, we've shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction to referring more cash to shareholders. 
Now I would be happy to take questions."

And asset you might expect, they weren't really interested in building inventories so pretty much came in right where we thought. And you have to realize given our strong seasonality, especially for back-to-school and the fact that most of the new product programs that customers are excited about really is going to hit the back half of the year. That revenue for us is less than 10% of ou r full year guidance. So it will be a much different story for the back half in April for the next three quarters, actually.

Some are rating prices and are trying to make trying to test and see what the consumer reaction will be to some of those apparel price increases. I don't think we've had our environment pricing increases for 20 years for this country, so it's a little bit new territory that they're breaking into.

Our discussion today will reference the earnings release that we issued earlier along with the slide presentation titled First Quarter 2011 Financial Review and Analysis. Both documents were furnished today with our 8-K and posted at the Investor section of our website at www.investors.averydennison.com. We remind you that these unaudited results are preliminary as we have not yet filed our 10-Q.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes the interest expense restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on non-GAAP operating margins, which reflects pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. This and other non-GAAP financial measures that we use are reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements  are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty. The safe harbor statement included in the documents that we've provided today, along with our 2010 Form 10-K address certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. 
I'm sure you noticed in our documents that we've changed the names of some our business to better reflect what we deliver to customers. Our Roll Materials business is now called Label and Packaging Materials and or our Retail Information Service business segment is now Retail Branding and Information Solutions.
On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dean."

First, to close the price inflation gap from the second half of 2010. Second, to continue the positive trajectory for RBIS, improving both sales and margins. Third, to invest in the turnaround of Office and Consumer Products by launching a pipeline of new products. I'll discuss the first quarter in terms of these priorities.
All of you know that the first quarter is our lowest revenue quarter because of the seasonality of RBIS and Office and Consumer Products. 
Given that seasonality, our results were consistent with our plan and we remain on track for 2011. Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered another quarter of solid top line growth with net sales up 10%, with continuing strength in emerging markets as well as in Europe. 
More important though, was the sequential improvement in margins for this segment. Our ability to pass through price increases make material substitutions and increased productivity all contributed to this sequential improvement. 
Inflation continues to accelerate in this sector as we see increases in paper, film and chemicals. As a result, we are increasing the magnitude and frequency of our price increases and as well as raising our targets for our material reengineering and productivity improvement. I'm confident we'll continue to make progress in margin improvement.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions had another strong quarter. The 9% sales growth was driven by market volume growth as well as customer program wins resulting from our improved service, RFID rollouts and new products. There is some concern among retailers and brand owners about the consumer's reaction to higher apparel prices, as well as the pocketbook squeeze from higher food and fuel prices. So far, apparel sales had held up well and the inventory to sales ratio for soft goods continues to be at historical low. We'll understand the trend better as the quarter unfolds. 
Also the solutions that RBIS provides not only enable brands to differentiate themselves, they also improve supply chain performance and help retailers manage their inventories more effectively. Given the current market environment, that's a real plus. So my confidence level in this business and its execution remain high.
As expected, Office and Consumer Products had a tough quarter. Sales volumes were down 13% due to customer inventory reduction from prior year forward VIES, plus a softer retail environment that was partially weather-related. Now while Q1 is always soft, this year's first quarter sales represent less than 20% of Office and Consumer Products' full year sales volume. And given the high variable margins in this segment, operating margins were very low in the first quarter. 
Our focus has been on launching new products with the goal of $20 million to $30 million in new product sales during 2011. Customer commitments for these new products are on track with our target. A combination of these new products plus the normal seasonal impact of back-to-school will drive improved sales trends and enable us to achieve our full year margin targets for this business.
To sum up, despite the dramatic increase in inflation, we are maintaining the full year earnings guidance we provided in early February. We also expect to meet our free cash flow target for the year and we remain committed to returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now, Mitch will go through the quarter in more detail."
252978,129246631,118470,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the first quarter were up as reported and organically about 7%, currency had little impact on sales in Q1. As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding a",996,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the first quarter were up as reported and organically about 7%, currency had little impact on sales in Q1. 
As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions again delivered solid top line growth, more than offsetting the decline in Office and Consumer Products. 
Our consolidated operating margin declined in the first quarter as expected to 5.4%, driven largely by inflation in PSM and margin compression at OCP, offset somewhat by another quarter of margin expansion in RBIS. 
Raw material cost in the first quarter came in pretty much as expected and we made good progress offsetting inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we discussed last quarter. Now inflationary pressure again picked up significantly in both March and April and we are implementing further actions to offset this new inflation. I'll talk more about that in a moment.
While our marketing general and administrative expense ratio was flat in the prior year, MD&A increased in absolute dollars. 
As we've discussed, we've stepped up growth in IT infrastructure related investments. We also had a warehouse fire in Brazil that cost about $4 million in the quarter. Now before getting into the segments, I just want to point out that our adjusted tax rate increased from 22% to 25% in the first quarter, reflecting our implication of reduced benefits from discrete tax events this year.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 10%, driven by volume gains and price in both our Label and Packaging Materials businesses and in Graphics and Reflective solutions. PSM's volume growth was a little over 5% led by emerging markets. While PSM's operating margin in the quarter was down 90 basis points year-over-year, margin versus the fourth quarter went up 130 basis points, due to our progress in offsetting raw material inflation. We've talked a lot about our pricing ability and productivity gains in this business and we made great progress in offsetting inflation in the first quarter.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered organic sales growth at 9% in the quarter. This business is making great progress in the top and bottom line with operating margin expanding 250 basis points in the quarter. We continue to build momentum and with a strong operating leverage in this business, expect continued margin expansion as we grow. Keep in mind that the sequential decline in operating margin reflects the seasonality of this business. The first quarter is typically the segment's smallest and the second quarter, typically is largest.
Dean covered Office and Consumer Products which came in largely as expected. Q1 is also a seasonally low quarter for this business and it was compounded by the Q4 customer inventory build, which reduced Q1 sales and profits. We continue to expect margins in this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year.
Our other specialty converting businesses again had solid sales growth in the quarter. Most of the cost of the warehouse fire in Brazil, that I mentioned earlier, impacted these businesses. 
Moving onto the outlook for 2011. On Slide 12, we've summarized the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 13 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter.
We now estimate organic revenue growth in 2011 of approximately 7%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments and growth, as well as less from pricing actions. The increase in our revenue assumption from last quarter is due primarily to price. 
Now obviously, currencies have moved since January and at March rates, currency would add $18 million of EBIT year-over-year. 
As for inflation, last quarter, we expected $140 million to $150 million of inflation, but inflationary pressure rose dramatically in March and April as I mentioned earlier. We're now experiencing approximately $220 million of raw material inflation year-over-year and it's across most of the materials that we buy. Paper is up, chemicals are up and films are up.
A sidenote from those not familiar with how we derive our inflation assumption, our methodology is to project a continuation of what we're currently experiencing for the remainder of the year. As we've demonstrated over the past couple of quarters, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, seeking substitute materials, driving further productivity and raising prices. We successfully narrowed the price inflation gap in Q1 as demonstrated by the sequential margin expansion of PSM. And given the magnitude of the continuing inflationary pressure, there should be no surprise that we're currently implementing further price increases and productivity initiatives.
As we said last quarter, the uncertainty about the timing of when we close the price inflation gap remains one of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. 
And as for the tax rate, we're now assuming it to be in the mid-20s at the high-end of our previous range. Netting these puts and takes based on the estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, our EPS and free cash flow guidance are unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 to $350 million.
Overall, we remain confident about our position on prospects. We're expecting another year of solid revenue growth driven by strength in PSM and RBIS. We expect to close the price inflation gap and see margin expansion in PSM. RBIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom lines. Free cash flow will remain strong and reflecting the strength of our balance sheet, we've shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction to returning more cash to shareholders. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

We knew when we got the big full guide from some of our customers in the fourth quarter that Q1 would be unusually soft. And if you read some of the announcements from the office superstores, you could see the retail foot traffic was down pretty substantially, especially in January, because of the bad weather. And as you might expect, they weren't really interested in building inventories so pretty much came in right where we thought. And you have to realize given our strong seasonality, especially for back-to-school and the fact that most of the new product programs that customers are excited about really won't hit the back half of the year. That revenue for us was less than 20% of the full year guidance. So it will be a much different story for the back half with April, for the next three quarters, actually. Now it's still going to be lower than it was in the prior year and I think we've been really clear about that."

The inventory sales ratio that I was referring to has to do with footwear and soft goods, which we have talked about in various seminars and of course, investor meetings.

So it's the reorder of points that they're just being cautious, very similar to what they have been in the last year or so. They don't want their inventories to get out a whack with sales. Some are raising prices on certain apparel items right now and they're trying to make -- they're trying to test and see what the consumer reaction will be to some of those apparel price increases. I don't think we've had apparel price increases for 20 years in this country, so it is a little bit new territory that they're breaking into. So far, it doesn't seem to have impacted overall volume, but we'll see as the year progresses. On the pressure sensitive side, I've been pleasantly surprised, especially in Europe with overall buy-in demands, and when I read the -- all the news coming out of Europe, sometimes it surprises me. Some of that of course is related to Eastern Europe which still remains pretty strong, but even Western Europe has been strong. And I think North America's also held up pretty well.

Our discussion today will reference the earnings release that we issued earlier along with the slide presentation titled First Quarter 2011 Financial Review and Analysis. Both documents were furnished today with our 8-K and posted at the Investor section of our website at www.investors.averydennison.com. We remind you that these unaudited results are preliminary as we have not yet filed our 10-Q.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes the interest expense restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on non-GAAP operating margins, which reflects pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. This and other non-GAAP financial measures that we use are reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements  are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty. The safe harbor statement included in the documents that we've provided today, along with our 2010 Form 10-K address certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. 
I'm sure you noticed in our documents that we've changed the names of some our business to better reflect what we deliver to customers. Our Roll Materials business is now called Label and Packaging Materials and or our Retail Information Service business segment is now Retail Branding and Information Solutions.

Second, to continue the positive trajectory for RBIS, improving both sales and margins. Third, to in",561,"Thanks, Eric. During the year end earnings call, I outlined our priorities for 2011. First, to close the price inflation gap from the second half of 2010. Second, to continue the positive trajectory for RBIS, improving both sales and margins. Third, to invest in the turnaround of Office and Consumer Products by launching a pipeline of new products. I'll discuss the first quarter in terms of these priorities.
All of you know that the first quarter is our lowest revenue quarter because of the seasonality of RBIS and Office and Consumer Products. 
Given that seasonality, our results were consistent with our plan and we remain on track for 2011. Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered another quarter of solid top line growth with net sales up 10%, with continuing strength in emerging markets as well as in Europe. 
More important though, was the sequential improvement in margins for this segment. Our ability to pass through price increases make material substitutions and increased productivity all contributed to this sequential improvement. 
Inflation continues to accelerate in this sector as we see increases in paper, film and chemicals. As a result, we are increasing the magnitude and frequency of our price increases and as well as raising our targets for material reengineering and productivity improvement. I'm confident we'll continue to make progress in margin improvement.
Retail Branding and Information Solution had another strong quarter. The 9% sales growth was driven by market volume growth as well as customer program wins resulting from our improved service, RFID rollouts and new products. There is some concern among retailers and brand owners about the consumer's reaction to higher apparel prices, as well as the pocketbook squeeze from higher food and fuel prices. So far, apparel sales had held up well and the inventory to sales ratio for soft goods continues to be at historical low. We'll understand the trend better as the quarter unfolds. 
Also the solutions that RBIS provides not only enable brands to differentiate themselves, they also improve supply chain performance and help retailers manage their inventories more effectively. Given the current market environment, that's a real plus. So my confidence level in this business and its execution remain high.
As expected, Office and Consumer Products had a tough quarter. Sales volumes were down 13% due to customer inventory reduction from prior year forward VIES, plus a softer retail environment that was partially weather-related. Now while Q1 is always soft, this year's first quarter sales represent less than 20% of Office and Consumer Products' full year sales volume. And given the high variable margins in this segment, operating margins were very low in the first quarter. 
Our focus has been on launching new products with the goal of $20 million to $30 million in new product sales during 2011. Customer commitments for these new products are on track with our target. A combination of these new products plus the normal seasonal impact of back-to-school will drive improved sales trends and enable us to achieve our full year margin targets for this business.
To sum up, despite the dramatic increase in inflation, we are maintaining the full year earnings guidance we provided in early February. We also expect to meet our free cash flow target for the year and we remain committed to returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now, Mitch will go through the quarter in more detail."
252978,129246631,118530,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the first quarter were up as reported and organically about 7%, currency had little impact on sales in Q1. As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding a",996,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the first quarter were up as reported and organically about 7%, currency had little impact on sales in Q1. 
As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions again delivered solid top line growth, more than offsetting the decline in Office and Consumer Products. 
Our consolidated operating margin declined in the first quarter as expected to 5.4%, driven largely by inflation in PSM and margin compression at OCP, offset somewhat by another quarter margin expansion in RBIS. 
Raw material cost in the first quarter came in pretty much as expected and we made good progress offsetting inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we discussed last quarter. Now inflationary pressure again picked up significantly in both March and April, and we are implementing further actions to offset this new inflation. I'll talk more about that in a moment.
While our marketing general and administrative expense ratio was flat in the prior year, MD&A increased in absolute dollars. 
As we've discussed, we've stepped up growth in IT infrastructure related investments. We also had a warehouse fire in Brazil that cost about $4 million in the quarter. Now before getting into the segments, I just want to point out that our adjusted tax rate increased from 22% to 25% in the first quarter, reflecting our expectation of reduced benefits from discrete tax events this year.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 10%, driven by volume gains and price in both our Label and Packaging Materials businesses and in Graphics and Reflective solutions. PSM's volume growth was a little over 5% led by emerging markets. While PSM's operating margin in the quarter was down 90 basis points year-over-year, margin versus the fourth quarter went up 130 basis points, due to our progress in offsetting raw material inflation. We've talked a lot about our pricing ability and productivity gains in this business and we made great progress in offsetting inflation in the first quarter.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered organic sales growth at 9% in the quarter. This business is making great progress in the top and bottom line with operating margin expanding 250 basis points in the quarter. We continue to build momentum and with a strong operating leverage in this business, expect continued margin expansion as we grow. Keep in mind that the sequential decline in operating margin reflects the seasonality of this business. The first quarter is typically the segment's smallest and the second quarter, typically is largest.
Dean covered Office and Consumer Products which came in largely as expected. Q1 is also a seasonally low quarter for this business and it was compounded by the Q4 customer inventory build, which reduced Q1 sales and profits. We continue to expect margins in this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year.
Our other specialty converting businesses again had solid sales growth in the quarter. Most of the cost of the warehouse fire in Brazil, that I mentioned earlier, impacted these businesses. 
Moving onto the outlook for 2011. On Slide 12, we've summarized the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 13 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter.
We now estimate organic revenue growth in 2011 of approximately 7%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments and growth, as well as less from pricing actions. The increase in our revenue assumption from last quarter is due primarily to price. 
Now obviously, currencies have moved since January and at March rates, currency would add $18 million of EBIT year-over-year. 
As for inflation, last quarter, we expected $140 million to $150 million of inflation, but inflationary pressure rose dramatically in March and April as I mentioned earlier. We're now experiencing approximately $220 million of raw material inflation year-over-year and it's across most of the materials that we buy. Paper is up, chemicals are up and films are up.
A sidenote from those not familiar with how we derive our inflation assumption, our methodology is to project a continuation of what we're currently experiencing for the remainder of the year. As we've demonstrated over the past couple of quarters, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, seeking substitute materials, driving further productivity and raising prices. We successfully narrowed the price inflation gap in Q1 as demonstrated by the sequential margin expansion of PSM. And given the magnitude of the continuing inflationary pressure, there should be no surprise that we're currently implementing further price increases and productivity initiatives.
As we said last quarter, the uncertainty about the timing of when we close the price inflation gap remains one of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. 
And as for the tax rate, we're now assuming it to be in the mid-20s at the high-end of our previous range. Netting these puts and takes based on the estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, our EPS and free cash flow guidance are unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 million to $350 million.
Overall, we remain confident about our position and prospects. We're expecting another year of solid revenue growth driven by strength in PSM and RBIS. We expect to close the price inflation gap and see margin expansion in PSM. RBIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom lines. Free cash flow will remain strong and reflecting the strength of our balance sheet, we've shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction to returning more cash to shareholders. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

We knew when we got the big full guide from some of our customers in the fourth quarter that Q1 would be unusually soft. And if you read some of the announcements from the office superstores, you could see the retail foot traffic was down pretty substantially, especially in January, because of the bad weather. And as you might expect, they weren't really interested in building inventories so pretty much came in right where we thought. And you have to realize given our strong seasonality, especially for back-to-school and the fact that most of the new product programs that customers are excited about really won't hit until the back half of the year. That revenue for us was less than 20% of the full year guidance. So it will be a much different story for the back half -- for the next three quarters, actually. Now it's still going to be lower than it was in the prior year and I think we've been really clear about that."

The inventory to sales ratio that I was referring to has to do with footwear and soft goods, which we have talked about in various seminars and of course, investor meetings.

Some are raising prices on certain apparel items right now and they're trying to make -- they're trying to test and see what the consumer reaction will be to some of those apparel price increases. I don't think we've had apparel price increases for 20 years in this country, so it is a little bit new territory that they're breaking into. So far, it doesn't seem to have impacted overall volume, but we'll see as the year progresses. On the pressure sensitive side, I've been pleasantly surprised, especially in Europe with overall buy-in demands, and when I read the all the news coming out of Europe, sometimes it surprises me. Some of that of course is related to Eastern Europe which still remains pretty strong, but even Western Europe has been strong. And I think North America's also held up pretty well.

We remind you that these unaudited results are preliminary as we have not yet filed our 10-Q.
Our news release references GAAP operating margin, which includes the interest expense restructuring and other charges included in the other expense line of our P&L. Restructuring charges tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on non-GAAP operating margins, which reflects pretax results before their effect and before interest expense. This and other non-GAAP financial measures that we use are reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.
We also remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements  are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to uncertainty. The safe harbor statement included in the documents that we've provided today, along with our 2010 Form 10-K address certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations.

First, to close the price inflation gap from the second half of 2010. Second, to continue the positive trajectory for RBIS, improving both sales and margins. Third, to invest in the turnaround of Office and Consumer Products by launching a pipeline of new products. I'll discuss the first quarter in terms of these priorities.
All of you know that the first quarter is our lowest revenue quarter because of the seasonality of RBIS and Office and Consumer Products. 
Given that seasonality, our results were consistent with our plan and we remain on track for 2011. Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered another quarter of solid top line growth with net sales up 10%, with continuing strength in emerging markets as well as in Europe. 
More important though, was the sequential improvement in margins for this segment. Our ability to pass through price increases make material substitutions and increased productivity all contributed to this sequential improvement. 
Inflation continues to accelerate in this sector as we see increases in paper, film and chemicals. As a result, we are increasing the magnitude and frequency of our price increases and as well as raising our targets for material reengineering and productivity improvement. I'm confident we'll continue to make progress in margin improvement.
Retail Branding and Information Solution had another strong quarter. The 9% sales growth was driven by market volume growth as well as customer program wins resulting from our improved service, RFID rollouts and new products. There is some concern among retailers and brand owners about the consumer's reaction to higher apparel prices, as well as the pocketbook squeeze from higher food and fuel prices. So far, apparel sales had held up well and the inventory to sales ratio for soft goods continues to be at historical low. We'll understand the trend better as the quarter unfolds. 
Also the solutions that RBIS provides not only enable brands to differentiate themselves, they also improve supply chain performance and help retailers manage their inventories more effectively. Given the current market environment, that's a real plus. So my confidence level in this business and its execution remain high.
As expected, Office and Consumer Products had a tough quarter. Sales volumes were down 13% due to customer inventory reduction from prior year forward VIES, plus a softer retail environment that was partially weather-related. Now while Q1 is always soft, this year's first quarter sales represent less than 20% of Office and Consumer Products' full year sales volume. And given the high variable margins in this segment, operating margins were very low in the first quarter. 
Our focus has been on launching new products with the goal of $20 million to $30 million in new product sales during 2011. Customer commitments for these new products are on track with our target. A combination of these new products plus the normal seasonal impact of back-to-school will drive improved sales trends and enable us to achieve our full year margin targets for this business.
To sum up, despite the dramatic increase in inflation, we are maintaining the full year earnings guidance we provided in early February. We also expect to meet our free cash flow target for the year and we remain committed to returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now, Mitch will go through the quarter in more detail."

As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding a",996,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 8. Sales in the first quarter were up as reported and organically about 7%, currency had little impact on sales in Q1. 
As Dean mentioned, Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions again delivered solid top line growth, more than offsetting the decline in Office and Consumer Products. 
Our consolidated operating margin declined in the first quarter as expected to 5.4%, driven largely by inflation in PSM and margin compression at OCP, offset somewhat by another quarter margin expansion in RBIS. 
Raw material cost in the first quarter came in pretty much as expected and we made good progress offsetting inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we discussed last quarter. Now inflationary pressure again picked up significantly in both March and April, and we are implementing further actions to offset this new inflation. I'll talk more about that in a moment.
While our marketing general and administrative expense ratio was flat in the prior year, MD&A increased in absolute dollars. 
As we've discussed, we've stepped up growth in IT infrastructure related investments. We also had a warehouse fire in Brazil that cost about $4 million in the quarter. Now before getting into the segments, I just want to point out that our adjusted tax rate increased from 22% to 25% in the first quarter, reflecting our expectation of reduced benefits from discrete tax events this year.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment again delivered strong organic revenue growth of 10%, driven by volume gains and price in both our Label and Packaging Materials businesses and in Graphics and Reflective solutions. PSM's volume growth was a little over 5% led by emerging markets. While PSM's operating margin in the quarter was down 90 basis points year-over-year, margin versus the fourth quarter went up 130 basis points, due to our progress in offsetting raw material inflation. We've talked a lot about our pricing ability and productivity gains in this business and we made great progress in offsetting inflation in the first quarter.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered organic sales growth at 9% in the quarter. This business is making great progress in the top and bottom line with operating margin expanding 250 basis points in the quarter. We continue to build momentum and with a strong operating leverage in this business, expect continued margin expansion as we grow. Keep in mind that the sequential decline in operating margin reflects the seasonality of this business. The first quarter is typically the segment's smallest and the second quarter, typically is largest.
Dean covered Office and Consumer Products which came in largely as expected. Q1 is also a seasonally low quarter for this business and it was compounded by the Q4 customer inventory build, which reduced Q1 sales and profits. We continue to expect margins in this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year.
Our other specialty converting businesses again had solid sales growth in the quarter. Most of the cost of the warehouse fire in Brazil, that I mentioned earlier, impacted these businesses. 
Moving onto the outlook for 2011. On Slide 12, we've summarized the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 13 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter.
We now estimate organic revenue growth in 2011 of approximately 7%, reflecting our large and growing presence in emerging markets and benefits from our investments and growth, as well as less from pricing actions. The increase in our revenue assumption from last quarter is due primarily to price. 
Now obviously, currencies have moved since January and at March rates, currency would add $18 million of EBIT year-over-year. 
As for inflation, last quarter, we expected $140 million to $150 million of inflation, but inflationary pressure rose dramatically in March and April as I mentioned earlier. We're now experiencing approximately $220 million of raw material inflation year-over-year and it's across most of the materials that we buy. Paper is up, chemicals are up and films are up.
A sidenote from those not familiar with how we derive our inflation assumption, our methodology is to project a continuation of what we're currently experiencing for the remainder of the year. As we've demonstrated over the past couple of quarters, we are working to mitigate this inflation by leveraging our global vendor network, seeking substitute materials, driving further productivity and raising prices. We successfully narrowed the price inflation gap in Q1 as demonstrated by the sequential margin expansion of PSM. And given the magnitude of the continuing inflationary pressure, there should be no surprise that we're currently implementing further price increases and productivity initiatives.
As we said last quarter, the uncertainty about the timing of when we close the price inflation gap remains one of the key factors driving the range in our EPS guidance. 
And as for the tax rate, we're now assuming it to be in the mid-20s at the high-end of our previous range. Netting these puts and takes based on the estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, our EPS and free cash flow guidance are unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3 to $3.30 and free cash flow of $325 million to $350 million.
Overall, we remain confident about our position and prospects. We're expecting another year of solid revenue growth driven by strength in PSM and RBIS. We expect to close the price inflation gap and see margin expansion in PSM. RBIS will continue to build momentum in both its top and bottom lines. Free cash flow will remain strong and reflecting the strength of our balance sheet, we've shifted the focus of free cash flow from debt reduction to returning more cash to shareholders. 
Now we'd be happy to take your questions."

We knew when we got the big full guide from some of our customers in the fourth quarter that Q1 would be unusually soft. And if you read some of the announcements from the office superstores, you could see the retail foot traffic was down pretty substantially, especially in January, because of the bad weather. And as you might expect, they weren't really interested in building inventories so pretty much came in right where we thought. And you have to realize given our strong seasonality, especially for back-to-school and the fact that most of the new product programs that customers are excited about really won't hit until the back half of the year. That revenue for us was less than 20% of the full year guidance. So it will be a much different story for the back half -- for the next three quarters, actually. Now it's still going to be lower than it was in the prior year and I think we've been really clear about that."

So when you look at the -- what we've commented on about the level of increase, there is a good amount of currency in some of those changes. And most of the changes are due to just growth overall, with the one exception being inventory. In inventory, there was a couple of additional things that we built inventory in the first quarter. One was around just -- we potentially did in Europe around the system implementation around the end of the quarter. We were going to shut the plant down for a little bit, so we built up some inventory for that. And two, is also because of the inflation, we pre-boxed some materials ahead of some price increases.

I want to start to say that I recognize the news that we gave you last week both unexpected and unpleasant. Organic growth x currency was down about 2% for the second quarter, compared to the 6.5% growth we saw in the first quarter. We experienced unexpected slowdown in all geographies and as well most of our businesses with the exception of our Office and Consumer Products business. 
Starting with Retail Branding and Information Solutions, sales decreased 6% on an abrupt decline in unit volumes across all customer groups and geographies, which pressured profits in this high variable margin business. A major factor in the order decline was the dramatic run-up in material and labor cost for apparel, which impacted retailers in 2 ways. First, very cautious about ordering garments with higher unit costs with correspondingly higher prices, especially in environment of uncertain consumer demand. Cotton prices and other material input peaked and then dropped rapidly in the quarter. This should costs unit cost for apparel to drop later this year, but because of that, our customers delayed or canceled orders to make sure they did not end up with large inventories of higher cost goods. Combined, these dynamics have the most impact on apparel, destined for the mass-market channel in the U.S. With unit volumes down significantly due to the magnitude of price increases on lower-priced garments, as well as a lack of consumer buying power and lower income levels.
While we expected a somewhat softer season this year due to the anticipated higher costs, we do not expect a rapid reduction in cotton and 
Other input prices. We expect the softness to continue until later this year and that's when retailers placed their orders for the 2012 season.
Turning to Pressure-sensitive Materials, it seems clear that overall economic activity slowed during the second quarter. We serve a wide range of end markets and Pressure-sensitive Materials, including food, durable goods and health and personal care. We also sell thousands of labor converters all over the world. And that makes it difficult to link our sales to end consumer sales. However, historically, this business has been a leading indicator for economic activity.
Labeling and Packaging Materials saw unit volume decline in every region, including emerging markets. Net sales on an organic basis were flat over last year because pricing actions offset the volume decline. This represents a big change from the first quarter when net sales grew almost 10%. It appears that like apparel, retailers and brands, consumer packaged goods companies are gaining cautious about consumer spending in the second half and are managing inventories tightly.
Label and Packaging Materials has led the industry on price increases that cover inflation and we made progress on narrowing the price inflation gap that developed in the second half of last year. As you know, we've been pushing prices up aggressively as raw material cost have escalated. As volumes softened in June, pricing became more challenging as competitors try to hang onto volumes and this happened especially in Europe. Now, at this point, we don't have any shared data from any of our markets, but we believe we may have lost a bit of share in the quarter as we prioritized getting our prices up. Now it's normal for us to lose a bit of share on the margin as we raise prices. So I'm confident that most of the volume losses related to lower market demand.
Now if there is a silver lining to this market softness, it's that we don't see inflation accelerating as it has for the last 5 quarters. I'm pleased that we've recovered most of the margin loss caused by inflation. It is likely we'll have to raise prices though in certain geographies and product lines to offset some of the remaining gap.
It's tough to predict how the rest of the year will play out. We have limited forward visibility in this business since we shipped out 80% of our orders in a 2-day window. We don't know yet if the lower activity level represents a shorts slowdown or a beginning of a more protractive trend. Our Other pressure sensitive business, Graphics and Reflective solutions had a good quarter, led by strong sales of new film products. 
Office and Consumer Products volumes sales and margin declined year-over-year as expected. We're  on track to launch new products in the second half, which combined with the Back-to-School season, will help Office and Consumer Products improved sales trends and meet its full year margin targets.
Given the trends in the quarter, we're assuming that a continuation of the market slowdown through year end is a real possibility and our updated guidance reflects that. We built in some very modest improvement in volumes, but also uncertainty about when in the second half it might occur. 
We're cutting expenses, setting our belts and reducing capital expenditures by $25 million, as well as evaluating additional opportunities to improve productivity. Our goal is to reduce expenses without sacrificing investment for the future.
Finally, although we do reduce guidance for free cash flow for the year, we remain focus on generating substantial free cash flow in the second half. We're committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now Mitch will take you through the details of the quarter."

Sales in the second quarter were up as reported by 3% but down about 2% organically. As Dean discussed, volume was the driver of the organic sales decline, particularly in our Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment. Volumes for the company were down approximately 5%, dropping up dramatically in June, historically the largest month in the quarter. The volume declines of course impacted our second quarter consolidated operating margin. Our operating margin of 8.2% was down 80 basis points from last year as the negative impact of lower volume was partially offset by a reduction in employee related costs, including lower expense for incentive compensation.
We've talked a lot about rising raw material cost over the last few quarters and they remain high. We've made great progress in offsetting inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we were talking about during our past few earnings report. 
As for marketing general and administrative expense, it declined versus last year due to lower employee related costs. Last quarter, we talked about stepping up growth in IT infrastructure related investments. We're still making investments in our most promising and potential initiatives will be reduced cost across the rest of the company, both structural changes and general belt-tightening.
Before getting into the segment, I want to point out that our year-to-date adjusted tax rate increase from 23% to 29%, largely reflecting an increased portion of our profit now expected to be in higher tax rate jurisdiction. 
I also want to comment on our year-to-date free cash flow, which included a net outflow in the second quarter very atypical for us. This net out flow is largely due to a combination of lower operating results and additional $25 million pension payments and changes in working capital. 
Now the changes -- the working capital changes primarily relates to the timing of cash payments for inventory. While we reduced inventories in the second quarter from the relatively high levels in Q1, the benefits of free cash flow will occur in the third quarter. These working capital changes and pension payments while negative for the quarter in the first half are not expected to impact the full year.
Now I'm sure you have noticed that our fee cash flow was out up sync with earnings in the quarter. This is largely because of reduction in our expectations for employee costs in 2011 are noncash this year and will not benefit free cash flow until the first quarter of next year.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered roughly flat organic sales growth, driven by declines in volume, largely offset by pricing. PSM volumes reflected year-over-year decline and all of label and packaging materials regions and the most categories. Volume in Graphics and Reflective solutions was up in the quarter. Dean said that a violence in the second quarter won't repeat them here. PSM's operating margin quarter was down 20 basis points year-over-year reflecting the decline in volumes and lower employee related costs. Sequentially, margin benefited from our narrowing of the price inflation gap.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions turned a 6% decline in organic sales in the second quarter, traditionally this segment, largest quarter of the year. The lower sales were due to lower unit volumes reflecting the softness in the market of our apparel 
units that Dean discussed earlier. 
With a decline in volumes, the relatively high operated have at this business work against us this quarter. More than you can see, the 140 basis point drop due to our lower employee related costs. Dean covered Office and Consumer products, which came in as expected. The second quarter is seasonally higher quarter for this business relative to Q1 as it includes part of the Back-to-School season, which concludes in Q3. We continue to expect margins for this business to be in the upper single-digit for the full year. And our Other Specialty Converting business delivered flat sales growth in the quarter with margins up 90 basis points from last year.
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 13, we summarized the key factors that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter. 
We now estimate organic sales growth in 2011 of approximately 1.5% to 3.5%, a big difference from the 7% assumption we made last quarter. Our current uncertainly about the market causes us to provide a pretty wide range for the top line in the second half.
We've increased our restructuring actions since last quarter and have accordingly increased our expectations of the cost to implement these actions. annualized savings associated with 2011 restructuring actions are expected to total approximately $40 million, at about 1/3 of the benefit to be realized this year. We continue to evaluate further opportunities to reduce cost, potentially including additional restructuring actions. And we've reduced our estimate for capital expenditures for the year by $25 million. 
Based on estimated sales and other assumptions including the listed factors, we now expect adjusted earnings for share in 2011 of $2.45 to $2.75. And free cash flow of $250 million to $275 million.
Notwithstanding the recent slowdown, we are confident our public is in a prospect our businesses up marketed which is it would be a competitive advantages and even with our guidance for free cash flow in 2011, we will maintain our financial strength, achieving our targeted debt level again later this year, and then increasing our return of cash to shareholders. 
Now I would be happy to take your questions."

So I'd say there might have been a very small amount of shifting and I can't really quantify it because most of the evidence we have is anecdotal at this point. So in Retail Branding and Information Services, the first -- some of the first quarter sales, I think were stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter because frankly people were just trying to get ahead of some of the unit costs that were coming in. And people at that point expected input cost to keep going up at the time so there were kind of buying early in the inflationary environment. That, of course, shifted pretty dramatically in the second quarter once cotton prices started to collapse. We may have had the a little bit of pre-buying in the Pressure-sensitive Materials, it would have been very small as a percentage of the total, so not really meaningful. And as part of the share position, we did see, in Europe, typically June is a pretty strong month for the Labeling and Packaging Materials business there. Because people are doing a lot of work before the summer holidays, the Food business tends to be very strong at that point of view and we just didn't see a search that we normally saw and some competitors , I think,  in a weakening environment, just couldn't offered to delay some price increases. The problem is we don't have that any market share data and we wont have it for a few weeks. I wish I could be more precise on that, but we just can't, at this point."

252978,136767687,146401,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2011",2011-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric.

I want to start to say that I recognize the news we gave you last week was both unexpected and unpleasant. Organic growth ex-currency was down about 2% for the second quarter compared to the 6.5% growth we saw in the first quarter. We experienced unexpected slowdown in all geographies, and as well most of our businesses, with the exception of our Office and Consumer Products business. 
Starting with Retail Branding and Information Solutions, sales decreased 6% on an abrupt decline in unit volumes across all customer groups and geographies, which pressured profits in this high variable margin business. A major factor in the order decline was the dramatic run-up in material and labor cost for apparel, which impacted retailers in 2 ways. First, it caused them to be very cautious about ordering garments with higher unit costs with correspondingly higher prices, especially in an environment of uncertain consumer demand. 
Cotton prices and other material inputs peaked and then dropped rapidly in the quarter. This should cause unit costs for apparel to drop later this year. But because of that, our customers delayed or canceled orders to make sure they did not end up with large inventories of higher cost goods. Combined, these dynamics have the most impact on apparel, destined for the mass-market channel in the U.S., with unit volumes down significantly due to the magnitude of price increases on lower-priced garments, as well as the lack of consumer buying power at lower-income levels.
While we expected a somewhat softer season this year due to the anticipated higher costs, we do not expect a rapid reduction in cotton and 
Other input prices. We expect the softness to continue until later this year, and that's when retailers place their orders for the 2012 season.
Turning to Pressure-sensitive Materials, it seems clear that overall economic activity slowed during the second quarter. We serve a wide range of end markets in Pressure-sensitive Materials, including food, durable goods and health and personal care. We also sell thousands of label converters all over the world, and that makes it difficult to link our sales to end consumer sales. However, historically, this business has been a leading indicator for economic activity.
Labeling and Packaging Materials saw unit volume decline in every region, including emerging markets. Net sales on an organic basis were flat over last year because pricing actions offset the volume decline. This represents a big change from the first quarter when net sales grew almost 10%. It appears that like apparel, retailers and brands, consumer packaged goods companies are being cautious about consumer spending in the second half and are managing inventories tightly.
Label and Packaging Materials has led the industry on price increases that cover inflation, and we made progress on narrowing the price inflation gap that developed in the second half of last year. As you know, we've been pushing prices up aggressively as raw material costs have escalated. As volumes softened in June, pricing became more challenging as competitors tried to hang onto volume, and this happened especially in Europe. Now, at this point, we don't have any shared data from any of our markets, but we believe we may have lost a bit of share in the quarter as we prioritized getting our prices up. Now it's normal for us to lose a bit of share on the margin as we raise prices. So I'm confident that most of the volume losses related to the lower market demand.
Now if there is a silver lining to this market softness, it's that we don't see inflation accelerating as it has for the last 5 quarters. I'm pleased that we've recovered most of the margin loss caused by inflation. It is likely we'll have to raise prices though in certain geographies and product lines to offset some of the remaining gap.
It's tough to predict how the rest of the year will play out. We have limited forward visibility in this business since we shipped out 80% of our orders in a 2-day window. We don't know yet if the lower activity level represents a short slowdown or the beginning of a more protracted trend. Our other Pressure-Sensitive business, Graphics and Reflective solutions had a great quarter, led by strong sales of new cast film products. 
Office and Consumer Products volumes, sales and margin declined year-over-year as expected. We're  on track to launch new products in the second half, which combined with the back-to-school season, will help Office and Consumer Products improve sales trends and meet its full year margin targets.
Given the trends in the quarter, we're assuming that a continuation of the market slowdown through year end is a real possibility, and our updated guidance reflects that. We built in some very modest improvement in volumes but also uncertainty about when in the second half it might occur. 
We're cutting expenses, tightening our belts and reducing capital expenditures by $25 million, as well as evaluating additional opportunities to improve productivity. Our goal is to reduce expenses without sacrificing investment for the future.
Finally, although we've reduce guidance for free cash flow for the year, we remain focused on generating substantial free cash flow in the second half. We're committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now Mitch will take you through the details of the quarter."

Sales in the second quarter were up as reported by 3% but down about 2% organically. As Dean discussed, volume was the driver of the organic sales decline, particularly in our Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment. Volumes for the company were down approximately 5%, dropping up dramatically in June, historically, the largest month in the quarter. The volume declines, of course, impacted our second quarter consolidated operating margin. Our operating margin of 8.2% was down 80 basis points from last year, as the negative impact of lower volume was partially offset by a reduction in employee-related costs, including lower expense from incentive compensation.
We've talked a lot about rising raw material cost over the last few quarters and they remain high. We've made great progress in offsetting inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we've talking about during our past few earnings reports. 
As for marketing, general and administrative expense, it declined versus last year due to lower employee-related costs. Last quarter, we talked about stepping up growth in IT infrastructure related investments. We're still making investments in our most promising and critical initiatives while we reduce costs across the rest of the company, both through structural changes and general belt-tightening.
Before getting into the segment, I want to point out that our year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 23% to 29%, largely reflecting an increased portion of our profit now expected to be in higher tax rate jurisdiction. 
I also want to comment on our year-to-date free cash flow, which included a net outflow in the second quarter, very atypical for us. This net outflow is largely due to the combination of lower operating results and additional $25 million pension payments and changes in working capital. 
Now the changes -- the working capital changes primarily relates to the timing of cash payments for inventories. While we reduced inventories in the second quarter from the relatively high levels in Q1, the benefits of free cash flow will occur in the third quarter. These working capital changes and pension payments, while negative to the quarter in the first half, are not expected to impact the full year.
Now I'm sure you've noticed that our fee cash flow was out-of-sync with earnings in the quarter. This is largely because of reduction in our expectations for employee-related costs in 2011 are noncash this year and will not benefit free cash flow until the first quarter of next year.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered roughly flat organic sales growth, driven by declines in volume, largely offset by pricing. PSM's volume reflected year-over-year decline in all of Label and Packaging Materials regions and the most categories. Volume in Graphics and Reflective solutions was up in the quarter. Dean shared with you our insights to the volumes in the segment, so I won't repeat them here. PSM's operating margin in the quarter was down 20 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the decline in volume and of lower employee-related costs. Sequentially, margin benefited from our narrowing of the price inflation gap.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions turned in a 6% decline in organic sales in the second quarter, traditionally, this segment's largest quarter of the year. The lower sales were due to lower unit volumes reflecting the softness in the market for our apparel units that Dean discussed earlier. 
With the decline in volumes, the relatively high operating leverage in this business worked against us this quarter, more than you can see in the 140 basis point drop due to our lower employee-related costs. Dean covered Office and Consumer products, which came in as expected. The second quarter is a seasonally higher quarter for this business relative to Q1, as it includes part of the back-to-school season which concludes in Q3. We continue to expect margins for this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year. And our Other Specialty Converting businesses delivered flat sales growth in the quarter, with margins up 90 basis points from last year.
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 13, we summarized the key factors that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we've discussed last quarter. 
We now estimate organic sales growth in 2011 of approximately 1.5% to 3.5%, a big difference from the 7% assumption we made last quarter. Our current uncertainty about the market causes us to provide a pretty wide range for the top line in the second half.
We've increased our restructuring actions since last quarter and have accordingly increased our expectation of the cost to implement these actions. Annualized savings associated with 2011 restructuring actions are expected to total approximately $40 million. That's about 1/3 of the benefits to be realized this year. We continue to evaluate further opportunities to reduce cost, potentially including additional restructuring action, and we've reduced our estimate for capital expenditures for the year by $25 million. 
Based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including a list of factors, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in 2011 of $2.45 to $2.75, and free cash flow of $250 million to $275 million.
Notwithstanding the recent slowdown, we are confident about our position and prospects. Our businesses have market-leading positions with clear competitive advantages. And even with our lowered guidance for free cash flow in 2011, we will maintain our financial strength, achieving our targeted debt level again later this year, and then increasing our return of cash to shareholders. 
Now I would be happy to take your questions."

So I'd say there might have been a very small amount of shifting, and I can't really quantify it because most of the evidence we have is anecdotal at this point. So in Retail Branding and Information Services, the first -- some of the first quarter sales, I think, were stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter because frankly, people were just trying to get ahead of some of these unit costs that were coming in because people at that point expected input costs to keep going up at that time. So they were kind of buying early in the inflationary environment. That, of course, shifted pretty dramatically in the second quarter once cotton prices started to collapse. We may have had a little bit of pre-buying in the Pressure-sensitive Materials business, but it would have been very small as a percentage of the total, so not really meaningful. And as part of the share position, we did see, in Europe, typically June is a pretty strong month for the Labeling and Packaging Materials business there because people are doing a lot of work before the summer holidays. The Food business tends to be very strong at that point of view, and we just didn't see the surge that we normally saw. And some competitors, I think,  in a weakening environment, just could have deferred to delay some price increases. The problem is we don't have any market share data and we wont have it for a few weeks. I wish I could be more precise on that, but we just can't at this point."

So cotton prices are already down. The problem is that cotton has not yet been turned into gray goods, which can be put into yarn and fabrics, and that really won't happen until later this year. So most companies are anticipating lower cotton costs and unit costs from a material perspective for 2012. They wont start ordering those products from us until very late in the third and in the fourth quarter. That's when we really start to see our fourth quarter surge in that business. So, yes -- I do see that, and I think there was actually, even in an article in the Wall Street Journal, about some people trying to keep their prices up by just adding units to their packs as a way of giving more to the consumer instead of giving it in price, giving it in unit volumes, which would be okay with us by the way.

I want to start to say that I recognize the news we gave you last week was both unexpected and unpleasant. Organic growth x currency was down about 2% for the second quarter compared to the 6.5% growth we saw in the first quarter. We experienced unexpected slowdowns in all geographies, and as well most of our businesses, with the exception of our Office and Consumer Products business. 
Starting with Retail Branding and Information Solutions, sales decreased 6% on an abrupt decline in unit volumes across all customer groups and geographies, which pressured profits in this high variable-margin business. A major factor in the order decline was the dramatic run-up in material and labor cost for apparel, which impacted retailers in 2 ways. First, it caused them to be very cautious about ordering garments with higher unit costs with correspondingly higher prices, especially in an environment of uncertain consumer demand. 
Cotton prices and other material inputs peaked and then dropped rapidly in the quarter. This should cause unit costs for apparel to drop later this year. But because of that, our customers delayed or canceled orders to make sure they did not end up with large inventories of higher-cost goods. Combined, these dynamics had the most impact on apparel, destined for the mass-market channel in the U.S., with unit volumes down significantly due to the magnitude of price increases on lower-priced garments, as well as the lack of consumer buying power at lower-income levels.
While we expected a somewhat softer season this year due to the anticipated higher costs, we did not expect a rapid reduction in cotton and other input prices. We expect the softness to continue until later this year, and that's when retailers place their orders for the 2012 season.
Turning to Pressure-sensitive Materials, it seems clear that overall economic activity slowed during the second quarter. We serve a wide range of end markets in Pressure-sensitive Materials, including food, durable goods and health and personal care. We also sell thousands of label converters all over the world, and that makes it difficult to link our sales to end consumer sales. However, historically, this business has been a leading indicator for economic activity.
Labeling and Packaging Materials saw unit volume declines in every region, including emerging markets. Net sales on an organic basis were flat over last year because pricing actions offset the volume decline. This represents a big change from the first quarter when net sales grew almost 10%. It appears that like apparel retailers and brands, consumer packaged goods companies are being cautious about consumer spending in the second half and are managing inventories tightly.
Label and Packaging Materials has led the industry on price increases that cover inflation and we made progress on narrowing the price inflation gap that developed in the second half of last year. As you know, we've been pushing prices up aggressively as raw material costs have escalated. As volumes softened in June, pricing became more challenging as competitors tried to hang onto volume and this happened especially in Europe. Now, at this point, we don't have any share data from any of our markets, but we believe we may have lost a bit of share in the quarter as we prioritized getting our prices up. Now it's normal for us to lose a bit of share on the margin as we raise prices. So I'm confident that most of the volume loss is related to lower market demand.
Now if there is a silver lining to this market softness, it's that we don't see inflation accelerating as it has for the last 5 quarters. I'm pleased that we've recovered most of the margin loss caused by inflation. It is likely we'll have to raise prices though in certain geographies and product lines to offset some of the remaining gap.
It's tough to predict how the rest of the year will play out. We have limited forward visibility in this business since we ship out 80% of our orders in a 2-day window. We don't know yet if the lower activity level represents a short slowdown or the beginning of a more protracted trend. Our other Pressure-sensitive business, Graphics and Reflective solutions had a good quarter, led by strong sales of new cast film products. 
Office and Consumer Products volume sales and margin declined year-over-year as expected. We're  on track to launch new products in the second half, which combined with the back-to-school season, will help Office and Consumer Products improve sales trends and meet its full year margin targets.
Given the trends in the quarter, we're assuming that a continuation of the market slowdown through year end is a real possibility and our updated guidance reflects that. We've built in some very modest improvement in volumes but also uncertainty about when in the second half it might occur. 
We're cutting expenses, tightening our belts and reducing capital expenditures by $25 million, as well as evaluating additional opportunities to improve productivity. Our goal is to reduce expenses without sacrificing investment for the future.
Finally, although we've reduce guidance for free cash flow for the year, we remain focused on generating substantial free cash flow in the second half. We're committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now Mitch will take you through the details of the quarter."

Sales in the second quarter were up as reported by 3% but down about 2% organically. As Dean discussed, volume was the driver of the organic sales decline, particularly in our Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions segments. Volumes for the company were down approximately 5%, dropping off dramatically in June, historically the largest month in the quarter. The volume declines, of course, impacted our second quarter consolidated operating margin. Our operating margin of 8.2% was down 80 basis points from last year, as the negative impact of lower volume was partially offset by a reduction in employee-related costs, including lower expense for incentive compensation.
We've talked a lot about rising raw material cost over the last few quarters and they remain high. We've made great progress in offsetting inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we've been talking about during our past few earnings reports. 
As for marketing, general and administrative expense, it declined versus last year due to lower employee-related costs. Last quarter, we talked about stepping up growth in IT infrastructure-related investments. We're still making investments in our most promising and critical initiatives while we reduce costs across the rest of the company, both through structural changes and general belt-tightening.
Before getting into the segments, I want to point out that our year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 23% to 29%, largely reflecting an increased portion of our profit now expected to be in higher tax rate jurisdiction. 
I also want to comment on our year-to-date free cash flow, which included a net outflow in the second quarter, very atypical for us. This net outflow is largely due to the combination of lower operating results, an additional $25 million pension payment and changes in working capital. 
Now the changes -- the working capital changes primarily relates to the timing of cash payments for inventories. While we reduced inventories in the second quarter from the relatively high levels in Q1, the benefit to free cash flow will occur in the third quarter. These working capital changes and pension payments, while negative to the quarter in the first half, are not expected to impact the full year.
Now I'm sure you've noticed that our free cash flow was out-of-sync with earnings in the quarter. This is largely because of reduction in our expectations for employee-related costs in 2011 are noncash this year and will not benefit free cash flow until the first quarter of next year.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered roughly flat organic sales growth, driven by declines in volume, largely offset by pricing. PSM's volume reflected year-over-year declines in all of Label and Packaging Materials regions and the most categories. Volume in Graphics and Reflective solutions was up in the quarter. Dean shared with you our insights to the volumes in the segment, so I won't repeat them here. PSM's operating margin in the quarter was down 20 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the decline in volume and of lower employee-related costs. Sequentially, margin benefited from our narrowing of the price inflation gap.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions turned in a 6% decline in organic sales in the second quarter, traditionally, this segment's largest quarter of the year. The lower sales were due to lower unit volume reflecting the softness in the market for our apparel units that Dean discussed earlier. 
With the decline in volumes, the relatively high operating leverage in this business worked against us this quarter, more than you can see in the 140 basis point drop due to our lower employee-related costs. Dean covered Office and Consumer products, which came in as expected. The second quarter is a seasonally higher quarter for this business relative to Q1, as it includes part of the back-to-school season which concludes in Q3. We continue to expect margins for this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year. And our Other Specialty Converting businesses delivered flat sales growth in the quarter, with margins up 90 basis points from last year.
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 13, we summarized the key factors that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter. 
We now estimate organic sales growth in 2011 of approximately 1.5% to 3.5%, a big difference from the 7% assumption we made last quarter. Our current uncertainty about the market causes us to provide a pretty wide range for the top line in the second half.
We've increased our restructuring actions since last quarter and have accordingly increased our expectation of the cost to implement these actions. Annualized savings associated with 2011 restructuring actions are expected to total approximately $40 million with about 1/3 of the benefit to be realized this year. We continue to evaluate further opportunities to reduce cost, potentially including additional restructuring action. And we've reduced our estimate for capital expenditures for the year by $25 million. 
Based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including a list of factors, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in 2011 of $2.45 to $2.75, and free cash flow of $250 million to $275 million.
Notwithstanding the recent slowdown, we are confident about our position and prospects. Our businesses have market-leading positions with clear competitive advantages. And even with our lowered guidance for free cash flow in 2011, we will maintain our financial strength, achieving our targeted debt level again later this year and then increasing our return of cash to shareholders. 
Now I would be happy to take your questions."

So I'd say there might have been a very small amount of shifting, and I can't really quantify it because most of the evidence we have is anecdotal at this point. So in Retail Branding and Information Services, the first -- some of the first quarter sales, I think, were stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter because frankly, people were just trying to get ahead of some of the unit costs that were coming in. Because people at that point expected input costs to keep going up at the time. So they were kind of buying early in the inflationary environment. That, of course, shifted pretty dramatically in the second quarter once cotton prices started to collapse. We may have had a little bit of pre-buying in the Pressure-sensitive Materials business, but it would have been very small as a percentage of the total, so not really meaningful. And as part of the share position, we did see, in Europe, typically June is a pretty strong month for the Labeling and Packaging Materials business there because people are doing a lot of work before the summer holidays. The Food business tends to be very strong at that point of view and we just didn't see the surge that we normally saw. And some competitors, I think, in a weakening environment, could have deferred or delayed some price increases. The problem is we don't have any market share data and we won't have it for a few weeks. I wish I could be more precise on that, but we just can't at this point."

So I still think that the competitors in this industry want to make money and they know they've got to get prices up in a time of rising raw material costs. So I think it was kind of a little sloppy in June in Europe, specifically, when the volume shortfalls -- we had a market volume shortfall, so some folks sometimes on the margins -- some competitors feel that they're better off trying to protect volume in the short term rather than raise prices. So we've seen this before. I do want to point out though that sequentially, we improved margins again in this sector. I mean, that was a priority for us to fill that gap.

I would imagine that would actually help you from a tax standpoint. But if you could provide any more color on that, it would be helpful. And from a restructuring standpoint, obviously, the company has done a lot of this over the years, where are the next areas where perhaps you can further improve and optimize your cost structure, given that you've already done a fair amount of this over the last number of years?"

I want to start to say that I recognize the news we gave you last week was both unexpected and unpleasant. Organic growth x currency was down about 2% for the second quarter compared to the 6.5% growth we saw in the first quarter. We experienced unexpected slowdowns in all geographies, and as well most of our businesses, with the exception of our Office and Consumer Products business. 
Starting with Retail Branding and Information Solutions, sales decreased 6% on an abrupt decline in unit volumes across all customer groups and geographies, which pressured profits in this high variable-margin business. A major factor in the order decline was the dramatic run-up in material and labor cost for apparel, which impacted retailers in 2 ways. First, it caused them to be very cautious about ordering garments with higher unit costs with correspondingly higher prices, especially in an environment of uncertain consumer demand. 
Cotton prices and other material inputs peaked and then dropped rapidly in the quarter. This should cause unit costs for apparel to drop later this year. But because of that, our customers delayed or canceled orders to make sure they did not end up with large inventories of higher-cost goods. Combined, these dynamics had the most impact on apparel, destined for the mass-market channel in the U.S., with unit volumes down significantly due to the magnitude of price increases on lower-priced garments, as well as the lack of consumer buying power at lower-income levels.
While we expected a somewhat softer season this year due to the anticipated higher costs, we did not expect a rapid reduction in cotton and other input prices. We expect the softness to continue until later this year, and that's when retailers place their orders for the 2012 season.
Turning to Pressure-sensitive Materials, it seems clear that overall economic activity slowed during the second quarter. We serve a wide range of end markets in Pressure-sensitive Materials, including food, durable goods and health and personal care. We also sell thousands of label converters all over the world, and that makes it difficult to link our sales to end consumer sales. However, historically, this business has been a leading indicator for economic activity.
Labeling and Packaging Materials saw unit volume declines in every region, including emerging markets. Net sales on an organic basis were flat over last year because pricing actions offset the volume decline. This represents a big change from the first quarter when net sales grew almost 10%. It appears that like apparel retailers and brands, consumer packaged goods companies are being cautious about consumer spending in the second half and are managing inventories tightly.
Label and Packaging Materials has led the industry on price increases that cover inflation and we made progress on narrowing the price inflation gap that developed in the second half of last year. As you know, we've been pushing prices up aggressively as raw material costs have escalated. As volumes softened in June, pricing became more challenging as competitors tried to hang onto volume and this happened especially in Europe. Now, at this point, we don't have any share data from any of our markets, but we believe we may have lost a bit of share in the quarter as we prioritized getting our prices up. Now it's normal for us to lose a bit of share on the margin as we raise prices. So I'm confident that most of the volume loss is related to lower market demand.
Now if there is a silver lining to this market softness, it's that we don't see inflation accelerating as it has for the last 5 quarters. I'm pleased that we've recovered most of the margin loss caused by inflation. It is likely we'll have to raise prices though in certain geographies and product lines to offset some of the remaining gap.
It's tough to predict how the rest of the year will play out. We have limited forward visibility in this business since we ship out 80% of our orders in a 2-day window. We don't know yet if the lower activity level represents a short slowdown or the beginning of a more protracted trend. Our other Pressure-sensitive business, Graphics and Reflective solutions had a good quarter, led by strong sales of new cast film products. 
Office and Consumer Products volume sales and margin declined year-over-year as expected. We're  on track to launch new products in the second half, which combined with the back-to-school season, will help Office and Consumer Products improve sales trends and meet its full year margin targets.
Given the trends in the quarter, we're assuming that a continuation of the market slowdown through year end is a real possibility and our updated guidance reflects that. We've built in some very modest improvement in volumes but also uncertainty about when in the second half it might occur. 
We're cutting expenses, tightening our belts and reducing capital expenditures by $25 million, as well as evaluating additional opportunities to improve productivity. Our goal is to reduce expenses without sacrificing investment for the future.
Finally, although we've reduce guidance for free cash flow for the year, we remain focused on generating substantial free cash flow in the second half. We're committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning more cash to shareholders. 
And now Mitch will take you through the details of the quarter."

Sales in the second quarter were up as reported by 3% but down about 2% organically. As Dean discussed, volume was the driver of the organic sales decline, particularly in our Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions segments. Volumes for the company were down approximately 5%, dropping off dramatically in June, historically the largest month in the quarter. The volume declines, of course, impacted our second quarter consolidated operating margin. Our operating margin of 8.2% was down 80 basis points from last year, as the negative impact of lower volume was partially offset by a reduction in employee-related costs, including lower expense for incentive compensation.
We've talked a lot about rising raw material cost over the last few quarters and they remain high. We've made great progress in offsetting inflation by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we've been talking about during our past few earnings reports. 
As for marketing, general and administrative expense, it declined versus last year due to lower employee-related costs. Last quarter, we talked about stepping up growth in IT infrastructure-related investments. We're still making investments in our most promising and critical initiatives while we reduce costs across the rest of the company, both through structural changes and general belt-tightening.
Before getting into the segments, I want to point out that our year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 23% to 29%, largely reflecting an increased portion of our profit now expected to be in higher tax rate jurisdiction. 
I also want to comment on our year-to-date free cash flow, which included a net outflow in the second quarter, very atypical for us. This net outflow is largely due to the combination of lower operating results, an additional $25 million pension payment and changes in working capital. 
Now the changes -- the working capital changes primarily relates to the timing of cash payments for inventories. While we reduced inventories in the second quarter from the relatively high levels in Q1, the benefit to free cash flow will occur in the third quarter. These working capital changes and pension payments, while negative to the quarter in the first half, are not expected to impact the full year.
Now I'm sure you've noticed that our free cash flow was out-of-sync with earnings in the quarter. This is largely because of reduction in our expectations for employee-related costs in 2011 are noncash this year and will not benefit free cash flow until the first quarter of next year.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered roughly flat organic sales growth, driven by declines in volume, largely offset by pricing. PSM's volume reflected year-over-year declines in all of Label and Packaging Materials regions and the most categories. Volume in Graphics and Reflective solutions was up in the quarter. Dean shared with you our insights to the volumes in the segment, so I won't repeat them here. PSM's operating margin in the quarter was down 20 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the decline in volume and of lower employee-related costs. Sequentially, margin benefited from our narrowing of the price inflation gap.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions turned in a 6% decline in organic sales in the second quarter, traditionally, this segment's largest quarter of the year. The lower sales were due to lower unit volume reflecting the softness in the market for our apparel units that Dean discussed earlier. 
With the decline in volumes, the relatively high operating leverage in this business worked against us this quarter, more than you can see in the 140 basis point drop due to our lower employee-related costs. Dean covered Office and Consumer products, which came in as expected. The second quarter is a seasonally higher quarter for this business relative to Q1, as it includes part of the back-to-school season which concludes in Q3. We continue to expect margins for this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year. And our Other Specialty Converting businesses delivered flat sales growth in the quarter, with margins up 90 basis points from last year.
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 13, we summarized the key factors that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 14 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter. 
We now estimate organic sales growth in 2011 of approximately 1.5% to 3.5%, a big difference from the 7% assumption we made last quarter. Our current uncertainty about the market causes us to provide a pretty wide range for the top line in the second half.
We've increased our restructuring actions since last quarter and have accordingly increased our expectation of the cost to implement these actions. Annualized savings associated with 2011 restructuring actions are expected to total approximately $40 million with about 1/3 of the benefit to be realized this year. We continue to evaluate further opportunities to reduce cost, potentially including additional restructuring action. And we've reduced our estimate for capital expenditures for the year by $25 million. 
Based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including a list of factors, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in 2011 of $2.45 to $2.75, and free cash flow of $250 million to $275 million.
Notwithstanding the recent slowdown, we are confident about our position and prospects. Our businesses have market-leading positions with clear competitive advantages. And even with our lowered guidance for free cash flow in 2011, we will maintain our financial strength, achieving our targeted debt level again later this year and then increasing our return of cash to shareholders. 
Now I would be happy to take your questions."

So I'd say there might have been a very small amount of shifting, and I can't really quantify it because most of the evidence we have is anecdotal at this point. So in Retail Branding and Information Services, the first -- some of the first quarter sales, I think, were stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter because frankly, people were just trying to get ahead of some of the unit costs that were coming in. Because people at that point expected input costs to keep going up at the time. So they were kind of buying early in the inflationary environment. That, of course, shifted pretty dramatically in the second quarter once cotton prices started to collapse. We may have had a little bit of pre-buying in the Pressure-sensitive Materials business, but it would have been very small as a percentage of the total, so not really meaningful. And as part of the share position, we did see, in Europe, typically June is a pretty strong month for the Labeling and Packaging Materials business there because people are doing a lot of work before the summer holidays. The Food business tends to be very strong at that point of view and we just didn't see the surge that we normally saw. And some competitors, I think, in a weakening environment, could have deferred or delayed some price increases. The problem is we don't have any market share data and we won't have it for a few weeks. I wish I could be more precise on that, but we just can't at this point."

The soft volume trends we saw in the second quarter continued into the third quarter and caused sales ex-currency to decline 2%. Unit demand in all key markets continues to reflect both consumer confidence, which is translating into tight inventory management throughout the supply chain. And we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. 
I am pleased that despite the lower volume and ongoing high raw material costs, operating results were in line with the third quarter of last year. The combination of continued pricing discipline, accelerated productivity and lower employee related costs essentially offset the impact of lower unit volume at the EBIT line. At the net income level, the change in our tax rate had a significant impact, which Mitch will discuss in more detail.
We made solid progress in generating free cash flow in the third quarter as well. Our teams did a good job of tightening expenses while at the same time protecting investments in innovation and new products. 
As the past quarter demonstrated, we are launching an increasing number of new products to enhance our competitive advantage and enable faster growth once the economic situation improves. 
Turning to the businesses. Organic sales growth for the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment was 2%. Volume in the quarter was still soft, but we did see a slight improvement in the trend over the second quarter. Margins expanded year-over-year as the impact of price increases and higher productivity offset the impact of inflation.
The recent Labelexpo show in Brussels was well attended and customers were very enthusiastic about all the new products we had in our stand. However, European customers were understandably concerned about the next few quarters due to the uncertain economic conditions in that region. But even in the slowdown, or maybe even because of it, converters were very interested in our new technology and products and that's because they see innovation as a way to grow faster. 
Our Labeling and Packaging Materials business introduced 16 your products with some significant innovation. We're specially excited about ThinStream, a new line of material that is 50% thinner than anything else on the market and which enables better economics to penetrate high volume food and beverage segments. 
We also introduced a new phase film with lower caliber and greater confirmability to better meet the needs for more sustainable lower-cost materials in household and personal care segment.
By wrapping up this segment, sales at Graphics and Reflective Solutions were flat compared with last year ex-currency, Butier lower than in the second quarter, which indicates a downturn in advertising and promotional spending. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions continued to feel the impact of unit volume decline and high apparel input costs, which is cotton work their way through this retail supply chain. We do expect unit volumes to gradually improve as lower input cost begin to come into play subject, of course, to retailers getting confidence in consumer spending. We are projecting an improvement in volume trends in Q4 as retailers begin to order for this season.
We continue to see adoption of RFID unit sagging, which is up more than 50% from last year. Additionally, we expanded our new line of heat transfer solutions called agility, which enables apparel brands to enhance garment exteriors with new high definition graphics that was not available on the market before. 
Even with a 7% decline in organic sales RBIS maintain margins during the quarter through our ELS productivity programs, lower employee related costs and an acceleration of some plan restructuring. This positions us well for margin expansion when unit volume recovers. 
Office and Consumer Products volume, sales and margin declined as expected due to weak end market demand. One notable event for the business was the partnership we announced with Martha Stewart leaving on media and Staples for a line of home organization products that will be available for consumers starting in early 2012. We do anticipate sales from this new line in the fourth quarter of 2011 as we prepare for that launch.
Summing up for the total company, we expect volume to be the story in the fourth quarter as well although we saw a slight improvement in volume trends in September, we believe that any increases in the fourth quarter will be marginally at that especially in Europe. 
We reduced our full year guidance to reflect this volume outlook as well as the increase in our tax rate. Our employees have done a very good job of reducing expenses and focusing on maximizing free cash flow. And we'll continue to do so. 
We also did some targeted restructuring during the quarter to reduce fixed costs. We're always looking for ways to improve productivity, including restructuring and we're evaluating further opportunities to do so. 
At the same time, we're continuing to develop end market innovative new products. Now Mitch will take you through the quarter in more detail."
252978,141109941,178224,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 7. Sales in the third quarter were up as reported by 4%, but down about 2% organically. As Dean discussed, we saw volume decline across all segments. Volumes for the company were down just",1308,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 7. Sales in the third quarter were up as reported by 4%, but down about 2% organically. 
As Dean discussed, we saw volume decline across all segments. Volumes for the company were down just over 4%, somewhat below the low end of our expectations. Negative trend in demand lessened late in the quarter with sales being roughly flat on an organic basis in September. 
Our third quarter operating margin was relatively flat with last year as the negative impact of the lower volume was mostly offset by a reduction in employee related costs, including lower expense for incentive compensation. 
Prices for the specialized raw materials that we buy remain high, but are stabilizing. As we discussed last quarter, we've essentially offset the raw material inflation that we began to experience mid-last year by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we've been talking about for the past few quarters.
As for marketing, general and administrative expense, it declined versus last year due to lower employee related costs and productivity, partially offset by currency. We're reducing cost across the company through both restructuring and general belt-tightening while we continue to protect our investments in growth that Dean discussed earlier. 
Next let me elaborate on our tax rate. Our year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 23% to 34%. The increase in the expected tax rate for this year was the key reason for the short fall in third quarter EPS and along with lower volume is a key contributing factor to our revised earnings guidance for the year. 
The primary reasons for the increased tax rate is our reduced expectation for pretax income outside the U.S. This impacts us in 2 ways. First, lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. are achieved only when we pass certain income thresholds. And second, lower pretax income diminishes our ability to utilize tax loss carry forwards and other tax credits. Another factor relates to discrete tax events, which we now anticipate will have negative impact on the rate this year.
If pretax earnings continues at the current level, we would expect our ongoing tax rate to be in the low '30s in the midterm. As earnings increase about certain income threshold outside the U.S., we would expect the tax rate to be modestly below this range. Now these comments related to the effective tax rate. The ultimate goal of our tax findings is to reduce the amount of tax that is actually paid in any given year as we measure this through the cash tax rate. 
Our cash tax rate have been in the upper 30% range for the past few years, and have been trending down modestly. We expect the tax -- the cash tax rate to again be in this upper 20% range and continue the downward trend in 2011 and for the midterm.
Now before getting into the segment, I want to comment on our free cash flow. In the first half of the year, our free cash flow was well below prior year level due to lower operating results and higher working capital, as well as the timing of pension payments. 
Looking at the third quarter, our free cash flow came in at $189 million. This is in line with our expectations and well ahead of last year due to the significant progress we made in Q3 in returning to more typical working capital levels. 
Turning to Slide 8, our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered 2% organic sales growth, driven by pricing and partially offset by lower volume. PSM to volume in the third quarter was down approximately 2.5%, an improvement over the second quarter's 5% volume decline. This improvement in the trend reflects a moderation in Label and Packaging Materials declines in Europe and an uptick in Asia-Pacific, which we turn to positive volume growth in the quarter. 
In addition to experiencing general softness in our markets, we also commented last quarter that we thought we lost some share in lower margin categories in Europe, well, we in fact did. While we do yet have market or shared data for Q3, we believe that we may have regained a modest amount of the share in the quarter. 
And my last point on sales in PSM relates to Graphics and Reflective solutions. Volumes in this business held up in Q2, but have now experienced a decline, due primarily to softness in Europe. Well remember that this businesses is more cyclical in nature than PSM's larger business, Label and Packaging Materials.
PSM's operating margin increased 50 basis points from prior year as the impact of lower volume was more than offset by lower employee related costs. Our pricing and cost reduction actions have offset the inflation that we began to experience mid last year. The pricing on raw material cost is now stabilizing, we feel that we've achieved a good position on the price cost front in PSM.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales were down 7% on an organic basis in the third quarter. Lower sales were due to a continuation of the trend we saw in Q2 with lower volume reflecting unit softness in the apparel market that Dean discussed earlier. As in the second quarter, the declines were most pronounced among mass-market retailers. RBIS margins were flat in the quarter as the negative impact of volume was offset by productivity and lower employee related costs. In consumer products came in as expected. The third quarter is typically a seasonally higher quarter for this business as it includes part of the back-to-school season, which starts in Q2. 
The operating margin in this business declined due primarily to the effect of lower volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower advertising spend and employee related costs. We continue to expect margins for this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year.
And our Other Specialty Converting businesses delivered modest sales growth in the quarter, driven by pricing from lower volume. Margins were down due to the lower volume partially offset by productivity initiatives. 
Moving onto the outlook for 2011. On Slide 11, we summarized the key factors that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 12 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter. 
We now estimate organic sales growth in 2011 to be roughly flat. Reduction primarily reflects a change to our assumptions for the fourth quarter. The increase our restructuring actions since last quarter and have accordingly increased our expectation of the cost to implement these actions. 
Annualized savings associated with 2011 restructuring actions are now expected to total approximately $55 million, which is about 1/4 of the benefit to be realized this year. We continue to evaluate further opportunities to reduce costs, potentially including additional restructuring actions.
We already discussed our increase in our expected tax rate for the year, that is the negative tax rate impact from our lower outlook for pretax income and other discrete events. And we made an additional $10 million pension contribution to the U.S. plan in the third quarter and we expect to contribute another $10 million in the fourth quarter. Full year pension contributions will approximate the level of last year.
Based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in 2011 of $2.15 to $2.30 and free cash flow of $215 million to $235 million. The low end of our EPS guidance assumes volume trends in Q4 that are consistent with what we experienced in Q3 and the high end reflects volume trends consistent with what we saw in September. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Now that trend is likely to start to reverse as raw material costs have come way down.

These items tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on non-GAAP operating margin, which reflects pretax results before their effect and before interest expense.

The soft volume trends we saw in the second quarter continued into the third quarter and caused sales, ex-currency to decline 2%. Unit demand in all key markets continues to reflect both consumer confidence, which is translating into tight inventory management throughout the supply chain. And we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. 
I am pleased that despite the lower volume and ongoing high raw material costs, operating results were in line with the third quarter of last year. The combination of continued pricing discipline, accelerated productivity and lower employee related costs essentially offset the impact of lower unit volume at the EBIT line. At the net income level, the change in our tax rate had a significant impact, which Mitch will discuss in more detail.
We made solid progress in generating free cash flow in the third quarter as well. Our teams did a good job of tightening expenses while at the same time protecting investments in innovation and new products. 
As the past quarter demonstrated, we are launching an increasing number of new products to enhance our competitive advantage and enable faster growth once the economic situation improves. 
Turning to the businesses. Organic sales growth for the pressure-sensitive materials segment was 2%. Volume in the quarter was still soft, but we did see a slight improvement in the trend over the second quarter. Margins expanded year-over-year as the impact of price increases and higher productivity offset the impact of inflation.
The recent Labelexpo show in Brussels was well attended and customers were very enthusiastic about all the new products we had in our stand. However, European customers were understandably concerned about the next few quarters due to the uncertain economic conditions in that region. But even in a slowdown, or maybe even because of it, converters were very interested in our new technology and products, and that's because they see innovation as a way to grow faster. 
Our Labeling and Packaging Materials business introduced 16 new products with some significant innovations. We're especially excited about ThinStream, a new line of material that is 50% thinner than anything else on the market, and which enables better economics to penetrate high volume food and beverage segments. 
We also introduced a new phase film with lower caliper and greater conformability to better meet the needs for more sustainable, lower-cost materials in the household and personal care segment.
Now wrapping up this segment, sales at Graphics and Reflective Solutions were flat compared with last year ex-currency, but lower than in the second quarter, which indicates a downturn in advertising and promotional spending. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions continue to feel the impact of unit volume decline and as high apparel input costs, which is cotton work their way through this retail supply chain. We do expect unit volumes to gradually improve as lower input cost begin to come into play subject, of course, to retailers gaining confidence in consumer spending. We are projecting an improvement in volume trends in Q4 as retailers begin to order for the spring season.
We continue to see adoption of RFID unit tagging, which is up more than 50% from last year. Additionally, we expanded our new line of heat transfer solutions called agility, which enables apparel brands to enhance garment exteriors with new high definition graphics that was not available on the market before. 
Even with a 7% decline in organic sales, RBIS maintain margins during the quarter through our ELS productivity programs, lower employee-related costs and an acceleration of some planned restructuring. This positions us well for margin expansion when unit volume recovers. 
Office and consumer products volumes, sales and margins declined as expected due to weak end market demand. One notable event for the business was the partnership we announced with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Staples for a line of home organization products that will be available for consumers starting in early 2012. We do anticipate sales from this new line in the fourth quarter of 2011 as we prepare for that launch.
Summing up for the total company, we expect volume to be the story in the fourth quarter as well, although we saw a slight improvement in volume trends in September, we believe that any increases in the fourth quarter will be marginal at that especially in Europe. 
We've reduced our full year guidance to reflect this volume outlook as well as the increase in our tax rate. Our employees had done a very good job of reducing expenses and focusing on maximizing free cash flow. And we'll continue to do so. 
We also did some targeted restructuring during the quarter to reduce fixed costs. We're always looking for ways to improve productivity, including restructuring, and we're evaluating further opportunities to do so. 
At the same time, we're continuing to develop end market innovative new products. Now Mitch will take you through the quarter in more detail."
252978,141109941,178503,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 7. Sales in the third quarter were up as reported by 4%, but down about 2% organically. As Dean discussed, we saw a volume decline across all segments. Volumes for the company were down ju",1310,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 7. Sales in the third quarter were up as reported by 4%, but down about 2% organically. 
As Dean discussed, we saw a volume decline across all segments. Volumes for the company were down just over 4%, somewhat below the low end of our expectations. The negative trend in demand lessened late in the quarter with sales being roughly flat on an organic basis in September. 
Our third quarter operating margin was relatively flat with last year as the negative impact of the lower volume was mostly offset by a reduction in employee related costs, including lower expense for incentive compensation. 
Prices for the specialized raw materials that we buy remain high, but are stabilizing. As we discussed last quarter, we've essentially offset the raw material inflation that we began to experience mid-last year by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we've been talking about for the past few quarters.
As for marketing, general and administrative expense, it declined versus last year due to lower employee related costs and productivity, partially offset by currency. We are reducing cost across the company through both restructuring and general belt-tightening while we continue to protect our investments in growth that Dean discussed earlier. 
Next let me elaborate on our tax rate. Our year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 23% to 34%. The increase in the expected tax rate for this year was the key reason for the short fall in third quarter EPS and along with lower volume, is a key contributing factor to our revised earnings guidance for the year. 
The primary reason for the increased tax rate is our reduced expectation for pretax income outside the U.S. This impacts us in 2 ways. First, lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. are achieved only when we pass certain income thresholds. And second, lower pretax income diminishes our ability to utilize tax loss carry forwards and other tax credits. Another factor relates to discrete tax events, which we now anticipate will have a negative impact on the rate this year.
If pretax earnings continues at the current level, we would expect our ongoing tax rate to be in the low '30s in the midterm. As earnings increase about certain income threshold outside the U.S., we would expect the tax rate to be modestly below this range. Now these comments relate to the effective tax rate. The ultimate goal of our tax funding is to reduce the amount of taxes actually paid in any given year, and we measure this through the cash tax rate. 
Our cash tax rate has been in the upper 20% range for the past few years, and had been trending down modestly. We expect the tax -- the cash tax rate to again be in this upper 20% range and continue the downward trend in 2011 and for the midterm.
Now before getting into the segment, I want to comment on our free cash flow. In the first half of the year, our free cash flow was well below prior year levels due to lower operating results and higher working capital, as well as the timing of pension payments. 
Looking at the third quarter, our free cash flow came in at $189 million. This is in line with our expectations and well ahead of last year due to the significant progress we made in Q3 in returning to more typical working capital levels. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our pressure-sensitive materials segment delivered 2% organic sales growth, driven by pricing and partially offset by lower volume. PSM to volume in the third quarter was down approximately 2.5%, an improvement over the second quarter's 5% volume decline. This improvement in the trend reflects a moderation in label and packaging materials declines in Europe and an uptick in Asia-Pacific, which return to positive volume growth in the quarter. 
In addition to experiencing general softness in our markets, we also commented last quarter that we thought we lost some share in lower margin categories in Europe, well, we in fact did. While we do not yet have market or shared data for Q3, we believe that we may have regained a modest amount of the share in the quarter. 
And my last point on sales  in PSM relates to graphics and reflective solutions. Volumes in this business held up in Q2, but have now experienced the decline, due primarily to softness in Europe. Well remember that this businesses is more cyclical in nature than PSM's larger business, label and packaging materials. 
PSM's operating margin increased 50 basis points from prior year as the impact of lower volume was more than offset by lower employee-related costs. Our pricing and cost reduction actions have offset the inflation that we began to experience mid last year. The pricing on raw material cost now stabilizing, we feel that we've achieved a good position on the price cost front in PSM.
Retail branding and information solutions sales were down 7% on an organic basis in the third quarter. Lower sales were due to a continuation of the trend we saw in Q2 with a lower volume reflecting unit softness in the apparel market that Dean discussed earlier. As in the second quarter, the declines were most pronounced among mass-market retailers. RBIS margins were flat in the quarter as the negative impact of volume was offset by productivity and lower employee-related costs. Profits in consumer products came in as expected. The third quarter is typically a seasonally higher quarter for this business as it includes part of the back-to-school season, which starts in Q2. 
The operating margin in this business declined due primarily to the effect of lower volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower advertising spend and employee related costs. We continue to expect margins for this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year.
And our other specialty converting businesses delivered modest sales growth in the quarter, driven by pricing from lower volume. Margins were down due to the lower volume partially offset by productivity initiatives. 
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 11, we summarized the key factors that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 12 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter. 
We now estimate organic sales growth in 2011 to be roughly flat. Reduction primarily reflects a change to our assumptions for the fourth quarter. With the increase our restructuring actions since last quarter and have accordingly increased our expectation of the cost to implement these actions. 
Annualized savings associated with 2011 restructuring actions are now expected to total approximately $55 million, with about 1/4 of the benefit to be realized this year. We continue to evaluate further opportunities to reduce costs, potentially including additional restructuring actions.
We've already discussed our increase in the expected tax rate for the year, that is the negative tax rate impact from our lower outlook for pretax income and other discrete events. And we made an additional $10 million pension contribution to the U.S. plan in the third quarter and we expect to contribute another $10 million in the fourth quarter. Full year pension contributions will approximate the level of last year.
Based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in 2011 of $2.15 to $2.30 and free cash flow of $215 million to $235 million. The low end of our EPS guidance assumes volume trends in Q4 that are consistent with what we experienced in Q3, and the high end reflects volume trends consistent with what we saw in September. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

So we should see a gradual improvement as we move forward over the next couple of quarters."

We're selling to the same customers, but we're able for example to take our heat transfer technology, which is used on the inside of the garment for care labeling and use that on the exterior garments, which is a whole new market segment for us frankly, and we've got some unique differentiated products there.

These items tend to be fairly disparate in amount, frequency and timing. In light of the nature of these items, we'll focus our margin commentary on non-GAAP operating margin, which reflects pretax results before their effect and before interest expense.

The soft volume trends we saw in the second quarter continued into the third quarter and caused sales, ex-currency to decline 2%. Unit demand in all key markets continues to reflect both consumer confidence, which is translating into tight inventory management throughout the supply chain. And we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. 
I am pleased that despite the lower volume and ongoing high raw material costs, operating results were in line with the third quarter of last year. The combination of continued pricing discipline, accelerated productivity and lower employee related costs essentially offset the impact of lower unit volume at the EBIT line. At the net income level, the change in our tax rate had a significant impact, which Mitch will discuss in more detail.
We made solid progress in generating free cash flow in the third quarter as well. Our teams did a good job of tightening expenses while at the same time protecting investments in innovation and new products. 
As the past quarter demonstrated, we are launching an increasing number of new products to enhance our competitive advantage and enable faster growth once the economic situation improves. 
Turning to the businesses. Organic sales growth for the pressure-sensitive materials segment was 2%. Volume in the quarter was still soft, but we did see a slight improvement in the trend over the second quarter. Margins expanded year-over-year as the impact of price increases and higher productivity offset the impact of inflation.
The recent Labelexpo show in Brussels was well attended and customers were very enthusiastic about all the new products we had in our stand. However, European customers were understandably concerned about the next few quarters due to the uncertain economic conditions in that region. But even in a slowdown, or maybe even because of it, converters were very interested in our new technology and products, and that's because they see innovation as a way to grow faster. 
Our Labeling and Packaging Materials business introduced 16 new products with some significant innovations. We're especially excited about ThinStream, a new liner material that is 50% thinner than anything else on the market, and which enables better economics to penetrate high volume food and beverage segments. 
We also introduced a new phase film with lower caliper and greater conformability to better meet the needs for more sustainable, lower-cost materials in the household and personal care segment.
Now wrapping up this segment, sales at Graphics and Reflective Solutions were flat compared with last year ex-currency, but lower than in the second quarter, which indicates a downturn in advertising and promotional spending. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions continued to feel the impact of unit volume declines as high apparel input costs, which is cotton work their way through this retail supply chain. We do expect unit volumes to gradually improve as lower input cost begin to come into play subject, of course, to retailers gaining confidence in consumer spending. We are projecting an improvement in volume trends in Q4 as retailers begin to order for the spring season.
We continue to see adoption of RFID unit tagging, which is up more than 50% from last year. Additionally, we expanded our new line of heat transfer solutions called agility, which enables apparel brands to enhance garment exteriors with new high definition graphics that was not available on the market before. 
Even with a 7% decline in organic sales, RBIS maintain margins during the quarter through our ELS productivity programs, lower employee-related costs and an acceleration of some planned restructuring. This positions us well for margin expansion when unit volume recovers. 
Office and consumer products volumes, sales and margins declined as expected due to weak end market demand. One notable event for the business was the partnership we announced with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Staples for a line of home organization products that will be available for consumers starting in early 2012. We do anticipate sales from this new line in the fourth quarter of 2011 as we prepare for that launch.
Summing up for the total company, we expect volume to be the story in the fourth quarter as well, although we saw a slight improvement in volume trends in September, we believe that any increases in the fourth quarter will be marginal at best, especially in Europe. 
We've reduced our full year guidance to reflect this volume outlook as well as the increase in our tax rate. Our employees had done a very good job of reducing expenses and focusing on maximizing free cash flow. And we'll continue to do so. 
We also did some targeted restructuring during the quarter to reduce fixed costs. We're always looking for ways to improve productivity, including restructuring, and we're evaluating further opportunities to do so. 
At the same time, we're continuing to develop end-market innovative new products. Now Mitch will take you through the quarter in more detail."
252978,141109941,178679,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 7. Sales in the third quarter were up as reported by 4%, but down about 2% organically. As Dean discussed, we saw a volume decline across all segments. Volumes for the company were down ju",1308,"Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 5 and talking through to Slide 7. Sales in the third quarter were up as reported by 4%, but down about 2% organically. 
As Dean discussed, we saw a volume decline across all segments. Volumes for the company were down just over 4%, somewhat below the low end of our expectations. Negative trend in demand lessened late in the quarter with sales being roughly flat on an organic basis in September. 
Our third quarter operating margin was relatively flat with last year as the negative impact of the lower volume was mostly offset by a reduction in employee related costs, including lower expense for incentive compensation. 
Prices for the specialized raw materials that we buy remain high, but are stabilizing. As we discussed last quarter, we've essentially offset the raw material inflation that we began to experience mid-last year by implementing the productivity initiatives and price increases that we've been talking about for the past few quarters.
As for marketing, general and administrative expense, it declined versus last year due to lower employee related costs and productivity, partially offset by currency. We are reducing cost across the company through both restructuring and general belt-tightening while we continue to protect our investments in growth that Dean discussed earlier. 
Next let me elaborate on our tax rate. Our year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 23% to 34%. The increase in the expected tax rate for this year was the key reason for the short fall in third quarter EPS and along with lower volume, is a key contributing factor to our revised earnings guidance for the year. 
The primary reason for the increased tax rate is our reduced expectation for pretax income outside the U.S. This impacts us in 2 ways. First, lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. are achieved only when we pass certain income thresholds. And second, lower pretax income diminishes our ability to utilize tax loss carry forwards and other tax credits. Another factor relates to discrete tax events, which we now anticipate will have a negative impact on the rate this year.
If pretax earnings continued at the current level, we would expect our ongoing tax rate to be in the low 30s in the midterm. As earnings increase about certain income threshold outside the U.S., we would expect the tax rate to be modestly below this range. Now these comments relate to the effective tax rate. The ultimate goal of our tax planning is to reduce the amount of taxes actually paid in any given year, and we measure this through the cash tax rate. 
Our cash tax rate has been in the upper 20% range for the past few years, and had been trending down modestly. We expect the tax -- the cash tax rate to again be in this upper 20% range and continue the downward trend in 2011 and for the midterm.
Now before getting into the segment, I want to comment on our free cash flow. In the first half of the year, our free cash flow was well below prior year levels due to lower operating results and higher working capital, as well as the timing of pension payments. 
Looking at the third quarter, our free cash flow came in at $189 million. This is in line with our expectations and well ahead of last year due to the significant progress we made in Q3 in returning to more typical working capital levels. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our pressure-sensitive materials segment delivered 2% organic sales growth, driven by pricing and partially offset by lower volume. PSM to volume in the third quarter was down approximately 2.5%, an improvement over the second quarter's 5% volume decline. This improvement in the trend reflects a moderation in label and packaging materials declines in Europe and an uptick in Asia-Pacific, which returned to positive volume growth in the quarter. 
In addition to experiencing general softness in our markets, we also commented last quarter that we thought we lost some share in lower margin categories in Europe, well, we in fact did. While we do not yet have market or share data for Q3, we believe that we may have regained a modest amount of the share in the quarter. 
And my last point on sales in PSM relates to graphics and reflective solutions. Volumes in this business held up in Q2, but have now experienced a decline, due primarily to softness in Europe. You’ll remember that this businesses is more cyclical in nature than PSM's larger business, label and packaging materials. 
PSM's operating margin increased 50 basis points from prior year as the impact of lower volume was more than offset by lower employee-related costs. Our pricing and cost reduction actions have offset the inflation that we began to experience mid last year. The pricing on raw material cost now stabilizing, we feel that we've achieved a good position on the price cost front in PSM.
Retail branding and information solutions sales were down 7% on an organic basis in the third quarter. Lower sales were due to a continuation of the trend we saw in Q2 with a lower volume reflecting unit softness in the apparel market that Dean discussed earlier. As in the second quarter, the declines were most pronounced among mass-market retailers. RBIS margins were flat in the quarter as the negative impact of volume was offset by productivity and lower employee-related costs. Profits in consumer products came in as expected. The third quarter is typically a seasonally higher quarter for this business as it includes part of the back-to-school season, which starts in Q2. 
The operating margin in this business declined due primarily to the effect of lower volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower advertising spend and employee related costs. We continue to expect margins for this business to be in the upper single digits for the full year.
And our other specialty converting businesses delivered modest sales growth in the quarter, driven by pricing on lower volume. Margins were down due to the lower volume partially offset by productivity initiatives. 
Moving on to the outlook for 2011. On Slide 11, we summarized the key factor that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2011. Slide 12 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. I'll highlight just a few key assumptions that have changed from what we discussed last quarter. 
We now estimate organic sales growth in 2011 to be roughly flat. Reduction primarily reflects a change to our assumptions for the fourth quarter. We’ve increase our restructuring actions since last quarter and have accordingly increased our expectation of the cost to implement these actions. 
Annualized savings associated with 2011 restructuring actions are now expected to total approximately $55 million, with about 1/4 of the benefit to be realized this year. We continue to evaluate further opportunities to reduce costs, potentially including additional restructuring actions.
We've already discussed our increase in the expected tax rate for the year, that is the negative tax rate impact from our lower outlook for pretax income and other discrete events. And we made an additional $10 million pension contribution to the U.S. plan in the third quarter and we expect to contribute another $10 million in the fourth quarter. Full year pension contributions will approximate the level of last year.
Based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in 2011 of $2.15 to $2.30 and free cash flow of $215 million to $235 million. The low end of our EPS guidance assumes volume trends in Q4 that are consistent with what we experienced in Q3, and the high end reflects volume trends consistent with what we saw in September. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Europe has been better, its downward trend has been a lot less. Part of that is because I believe we're taking some market share. Part of that is because many of the retailers and brand owners we serve in Europe -- that are based in Europe also have a global footprint. So they're not just focused on European retail sales. And finally, we just don't have as much impact from mass market.

When we --  you take a step back and look at RBIS and Paxar, if we go back to history and look at the benefits, it should have happened from the restructuring and from the synergies. EBIT for RBIS probably in a normal environment, you would have pegged at $200 million or so, and obviously it's been a much more difficult economic environment over the last couple of years than you would've envisioned. Given the backup though, you can't change that. How do you begin to get and recover the value put into Paxar above and beyond what you've already done. I realize you'll do some further restructuring, cost cutting,  but is there anything else that you can do within the business -- within the business model that can help validate the RBIS business within the overall portfolio of Avery?"

Sales volume has been flat for 4 years if you just look across the past history. We overachieved on getting our synergies and cost up. So -- because this is high variable margin business, getting sales growth -- a moderate level of sales growth in this business is very important. At the same time, the playbook on a go forward basis is to invest in the business with a little bit of money to -- for innovation of new products, we've launched again a number of new products in the business that help. We're selling to the same customers, but we're able for example to take our heat transfer technology, which is used on the inside of the garment for care labeling and use that on the exterior garments, which is a whole new market segment for us frankly, and we've got some unique differentiated products there. RFID also continues to track up. So -- and then finally, the last element of what we're doing is we're getting a little more aggressive on selling those same capabilities to retailers based in countries outside of North America and Western Europe. So there's Japan, Russia, India and China, to a certain extent, Brazil. But we really do need to get sales growth in the business, that's one. I think you noticed -- everybody noticed the increase in restructuring that we had announced as part of our third quarter actions. And frankly, a lot of that is focused on continuing to rightsize the fixed costs around the Retail Branding and Information Solutions business. So the playbook is, continue to focus on the top line with some limited investment, if we can continue to work on taking capital out of the business, as well as improve productivity."

We have a very large share of the RFID business, and that's a sea-level discussion, it's major retailers. So we are differentiated in this space because of our footprint and the wide variety of capabilities, so we can bring to bear. And in fact, our unit volume declines in certain segments, such as vertical retail or some of the performance athletic brands, isn’t down very much at all. Our biggest issue this year from a decline point of view has been unit volume declines in mass market, which has really pulled down the average."
