The rising metals price environment conversed with our e",908,"Thanks, John. Those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll begin on Slide 3. In 2010, Newmont generated the highest revenue, net income and operating cash flow in our 90-year history. The rising metals price environment conversed with our emphasis on operational execution and yielded outstanding financial results. Today, we'll discuss our 2010 highlights, but more importantly, we want to begin to tell you how we're leveraging our financial success, and we'll continue that story into Investor Day in April. 
We closed the books on 2010 with over $5.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Our priorities for deploying cash remain consistent with what we've talked with you about before. They're designed to build our business and to maximize shareholder value. First, we are developing our internal project portfolio with about $1.1 billion in consolidated capital spending planned for our major projects at Conga and Hope Bay. Next we're leveraging our superior land position in infrastructure in some of the world's most prolific mining districts. In 2010, we delivered a net reserve increase on our base of well over 90 million ounces. We also continue to focus on near-mine exploration and early-stage development opportunities.
Another way we're building for the future is by pursuing opportunistic M&A. This is evidenced by our announcement earlier this month that we plan to acquire Fronteer Gold. The integration of Fronteer assets, particularly Long Canyon will allow us to develop a district that we believe closely resembles the Carlin Trend, a region where Newmont has established infrastructure and experienced and motivated labor force and key relationships with various stakeholder groups.
While our land position and exploration activities along with opportunistic M&A provide access to new opportunities, our financial resources provide us the flexibility to capitalize on each of those priorities as you can see on Slide 3. 
Taking a closer look at our gold and copper operating margins on Slide 4, you'll see how Newmont has expanded its margins faster than the metal price for three years running. Boosting our operating margins increases our operating cash flow, which we can then deploy back into the business. We are bullish on gold, and the first seven weeks of 2011 certainly support that optimism.
At $1,350 gold, for example, we expect that Newmont will be generating an operating margin of about $760 per ounce, providing additional cash flow to develop our business and increase shareholder value. Excerpts of our outlook are on Slide 5. In 2011, we expect to produce between 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces. This is a slight change from 2010 actuals due to lower expected Batu Hijau production as we move out of the bottom of the pit in Phase 5 more into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher expected Nevada and production. Cost applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per gold ounce in between $1.25 and $1.50 per pound of copper. 
As you've seen with other releases, industry-wide pressures continue to impact CAS across the industry, and we're no different. But as Russell will point out, much of our increase comes from the Batu Hijau change I just mentioned. Capital spending on a consolidated basis is expected to be between $2.7 billion to $3 million, which translates to about $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion on attributable basis and is a substantial increase from last year.
As I mentioned at the start of our call, we're generating considerable cash flow in the current environment. For 2011, this allows us to advance the development of a number of our projects, including Conga and Hope Bay, which collectively represent about 40% of that capital spending. The balance will be spent on a combination of several expansion and optimization projects, routine replacement and a number of new project development and other mine life extensions that we'll talk about briefly. 
Moving to Slide 6. Our 2011 cost applicable to sales are expected to between $560 as $590 per ounce as I mentioned due to lower Batu Hijau and Yanacocha production, which results from lower waste removal and lower grades from higher energy labor costs. 
On Slide 7, we provided a comparison of our 2010 and '11 capital spending, highlighting increased spending at Conga. In addition to that, our 2011 capital plan does encompass continued reinvestment in each of our four regions. A few examples where we're deploying capital include in Nevada where we're spending about $100 million towards Leeville/Turf two of the highest returning projects in our portfolio because they are very near a existing infrastructure. Yanacocha we're spending about $200 million to bring forward the Western oxides project and keep Yanacocha in production. 
In our APAC region about $120 million is going towards the Tanami, KCGM, Waihi and Jundee where we are extending resources in each of those mines. And in Africa, we're excited about putting $75 million more towards the Subika underground development and continuing our Ahafo north early stage work. In addition, we've embarked upon several sustaining capital investments that maintained or extend mine production and boost mill efficiency across our operations. 
Actually sustaining capital as a percentage of total capital spending is lower this year than it was last year. As I stated earlier, we're generating solid cash flow that we'll be deploying back into the business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Russell to discuss in a little more depth our 2010 operating and financial performance."
291795,118084677,105874,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 8 you will see our key operating and financial highlights for 2010. We reported record results driven by strong metal prices and our continued focus on operational execution. Revenue at $9.5 billion",627,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 8 you will see our key operating and financial highlights for 2010. We reported record results driven by strong metal prices and our continued focus on operational execution. Revenue at $9.5 billion, cash from continuing operations of $3.2 billion and adjusted net income of $1.9 billion are all record amounts for the company. 
As you can see on Slide 9, we realized an average price of $1,222 per ounce of gold and $3.43 per pound of copper for the year. And while both were record prices for Newmont, they remain significantly below current spot prices of approximately $1,415 and $4, respectively. Our gold operating margin increased 30% year-over-year to $737 per ounce outpacing the 25% increase in the Gulf price. 
Turning to the fourth quarter comparison on Slide 10. Attributable production was down 7% primarily on lower production from Nevada due to the pit wall failure at the end of 2009 and the cessation of mining at Deep Post at the end of 2009. And from Yanacocha due to lower leach ore placement, transitional ore stockpiling at Yanacocha and lower middle grade due to sequencing. These declines were offset by increased production from Boddington, which commenced commercial production in November 2009. Adjusted net income was up 2% versus the year-ago quarter with higher metal prices offset the impact of lower production and higher operating costs, which I will discuss in more detail on Slide 11.
Slide 11 reconciles our actual cost applicable to sales of $485 per ounce with our original outlook provided in February 2010. Cost applicable to sales for gold were approximately $4 above the midpoint of our original outlook, which was based on $900 gold price assumption and an AUD $0.80 exchange rate assumption. Stronger Australian dollar added $22 per ounce to costs, which were offset by approximately $10 per ounce and hedging gains from our Australian book for net impact of $12 per ounce. 
Lower volumes primarily at Boddington boosted our 2010 budget. Higher gold prices drove higher royalty and workers participation costs, which increased cost by about $7 an ounce. As I've said before, these type of cost increases that are tied to the gold price are ones we are happy to pay, given the significant margin related expansion that occurs. 
On the other hand, we saw favorable by-product credits of $6 an ounce and diesel savings of about $2 an ounce, given our assumption at the beginning of the year of $80 per ounce. Obviously, with the delivery in the broader Middle East, oil prices have escalated significantly in recent weeks. 
Before I turn it over to Guy Lansdown for his reserve and exploration update, I wanted to make a point in regards to reported cost applicable to sales per ounce on a go forward basis. Historically, a significant metric in this business. As a U.S. company, Newmont will not be reporting under IFRS accounting for 2011 or indeed for anytime in the future and what this means reported CAS per ounce number is no longer apples-to-apples comparison with most of our Canadian peers are now reporting under IFRS. These differences can be quite significant and without getting into the details, numerous cost that can be capitalized under IFRS that we will be expensing in 2011 and beyond. Our personal view is that the resulting lack of direct comparability between income statements will result in even more attention to the cash flow statement and company's ability to generate operating cash flows, both an absolute basis but more importantly on a per share basis as a measure of long-term value. Quite frankly, we welcome this attention. 
With that brief diversion into the accounting debits and credits, I will turn it over to Guy."

On to Slide 12. We are particularly encouraged by today's gold and copper reserves report, which affects 8 million new gold ounces in reserves, a 2% growth in depletion and 300 million new pounds of copper, representing a 3% increase over last year. As a large senior gold producer, we are thrilled to be in a position to boost our reserves on a net basis and primarily through the buildup. 
Our 2010 drilling program resulted in total copper reserves at record levels of 9.4 billion pounds and near record reserves of 9 to 3.5 million ounces of gold. North America was the largest contributor to higher gold reserves in 2010 with additions at Leeville Turf, Twin Creeks, Phoenix and La Herradura. Large reserve additions we made at Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region and Ahafo in the Africa region. North America also made the largest contributions for non-reserve mineralization with significant additions of Gold Quarry, Leeville/Turf, Buffalo Valley and Twin Creeks. 
Initial NRM was declared at the Marian Gold Greenfield project, solidifying the exciting potential in the region. As noteworthy contributors to NRM included KCGM and Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region. For 2011, we have budgeted about $360 million for exploration, which covers both expense and capital on a consolidated basis and an increase of over 40% from 2010. 
On Slide 13, you can see the breakdown by region. This larger budget gives us additional flexibility to work on substantial mine life expanding projects such as Subika and Leeville/Turf. With more dollars to invest back into the business, we are focusing on large district potential targets like the sleeping giants in Nevada, which includes Mike, Fiberline, Greater Phoenix and Copper Basin, as well as Elang in Indonesia, Yanacocha in Peru and Merian. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our operational results."

Before we jump into discussing the regional performance, it's important to step back and echo Richard's earlier point about investing in developing our business. Newmont has a total land position of over 32,000 square mil",1501,"Thanks, Guy. Turning to Slide 14. Before we jump into discussing the regional performance, it's important to step back and echo Richard's earlier point about investing in developing our business. Newmont has a total land position of over 32,000 square miles around the globe. The opportunities to invest in our business are rich and varied from traditional oxide deposits to sulfide deposits and gold copper porphyry. We believe we have significant potential to develop new districts across our four regions, and the scope of new development opportunities is nearly equal to that of our existing operations.
On each of our regional slides, we will share our capital spending budget, with a breakout between near mine and sustaining capital. At our Investor Day in April, we'll provide more details on how we are leveraging our existing operations into future development. 
Let's begin our recap of regional performance with North America. Full year 2010 attributable gold production in Nevada decreased 13% due to the completion of underground mining at Deep Post in 2009, lower Gold Quarry ore mine as a result of the pit wall failure, which occurred in December 2009, lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin, partially offset by increased underground mining at Leeville. 
Total ore tons mined were 26% lower mainly due to the Gold Quarry's load failure and the completion of mining at North Lantern in April 2010. Ore placed on leach pad decreased 62% to 4.5 million tons. Cost applicable to sales per ounce increased 11% due to lower production, partially offset by higher by-product credits. 
Full year 2010 attributable gold production at La Herradura increased 54% to 49,000 ounces compared to 2009 due to the commencement of commercial production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits in January 2010 where we've been really pleased with the results. Cost applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% due to higher waste tons mined. 
In 2011, we expect to produce 2 million to 2.1 million attributable ounces in North America at cost applicable to sales of approximately $560 to $600 per ounce. Our North American capital budget is $600 million to $700 million for 2011, which includes building on Hope Bay's successful drill program, which yielded many high-grade intercepts last year. 
Further development in Nevada, including Leeville/Turf and East Carlin, development at Pete Ball and the exit exploration drift, as well as work at the Noche Buena pit in La Herradura in Mexico. As previously announced, Newmont plans to acquire Fronteer Gold, which includes the Long Canyon development project. 
Turning to Slide 15. You'll see how we view Long Canyon in the context of other major gold trends in Nevada. The chart at right shows where Long Canyon is in its current stage of development relative to the other more established gold trends in the region. We believe that it can potentially grow into the next major mineralized trend in Nevada, and we expect to close this transaction in early April.
Turning to Slide 16. Our South American regions performance reflects the maturity of our Yanacocha mine combined with new contributions from La Zanja and development activity at Conga. Full year 2010 Yanacocha gold production attributable to Newmont decreased 27% from the prior year due to mine sequencing resulting in lower leach placements, transitional or stockpiling at La Quinua and lower grade and recovery resulting in lower mill production. Leach tons placed decreased from a record 136 million tons in 2009 to 59 million tons in 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 39% from the prior year due to higher waste material mine, lower production, higher labor, diesel and maintenance costs and higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices. These were partially offset by higher by-product credits.
Attributable gold production was 21,000 ounces in 2010 at La Zanja, which was in its first year of contribution to Newmont's operating results, and we continue to be impressed with the operational leadership from our partners at Buenaventura.
2010 attributable gold production in South America is expected to be approximately 715,000 to 775,000 ounces slightly lower than 2010 actuals, primarily due to lower leach production at Yanacocha. Cost applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2011 to approximately $500 to $550 per ounce, primarily due to lower leach production and higher contracted services and supplies. 
Our South American capital budget is $900 million to $1.1 billion in 2011, which includes construction activity at Conga where we've recently signed our EPC contractor, as well as engaged contractors for mills and motors, the main access road, camp buildings and water treatment plants. Our capital budget also includes development of the Western oxides project in Peru and several sustaining capital projects in the region. 
On Slide 17, our Asia-Pacific region saw a favorable boost in gold and copper production through a full year contribution from our Boddington mine, as well as the best ever gold production from our Batu Hijau mine. 2010 gold production at Boddington was approximately 730,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $590 per ounce. 2010 attributable copper and gold production at Batu Hijau increased 10% and 32%, respectively, in 2010 over the prior year due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore. Unseasonably dry weather permitted extended mining in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. We expect to process stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill commencing in late 2013. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% per ounce and per pound due to higher waste mining, labor and diesel costs.
Across our other Asia-Pacific assets, full year 2010 attributable gold production decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by higher grade, throughput and recovery at KCGM. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to lower production, higher diesel costs and a stronger Australian dollar. 2011 attributable production for the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be approximately 1.9 million to 2 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower production at Batu Hijau. Cost applicable the sales are expected to increase to approximately $600 to $675 per ounce in 2011, primarily driven by lower Batu Hijau production. We expect attributable copper production for the Asia-Pacific operations of approximately 190 million to 220 million pounds. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 per pound in 2011. 
Our 2011 capital spending budget for the Asia-Pacific region is $650 million to $750 million and includes efforts to increase resources and extend mine life at Tanami, Jundee and KCGM. In addition, we are evaluating further expansion opportunities at Boddington and mill optimization at Batu Hijau. 
At Boddington, we developed a revised mine plan in the fourth quarter to deliver the best possible grade to the mill. From a volume standpoint, it's notable that Boddington produced 206,000 attributable ounces of gold in the fourth quarter despite a seven-day total plant shutdown to integrate the six MP 1000 secondary crusher. Today, we are seeing mining performance, processing throughput rates, grades in recovery consistent with our 2011 outlook. Debottlenecking studies have commenced to identify opportunities to optimize production through the existing plant infrastructure and are planned to be complete in the second quarter of this year.
We also continue to promote Boddington's exploration potential as the deposit remains open laterally and at depth. Boddington's reserves remain over 20 million ounces of gold and approximately 40,000 meters of drilling as planned in 2011 as the target opportunities for extensions of the known resource and test regional targets.
Turning to Slide 19. Our Africa region had a terrific year. They continue to deliver a consistent performance and symbolized why we're so excited about Newmont's future growth in this region. Full year attributable gold ounces produced increased 2% to 545,000 ounces due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu and the commencement of production at Amoma in October, which began operations slightly ahead of schedule and under budget. Cost applicable to sales per ounce increased less than 1% to $450 per ounce due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production.
2011 attributable gold production for the Africa operation is expected to be approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces, primarily due to higher expected ore grades. Cost applicable to sales of approximately $485 to $535 per ounce are expected for 2011, primarily as a result of higher energy prices and higher labor and royalty costs. Our 2011 capital budget for Africa is $450 million to $545 million, the bulk of which is allocated to advancing our Akyem project, which will eventually support the doubling of our annual production in this region. In addition, we have capital allocated to the Ahafo North opportunity and to the Subika underground, which is expected to contribute to Newmont's production later this year subject to permitting. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

So I think the board has that flexibility. With respect to your question on free cash flow generation, obviously, it depends on gold price. But given where we are today, I'd say we're $500 million plus of free cash flow with a significant balance sheet to carry that through. So I think to the extent that the market pays for dividends, and we'll associate share increases with that, I think we're prepared to consider that. To the extent that the market prefers growth and we should be investing in our growth platform, we will consider that. The great news about Newmont and our balance sheet and cash flow is we can do both."

As I said, we're doing some more debottlenecking, and we'll look at ways at which we may be able to further optimize that asset considering the $20 million plus reserve base that we have a Boddington. In terms of copper, I think we are seeing copper is copper is performing about in line with the expectations right now. So that's where I'd be sort of projecting it as we go forward. It's always reconciled relatively well with our model, and we don't really see any change in the copper."

A rising metals price environment converged with our",919,"Thanks, John. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll begin on Slide 3. In 2010, Newmont generated the highest revenue, net income and operating cash flow in our 90-year history. A rising metals price environment converged with our emphasis on operational execution and yielded outstanding financial results. Today, we'll discuss our 2010 highlights but more importantly, we want to begin to tell you how we're leveraging our financial success, and we'll continue that story into Investor Day in April. 
We closed the books on 2010 with over $5.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Our priorities for deploying cash remain consistent with what we've talked with you about before. They're designed to build our business and to maximize shareholder value. First, we are developing our internal project portfolio with about $1.1 billion in consolidated capital spending planned for our major projects at Conga, Akyem and Hope Bay. Next, we're leveraging our superior land position and infrastructure in some of the world's most prolific mining districts. In 2010, we delivered a net reserve increase on our base of well over 90 million ounces. We also continue to focus on near-mine exploration and early-stage development opportunities.
Another way we're building for the future is by pursuing opportunistic M&A. This is evidenced by our announcement earlier this month that we plan to acquire Fronteer Gold. The integration of Fronteer's assets, particularly Long Canyon, will allow us to develop a district that we believe closely resembles the Carlin Trend, a region where Newmont has established infrastructure and experienced and motivated labor force and key relationships with various stakeholder groups.
While our land positions and exploration activities along with opportunistic M&A provide access to new opportunities, our financial resources provide us the flexibility to capitalize on each of those priorities, as you can see on Slide 3. 
Taking a closer look at our gold and copper operating margins on Slide 4, you'll see how Newmont has expanded its margins faster than the metal price for three years running. Boosting our operating margins increases our operating cash flow, which we can then deploy back into the business. We are bullish on gold, and the first seven weeks of 2011 certainly support that optimism.
At $1,350 gold, for example, we expect that Newmont will be generating an operating margin of about $760 per ounce, providing additional cash flow to develop our business and increase shareholder value. Excerpts of our outlook are on Slide 5. In 2011, we expect to produce between 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces. This is a slight change from 2010 actuals due to lower expected Batu Hijau production as we move out of the bottom of the pit in Phase 5 more into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher expected Nevada and Ahafo production. Cost applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per gold ounce and between $1.25 and $1.50 per pound of copper. 
As you've seen with other releases, industry-wide pressures continue to impact CAS across the industry, and we're no different. But as Russell will point out, much of our increase comes from the Batu Hijau change I just mentioned. Capital spending on a consolidated basis is expected to be between $2.7 billion to $3 billion, which translates to about $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion on an attributable basis and is a substantial increase from last year.
As I mentioned at the start of our call, we're generating considerable cash flow in the current environment. For 2011, this allows us to advance the development of a number of our projects, including Akyem, Conga and Hope Bay, which collectively represent about 40% of that capital spending. The balance will be spent on a combination of several expansion and optimization projects, routine replacement and a number of new project development and other mine life extensions that we'll talk about briefly. 
Moving to Slide 6. Our 2011 cost applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per ounce, as I mentioned, due to lower Batu Hijau and Yanacocha production, which results from higher waste removal and lower grades and higher energy and labor costs. 
On Slide 7, we provided a comparison of our 2010 and '11 capital spending, highlighting increased spending at Conga and Akyem. In addition to that, our 2011 capital plan though does encompass continued reinvestment in each of our four regions. A few examples where we're deploying capital include: in Nevada where we're spending about $100 million towards Leeville/Turf and Peet Bajo [ph], two of the highest returning projects in our portfolio because they're very near existing infrastructure. At Yanacocha, we're spending about $200 million to bring forward the Western Oxides project and keep Yanacocha in production. 
In our APAC region, about $120 million is going towards the Tanami, KCGM, Waihi and Jundee where we are extending resources in each of those mines. And in Africa, we're excited about putting $75 million more towards the Subika underground development and continuing our Ahafo North early-stage work. In addition, we've embarked upon several sustaining capital investments that maintain or extend mine production and boost mill efficiency across our operations. 
Actually, sustaining capital as a percentage of total capital spending is lower this year than it was last year. As I stated earlier, we're generating solid cash flow that we're redeploying back into the business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Russell to discuss in a little more depth our 2010 operating and financial performance."

Revenue a",657,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 8, you will see our key operating and financial highlights for 2010. We reported record results driven by strong metal prices and our continued focus on operational execution and delivery. Revenue at $9.5 billion, cash from continuing operations at $3.2 billion and adjusted net income of $1.9 billion are all record amounts for the company. 
As you can see on Slide 9, we realized an average price of $1,222 per ounce of gold and $3.43 per pound of copper for the year. And while both were record prices for Newmont, they remain significantly below current spot prices of approximately $1,415 and $4.30 per pound, respectively. Our gold operating margin increased 30% year-over-year to $737 per ounce, outpacing the 25% increase in the gold price. 
Turning to the fourth quarter comparison on Slide 10. Attributable production was down 7% primarily on lower production from Nevada due to the pit wall failure at the end of 2009 and the cessation of mining at Deep Post at the end of 2009. And from Yanacocha due to lower leach ore placement, transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua and lower mill ore grade due to mine sequencing. These declines were offset by increased production from Boddington, which commenced commercial production in November 2009. Adjusted net income was up 2% versus the year-ago quarter, with higher metal prices offset the impacts of lower production and higher operating costs, which I will discuss in more detail on Slide 11.
Slide 11 reconciles our actual cost applicable to sales of $485 per ounce, with our original outlook provided in February 2010. Cost applicable to sales for gold were approximately $4 above the midpoint of our original outlook, which was based on a $900 gold price assumption and an AUD $0.80 exchange rate assumption. Stronger Australian dollar added $22 per ounce to costs, which were offset by approximately $10 per ounce and hedging gains from our Australian book for net impact of $12 per ounce. 
Lower volumes primarily at Boddington boosted our 2010 budget, and given the fixed-cost nature of our business, added $39 [ph] per ounce. Higher gold prices drove higher royalty and workers participation costs, which increased cost by about $7 an ounce. As I've said before, these type of cost increases that are tied to the gold price are ones we are happy to pay, given the significant margin-related expansion that occurs. 
On the other hand, we saw favorable by-product credits of $6 an ounce and diesel savings of about $2 an ounce, given our assumption at the beginning of the year of $80 per ounce West Texas. Obviously, with the unrest in Libya and the broader Middle East, oil prices have escalated significantly in recent weeks. 
Before I turn it over to Guy Lansdown for his reserve and exploration update, I wanted to make a point in regards to reported cost applicable to sales per ounce on a go-forward basis. Historically, a significant metric in this business. As a U.S. company, Newmont will not be reporting under IFRS accounting for 2011 or indeed for anytime in the future. And what this means is that our reported CAS per ounce number is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with most of our Canadian peers are now reporting under IFRS. The differences can be quite significant. And without getting into the details, there are numerous costs that can be capitalized under IFRS that we will be expensing in 2011 and beyond. Our personal view is that the resulting lack of direct comparability between income statements will result in even more attention to the cash flow statement and the company's ability to generate operating cash flows, both an absolute basis but more importantly on a per share basis as a measure of long-term value. Quite frankly, we welcome this attention. 
With that brief diversion into the accounting, debits and credits, I will turn it over to Guy."

On to Slide 12. We are particularly encouraged by today's gold and copper reserves report, which reflects over 8 million new gold ounces in reserves, a 2% growth net of depletion and 300 million new pounds of copper representing a 3% increase over last year. As a large senior gold producer, we are thrilled to be in a position to boost our reserves on a net basis and primarily through the drill bit. 
Our 2010 drilling program resulted in total copper reserves at record levels of 9.4 billion pounds and near record reserves of 93.5 million ounces of gold. North America was the largest contributor to higher gold reserves in 2010, with additions at Leeville/Turf, Twin Creeks, Phoenix and La Herradura. Other large reserve additions we made at Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region and at Ahafo in the Africa region. North America also made the largest contribution to non-reserve mineralization, with significant additions at Gold Quarry, Leeville/Turf, Buffalo Valley and Twin Creeks.  Initial NRM was declared at the Merian Gold greenfield project in Suriname, solidifying the exciting potential in the region. Other noteworthy contributors to NRM included KCGM and Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region. 
For 2011, we have budgeted about $360 million for exploration, which covers both expense and capital on a consolidated basis and is an increase of over 40% from 2010. On Slide 13, you can see the breakdown by region. This larger budget gives us additional flexibility to work on substantial mine life extending projects, such as Subika and Leeville/Turf. With more dollars to invest back into the business, we are focusing on large district potential targets like the sleeping giants in Nevada, which includes Mike, Fiberline, Greater Phoenix and Copper Basin, as well as Elang in Indonesia, Yanacocha Verde in Peru and Merian in Suriname. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our operational results."

Before we jump into discussing the regional performance, it's important to step back and echo Richard's earlier point about investing and developing our business. Newmont has a total land position of over 32,000 square miles around the globe. The opportunities to invest in our business are rich and vary, from traditional oxide deposits to sulfide deposits and gold-copper porphyries. We believe we have significant potential to develop new districts across our four regions, and the scope of new development opportunities is nearly equal to that of our existing operations.
On each of our regional slides, we will share our capital spending budget with a breakout between near mine and sustaining capital. At our Investor Day in April, we'll provide more details on how we are leveraging our existing operations into future development. 
Let's begin our recap of regional performance with North America. Full year 2010 attributable gold production in Nevada decreased 13% due to the completion of underground mining at Deep Post in 2009; lower Gold Quarry ore mine as a result of the pit wall failure, which occurred in December 2009; lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin, partially offset by increased underground mining at Leeville. 
Total ore tons mined were 26% lower mainly due to the Gold Quarry slope failure and the completion of mining at North Lantern in April 2010. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 62% to 4.5 million tons. Cost applicable to sales per ounce increased 11% due to lower production, partially offset by higher by-product credits. 
Full year 2010 attributable gold production at La Herradura increased 54% to 49,000 ounces compared to 2009 due to the commencement of commercial production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits in January 2010 where we've been really pleased with the results. Cost applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% due to higher waste tons mined. 
In 2011, we expect to produce 2 million to 2.1 million attributable ounces in North America at cost applicable to sales of approximately $560 to $600 per ounce. Our North American capital budget is $600 million to $700 million for 2011, which includes building on Hope Bay's successful drill program, which yielded many high-grade intercepts last year; further development in Nevada, including Leeville/Turf and East Carlin, development at Peet Bajo [ph] and the Exodus exploration drift, as well as work at the Noche Buena pit in La Herradura in Mexico. 
As previously announced, Newmont plans to acquire Fronteer Gold, which includes the Long Canyon development project. Turning to Slide 15, you'll see how we view Long Canyon in the context of other major gold trends in Nevada. The chart at right shows where Long Canyon is in its current stage of development relative to the other more established gold trends in the region. We believe that it can potentially grow into the next major mineralized trend in Nevada, and we expect to close this transaction in early April.
Turning to Slide 16. Our South American regions performance reflects the maturity of our Yanacocha mine combined with new contributions from La Zanja and development activity at Conga. Full year 2010 Yanacocha gold production attributable to Newmont decreased 27% from the prior year due to mine sequencing resulting in lower leach placements, transitional or stockpiling at La Quinua and lower grade and recovery resulting in lower mill production. Leach tons placed decreased from a record of 136 million tons in 2009 to 59 million tons in 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 39% from the prior year due to higher waste material mine, lower production, higher labor, diesel and maintenance costs and higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices. These were partially offset by higher by-product credits.
Attributable gold production was 21,000 ounces in 2010 at La Zanja, which was in its first year of contribution to Newmont's operating results, and we continue to be impressed with the operational leadership from our partners at Buenaventura. 2010 attributable gold production in South America is expected to be approximately 715,000 to 775,000 ounces, slightly lower than 2010 actuals primarily due to lower leach production at Yanacocha. Cost applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2011 to approximately $500 to $550 per ounce, primarily due to lower leach production and higher contracted services and supplies. 
Our South American capital budget is $900 million to $1.1 billion in 2011, which includes construction activity at Conga where we've recently signed our EPC contractor, as well as engaged contractors for mills and motors, the main access road, camp buildings and water treatment plants. Our capital budget also includes development of the Western Oxides project in Peru and several sustaining capital projects in the region. 
On Slide 17, our Asia-Pacific region saw a favorable boost in gold and copper production through a full year contribution from our Boddington mine as well as the best-ever gold production from our Batu Hijau mine. 2010 gold production at Boddington was approximately 730,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $590 per ounce. 2010 attributable copper and gold production at Batu Hijau increased 10% and 32%, respectively, in 2010 over the prior year due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore. Unseasonably dry weather permitted extended mining in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. We expect to process stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed commencing in late 2013. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% per ounce and per pound due to higher waste mining, labor and diesel costs.
Across our other Asia-Pacific assets, full year 2010 attributable gold production decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by higher grade throughput and recovery at KCGM. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to lower production, higher diesel costs and a stronger Australian dollar. 2011 attributable production for the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be approximately 1.9 million to 2 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable the sales are expected to increase to approximately $600 to $675 per ounce in 2011, primarily driven by lower Batu Hijau production. We expect attributable copper production for the Asia-Pacific operations of approximately 190 million to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 per pound in 2011. 
Our 2011 capital spending budget for the Asia-Pacific region is $650 million to $750 million and includes efforts to increase resources and extend mine life at Tanami, Jundee and KCGM. In addition, we're evaluating further expansion opportunities at Boddington and mill optimization at Batu Hijau. 
At Boddington, we developed a revised mine plan in the fourth quarter to deliver the best possible grade to the mill. From a volume standpoint, it's notable that Boddington produced 206,000 attributable ounces of gold in the fourth quarter despite a seven-day total plant shutdown to integrate the sixth MP 1000 secondary crusher. Today, we are seeing mining performance, processing throughput rates, grades in recovery consistent with our 2011 outlook. Debottlenecking studies have commenced to identify opportunities to optimize production through the existing plant infrastructure and are planned to be complete during the second quarter of this year.
We also continue to promote Boddington's exploration potential as the deposit remains open laterally and at depth. Boddington's reserves remain over 20 million ounces of gold, and approximately 40,000 meters of drilling is planned in 2011 as we target opportunities for extensions of the known resource and test regional targets.
Turning to Slide 19. Our Africa region had a terrific year. They continue to deliver consistent performance and symbolized why we're so excited about Newmont's future growth in this region. Full year attributable gold ounces produced increased 2% to 545,000 ounces due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu and the commencement of production at Amoma in October, which began operations slightly ahead of schedule and under budget. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased less than 1% to $450 per ounce due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production.
2011 attributable gold production for the Africa operation is expected to be approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces, primarily due to higher expected ore grades. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $485 to $535 per ounce are expected for 2011, primarily as a result of higher energy prices and higher labor and royalty costs. Our 2011 capital budget for Africa is $450 million to $545 million. The bulk of which is allocated to advancing our Akyem project, which will eventually support a doubling of our annual production in this region. In addition, we have capital allocated to the Ahafo North opportunity and to the Subika underground, which is expected to contribute to Newmont's production later this year subject to permitting. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

Basically, you've doubled your CapEx program to about $2.8 billion, of which around $1.7 million is discretionary. You are embarking on a $2.3 billion acquisition. So you're spending about $4 billion of what I would consider growth in discretionary opportunities. Your dividend policy at $0.60 remains around a $300 million total cash outlay. So I was just wondering if you could kind of compare and contrast if you think now that you've announced this growth plan that there will be any room left for incremental dividend in 2011?

So I think the board has that flexibility. With respect to your question on free cash flow generation, obviously, it depends on gold price. But given where we are today, I'd say we're $500 million plus of free cash flow with a significant balance sheet to carry that through. So I think to the extent that the market pays for dividends, and we'll associate share increases with that, I think we're prepared to consider that.

A rising metals price environment converged with our",919,"Thanks, John. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll begin on Slide 3. In 2010, Newmont generated the highest revenue, net income and operating cash flow in our 90-year history. A rising metals price environment converged with our emphasis on operational execution and yielded outstanding financial results. Today, we'll discuss our 2010 highlights but more importantly, we want to begin to tell you how we're leveraging our financial success and we'll continue that story into Investor Day in April. 
We closed the books on 2010 with over $5.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Our priorities for deploying cash remain consistent with what we've talked with you about before. They're designed to build our business and to maximize shareholder value. First, we are developing our internal project portfolio with about $1.1 billion in consolidated capital spending planned for our major projects at Conga, Akyem and Hope Bay. Next, we're leveraging our superior land position and infrastructure in some of the world's most prolific mining districts. In 2010, we delivered a net reserve increase on our base of well over 90 million ounces. We also continue to focus on near-mine exploration and early-stage development opportunities.
Another way we're building for the future is by pursuing opportunistic M&A. This is evidenced by our announcement earlier this month that we plan to acquire Fronteer Gold. The integration of Fronteer's assets, particularly Long Canyon, will allow us to develop a district that we believe closely resembles the Carlin Trend, a region where Newmont has established infrastructure and experienced and motivated labor force and key relationships with various stakeholder groups.
While our land positions and exploration activities along with opportunistic M&A provide access to new opportunities, our financial resources provide us the flexibility to capitalize on each of those priorities, as you can see on Slide 3. 
Taking a closer look at our gold and copper operating margins on Slide 4, you'll see how Newmont has expanded its margins faster than the metal price for three years running. Boosting our operating margins increases our operating cash flow, which we can then deploy back into the business. We are bullish on gold, and the first seven weeks of 2011 certainly support that optimism.
At $1,350 gold, for example, we expect that Newmont will be generating an operating margin of about $760 per ounce, providing additional cash flow to develop our business and increase shareholder value. Excerpts of our outlook are on Slide 5. In 2011, we expect to produce between 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces. This is a slight change from 2010 actuals due to lower expected Batu Hijau production as we move out of the bottom of the pit in Phase 5 more into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher expected Nevada and Ahafo production. Costs applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per gold ounce and between $1.25 and $1.50 per pound of copper. 
As you've seen with other releases, industry-wide pressures continue to impact CAS across the industry, and we're no different. But as Russell will point out, much of our increase comes from the Batu Hijau change I just mentioned. Capital spending on a consolidated basis is expected to be between $2.7 billion to $3 billion, which translates to about $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion on an attributable basis and is a substantial increase from last year.
As I mentioned at the start of our call, we're generating considerable cash flow in the current environment. For 2011, this allows us to advance the development of a number of our projects, including Akyem, Conga and Hope Bay, which collectively represent about 40% of that capital spending. The balance will be spent on a combination of several expansion and optimization projects, routine replacement and a number of new project development and other mine life extensions that we'll talk about briefly. 
Moving to Slide 6. Our 2011 cost applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per ounce, as I mentioned, due to lower Batu Hijau and Yanacocha production, which results from higher waste removal and lower grades and higher energy and labor costs. 
On Slide 7, we provided a comparison of our 2010 and '11 capital spending, highlighting increased spending at Conga and Akyem. In addition to that, our 2011 capital plan though does encompass continued reinvestment in each of our four regions. A few examples where we're deploying capital include: in Nevada where we're spending about $100 million towards Leeville/Turf and Peet Bajo [ph], two of the highest returning projects in our portfolio because they're very near existing infrastructure. At Yanacocha, we're spending about $200 million to bring forward the Western Oxides project and keep Yanacocha in production. 
In our APAC region, about $120 million is going towards the Tanami, KCGM, Waihi and Jundee, where we are extending resources in each of those mines. And in Africa, we're excited about putting $75 million more towards the Subika underground development and continuing our Ahafo North early-stage work. In addition, we've embarked upon several sustaining capital investments that maintain or extend mine production and boost mill efficiency across our operations. 
Actually, sustaining capital as a percentage of total capital spending is lower this year than it was last year. As I stated earlier, we're generating solid cash flow that we're redeploying back into the business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Russell to discuss in a little more depth our 2010 operating and financial performance."

We reported record results driven by strong metal prices and our continued focus on operational execution and delivery. Revenue at $9.5 billion, cash from continuing operations at $3.2 billion and adjusted net income of $1.9 billion are all record amounts for the company. 
As you can see on Slide 9, we realized an average price of $1,222 per ounce of gold and $3.43 per pound of copper for the year. And while both were record prices for Newmont, they remain significantly below current spot prices of approximately $1,415 and $430 per pound, respectively. Our gold operating margin increased 30% year-over-year to $737 per ounce, outpacing the 25% increase in the gold price. 
Turning to the fourth quarter comparison on Slide 10. Attributable production was down 7% primarily on lower production from Nevada due to the pit wall failure at the end of 2009 and the cessation of mining at Deep Post at the end of 2009, and from Yanacocha due to lower leach ore placement, transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua and lower mill ore grade due to mine sequencing. These declines were offset by increased production from Boddington, which commenced commercial production in November 2009. Adjusted net income was up 2% versus the year-ago quarter, with higher metal prices offset the impacts of lower production and higher operating costs, which I will discuss in more detail on Slide 11.
Slide 11 reconciles our actual cost applicable to sales of $485 per ounce, with our original outlook provided in February 2010. Cost applicable to sales for gold were approximately $4 above the midpoint of our original outlook, which was based on a $900 gold price assumption and an AUD $0.80 exchange rate assumption. Stronger Australian dollar added $22 per ounce to costs, which were offset by approximately $10 per ounce and hedging gains from our Australian book for net impact of $12 per ounce. 
Lower volumes primarily at Boddington boosted our 2010 budget, and given the fixed-cost nature of our business, added a further $9 per ounce. Higher gold prices drove higher royalty and workers participation costs, which increased cost by about $7 an ounce. As I've said before, these type of cost increases that are tied to the gold price are ones we are happy to pay, given the significant margin-related expansion that occurs. 
On the other hand, we saw favorable by-product credits of $6 an ounce and diesel savings of about $2 an ounce, given our assumption at the beginning of the year of $80 per ounce West Texas. Obviously, with the unrest in Libya and the broader Middle East, oil prices have escalated significantly in recent weeks. 
Before I turn it over to Guy Lansdown for his reserve and exploration update, I wanted to make a point in regards to reported cost applicable to sales per ounce on a go-forward basis, historically a significant metric in this business. As a U.S. company, Newmont will not be reporting under IFRS accounting for 2011 or indeed for anytime in the future. And what this means is that our reported CAS per ounce number is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with most of our Canadian peers are now reporting under IFRS. The differences can be quite significant. And without getting into the details, there are numerous costs that can be capitalized under IFRS that we will be expensing in 2011 and beyond. Our personal view is that the resulting lack of direct comparability between income statements will result in even more attention to the cash flow statement and the company's ability to generate operating cash flows, both on an absolute basis but more importantly on a per share basis as a measure of long-term value. Quite frankly, we welcome this attention. 
With that brief diversion into the accounting, debits and credits, I will turn it over to Guy."

On to Slide 12. We are particularly encouraged by today's gold and copper reserves report, which reflects over 8 million new gold ounces in reserves, a 2% growth net of depletion and 300 million new pounds of copper representing a 3% increase over last year. As a large senior gold producer, we are thrilled to be in a position to boost our reserves on a net basis and primarily through the drill bit. 
Our 2010 drilling program resulted in total copper reserves at record levels of 9.4 billion pounds and near record reserves of 93.5 million ounces of gold. North America was the largest contributor to higher gold reserves in 2010, with additions at Leeville/Turf, Twin Creeks, Phoenix and La Herradura. Other large reserve additions we made at Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region and at Ahafo in the Africa region. North America also made the largest contribution to non-reserve mineralization, with significant additions at Gold Quarry, Leeville/Turf, Buffalo Valley and Twin Creeks. Initial NRM was declared at the Merian Gold greenfield project in Suriname, solidifying the exciting potential in the region. Other noteworthy contributors to NRM included KCGM and Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region. 
For 2011, we have budgeted about $360 million for exploration, which covers both expense and capital on a consolidated basis and is an increase of over 40% from 2010. On Slide 13, you can see the breakdown by region. This larger budget gives us additional flexibility to work on substantial mine life-extending projects, such as Subika and Leeville/Turf. With more dollars to invest back into the business, we are focusing on large district potential targets like the sleeping giants in Nevada, which includes Mike, Fiberline, Greater Phoenix and Copper Basin, as well as Elang in Indonesia, Yanacocha Verde in Peru and Merian in Suriname. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our operational results."

Before we jump into discussing the regional performance, it's important to step back and echo Richard's earlier point about investing and developing our business. Newmont has a total land position of over 32,000 square miles around the globe. The opportunities to invest in our business are rich and varied, from traditional oxide deposits to sulfide deposits and gold-copper porphyries. We believe we have significant potential to develop new districts across our four regions, and the scope of new development opportunities is nearly equal to that of our existing operations.
On each of our regional slides, we will share our capital spending budget with a breakout between near mine and sustaining capital. At our Investor Day in April, we'll provide more details on how we are leveraging our existing operations into future development. 
Let's begin our recap of regional performance with North America. Full year 2010 attributable gold production in Nevada decreased 13% due to the completion of underground mining at Deep Post in 2009; lower Gold Quarry ore mine as a result of the pit wall failure which occurred in December 2009; lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin, partially offset by increased underground mining at Leeville. 
Total ore tons mined were 26% lower, mainly due to the Gold Quarry slope failure and the completion of mining at North Lantern in April 2010. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 62% to 4.5 million tons. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 11% due to lower production, partially offset by higher by-product credits. 
Full year 2010 attributable gold production at La Herradura increased 54% to 49,000 ounces compared to 2009 due to the commencement of commercial production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits in January 2010, where we've been really pleased with the results. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% due to higher waste tons mined. 
In 2011, we expect to produce 2 million to 2.1 million attributable ounces in North America at costs applicable to sales of approximately $560 to $600 per ounce. Our North American capital budget is $600 million to $700 million for 2011, which includes building on Hope Bay's successful drill program, which yielded many high-grade intercepts last year; further development in Nevada, including Leeville/Turf and East Carlin, development at Peet Bajo [ph] and the Exodus exploration drift, as well as work at the Noche Buena pit in La Herradura in Mexico. 
As previously announced, Newmont plans to acquire Fronteer Gold, which includes the Long Canyon development project. Turning to Slide 15, you'll see how we view Long Canyon in the context of other major gold trends in Nevada. The chart at right shows where Long Canyon is in its current stage of development relative to the other more established gold trends in the region. We believe that it can potentially grow into the next major mineralized trend in Nevada, and we expect to close this transaction in early April.
Turning to Slide 16. Our South American regions performance reflects the maturity of our Yanacocha mine combined with new contributions from La Zanja and development activity at Conga. Full year 2010 Yanacocha gold production attributable to Newmont decreased 27% from the prior year due to mine sequencing resulting in lower leach placements, transitional or stockpiling at La Quinua and lower grade and recovery resulting in lower mill production. Leach tons placed decreased from a record of 136 million tons in 2009 to 59 million tons in 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 39% from the prior year due to higher waste material mine, lower production, higher labor, diesel and maintenance costs and higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices. These were partially offset by higher by-product credits.
Attributable gold production was 21,000 ounces in 2010 at La Zanja, which was in its first year of contribution to Newmont's operating results, and we continue to be impressed with the operational leadership from our partners at Buenaventura. 2010 attributable gold production in South America is expected to be approximately 715,000 to 775,000 ounces, slightly lower than 2010 actuals primarily due to lower leach production at Yanacocha. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2011 to approximately $500 to $550 per ounce, primarily due to lower leach production and higher contracted services and supplies. 
Our South American capital budget is $900 million to $1.1 billion in 2011, which includes construction activity at Conga, where we've recently signed our EPC contractor, as well as engaged contractors for mills and motors, the main access road, camp buildings and water treatment plants. Our capital budget also includes development of the Western Oxides project in Peru and several sustaining capital projects in the region. 
On Slide 17, our Asia-Pacific region saw a favorable boost in gold and copper production through a full year's contribution from our Boddington mine, as well as the best-ever gold production from our Batu Hijau mine. 2010 gold production at Boddington was approximately 730,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $590 per ounce. 2010 attributable copper and gold production at Batu Hijau increased 10% and 32%, respectively, in 2010 over the prior year due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore. Unseasonably dry weather permitted extended mining in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. We expect to process stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed commencing in late 2013. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% per ounce and per pound due to higher waste mining, labor and diesel costs.
Across our other Asia-Pacific assets, full year 2010 attributable gold production decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by higher grade throughput and recovery at KCGM. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to lower production, higher diesel costs and a stronger Australian dollar. 2011 attributable production for the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be approximately 1.9 million to 2 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable the sales are expected to increase to approximately $600 to $675 per ounce in 2011, primarily driven by lower Batu Hijau production. We expect attributable copper production for the Asia-Pacific operations of approximately 190 million to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 per pound in 2011. 
Our 2011 capital spending budget for the Asia-Pacific region is $650 million to $750 million and includes efforts to increase resources and extend mine life at Tanami, Jundee and KCGM. In addition, we're evaluating further expansion opportunities at Boddington and mill optimization at Batu Hijau. 
At Boddington, we developed a revised mine plan in the fourth quarter to deliver the best possible grade to the mill. From a volume standpoint, it's notable that Boddington produced 206,000 attributable ounces of gold in the fourth quarter despite a seven-day total plant shutdown to integrate the sixth MP 1000 secondary crusher. Today, we are seeing mining performance, processing throughput rates, grades in recovery consistent with our 2011 outlook. Debottlenecking studies have commenced to identify opportunities to optimize production through the existing plant infrastructure and are planned to be complete during the second quarter of this year.
We also continue to promote Boddington's exploration potential as the deposit remains open laterally and at depth. Boddington's reserves remain over 20 million ounces of gold, and approximately 40,000 meters of drilling is planned in 2011 as we target opportunities for extensions of the known resource and test regional targets.
Turning to Slide 19. Our Africa region had a terrific year. They continue to deliver consistent performance and symbolize why we're so excited about Newmont's future growth in this region. Full year attributable gold ounces produced increased 2% to 545,000 ounces due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu and the commencement of production at Amoma in October, which began operations slightly ahead of schedule and under budget. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased less than 1% to $450 per ounce due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production.
2011 attributable gold production for the Africa operation is expected to be approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces, primarily due to higher expected ore grades. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $485 to $535 per ounce are expected for 2011, primarily as a result of higher energy prices and higher labor and royalty costs. Our 2011 capital budget for Africa is $450 million to $545 million. The bulk of which is allocated to advancing our Akyem project, which will eventually support a doubling of our annual production in this region. In addition, we have capital allocated to the Ahafo North opportunity and to the Subika underground, which is expected to contribute to Newmont's production later this year subject to permitting. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

Basically, you've doubled your CapEx program to about $2.8 billion, of which around $1.7 million is discretionary. You are embarking on a $2.3 billion acquisition. So you're spending about $4 billion of what I would consider growth in discretionary opportunities. Your dividend policy at $0.60 remains around a $300 million total cash outlay. So I was just wondering if you could kind of compare and contrast if you think, now that you've announced this growth plan, that there will be any room left for incremental dividend in 2011?

So I think the board has that flexibility. With respect to your question on free cash flow generation, obviously it depends on gold price. But given where we are today, I'd say we're $500 million plus of free cash flow with a significant balance sheet to carry that through. So I think to the extent that the market pays for dividends, and we'll associate share increases with that, I think we're prepared to consider that.

And as Russ says, that's sort of a high-class problem for us.

And that is a 35% growth net of decline, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders to enhance their exposure to gold price.

Turning to Slide 4. As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular. A few highlights from the quarter",1349,"Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Turning to Slide 4. As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular. A few highlights from the quarter. We realized an average gold price of $1,382 an ounce, and while the record of approximately $115 below current spot prices. We generated record operating cash flow of almost $1 billion, an 86% increase over last year and a 25% increase in gold price. It is clear to me that the companywide focus on operational execution and delivery is being driven to the bottom line an environment of expanding margins as reflected in the operating cash flow for the quarter.
production was 1.3 million ounces, currently to last year and slightly ahead of our budget for the first quarter. Attributable favorable copper production decreased to 57 million pounds driven by lower production at in Indonesia, with Phase 6 and lower grades stock bonds. We should access Phase 6 in late 2013.
Copper production was, however, ahead of budget for the quarter. As far as the bottom line, there was essentially no difference between reported net income and our adjusted net income figures on to Slide of $513 million or $1.04 a share, a really clean quarter from an income statement perspective. Continuing on Slide 5, revenue for the quarter was up 10% to $2.5 billion. On the cost side, cost applicable to sales were up 17% and 42% respectively, with higher copper operating cost driven by lower production partly out as previously mentioned.
On gold operating costs. Starting this quarter, we have added 2 non-GAAP metrics that we think will provide basis with a different perspective on our cost structure and one likely more comparable to our peers. The first is attributable to CAS, which represents the operating cost per ounce for Newmont's attributable gold ounces produced. So we eliminate the ounces in cost that are included in our consolidated financial statements that are ultimately for the account of the noncontrolling shareholders largely in the Batu Hijau. Attributable to CAS for the quarter was $562 an ounce or roughly $5 an ounce, higher than the consolidated CAS number that historically we have reported.
The second is net attributable CAS, where we take the attributable CAS number that I just covered, and then our copper product revenue as a credits to operating costs. Net attributable to CAS for the quarter was $438 an ounce. As I said, both of these are non-GAAP measures, but I believe they are important for investors to understand, particularly when comparing costs across the sector. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided in the appendix on Slide 24 and 25.
One last point on costs. I would like to remind you that we will continue to report U.S. GAAP operating costs, which result in us being required to expense significant more cost than we would under FS accounting. Our estimate for 2011 is in the order of about $40 an ounce. Moving to Slide 6.
We've included the GFMS 2010 industry cost drivers to provide some additional perspective on industrywide costs. From 2009 to 2010, average CAS cost increased 70% driven by the factors highlighted on the chart. I would submit that the cost drivers for 2011 are not going to be too much different from what you see here. And I think we will be looking at industrywide operating costs of around $650 an ounce for 2011.
Interestingly, our first quarter CAS of $557 an ounce is equal to the industry average for last year. I have no doubt that our relative position on the cost curb would improve in 2011. Moving to Slide 7.
Our gold operating margin continues to expand at a greater rate than the gold price. I like what we saw in the early years of this full market when operating and capital cost increases around the globe price. If you think the midpoint of our cost guidance for 2011 and the current spot price of gold, you will see continued margin expansion likely for the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 8.
As mentioned previously, strong operating cash flow for the quarter combined with a strong balance sheet at the beginning of the year resulted in a liquidity picture reflected on the right-hand side of the slide. On a consolidated basis, we reported $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.8 billion in marketable securities and ongoing capacity of approximately $1.8 billion under our corporate revolver. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of Fronteer Gold and utilized approximately $2.25 billion in cash, which left us with still an excess of $2 billion on the balance sheet.
I will talk about returning additional cash to shareholders shortly. but first, a few thoughts on gold with the spot prices nearing all-time high, at leased on a nominal basis. I've included on the Slide 9, Martin most recent summary slides on the gold market. For those who don't subscribe to Martin I really believe you're missing out on the most complete and accurate coverage of the gold market. For some history, Martin has always been bullish on gold and in fact he was very late 90s has produced his edge, central by sold in the us dollar range the premium. Martin has been bullish in 2001. And for those who have not been following his work, has been uncannily accurate in his forecast since then. You can see Martin's bullish argument for gold on the slide, and let go into them in any detail as we clearly don't have time on this call.
In short, Martin remains bullish and has the probability weighted forecast of $1,546 for the end of 2011 and an average price of $1,573 for 2012. Although as you can see on the bottom of the slide, he does make a point that he makes no allowances for geopolitics in his forecast.
On the Slide 10, you will see GFMS's forecast for 2011. Albeit slightly less bullish average of $1,455, but interestingly, a very wide range about $1,620 an ounce. Finally, I've included note of Tuesday this week. I think it very distinctly sums up the current gold market, that gold trades no longer as a commodity but as a currency. We concur. We are bullish. And as we outlined in our Investor Day in Europe on April 7, we are ready to invest accordingly. At this same analyst day, we announced our gold price link dividend, which is summarized on Slide 11. In short, we believe that we have an obligation to share this significant cash flow we are generating with the owners of the company. And that is what we intend to do starting with the gold price link dividend.
Subject of course to board approval, starting with the second quarter dividend, shareholders will receive an annual dividend increases by $0.20 for every $100 increase in our net realized gold price for the trailing quarter.
To take the second quarter dividend as an example, we realized $1,382 an ounce, which corresponds to $0.80 annual dividend on the chart that you see on this slide. So, we will be paying a $0.20 quarterly dividend on June 29. This represents a 33% increase over the first quarter dividend and 100% increase over a year ago dividends. Looking ahead, it's very likely that our net realized price for Q2 will be towards the high end of the $1,400 to $1,499 bucket, which should equate to an annual dividend or $0.25 for the third quarter dividend payment. This would represent 1/3 of 25% increase.
As we have said before, heading the financial strength and flexibility we have allowed us to both aggressively grow the business and return capital to shareholders. We are bullish in our earnings opportunities and the gold price, we will continue to look at further alternatives to return additional cash to shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Bryan who will cover the operational performance for the quarter."

We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower productio",866,"Thanks,  Russell. We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower production from South America, while in North America and APAC production was essentially flat. Consolidated costs applicable to sales were 17% higher than last year due to lower production in South America, as well as higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs in North America. And as Russell mentioned a few minutes ago, this is generally line with our industry as a whole.
Commencing our regional discussion on to Slide 13 would North America, you'll see a recent picture of the gold quarry area in Nevada where remediations from the slide that took place in December 2009 is nearing completion. Over 40 million tons of in bedrock has been removed and all of the equipment that was trapped by the slide has been safely recovered. We are currently mining fresh or formula and approximately 50% of the ore going to Mill 5 is direct from gold quarry. 
Turning to first quarter results. Attributable gold production in North America was 482,000 ounces, up 2% over last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to highly placement of our Soledad La Herradura in Mexico. Gold ounces produced in Nevada were virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 as higher mill productions from underground sources was offset by a lower leach placements due to mine sequencing. North American costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs and lower leach production in Nevada. This was partially offset by higher copper and silver byproduct credits.
Newmont continues to expect full year in North American gold production of 1.98 to 2.1 million ounces at cost applicable to sales of $560 to $600 an ounce.
Moving to Slide 14. Attributable gold production during the first quarter in South America region at Yanacocha in Peru was 160,000 ounces. This included 148,000 ounces from Yanacocha and 12,000 ounces from La Zanja. Gold production in South America decreased 26% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower leach placement, mill grade and transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were $583 per ounce, an increase of 57% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower production, higher labor costs that was partially offset by lower workers participation costs and higher byproduct credits.
Newmont continue to expect 2011 action growth gold production in South America between 715,000 ounces and 775,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $500 and $550 per ounce. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 15. Attributable gold production was 514,000 ounces, down 1.5% from the prior year quarter, while copper production was 57 million pounds down 37% from Q1 2010.
The biggest driver of the change in gold and copper production, sorry in Indonesia where we are currently processing from stockpile by the Phase 6 stripping campaign is underway. At our Boddington mine in Australia, we had a solid quarter despite a of downtime due to a conveyor belt failure. Had we not experienced that unplanned event, production at Boddington would've been ahead of budget for the quarter as the picture at right depicts, Boddington recently posted its 1 million pounds of gold production. Our Asia-Pacific region reported gold costs applicable to sales of $527 per ounce, up 15% over last year's Q1 and copper costs applicable to sales of $1.11 per pound, up 42%.
Costs were impacted by the lower Batu Hijau production, as well as attributable gold production -- sorry, increase over last -- Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production in the Asia-Pacific region of between 1.86 million ounces and 1.99 million ounces at costs applicable to sales up between $600 and $665 per ounce. We also expect 2011 attributable copper production of 190 million to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of $1.25 to $1.50 per pound. Regarding divestiture activity at Batu Hijau, Newmont's economic ownership currently remains at 48.5%.
The Indonesian government has recently designated agency of the Ministry of Finance as the entity that will buy the final 7% stake. On April 18, 2011, our subsidiary than the agency reached an agreement to finalize the terms for purchase and sale, which is anticipated to occur by mid-2011. On to Slide 16.
In Africa, Newmont's biggest growth region, our Ahafo mine delivered attributable gold production of 186,000 ounces in Q1, which was a 55% increase over last year's first quarter due to higher mill grade and recovery as the result of mine sequencing. The higher gold production at Africa also had a favorable impact on cost applicable to sales, which were $451 per ounce in Q1, a reduction of 17% that was partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Ahafo of between 550,000 and 590,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $485 to $535 per ounce. I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to about 7",611,"Thanks, Brian. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to about 7 million ounces of attributable gold production by 2017 from a base of our current outlook of 5.1 million ounces of 5.3 million ounces of gold for 2011.
In order to get to that 7 million-ounce run rate in 2017, we need to bring about 3.2 million ounces of incremental production online over the next few years to offset the decline in the balance of our portfolio. Our growth will be faced in with about 20% of our new growth reflected in production by 2013, 50% by 2015 and the balance expected to be in production by 2017.
On Slide 18, we've added some additional comp color to the timing of that incremental production by breaking down our growth profile by project. I've noted that some of the analysts I've already got this fairly close, and So we're providing some information that some of you may not need, but interest of clarity we're going to give it to everybody in this format. The sequence of the projects begins with the and Nevada expansions where development is advanced. And it goes all the way through the commencement of production at Long Canyon, which we expect as shown on this slide in 2017. If you'd like to reference this growth plan against our potential decline, we would direct you to the detailed regional waterfall that we provided in our Investor Day where we gave the regional decline for each of our operations.
As the previous we told you, 5.1 million ounces to 5.3 million ounces our current base and we expect the next couple of years to be essentially stable and until we get back in to higher grade ore in basics, as Russ, mentioned beginning in 2013, late and then moving into higher grade into 2014 and 2015. At that time, we'll also see the benefits of our new expansion projects as shown on this slide. The numbers were a lot for each represent the initial development capital of each of those projects. This view of our growth plan should allow investors to better understand that we have a fairly solid production growth ahead of us. Moving on to Slide 19. We show our operating cost for these new projects annual that the plot of them against the GFMS 2010 cost curve.
Our forecast are based on what we know today about our projects, and they are unescalated. We're referencing our cost to the GFMS industry cost curve as a reminder that our actual cost will vary from our projections but that we believe the relative position of our projects should remain consistent with the replacement on the industry cost of Asimov's overtime. You'll see that our project expand the first of 4 quartiles, reflecting the diversity of our operations. You'll also notice that the companywide CAS we reported today for the first quarter file it is clearly near the 2010 industry midpoint for costs, which is in line with our guidance.
As Russell mentioned, we continue to focus on execution to ensure that we protect our margins into the future. So to summarize on Slide 20. We believe that Newmont offers a unique omission of production growth, project returns, reserves and exploration upside, balance sheet strength, continued operational execution and the industry's first and only gold price link dividends. With that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

Energy costs are about 25% of our cost structure. Again, we have budgeted at $90 oil and we're sitting today at around $110. And if you think about labor costs, that's about 45% of our cost structure. And labor costs are largely for us non-dollar denominated. So I'd say those in conjunction with our lower grades. These deposits, the average rates decrease, you've seen that in the gold and in the copper industry where grades have come up significantly. So I think you've got grade and he got certain working against he had it's going to be a challenge for us as Richard said earlier, maintaining our relative position of that cost curve and at the end of the day, you looking at a time to visit, try to manage some volatility around those cost structures but some challenges.

This, combined with the commitment and enthusiasm of our workforce across the globe, we feel confident that we will deliver on our growth plan. And now to recap our first quarter performance, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Russell Ball."
291795,129480694,116341,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Turning to Slide 4. As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular. A few highlights from the quarter",1349,"Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Turning to Slide 4. As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular. A few highlights from the quarter. We realized an average gold price of $1,382 an ounce, and while the record of approximately $115 below current spot prices. We generated record operating cash flow of almost $1 billion, an 86% increase over last year and a 25% increase in gold price. It is clear to me that the companywide focus on operational execution and delivery is being driven to the bottom line an environment of expanding margins as reflected in the operating cash flow for the quarter.
production was 1.3 million ounces, currently to last year and slightly ahead of our budget for the first quarter. Attributable favorable copper production decreased to 57 million pounds driven by lower production at in Indonesia, with Phase 6 and lower grades stock bonds. We should access Phase 6 in late 2013.
Copper production was, however, ahead of budget for the quarter. As far as the bottom line, there was essentially no difference between reported net income and our adjusted net income figures on to Slide of $513 million or $1.04 a share, a really clean quarter from an income statement perspective. Continuing on Slide 5, revenue for the quarter was up 10% to $2.5 billion. On the cost side, cost applicable to sales were up 17% and 42% respectively, with higher copper operating cost driven by lower production partly out as previously mentioned.
On gold operating costs. Starting this quarter, we have added 2 non-GAAP metrics that we think will provide basis with a different perspective on our cost structure and one likely more comparable to our peers. The first is attributable to CAS, which represents the operating cost per ounce for Newmont's attributable gold ounces produced. So we eliminate the ounces in cost that are included in our consolidated financial statements that are ultimately for the account of the noncontrolling shareholders largely in the Batu Hijau. Attributable to CAS for the quarter was $562 an ounce or roughly $5 an ounce, higher than the consolidated CAS number that historically we have reported.
The second is net attributable CAS, where we take the attributable CAS number that I just covered, and then our copper product revenue as a credits to operating costs. Net attributable to CAS for the quarter was $438 an ounce. As I said, both of these are non-GAAP measures, but I believe they are important for investors to understand, particularly when comparing costs across the sector. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided in the appendix on Slide 24 and 25.
One last point on costs. I would like to remind you that we will continue to report U.S. GAAP operating costs, which result in us being required to expense significant more cost than we would under FS accounting. Our estimate for 2011 is in the order of about $40 an ounce. Moving to Slide 6.
We've included the GFMS 2010 industry cost drivers to provide some additional perspective on industrywide costs. From 2009 to 2010, average CAS cost increased 70% driven by the factors highlighted on the chart. I would submit that the cost drivers for 2011 are not going to be too much different from what you see here. And I think we will be looking at industrywide operating costs of around $650 an ounce for 2011.
Interestingly, our first quarter CAS of $557 an ounce is equal to the industry average for last year. I have no doubt that our relative position on the cost curb would improve in 2011. Moving to Slide 7.
Our gold operating margin continues to expand at a greater rate than the gold price. I like what we saw in the early years of this full market when operating and capital cost increases around the globe price. If you think the midpoint of our cost guidance for 2011 and the current spot price of gold, you will see continued margin expansion likely for the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 8.
As mentioned previously, strong operating cash flow for the quarter combined with a strong balance sheet at the beginning of the year resulted in a liquidity picture reflected on the right-hand side of the slide. On a consolidated basis, we reported $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.8 billion in marketable securities and ongoing capacity of approximately $1.8 billion under our corporate revolver. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of Fronteer Gold and utilized approximately $2.25 billion in cash, which left us with still an excess of $2 billion on the balance sheet.
I will talk about returning additional cash to shareholders shortly. but first, a few thoughts on gold with the spot prices nearing all-time high, at leased on a nominal basis. I've included on the Slide 9, Martin most recent summary slides on the gold market. For those who don't subscribe to Martin I really believe you're missing out on the most complete and accurate coverage of the gold market. For some history, Martin has always been bullish on gold and in fact he was very late 90s has produced his edge, central by sold in the us dollar range the premium. Martin has been bullish in 2001. And for those who have not been following his work, has been uncannily accurate in his forecast since then. You can see Martin's bullish argument for gold on the slide, and let go into them in any detail as we clearly don't have time on this call.
In short, Martin remains bullish and has the probability weighted forecast of $1,546 for the end of 2011 and an average price of $1,573 for 2012. Although as you can see on the bottom of the slide, he does make a point that he makes no allowances for geopolitics in his forecast.
On the Slide 10, you will see GFMS's forecast for 2011. Albeit slightly less bullish average of $1,455, but interestingly, a very wide range about $1,620 an ounce. Finally, I've included note of Tuesday this week. I think it very distinctly sums up the current gold market, that gold trades no longer as a commodity but as a currency. We concur. We are bullish. And as we outlined in our Investor Day in Europe on April 7, we are ready to invest accordingly. At this same analyst day, we announced our gold price link dividend, which is summarized on Slide 11. In short, we believe that we have an obligation to share this significant cash flow we are generating with the owners of the company. And that is what we intend to do starting with the gold price link dividend.
Subject of course to board approval, starting with the second quarter dividend, shareholders will receive an annual dividend increases by $0.20 for every $100 increase in our net realized gold price for the trailing quarter.
To take the second quarter dividend as an example, we realized $1,382 an ounce, which corresponds to $0.80 annual dividend on the chart that you see on this slide. So, we will be paying a $0.20 quarterly dividend on June 29. This represents a 33% increase over the first quarter dividend and 100% increase over a year ago dividends. Looking ahead, it's very likely that our net realized price for Q2 will be towards the high end of the $1,400 to $1,499 bucket, which should equate to an annual dividend or $0.25 for the third quarter dividend payment. This would represent 1/3 of 25% increase.
As we have said before, heading the financial strength and flexibility we have allowed us to both aggressively grow the business and return capital to shareholders. We are bullish in our earnings opportunities and the gold price, we will continue to look at further alternatives to return additional cash to shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Bryan who will cover the operational performance for the quarter."

We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower productio",866,"Thanks,  Russell. We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower production from South America, while in North America and APAC production was essentially flat. Consolidated costs applicable to sales were 17% higher than last year due to lower production in South America, as well as higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs in North America. And as Russell mentioned a few minutes ago, this is generally line with our industry as a whole.
Commencing our regional discussion on to Slide 13 would North America, you'll see a recent picture of the gold quarry area in Nevada where remediations from the slide that took place in December 2009 is nearing completion. Over 40 million tons of in bedrock has been removed and all of the equipment that was trapped by the slide has been safely recovered. We are currently mining fresh or formula and approximately 50% of the ore going to Mill 5 is direct from gold quarry. 
Turning to first quarter results. Attributable gold production in North America was 482,000 ounces, up 2% over last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to highly placement of our Soledad La Herradura in Mexico. Gold ounces produced in Nevada were virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 as higher mill productions from underground sources was offset by a lower leach placements due to mine sequencing. North American costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs and lower leach production in Nevada. This was partially offset by higher copper and silver byproduct credits.
Newmont continues to expect full year in North American gold production of 1.98 to 2.1 million ounces at cost applicable to sales of $560 to $600 an ounce.
Moving to Slide 14. Attributable gold production during the first quarter in South America region at Yanacocha in Peru was 160,000 ounces. This included 148,000 ounces from Yanacocha and 12,000 ounces from La Zanja. Gold production in South America decreased 26% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower leach placement, mill grade and transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were $583 per ounce, an increase of 57% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower production, higher labor costs that was partially offset by lower workers participation costs and higher byproduct credits.
Newmont continue to expect 2011 action growth gold production in South America between 715,000 ounces and 775,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $500 and $550 per ounce. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 15. Attributable gold production was 514,000 ounces, down 1.5% from the prior year quarter, while copper production was 57 million pounds down 37% from Q1 2010.
The biggest driver of the change in gold and copper production, sorry in Indonesia where we are currently processing from stockpile by the Phase 6 stripping campaign is underway. At our Boddington mine in Australia, we had a solid quarter despite a of downtime due to a conveyor belt failure. Had we not experienced that unplanned event, production at Boddington would've been ahead of budget for the quarter as the picture at right depicts, Boddington recently posted its 1 million pounds of gold production. Our Asia-Pacific region reported gold costs applicable to sales of $527 per ounce, up 15% over last year's Q1 and copper costs applicable to sales of $1.11 per pound, up 42%.
Costs were impacted by the lower Batu Hijau production, as well as attributable gold production -- sorry, increase over last -- Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production in the Asia-Pacific region of between 1.86 million ounces and 1.99 million ounces at costs applicable to sales up between $600 and $665 per ounce. We also expect 2011 attributable copper production of 190 million to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of $1.25 to $1.50 per pound. Regarding divestiture activity at Batu Hijau, Newmont's economic ownership currently remains at 48.5%.
The Indonesian government has recently designated agency of the Ministry of Finance as the entity that will buy the final 7% stake. On April 18, 2011, our subsidiary than the agency reached an agreement to finalize the terms for purchase and sale, which is anticipated to occur by mid-2011. On to Slide 16.
In Africa, Newmont's biggest growth region, our Ahafo mine delivered attributable gold production of 186,000 ounces in Q1, which was a 55% increase over last year's first quarter due to higher mill grade and recovery as the result of mine sequencing. The higher gold production at Africa also had a favorable impact on cost applicable to sales, which were $451 per ounce in Q1, a reduction of 17% that was partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Ahafo of between 550,000 and 590,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $485 to $535 per ounce. I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to about 7",611,"Thanks, Brian. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to about 7 million ounces of attributable gold production by 2017 from a base of our current outlook of 5.1 million ounces of 5.3 million ounces of gold for 2011.
In order to get to that 7 million-ounce run rate in 2017, we need to bring about 3.2 million ounces of incremental production online over the next few years to offset the decline in the balance of our portfolio. Our growth will be faced in with about 20% of our new growth reflected in production by 2013, 50% by 2015 and the balance expected to be in production by 2017.
On Slide 18, we've added some additional comp color to the timing of that incremental production by breaking down our growth profile by project. I've noted that some of the analysts I've already got this fairly close, and So we're providing some information that some of you may not need, but interest of clarity we're going to give it to everybody in this format. The sequence of the projects begins with the and Nevada expansions where development is advanced. And it goes all the way through the commencement of production at Long Canyon, which we expect as shown on this slide in 2017. If you'd like to reference this growth plan against our potential decline, we would direct you to the detailed regional waterfall that we provided in our Investor Day where we gave the regional decline for each of our operations.
As the previous we told you, 5.1 million ounces to 5.3 million ounces our current base and we expect the next couple of years to be essentially stable and until we get back in to higher grade ore in basics, as Russ, mentioned beginning in 2013, late and then moving into higher grade into 2014 and 2015. At that time, we'll also see the benefits of our new expansion projects as shown on this slide. The numbers were a lot for each represent the initial development capital of each of those projects. This view of our growth plan should allow investors to better understand that we have a fairly solid production growth ahead of us. Moving on to Slide 19. We show our operating cost for these new projects annual that the plot of them against the GFMS 2010 cost curve.
Our forecast are based on what we know today about our projects, and they are unescalated. We're referencing our cost to the GFMS industry cost curve as a reminder that our actual cost will vary from our projections but that we believe the relative position of our projects should remain consistent with the replacement on the industry cost of Asimov's overtime. You'll see that our project expand the first of 4 quartiles, reflecting the diversity of our operations. You'll also notice that the companywide CAS we reported today for the first quarter file it is clearly near the 2010 industry midpoint for costs, which is in line with our guidance.
As Russell mentioned, we continue to focus on execution to ensure that we protect our margins into the future. So to summarize on Slide 20. We believe that Newmont offers a unique omission of production growth, project returns, reserves and exploration upside, balance sheet strength, continued operational execution and the industry's first and only gold price link dividends. With that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

Energy costs are about 25% of our cost structure. Again, we have budgeted at $90 oil and we're sitting today at around $110.

So I think you've got grade and he got certain working against he had it's going to be a challenge for us as Richard said earlier, maintaining our relative position of that cost curve and at the end of the day, you looking at a time to visit, try to manage some volatility around those cost structures but some challenges.

First of all, I want to thank all of you who attended our Investor Day two weeks ago, either in person or via the webcast. We've got a lot of positive and constructive feedback from the investment community on our approach to deliver growth with good returns. Specifically at Investor Day, we announced plans to grow from our current outlook of 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces of gold production for 2011 to approximately 7 million ounces of annual production by 2017. And that is a 35% growth net of decline, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders to enhance their exposure to gold price.
We've also heard that you want more color on our gold price link dividend and on the timing of our production from our projects and our growth plan. We plan on covering both of those in our call today. In addition to that, we'll provide highlights of our first quarter results. And our first quarter results were very solid with the benefit of robust gold and copper price environment, combined with strong operating results. We continue to have a rock-solid balance sheet and the potential to generate significant additional cash flow.
This, combined with the commitment and enthusiasm of our workforce across the globe, gives me confident that we will deliver on our growth plan. 
And now to recap our first quarter performance, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Russell Ball."

As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular. 
A few highlights from the quarter. We realized an average gold price of $1,382 an ounce, and while the record is approximately $115 below current spot prices. We generated record operating cash flow of almost $1 billion, a 36% increase over last year on a 25% increase in gold price. It is clear to me that the company-wide focus on operational execution and delivery is being driven to the bottom line in an environment of expanding margins, as reflected in the operating cash flow for the quarter.
Attributable gold production was 1.3 million ounces, slightly the same as [ph] last year and slightly ahead of our budget for the first quarter. Attributable copper production decreased to 57 million pounds driven by lower production at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, as we strip for Phase 6 and process lower-grade stockpiles. We should access Phase 6 ore in late 2013 copper production was, however, ahead of budget for the quarter. 
As far as the bottom line, there was essentially no difference between reported net income and our adjusted net income figures shown on the slide of $513 million or $1.04 a share, a really clean quarter from an income statement perspective. 
Continuing on Slide 5, revenue for the quarter was up 10% to $2.5 billion. On the cost side, cost applicable to sales were up 17% and 42%, respectively, with higher copper operating cost driven by lower production at Batu Hijau, as previously mentioned.
On gold operating costs. Starting this quarter, we have added 2 non-GAAP metrics that we think will provide investors with a different perspective on our cost structure and 1 likely more comparable to our peers. The first is attributable to CAS, which represents the operating cost per ounce for Newmont's attributable gold ounces produced. So we eliminate the ounces in cost that are included in our consolidated financial statements that are ultimately for the account of the noncontrolling shareholders largely, again, at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau. Attributable CAS for the quarter was $562 an ounce or roughly $5 an ounce higher than the consolidated CAS number that historically we have reported.
The second is net attributable CAS, where we take the attributable CAS number that I just covered and then treat our copper co-product revenue as a credit to operating costs. Net attributable CAS for the quarter was $438 an ounce. As I said, both of these are non-GAAP measures, but I believe they are important for investors to understand, particularly when comparing costs across the sector. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided in the appendix on Slides 24 and 25.
One last point on costs. I would like to remind you that we will continue to report U.S. GAAP operating costs, which result in us being required to expense significant more cost than we would under FRS accounting. Our estimate for 2011 is in the order of about $40 an ounce. 
Moving to Slide 6. We've included the GFMS 2010 industry cost drivers to provide some additional perspective on industrywide costs. From 2009 to 2010, average cash costs increased 17%, driven by the factors highlighted on the chart. I would submit that the cost drivers for 2011 are not going to be too much different from what you see here, and I think we will be looking at industrywide operating costs of around $650 an ounce for 2011.  Interestingly, our first quarter CAS of $557 an ounce is equal to the industry average for last year. I have no doubt that our relative position on the cost curve will improve in 2011. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our gold operating margin continues to expand at a greater rate than the gold price. I like what we saw in the early years of this bull market when operating and capital cost increases outran the globe price. If you think the midpoint of our cost guidance for 2011 and the current spot price of gold, you will see continued margin expansion likely for the balance of the year. 
Turning to Slide 8. As mentioned previously, strong operating cash flow for the quarter, combined with a strong balance sheet at the beginning of the year, resulted in a liquidity picture reflected on the right-hand side of the slide. On a consolidated basis, we reported $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.8 billion in marketable securities and ongoing capacity of approximately $1.8 billion under our corporate revolver. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of Fronteer Gold and utilized approximately $2.25 billion in cash, which left us with still an excess of $2 billion on the balance sheet.
I will talk about returning additional cash to shareholders shortly, but first, a few thoughts on gold with spot prices nearing all-time high, at lease on a nominal basis. I've included on Slide 9 Martin Murenbeeld's most recent summary slides on the gold market. For those who don't subscribe to Martin's work, I really believe you're missing out on the most complete and accurate coverage of the gold market. 
For some history, Martin hasn't always been bullish on gold, and in fact, he was very bearish in late '90s as produced as hedged, central banks sold and the us dollar range to premium. Martin turned bullish in 2001. And for those who haven't been following his work, he's been uncannily accurate in his forecast since then. You can see Martin's bullish and bearish arguments for gold on the slide. And I won't go into them in any detail, as we clearly don't have time on this call.
In short, Martin remains bullish and has the probability weighted forecast of $1,546 for the end of 2011 and an average price of $1,573 for 2012. Although as you can see on the bottom of the slide, he does make a point that he makes no allowances for geopolitics in his forecast.
On the Slide 10, you will see GFMS's forecast for 2011, albeit with a slightly less bullish average of $1,455, but interestingly, a very wide range of up to $1,620 an ounce. Finally, I've included a quote from Dennis Gartman's research note from Tuesday this week. I think it very distinctly sums up the current gold market, where Dennis notes that gold trade is no longer a commodity but as a currency. We concur, we are bullish, and as outlined in our Investor Day in New York on April 7, we are ready to invest accordingly. 
At this same Analyst Day, we announced our gold price link dividend, which is summarized on Slide 11. In short, we believe that we have an obligation to share this significant cash flow we are generating with the owners of the company, and that is what we intend to do starting with the gold price link dividend. Subject, of course, to regular quarterly board approval, starting with the second quarter dividend, shareholders will receive an annual dividend that increases by $0.20 for every $100 increase in our net realized gold price for the trailing quarter.
To take the second quarter dividend as an example, we realized $1,382 an ounce, which corresponds to an $0.80 annual dividend on the chart that you see on this slide. So we will be paying a $0.20 quarterly dividend on June 29. This represents a 33% increase over the first quarter dividend and 100% increase over the year-ago dividend. 
Looking ahead, it's very likely that our net realized price for Q2 will be towards the high end of the $1,400 to $1,499 bucket, which should equate to an annual dollar rate -- annual dividend of $0.25 for the third quarter dividend payment. This would represent 1/3 of 25% increase.
As we have said before, having the financial strength and flexibility we have allowed us to both aggressively grow the business and return capital to shareholders. With a bullish view on our own internal opportunities and the gold price, we will continue to look at further alternatives to return additional cash to shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Brian, who will cover the operational performance for the quarter."

We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower production",869,"Thanks, Russell. We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower production from South America, while North America and APAC production was essentially flat. 
Consolidated costs applicable to sales were 17% higher than last year due to lower production in South America, as well as higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs in North America. And as Russell mentioned a few minutes ago, this is generally line with our industry as a whole.
Commencing our regional discussion on Slide 13 with North America, you'll see a recent picture of the gold quarry area in Nevada where remediation from the slide that took place in December 2009 is nearing completion. Over 40 million tons of alluvium and bedrock have been removed, and all of the equipment that was trapped by the slide has been safely recovered. We are currently mining fresh ore feed for Mill 5, and approximately 50% of the ore going to Mill 5 is direct from gold quarry. 
Turning to first quarter results. Attributable gold production in North America was 482,000 ounces, up 2% over last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher leach placement at the Soledad-Dipolos pit at La Herradura in Mexico. Gold ounces produced in Nevada were virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010, as higher mill production from underground sources was offset by a lower leach placement due to mine sequencing. 
North American costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs, and lower leach production in Nevada. This was partially offset by higher copper and silver byproduct credits. Newmont continues to expect full year North American gold production of 1.98 to 2.1 million ounces at cost applicable to sales of $560 to $600 an ounce.
Moving to Slide 14. Attributable gold production during the first quarter in South America region at Yanacocha in Peru was 160,000 ounces. This included 148,000 ounces from Yanacocha and 12,000 ounces from La Zanja. Gold production in South America decreased 26% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower leach placement, mill grade and transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were $583 per ounce, an increase of 57% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower production, higher labor costs that was partially offset by lower workers' participation costs and higher byproduct credits. Newmont continue to expect 2011 attributable gold production in South America between 715,000 and 775,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $500 and $550 per ounce. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 15. Attributable gold production was 514,000 ounces, down 1.5% from the prior-year quarter, while copper production was 57 million pounds, down 37% from Q1 2010. The biggest driver of the change in gold and copper production -- sorry, in Indonesia, where we are currently processing from stockpile while the Phase 6 stripping campaign is under way. 
At our Boddington mine in Australia, we had a solid quarter despite 8 days of downtime due to a conveyor belt failure. Had we not experienced that unplanned event, production at Boddington would've been ahead of budget for the quarter. As the picture at right depicts, Boddington recently posted its 1 million pounds of gold production. Our 
Asia-Pacific region reported gold costs applicable to sales of $527 per ounce, up 15% over last year's Q1 and copper costs applicable to sales of $1.11 per pound, up 42%. Costs were impacted by the lower Batu Hijau production, as well as attributable gold production -- sorry, increase over last -- Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production in the Asia-Pacific region of between 1.86 and 1.99 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $600 and $675 per ounce. We also expect 2011 attributable copper production of 190 to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of $1.25 to $1.50 per pound. Regarding divestiture activity at Batu Hijau, Newmont's economic ownership currently remains at 48.5%. The Indonesian government has recently designated an agency of the Ministry of Finance as the entity that will buy the final 7% stake. On April 18, 2011, our subsidiary and the agency reached an agreement to finalize the terms for the purchase and sale, which is anticipated to occur by mid-2011. 
On to Slide 16. In Africa, Newmont's biggest growth region, our Ahafo mine delivered attributable gold production of 186,000 ounces in Q1, which was a 55% increase over last year's first quarter due to higher mill grade and recovery as a result of mine sequencing. The higher gold production at Africa also had a favorable impact on costs applicable to sales, which were $451 per ounce in Q1, a reduction of 17% that was partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Ahafo of between 550,000 and 590,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $485 to $535 per ounce. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced in our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to about 7 million ounces of attributable gold production by 2017 from a base of our current outlook of 5.1 of 5.3 million ounces of gold for 2011.
In order to get to that 7 million ounce run rate in 2017, we need to bring about 3.2 million ounces of incremental production online over the next few years to offset the decline in the balance of our portfolio. Our growth will be faced in, with about 20% of our new growth reflected in production by 2013, 50% by 2015 and the balance expected to be in production by 2017.
On Slide 18, we've added some additional color to the timing of that incremental production by breaking down our growth profile by project. I've noted that several analysts have already got this fairly close, and so we're providing some information that some of you may not need, but in the interest of clarity, we're going to give it to everybody in this format. 
The sequence begins with the Subika and Nevada expansions where development is advancing, and it goes all the way through the commencement of production at Long Canyon, which we expect, as shown on this slide, in 2017. If you'd like to reference this growth plan against our potential decline, we would direct you to the detailed regional waterfall that we provided in our Investor Day where we gave the regional decline for each of our operations.
As we previously told you, 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces is our current base, and we expect the next couple of years to be essentially stable until we get back into higher-grade ore in Phase 6, as Russ mentioned, beginning in 2013, late and then moving into higher grade into 2014 and 2015. At that time, we'll also see the benefits of our new expansion projects, as shown on this slide. The numbers to the left of each represent the initial development capital of each of those projects. This view of our growth plan should allow investors to better understand that we have a fairly solid arc of production growth ahead of us. 
Moving on to Slide 19. We show our operating cost for these new projects, and you'll note that we plotted them against the GFMS 2010 cost curve. Our forecast are based on what we know today about our projects, and they are unescalated. We're referencing our cost to the GFMS industry cost curve as a reminder that our actual cost will vary from our projections but that we believe the relative position of our projects should remain consistent within their replacement on the industry cost curve as it moves over time. 
You'll see that our projects expand the first of 4 quartiles, reflecting the diversity of our operations. You'll also notice that the companywide CAS we reported today for the first quarter fall squarely near the 2010 industry midpoint for costs, which is in line with our prior guidance. As Russell mentioned, we continue to focus on our execution to ensure that we protect our margins into the future. 
So to summarize on Slide 20. We believe that Newmont offers a unique combination of production growth, project returns, reserves and exploration upside, balance sheet strength, continued operational execution and the industry's first and only gold price link dividend. 
With that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

For us, we're going into the dry season, so we have 2 months of nice, dry roads, and in the fourth quarter, a little more challenging.

It's a very interesting perspective, and I would like to remind people, we currently look at the top line, we're going to look at the top end of cost line. And I think what we'll see if that thesis is correct, the weaker U.S. dollar will drive gold production cost curves up, because obviously the majority of gold production is outside the U.S. So I think FX is the one that's going to be industrywide. Again, if the thesis is correct on a weaker U.S. dollar, and you've seen that certainly on a trade-weighted basis over the last couple of modes. The other issues, obviously, fuel for us. Energy costs are about 25% of our cost structure. Again, we have budgeted at $90 oil, and we're sitting today at around $110. And if you think about labor costs, that's about 45% of our cost structure. And labor costs are largely for us non-dollar denominated. So I'd say those in conjunction with our lower grades. These deposits, the average grade has decreased, and you've seen that in the gold industry and in the copper industry, where grades have come up significantly. So I think you've got grade and you've got things working against you. And it is going to be a challenge for us, as Richard said earlier, maintaining our relative position on that cost curve and at the end of the day looking, as John suggested, to try and manage some of the volatility around those cost structures, but clearly some challenges. I think what you will see on the cost is $35 to $45 to $50, who knows where silver prices are going to be. A lot of the producers with significant silver byproduct will be shielded because, clearly, silver has had incredible run over the last 6 to 9 moths that will offset some of those cost pressures.

And that is a 35% growth net of decline, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders to enhance their exposure to gold price.

Turning to Slide 4. As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular. A few highlights from the quart",1388,"Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Turning to Slide 4. As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular. 
A few highlights from the quarter. We realized an average gold price of $1,382 an ounce, and while the record is approximately $115 below current spot prices. We generated record operating cash flow of almost $1 billion, a 36% increase over last year on a 25% increase in gold price. It is clear to me that the company-wide focus on operational execution and delivery is being driven to the bottom line in an environment of expanding margins, as reflected in the operating cash flow for the quarter.
Attributable gold production was 1.3 million ounces, slightly the same as [ph] last year and slightly ahead of our budget for the first quarter. Attributable copper production decreased to 57 million pounds driven by lower production at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, as we strip for Phase 6 and process lower-grade stockpiles. We should access Phase 6 ore in late 2013. Copper production was, however, ahead of budget for the quarter. 
As far as the bottom line, there was essentially no difference between reported net income and our adjusted net income figures shown on the slide of $513 million or $1.04 a share, a really clean quarter from an income statement perspective. 
Continuing on Slide 5, revenue for the quarter was up 10% to $2.5 billion. On the cost side, cost applicable to sales were up 17% and 42%, respectively, with higher copper operating cost driven by lower production at Batu Hijau, as previously mentioned.
On gold operating costs. Starting this quarter, we have added 2 non-GAAP metrics that we think will provide investors with a different perspective on our cost structure and one likely more comparable to our peers. The first is attributable to CAS, which represents the operating cost per ounce for Newmont's attributable gold ounces produced. So we eliminate the ounces in cost that are included in our consolidated financial statements that are ultimately for the account of the noncontrolling shareholders largely, again, at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau. Attributable CAS for the quarter was $562 an ounce or roughly $5 an ounce higher than the consolidated CAS number that historically we have reported.
The second is net attributable CAS, where we take the attributable CAS number that I just covered and then treat our copper co-product revenue as a credit to operating costs. Net attributable CAS for the quarter was $438 an ounce. As I said, both of these are non-GAAP measures, but I believe they are important for investors to understand, particularly when comparing costs across the sector. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided in the appendix on Slides 24 and 25.
One last point on costs. I would like to remind you that we will continue to report U.S. GAAP operating costs, which result in us being required to expense significant more cost than we would under FRS accounting. Our estimate for 2011 is in the order of about $40 an ounce. 
Moving to Slide 6. We've included the GFMS 2010 industry cost drivers to provide some additional perspective on industrywide costs. From 2009 to 2010, average cash costs increased 17%, driven by the factors highlighted on the chart. I would submit that the cost drivers for 2011 are not going to be too much different from what you see here, and I think we will be looking at industrywide operating costs of around $650 an ounce for 2011.  Interestingly, our first quarter CAS of $557 an ounce is equal to the industry average for last year. I have no doubt that our relative position on the cost curve will improve in 2011. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our gold operating margin continues to expand at a greater rate than the gold price. I like what we saw in the early years of this bull market when operating and capital cost increases outran the globe price. If you take the midpoint of our cost guidance for 2011 and the current spot price of gold, you will see continued margin expansion likely for the balance of the year. 
Turning to Slide 8. As mentioned previously, strong operating cash flow for the quarter, combined with a strong balance sheet at the beginning of the year, resulted in a liquidity picture reflected on the right-hand side of the slide. On a consolidated basis, we reported $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.8 billion in marketable securities and ongoing capacity of approximately $1.8 billion under our corporate revolver. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of Fronteer Gold and utilized approximately $2.25 billion in cash, which left us with still an excess of $2 billion on the balance sheet.
I will talk about returning additional cash to shareholders shortly, but first, a few thoughts on gold with spot prices nearing an all-time high, at least on a nominal basis. I've included on Slide 9 Martin Murenbeeld's most recent summary slides on the gold market. For those who don't subscribe to Martin's work, I really believe you're missing out on the most complete and accurate coverage of the gold market. 
For some history, Martin hasn't always been bullish on gold, and in fact, he was very bearish in late '90s as produced as hedged, central banks sold and the U.S. dollar range to premium. Martin turned bullish in 2001. And for those who haven't been following his work, he's been uncannily accurate in his forecast since then. You can see Martin's bullish and bearish arguments for gold on the slide. And I won't go into them in any detail, as we clearly don't have time on this call.
In short, Martin remains bullish and has the probability weighted forecast of $1,546 for the end of 2011 and an average price of $1,573 for 2012. Although as you can see on the bottom of the slide, he does make a point that he makes no allowances for geopolitics in his forecast.
On the Slide 10, you will see GFMS's forecast for 2011, albeit with a slightly less bullish average of $1,455, but interestingly, a very wide range of up to $1,620 an ounce. Finally, I've included a quote from Dennis Gartman's research note from Tuesday this week. I think it very succinctly sums up the current gold market, where Dennis notes that gold trade is no longer a commodity but as a currency. We concur, we are bullish, and as outlined in our Investor Day in New York on April 7, we are going to invest accordingly. 
At that same Analyst Day, we announced our gold price link dividend, which is summarized on Slide 11. In short, we believe that we have an obligation to share this significant cash flow we are generating with the owners of the company, and that is what we intend to do starting with the gold price link dividend. Subject, of course, to regular quarterly board approval, starting with the second quarter dividend, shareholders will receive an annual dividend that increases by $0.20 for every $100 increase in our net realized gold price for the trailing quarter.
To take the second quarter dividend as an example, we realized $1,382 an ounce, which corresponds to an $0.80 annual dividend on the chart that you see on this slide. So we will be paying a $0.20 quarterly dividend on June 29. This represents a 33% increase over the first quarter dividend and 100% increase over the year-ago dividend. 
Looking ahead, it's very likely that our net realized price for Q2 will be towards the high end of the $1,400 to $1,499 bucket, which should equate to an annual dollar rate -- annual dividend of $0.25 for the third quarter dividend payment. This would represent 1/3 of 25% increase.
As we have said before, having the financial strength and flexibility we have allows us to both aggressively grow the business and return capital to shareholders. With a bullish view on our own internal opportunities and the gold price, we will continue to look at further alternatives to return additional cash to shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Brian, who will cover the operational performance for the quarter."

We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower production",870,"Thanks, Russell. We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower production from South America, while North America and APAC production was essentially flat. 
Consolidated costs applicable to sales were 17% higher than last year due to lower production in South America, as well as higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs in North America. And as Russell mentioned a few minutes ago, this is generally in line with our industry as a whole.
Commencing our regional discussion on Slide 13 with North America, you'll see a recent picture of the gold quarry area in Nevada where remediation from the slide that took place in December 2009 is nearing completion. Over 40 million tons of alluvium and bedrock have been removed, and all of the equipment that was trapped by the slide has been safely recovered. We are currently mining fresh ore feed for Mill 5, and approximately 50% of the ore going to Mill 5 is direct from gold quarry. 
Turning to first quarter results. Attributable gold production in North America was 482,000 ounces, up 2% over last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher leach placement at the Soledad-Dipolos pit at La Herradura in Mexico. Gold ounces produced in Nevada were virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010, as higher mill production from underground sources was offset by a lower leach placement due to mine sequencing. 
North American costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs, and lower leach production in Nevada. This was partially offset by higher copper and silver byproduct credits. Newmont continues to expect full year North American gold production of 1.98 to 2.1 million ounces at cost applicable to sales of $560 to $600 an ounce.
Moving to Slide 14. Attributable gold production during the first quarter in South America region at Yanacocha in Peru was 160,000 ounces. This included 148,000 ounces from Yanacocha and 12,000 ounces from La Zanja. Gold production in South America decreased 26% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower leach placement, mill grade and transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were $583 per ounce, an increase of 57% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower production, higher labor costs that was partially offset by lower workers' participation costs and higher byproduct credits. Newmont continue to expect 2011 attributable gold production in South America between 715,000 and 775,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $500 and $550 per ounce. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 15. Attributable gold production was 514,000 ounces, down 1.5% from the prior-year quarter, while copper production was 57 million pounds, down 37% from Q1 2010. The biggest driver of the change in gold and copper production -- sorry, in Indonesia, where we are currently processing from stockpile while the Phase 6 stripping campaign is under way. 
At our Boddington mine in Australia, we had a solid quarter despite 8 days of downtime due to a conveyor belt failure. Had we not experienced that unplanned event, production at Boddington would've been ahead of budget for the quarter. As the picture at right depicts, Boddington recently posted its 1 million pounds of gold production. 
Our Asia-Pacific region reported gold costs applicable to sales of $527 per ounce, up 15% over last year's Q1 and copper costs applicable to sales of $1.11 per pound, up 42%. Costs were impacted by the lower Batu Hijau production, as well as attributable gold production -- sorry, increase over last -- Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production in the Asia-Pacific region of between 1.86 and 1.99 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $600 and $675 per ounce. We also expect 2011 attributable copper production of 190 to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of $1.25 to $1.50 per pound. Regarding divestiture activity at Batu Hijau, Newmont's economic ownership currently remains at 48.5%. The Indonesian government has recently designated an agency of the Ministry of Finance as the entity that will buy the final 7% stake. On April 18, 2011, our subsidiary and the agency reached an agreement to finalize the terms for the purchase and sale, which is anticipated to occur by mid-2011. 
On to Slide 16. In Africa, Newmont's biggest growth region, our Ahafo mine delivered attributable gold production of 186,000 ounces in Q1, which was a 55% increase over last year's first quarter due to higher mill grade and recovery as a result of mine sequencing. The higher gold production at Africa also had a favorable impact on costs applicable to sales, which were $451 per ounce in Q1, a reduction of 17% that was partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Ahafo of between 550,000 and 590,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $485 to $535 per ounce. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced in our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to abou",610,"Thanks, Brian. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced in our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to about 7 million ounces of attributable gold production by 2017 from a base of our current outlook of 5.1 of 5.3 million ounces of gold for 2011.
In order to get to that 7 million ounce run rate in 2017, we need to bring about 3.2 million ounces of incremental production online over the next few years to offset the decline in the balance of our portfolio. Our growth will be faced in, with about 20% of our new growth reflected in production by 2013, 50% by 2015 and the balance expected to be in production by 2017.
On Slide 18, we've added some additional color to the timing of that incremental production by breaking down our growth profile by project. I've noted that several analysts have already got this fairly close, and so we're providing some information that some of you may not need, but in the interest of clarity, we're going to give it to everybody in this format. 
The sequence begins with the Subika and Nevada expansions where development is advancing, and it goes all the way through the commencement of production at Long Canyon, which we expect, as shown on this slide, in 2017. If you'd like to reference this growth plan against our potential decline, we would direct you to the detailed regional waterfall that we provided in our Investor Day where we gave the regional decline for each of our operations.
As we previously told you, 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces is our current base, and we expect the next couple of years to be essentially stable until we get back into higher-grade ore in Phase 6, as Russ mentioned, beginning in 2013, late and then moving into higher grade into 2014 and 2015. At that time, we'll also see the benefits of our new expansion projects, as shown on this slide. The numbers to the left of each represent the initial development capital of each of those projects. This view of our growth plan should allow investors to better understand that we have a fairly solid arc of production growth ahead of us. 
Moving on to Slide 19. We show our operating cost for these new projects, and you'll note that we plotted them against the GFMS 2010 cost curve. Our forecast are based on what we know today about our projects, and they are unescalated. We're referencing our cost to the GFMS industry cost curve as a reminder that our actual cost will vary from our projections but that we believe the relative position of our projects should remain consistent within their replacement on the industry cost curve as it moves over time. 
You'll see that our projects span the first of 4 quartiles, reflecting the diversity of our operations. You'll also notice that the companywide CAS we reported today for the first quarter fall squarely near the 2010 industry midpoint for costs, which is in line with our prior guidance. As Russell mentioned, we continue to focus on our execution to ensure that we protect our margins into the future. 
So to summarize on Slide 20. We believe that Newmont offers a unique combination of production growth, project returns, reserves and exploration upside, balance sheet strength, continued operational execution and the industry's first and only gold price link dividend.

It's a very interesting perspective, and I would like to remind people, we currently look at the top line, we're going to look at the top end of cost line. And I think what we'll see if that thesis is correct, the weaker U.S. dollar will drive gold production cost curves up, because obviously the majority of gold production is outside the U.S. So I think FX is the one that's going to be industrywide. Again, if the thesis is correct on a weaker U.S. dollar, and you've seen that certainly on a trade-weighted basis over the last couple of modes. The other issues, obviously, fuel for us. Energy costs are about 25% of our cost structure. Again, we have budgeted at $90 oil, and we're sitting today at around $110. And if you think about labor costs, that's about 45% of our cost structure. And labor costs are largely for us non-dollar denominated. So I'd say those in conjunction with our lower grades. These deposits, the average grade has decreased, and you've seen that in the gold industry and in the copper industry, where grades have come up significantly. So I think you've got grade and you've got things working against you. And it is going to be a challenge for us, as Richard said earlier, maintaining our relative position on that cost curve and at the end of the day looking, as John suggested, to try and manage some of the volatility around those cost structures, but clearly some challenges. I think what you will see on the cost is $35 to $45 to $50, who knows where silver prices are going to be. A lot of the producers with significant silver byproduct will be shielded because, clearly, silver has had incredible run over the last 6 to 9 months that will offset some of those cost pressures.

In the second quarter, we continue to focus on delivering growth, generating profits and returning capital to shareholders. On April 6, we closed the Frontier Gold acquisition and began our drilling program at Long Canyon, Nevada it. We've now completed over 20,000 meters of drilling at Long Canyon, some encouraging initial intercepts identified earlier this month. At the same time, our discovery and development team remains focused on advancing several key projects in our growth plan as evidenced by Wednesday's announcement of full funds approval for our Conga and Tanami projects. As you may remember, we also announced full funds approval for our team project in March. Collectively, those projects, Conga, Tanami, Akyem and Long Canyon will deliver over 1 million ounces of gold production when completed.
Meanwhile, our existing top rating teams continue to focus on execution and cost control, providing our shareholders with continuing margin expansion in a rising gold price environment. Our second quarter highlights included an average realized gold sales price of $15.01, allowing us to boost our dividend to $0.30 per share for the third quarter. This is a 100% increase over our third quarter 2010 dividend.
On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend yield is now an industry-leading over 2%, just higher also than the current S&P 500 average yield. We are also maintaining our outlook for production and cost attributable to sales and capital expenditures. And although capital spending to the first half of 2011 has been lower than expected across the portfolio, we do expect to accelerate capital spending in the second half of the year.
I'll turn the call over to Russell, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our second quarter results."
291795,133969185,148657,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.As Richard mentio",878,"Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.
As Richard mentioned, we're maintaining our full-year 2011 outlook and we're on track to meet our goal of 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounce and attributable copper production of between 190 million to 100 million pounds. We're also maintaining our outlook for costs, despite our upward pressure from assumption changes we made in respect of the gold price, the Aussie dollar exchange rate and the new oil price, which are key drivers of our cost. So we had a very good first half, maintaining cost pressures and we think we're online to deliver for the balance of the year.
Focusing on Q2 operating costs, we did see pressure from a weaker U.S. dollar and higher labor commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. As expected, our second quarter costs applicable to sales per gold were towards the higher end of our annual outlook due to a combination of scale did gross maintenance in Nevada, which required a shutdown of approximately 30 days and processing of lower grades in Nevada was a function of mine sequencing and the filing remediation of the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in December 2009.
Copper costs applicable to sales in the second quarter were higher than last year as expected due to higher waste stripping related to Phase 6 in Batu Hijau and an extended mill maintenance shutdown at Batu Hijau. In order to provide better compatibility with our peers, last quarter, we also began reporting cost applicable to sales in attributable and net attributable basis. Second quarter cost applicable to sales on in a net attributable, which is down to $500 an ounce.
Let me highlight some of this key financial metrics for the quarter. Revenue of $2.4 billion was 11% higher than the year ago quarter, driven by higher realized gold and copper prices. In respect of earnings, we had another strong quarter generating net income attributable to shareholders and continuing operations of $523 million or $1.06 a share, up from $382 million or $0.78 a share for the year ago quarter.
During the quarter, we closed on the Frontier acquisition and the cost of approximately $20 million. In addition, during the quarter, we incurred copper provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of approximately $16 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had 84 million pounds of copper provisioning priced at $4.22 a pound.
It is interesting to note that if you look at quarterly adjusted net income over the past three years, you will see that we have a distinct seasonality effect our numbers, with the second quarter approximately 15% weaker than the other three-part is just a combination of factors, some of which I've covered above. And while we did run the as on a quarterly basis, we will try to do a better job providing quarterly direction in respect of productions since in the absence thereof quarter expectations become the annual guidance divided by four, which is how the regions perform.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $414 million, after an Indonesian tax payment of approximately $300 million for the 2010 year. Operating cash flow was also impacted by timing issue related to concentrate shipments that occurred right before quarter end for which provisional payments are only received in early Q3.
For the first half of the year, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion and if current metal prices continue we expect we will deliver very strong operating cash flow and earnings in the second half of the year.
Finally, bottom-line earnings were negatively impacted by an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $136 million related to the finalization of litigation related to our royalty on the Goldmine, currently operated by Saint Andrew Goldfields. The Saint Andrew royalty and our obligation to pay the sliding scale royalty is a legacy of the former Newmont capital business that we divested at the end of 2007. We previously announced details of the expected charge for this quarter in an 8-K filing on July 15.
On Slide 6, you will see the significant gold margin expansion experienced over the past 10 quarters, with a 90% increase in margin on a 66% increase in gold price. It is this margin expansion on current attributable production in excess of 5 million ounces that enables us to fund a truly unique combination of aggressive internal growth, increased investment for the long-term through exploration and the ability to return additional capital to shareholders.
Slide 7 provides evidence of our commitment to returning additional capital to shareholders, and you'll see a 200% increase in dividends over the past six quarters. On Wednesday this week in line with our stated goal price-linked dividend policy, the board approved a $0.30 per share dividend payable to the third quarter, payable on September 29 to shareholders of record on September 28. As Richard mentioned, the yield of the current stock price is an excess of 2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our regional operating performance in a little more detail."

Russell detailed the key production variances from the quarter in his remarks, and full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can be found in this morning's release or in our 10-Q. For the current discussion, I'd like to focus my remarks on relevant updates from each of our four operating regions.
Turning to Slide 9, our North American Q2 results were down slightly from last year's second quarter due to mine sequencing at Leeville and the temporary suspension of mining at chalk, which was partially offset by the initiation of mining at Exodus. As you can see on the picture, in July, we completed remediation work at gold Quarry, and we have recently recommenced mining ore from the pit. There is significant development activity under way throughout our Nevada operations including Exodus, which is an underground refractory deposit that commenced commercial production in May and is expected to produce about 65,000 to 75,000 ounces per year for at least five years, and provide a platform for further underground exploration.
Emigrant is the near surface leach deposit which is anticipated to be begin production in 2012 at about 80,000 ounces per year. While Pit Bajo, another underground refractory deposit, which delivered its first ounces in July is expected to produce 60,000 to 070,000 ounces in 2012, and will also provide underground exploration access between Pete and Kalgoorlie.
At Twin Creeks, we are expecting regulatory approval to initiate mining of the Vista seven lay back later this year. Approximately 600,000 ounces in total are expected to be mined from this deposit over the next four to five years. Our Phoenix operation, we continue to see opportunities for increasing production. We are permitting and preparing to construct the copper leech project, which should add 20 million to 25 million ounces of copper production per year beginning in the second half of 2013, and we are studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase in excess copper and gold production. At Long Canyon, drilling is focused on in-fill, mineralized extensions and district exploration and our extension drilling program continues to highlight growth potential.
In Mexico, construction of than Noche Buena mine in La Herradura is progressing according to schedule. We are also putting our partner as they consider developing a gold mill that will have a capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis.
Moving to Slide 10. South American production was up over the prior year due to the contribution of the new La Zanja improve partially offset by leech placement in Yanacocha. On the development front, we have resequenced the mine plant in Yanacocha to deal with geo0- political and paleozoic issues in La Zanja. And as previously announced this week, our board approved the Congo project, which Guy will speak to in more detail in a moment.
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 11. Regional volumes and costs in the second quarter were impacted by the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, production was ahead of budget at 205,000 ounces of gold for the quarter and optimization study is advancing. CAS was slightly higher than planned in Q2 related to a conveyor belt maintenance at Boddington. However, we are still on track to meet our guidance range of $580 to $620 per ounce.
This region is making good progress in achieving its strategic planning gold and is moving forward with the Tanami Shaft project after this week's board approval.
In Indonesia, signed a momentum of understanding allowing resumption of exploration activity at Elang and at other locations in eastern Indonesia. At Elang, we are re-establishing the exploration camp in advance of initiating our drilling program later this year.
I'll wrap up the regional discussion on Slide 12 with Africa. While Richard mentioned future milestones to growth, I'd like to recognize the significant milestone in our African region. On July 18, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our first full gold core at Ahafo. In its short history, our Ahafo operations have become the base for the fastest-growing region in our portfolio. So far, Newmont Ghana gold have safely produced our almost 2.5 million ounces can shipping significantly talk the overall value of our company since 2006. In addition to job creation, many community development project have come to the area due in part to Newmont's social investments, including programs dealing with malaria treatment and prevention, HIV AIDS awareness and education and community infrastructure projects. Ahafo demonstrated another strong quarter of gold production growth due to higher grades and recoveries at the Akyem and pits. Recent development activities include a successful public hearing with respect to our civic underground project, which paves the way for investment towards issuance of the production permit. While construction is well underway at Akyem after our Board of Directors approved the project in March, 2011. Both of these projects are important contributors to our growth plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Guy Lansdown who'll speak to the reason board approvals for Conga and the Tanami Shaft."

On to Slide 13. Earlier this week, we announced that the Conga and Tanami Shaft projects received full funds approval from our burger collectively, these projects are major steps towards achieving our goal of growing to 7 million ounces of gold production by 2017. I'd like to share some additional items on these projects.
On Slide 14, you'll see a picture of the drilling activity at our Congo project in Peru. Conga's size the quality of its current reserves and NRM make it one of the premier gold and copper mining projects in the world. In addition, we have established relationships with the local communities and an experienced base of employees and stakeholders. Furthermore, Congo provides a bridge to the future of Yanacocha allowing time for the potential development of the sulfuric and underground opportunities and continued exploration expense on our 300,000-hectare land package. Conga will also provide a strategic advantage to develop attention surrounding opportunities with the construction of the first copper concentrate in the region.
Planning for near-term production of 300,000 to 350,000 ounces of gold and 80,000 to 20,000 copper per year at cash cost of $400 to $450 per ounce and $1.25 to $1.75 per pound. Capital spending attributable to Newmont is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. This is an increase of our previous guidance of $1.8 billion. The cost increases are as a result of scoped developments, estimate refinement as well as Forex and escalation.
We have a great team on board, and ready to execute the project under the leadership of Paul Goodman, who will serve as our Project Director. Paul has tremendous experience and a great track record of successfully delivering large projects around the globe and in particular, in South America, we have successfully delivered the answering the projects on-time and under budget.
On Slide 15, we provided an update on the Tanami Shaft project in Australia which also received board approval on Wednesday. The shaft will increase Newmont's gold production from the Kelly underground mine at Tanami to greater than 340,000 ounces per year in a sustainable, profitable and responsible manner. We expect to have the potential to increase the resource through reduced cut off grades and improve access at dips. The sharp shaft will also reduce our cost by around $100 per ounce by increasing efficiency.
It will strategically position Newmont to potentially expand existing mine reserves through access to the ore and ore body and other exploration targets while leveraging off Newmont's existing position at the Tanami, including existing infrastructure and positive relationships with regulators and traditional owners. We're encouraged by Wednesday's board approval of the Conga and Tanami projects and we hope to bring more projects to development pipeline over the next several quarters. Richard?"

So to summarize, Newmont continues to execute on both our operations and development plans, and we continue to deliver solid results. We're advancing our growth plan across our portfolio with two key project approvals announced this week. We're maintaining our outlook for 2011 production, CAS and capital spending. We've increased our dividend over 200% over the second quarter of 2010 dividend, enhancing our shareholders' exposure to the rallying in gold price.
We now have the highest return of capital through gold price-link dividend than any gold company in this space. And notably, based on the our ROIC measure, we have the highest return on capital as well.
For further feedback that you'd like more information on project updates and milestones and hopefully some of today's materials were accepted in that regard with respect to responding to that feedback, and we will communicate periodic updates as is practicable on all of our growth projects going forward.

And with all that, we expect that we will see political changes in Peru, just like we do everywhere else around the world. I would say specifically, with respect to the change of presidents in Peru, one, it's always, I think good to note that in any country the world where change happen in a democracy, and things go without really any revolution or anything to go with that, Peru certainly qualifies for that. I think people in Peru pride the vote that the get and they use it properly. I hope that President Omala will be a President who values the contribution of business in general and mining particular. And at this point, I think given the ministerial staff that he has selected, I think he is looking for experienced individuals who will help guide the government of Peru in exactly the same direction that it's been driven. And I think what we could expect is to see some ongoing thoughts and discussions around how best to close the gap between rich and poor and better share some of the wealth of Peru. And I think we're all for that, done in the right way. And so far, what I would tell you is we expect this as when President Garcia came to into office that there will be some discussions about what we will do as mining companies on royalties. I don't expect that gold or Yanacocha and Conga will be picked on in particular. I think it will be industry-wide. And I think we have be a pretty good sense of what that is and we've incorporated that into our economics. I won't tell you what our assumption is but we've made some assumptions.

Do you expect, in the coming projects to have significantly lower average cost per ounces or do you think that that $7 billion baseline that you give in April will start to creep up just because of the new information on these projects?"

And as with Conga, if you do the debt on production or cost, as both cost for gold and cost for copper and you look at the revenue stream, I think a lot of companies would tell you that they are producing gold for free, the way this comes out. So I think when we look at the cash flow returns on this and we look at the near-term payback, these are just the kind of projects that we ought to do.

But you need to remember that those funds will go to existing shareholders so it's second re-ineffect versus additional capital going to be TNT. What we did complete in the quarter was $600 million nonrecourse to the sponsors' financing at the level, and that provides that entity with significant capital flexibility to fund ongoing operating and capital costs, as we continue to evaluate our third seg and starting to spend on the Elang project, which we've spoken to you in a small amount of detail.

In the second quarter, we continue to focus on delivering growth, generating profits and returning capital to shareholders. On April 6, we closed the Fronteer Gold acquisition and began our drilling program at Long Canyon, Nevada. We've now completed over 20,000 meters of drilling at Long Canyon, some encouraging initial intercepts identified earlier this month. At the same time, our discovery and development team remains focused on advancing several key projects in our growth plan as evidenced by Wednesday's announcement of full funds approval for our Conga and Tanami projects. As you may remember, we also announced full funds approval for our Akyem project in March. Collectively, those projects, Conga, Tanami, Akyem and Long Canyon will deliver over 1 million ounces of annual gold production when completed.
Meanwhile, our existing top rating teams continue to focus on execution and cost control, providing our shareholders with continuing margin expansion in a rising gold price environment. Our second quarter highlights included an average realized gold sales price of $15.01, allowing us to boost our dividend to $0.30 per share for the third quarter. This is a 100% increase over our third quarter 2010 dividend.
On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend yield is now an industry-leading over 2%. This is higher also than the current S&P 500 average yield. We're also maintaining our outlook for production and cost attributable to sales and capital expenditures. And although capital spending to the first half of 2011 has been lower than expected across the portfolio, we do expect to accelerate capital spending in the second half of the year.
I'll turn the call over to Russell, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our second quarter results."
291795,133969185,148883,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.As Richard mentio",881,"Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.
As Richard mentioned, we're maintaining our full year 2011 outlook, and we're on track to meet our goal of 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces and attributable copper production of between 190 million and 220 million pounds. We're also maintaining our outlook for costs. Despite upward pressure from assumption changes we made in respect of the gold price, the Aussie dollar exchange rate and the oil price, which are key drivers of our costs. So we had a very good first half, maintaining cost pressures, and we think we're on line to deliver for the balance of the year.
Focusing on Q2 operating costs, we did see pressure from a weaker U.S. dollar and higher labor commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. As expected, our second quarter costs applicable to sales of gold are towards the higher end of our annual outlook due to a combination of scheduled roaster maintenance in Nevada, which required a shutdown of approximately 30 days, and processing of lower grades in Nevada as a function of mine sequencing and the final remediation of the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in December 2009.
Copper cost applicable to sales for the second quarter were higher than last year as expected due to higher waste stripping related to Phase 6 at Batu Hijau and an extended mill maintenance shutdown at Batu. In order to provide better comparability with our peers, last quarter, we also began reporting costs applicable to sales on an attributable and net attributable basis. Second quarter costs applicable to sales on a net attributable basis were just under $500 an ounce.
Slide 5 highlights some of the key financial metrics for the quarter. Revenue of $2.4 billion was 11% higher than the year-ago quarter, driven by higher realized gold and copper prices. In respect of earnings, we had another strong quarter, generating net income attributable to shareholders and continuing operations of $523 million or $1.06 a share, up from $382 million or $0.78 a share for the year-ago quarter.
During the quarter, we closed on the Fronteer acquisition and expensed transaction costs of approximately $20 million. In addition, during the quarter, we incurred a copper provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of approximately $16 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had 84 million pounds of copper provisioning priced at $4.22 a pound.
It is interesting to note that if you look at quarterly adjusted net income over the past 3 years, you will see that we have a distinct seasonality effect to our numbers, with the second quarter approximately 15% weaker than the other 3 quarters due to a combination of factors, some of which are covered above. And while we don't run the business on a quarterly basis, we will try to do a better job providing quarterly direction in respect to production since in the absence thereof, quarterly expectations become the annual guidance divided by 4, which is not how the regions perform.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $414 million after an Indonesian tax payment of approximately $300 million for the 2010 year. Operating cash flow was also impacted by timing issue related to concentrate shipments that occurred right before quarter-end, for which provisional payments are only received in early Q3.
For the first half of the year, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, and if current metal prices continue, we expect we will deliver very strong operating cash flow and earnings in the second half of the year.
Finally, bottom line earnings were negatively impacted by an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $136 million related to the finalization of litigation related to our royalty on the Holt mine, currently operated by St. Andrew Goldfields. The St. Andrew royalty and our obligation to pay the sliding scale royalty is a legacy of the former Newmont capital business that we divested at the end of 2007. We previously announced details of the expected charge for this quarter in an 8-K filing on July 15.
On Slide 6, you will see the significant gold margin expansion experienced over the past 10 quarters, with a 90% increase in margin on a 66% increase in gold price. It is this margin expansion on current attributable production in excess of 5 million ounces that enables us to fund a truly unique combination of aggressive internal growth, increased investment for the long term through exploration and the ability to return additional capital to shareholders.
Slide 7 provides evidence of our commitment to returning additional capital to shareholders, and you'll see a 200% increase in dividends over the past 6 quarters. On Wednesday this week, in line with our stated gold price-linked dividend policy, the board approved a $0.30 per share dividend payable for the third quarter, payable on September 29 to shareholders of record on September 28. As Richard mentioned, the yield of the current stock price is an excess of 2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our regional operating performance in a little more detail."

An overview of Q2 results by region can be found on Slide 8, with a view of performance versus the prior year quarter. Russell detailed the key production variances from the quarter in his remarks, and full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can be found in this morning's release or in our 10-Q. For the current discussion, I'd like to focus my remarks on relevant updates from each of our 4 operating regions.
Turning to Slide 9, our North American Q2 results were down slightly from last year's second quarter due to mine sequencing at Leeville and the temporary suspension of mining at Chukar, which was partially offset by the initiation of mining at Exodus. As you can see in the picture, in July, we completed remediation work at Gold Quarry, and we have recently recommenced mining ore from the pit. There is significant development activity underway throughout our Nevada operations, including Exodus, which is an underground refractory deposit that commenced commercial production in May and is expected to produce about 65,000 to 75,000 ounces per year for at least 5 years and provide a platform for further underground exploration.
Emigrant is the near-surface oxide leach deposit which is anticipated to be begin production in 2012 at about 80,000 ounces per year, while Pete Bajo, another underground refractory deposit which delivered its first ounces in July, is expected to produce 60,000 to 70,000 ounces in 2012 and will also provide underground exploration access between Pete and Carlin East.
At Twin Creeks, we are expecting regulatory approval to initiate mining of the Vista 7 layback later this year. Approximately 600,000 ounces in total are expected to be mined from this deposit over the next 4 to 5 years. 
At our Phoenix operation, we continue to see opportunities for increasing production. We are permitting and preparing to construct the copper leach project, which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year beginning in the second half of 2013, and we are studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase in-excess copper and gold production. 
At Long Canyon, drilling is focused on in-fill, mineralized extensions and district exploration, and our extension drilling program continues to highlight growth potential.
In Mexico, construction of the Noche Buena mine in La Herradura is progressing according to schedule. We are also supporting our partner as they consider developing a gold mill that will have a capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis.
Moving to Slide 10, South American production was up over the prior year due to the contribution of the new La Zanja mine in Peru, partially offset by lower leach placement at Yanacocha. On the development front, we have re-sequenced the mine plant at Yanacocha to deal with geotechnical and paleosol issues at La Quinua. And as previously announced this week, our board approved the Conga project, which Guy will speak to in more detail in a moment.
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 11, regional volumes and costs in the second quarter were impacted by the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, production was ahead of budget at 205,000 ounces of gold for the quarter, and optimization study is advancing. CAS was slightly higher than planned in Q2 related to a conveyor belt maintenance at Boddington. However, we are still on track to meet our guidance range of $580 to $620 per ounce. This region is making good progress in achieving its strategic planned goals and is moving forward with the Tanami Shaft project after this week's board approval.
In Indonesia,PTNNT signed a memorandum of understanding allowing resumption of exploration activity at Elang and at other locations in eastern Indonesia. At Elang, we are reestablishing the exploration camp in advance of initiating our drilling program later this year.
I'll wrap up the regional discussion on Slide 12 with Africa. While Richard mentioned future milestones to growth, I'd like to recognize the significant milestone in our African region. On July 18, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our first full gold core at Ahafo. In its short history, our Ahafo operations have become the base for the fastest-growing region in our portfolio. So far, Newmont Ghana gold has safely produced almost 2.5 million ounces, contributing significantly to the overall value of our company since 2006. In addition to job creation, many community development projects have come to the area due in part to Newmont's social investments, including programs dealing with malaria treatment and prevention, HIV AIDS awareness and education and community infrastructure projects. Ahafo demonstrated another strong quarter of gold production growth due to higher grades and recoveries at the Apensu and Amoma pits. Recent development activities include a successful public hearing with respect to our Subika underground project, which paves the way for advancement towards issuance of the production permit, while construction is well underway at Akyem after our Board of Directors approved the project in March, 2011. Both of these projects are important contributors to our growth plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Guy Lansdown, who will speak to the recent board approvals for Conga and the Tanami Shaft."

Earlier this week, we announced that the Conga and Tanami Shaft projects received full funds approval from our board. Collectively, these projects are major steps towards achieving our goal of growing to 7 million ounces of gold production by 2017. I'd like to shed some additional light on those projects.
On Slide 14, you'll see a picture of the drilling activity at our Conga project in Peru. Conga's size and quality of its current reserves and NRM make it one of the premier gold and copper mining projects in the world. In addition, we have established relationships with the local communities and an experienced base of employees and stakeholders. Furthermore, Conga provides a bridge to the future of Yanacocha, allowing time for the potential development of the sulfidic and underground opportunities and continued exploration exposure on our 300,000-hectare land package. Conga will also provide a strategic advantage to develop potential surrounding opportunities with our construction of the first copper concentrator in the region. We're planning for near-term production of 300,000 to 350,000 ounces of gold and 80 million to 120 million pounds of copper per year at cash costs of $400 to $450 per ounce and $1.25 to $1.75 per pound. Capital spending attributable to Newmont is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. This is an increase of our previous guidance of $1.8 billion. The cost increases are as a result of scope developments, estimate refinement, as well as Forex and escalation.
We have a great team on board and ready to execute the projects under the leadership of Pol Guzman, who will serve as our Project Director. Pol has tremendous experience and a great track record of successfully delivering large projects around the globe and, in particular, in South America, where he successfully delivered the Escondida and Antamina projects on time and under budget.
On Slide 15, we provided an update on the Tanami Shaft project in Australia, which also received board approval on Wednesday. The shaft will increase Newmont's gold production from the Callie underground mine at Tanami to greater than 340,000 ounces per year in a sustainable, profitable and responsible manner. We expect it has the potential to increase the resource through reduced cutoff grades and improved access at depth. The shaft will also reduce our CAS by around $100 per ounce by increasing efficiency.
It will strategically position Newmont to potentially expand existing mine reserves through access to the ore and orebody and other exploration targets while leveraging off Newmont's existing position at the Tanami, including existing infrastructure and positive relationships with regulators and traditional owners. 
We're encouraged by Wednesday's board approval of the Conga and Tanami projects, and we hope to bring more projects to the development pipeline over the next several quarters. Richard?"

We have undergone several changes of not just precedence but political styles, from revolutionary through left- and right-leaning. And I think as we look into the future, this company -- this asset, based on reserves today, will be producing, I believe, 20 to 30 years Conga, not to mention Yanacocha, we believe will have a second life as we get into sulfide ores. And with all that, we expect that we will see political changes in Peru, just like we do everywhere else around the world. I would say specifically, with respect to the change of presidents in Peru, one, it's always, I think, good to note that in any country in the world, where changes happen in a democracy and things go without really any revolution or anything to go with that, Peru certainly qualifies for that. I think people in Peru pride the vote that they get, and they use it appropriately. I hope that President Humala will be a president who values the contribution of business in general and mining in particular. And at this point, I think given the ministerial staff that he has selected, I think he is looking for experienced individuals who will help guide the government of Peru in exactly the same direction that it's been driven. And I think what we could expect is to see some ongoing thoughts and discussions around how best to close the gap between rich and poor and better share some of the wealth of Peru. And I think we're all for that, done in the right way. And so far, what I would tell you is we expect, just as when President Garcia came to into office, that there will be some discussions about what we will do as mining companies on royalties. I don't expect that gold or Yanacocha and Conga will be picked on in particular. I think it will be industry-wide. And I think we have a pretty good sense of what that is, and we've incorporated that into our economics. I won't tell you what our assumption is, but we have made some assumptions. And what I'll tell you is going forward, John, we learned how to live around the world in changing political environments and will continue to do so."

I guess there's a few things going on in Nevada which are giving us some confidence for production in the second half. First, we're going to have significantly more roaster days coming into the second half of the year after the shutdown. We're also going to see some significantly higher-grade material getting delivered into the plants. With the Gold Quarry slide being remediated, we're going to be back into the higher-grade ore in the bottom of Gold Quarry for the second half of the year. We're also going to see higher grades coming out of Twin Creeks as we go deeper. The other 2 areas where we're also going to see production coming in higher -- I already did mention was with the startup of Pete Bajo and Exodus in Q2, we'll see those underground operations ramping up over the second half of the year. So we're probably going to see in the order of 25%, 30% increase in production coming out in Nevada over the second half of the year for roughly around the same global total cost. So not only are we going to see the ounces go up, which should bring us into the guidance range, but we're also going to see our CAS come down over the second half of the year as well."

In the second quarter, we continue to focus on delivering growth, generating profits and returning capital to shareholders. On April 6, we closed the Fronteer Gold acquisition and began our drilling program at Long Canyon, Nevada. We've now completed over 20,000 meters of drilling at Long Canyon, some encouraging initial intercepts identified earlier this month. At the same time, our discovery and development team remains focused on advancing several key projects in our growth plan as evidenced by Wednesday's announcement of full funds approval for our Conga and Tanami projects. As you may remember, we also announced full funds approval for our Akyem project in March. Collectively, those projects, Conga, Tanami, Akyem and Long Canyon will deliver over 1 million ounces of annual gold production when completed.
Meanwhile, our existing top rating teams continue to focus on execution and cost control, providing our shareholders with continuing margin expansion in a rising gold price environment. Our second quarter highlights included an average realized gold sales price of $15.01, allowing us to boost our dividend to $0.30 per share for the third quarter. This is a 100% increase over our third quarter 2010 dividend.
On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend yield is now an industry leading over 2%. This is higher also than the current S&P 500 average yield. We're also maintaining our outlook for production and cost attributable to sales and capital expenditures. And although capital spending through the first half of 2011 has been lower than expected across the portfolio, we do expect to accelerate capital spending in the second half of the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our second quarter results."
291795,133969185,148923,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.As Richard mentio",883,"Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.
As Richard mentioned, we're maintaining our full year 2011 outlook, and we're on track to meet our goal of 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces and attributable copper production of between 190 million and 220 million pounds. We're also maintaining our outlook for costs. Despite upward pressure from assumption changes we made in respect of the gold price, the Aussie dollar exchange rate and the oil price, which are key drivers of our costs. So we had a very good first half, maintaining cost pressures, and we think we're on line to deliver for the balance of the year.
Focusing on Q2 operating costs, we did see pressure from a weaker U.S. dollar and higher labor commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. As expected, our second quarter costs applicable to sales of gold are towards the higher end of our annual outlook due to a combination of scheduled roaster maintenance in Nevada, which required a shutdown of approximately 30 days, and processing of lower grades in Nevada as a function of mine sequencing and the final remediation of the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in December 2009.
Copper cost applicable to sales for the second quarter were higher than last year as expected due to higher waste stripping related to Phase 6 at Batu Hijau and an extended mill maintenance shutdown at Batu. In order to provide better comparability with our peers, last quarter, we also began reporting costs applicable to sales on an attributable and net attributable basis. Second quarter costs applicable to sales on a net attributable basis were just under $500 an ounce.
Slide 5 highlights some of the key financial metrics for the quarter. Revenue of $2.4 billion was 11% higher than the year-ago quarter, driven by higher realized gold and copper prices. In respect of earnings, we had another strong quarter, generating net income attributable to shareholders and continuing operations of $523 million or $1.06 a share, up from $382 million or $0.78 a share for the year-ago quarter.
During the quarter, we closed on the Fronteer acquisition and expensed transaction costs of approximately $20 million. In addition, during the quarter, we incurred a copper provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of approximately $16 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had 84 million pounds of copper provisioning priced at $4.22 a pound.
It is interesting to note that if you look at quarterly adjusted net income over the past 3 years, you will see that we have a distinct seasonality effect to our numbers, with the second quarter approximately 15% weaker than the other 3 quarters due to a combination of factors, some of which are covered above. And while we don't run the business on a quarterly basis, we will try to do a better job providing quarterly direction in respect to production since in the absence thereof, the quarterly expectations become the annual guidance divided by 4, which is not how the regions perform.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $414 million after an Indonesian tax payment of approximately $300 million for the 2010 year. Operating cash flow was also impacted by a timing issue related to concentrate shipments that occurred right before quarter-end, for which provisional payments are only received in early Q3.
For the first half of the year, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, and if current metal prices continue, I expect we will deliver very strong operating cash flow and earnings in the second half of the year.
Finally, bottom line earnings were negatively impacted by an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $136 million related to the finalization of litigation related to our royalty on the Holt mine, currently operated by St. Andrew Goldfields. The St. Andrew royalty and our obligation to pay the sliding scale royalty is a legacy of the former Newmont capital business that we divested at the end of 2007. We previously announced details of the expected charge for this quarter in an 8-K filing on July 15.
On Slide 6, you will see the significant gold margin expansion experienced over the past 10 quarters, with a 90% increase in margin on a 66% increase in gold price. It is this margin expansion on current attributable production in excess of 5 million ounces that enables us to fund a truly unique combination of aggressive internal growth, increased investment for the long term through exploration and the ability to return additional capital to shareholders.
Slide 7 provides evidence of our commitment to returning additional capital to shareholders, and you'll see a 200% increase in dividends over the past 6 quarters. On Wednesday this week, in line with our stated gold price-linked dividend policy, the board approved a $0.30 per share dividend payable for the third quarter, payable on September 29 to shareholders of record on September 28. As Richard mentioned, the yield of the current stock price is an excess of 2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our regional operating performance in a little more detail."

An overview of Q2 results by region can be found on Slide 8, with a view of performance versus the prior year quarter. Russell detailed the key production variances from the quarter in his remarks, and full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can be found in this morning's release or in our 10-Q. For the current discussion, I'd like to focus my remarks on relevant updates from each of our 4 operating regions.
Turning to Slide 9, our North American Q2 results were down slightly from last year's second quarter due to mine sequencing at Leeville and the temporary suspension of mining at Chukar, which was partially offset by the initiation of mining at Exodus. As you can see in the picture, in July, we completed remediation work at Gold Quarry, and we have recently recommenced mining ore from the pit. There is significant development activity underway throughout our Nevada operations, including Exodus, which is an underground refractory deposit that commenced commercial production in May and is expected to produce about 65,000 to 75,000 ounces per year for at least 5 years and provide a platform for further underground exploration.
Emigrant is the near-surface oxide leach deposit which is anticipated to be begin production in 2012 at about 80,000 ounces per year, while Pete Bajo, another underground refractory deposit which delivered its first ounces in July, is expected to produce 60,000 to 70,000 ounces in 2012 and will also provide underground exploration access between Pete and Carlin East.
At Twin Creeks, we are expecting regulatory approval to initiate mining of the Vista 7 layback later this year. Approximately 600,000 ounces in total are expected to be mined from this deposit over the next 4 to 5 years. 
At our Phoenix operation, we continue to see opportunities for increasing production. We are permitting and preparing to construct the copper leach project, which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year beginning in the second half of 2013, and we are studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase in-excess copper and gold production. 
At Long Canyon, drilling is focused on in-fill, mineralized extensions and district exploration, and our extension drilling program continues to highlight growth potential.
In Mexico, construction of the Noche Buena mine in La Herradura is progressing according to schedule. We are also supporting our partner as they consider developing a gold mill that will have a capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis.
Moving to Slide 10, South American production was up over the prior year due to the contribution of the new La Zanja mine in Peru, partially offset by lower leach placement at Yanacocha. On the development front, we have re-sequenced the mine plant at Yanacocha to deal with geotechnical and paleosol issues at La Quinua. And as previously announced this week, our board approved the Conga project, which Guy will speak to in more detail in a moment.
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 11, regional volumes and costs in the second quarter were impacted by the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, production was ahead of budget at 205,000 ounces of gold for the quarter, and optimization study is advancing. CAS was slightly higher than planned in Q2 related to a conveyor belt maintenance at Boddington. However, we are still on track to meet our guidance range of $580 to $620 per ounce. This region is making good progress in achieving its strategic planned goals and is moving forward with the Tanami Shaft project after this week's board approval.
In Indonesia,PTNNT signed a memorandum of understanding allowing resumption of exploration activity at Elang and at other locations in eastern Indonesia. At Elang, we are reestablishing the exploration camp in advance of initiating our drilling program later this year.
I'll wrap up the regional discussion on Slide 12 with Africa. While Richard mentioned future milestones to growth, I'd like to recognize the significant milestone in our African region. On July 18, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our first full gold core at Ahafo. In its short history, our Ahafo operations have become the base for the fastest-growing region in our portfolio. So far, Newmont Ghana gold has safely produced almost 2.5 million ounces, contributing significantly to the overall value of our company since 2006. In addition to job creation, many community development projects have come to the area due in part to Newmont's social investments, including programs dealing with malaria treatment and prevention, HIV/AIDS awareness and education and community infrastructure projects. Ahafo demonstrated another strong quarter of gold production growth due to higher grades and recoveries at the Apensu and Amoma pits. Recent development activities include a successful public hearing with respect to our Subika underground project, which paves the way for advancement towards issuance of the production permit, while construction is well underway at Akyem after our Board of Directors approved the project in March, 2011. Both of these projects are important contributors to our growth plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Guy Lansdown, who will speak to the recent board approvals for Conga and the Tanami Shaft."

Earlier this week, we announced that the Conga and Tanami Shaft projects received full funds approval from our board. Collectively, these projects are major steps towards achieving our goal of growing to 7 million ounces of gold production by 2017. I'd like to shed some additional light on those projects.
On Slide 14, you'll see a picture of the drilling activity at our Conga project in Peru. Conga's size and quality of its current reserves and NRM make it one of the premier gold and copper mining projects in the world. In addition, we have established relationships with the local communities and an experienced base of employees and stakeholders. Furthermore, Conga provides a bridge to the future of Yanacocha, allowing time for the potential development of the sulfidic and underground opportunities and continued exploration exposure on our 300,000-hectare land package. Conga will also provide a strategic advantage to develop potential surrounding opportunities with our construction of the first copper concentrator in the region. We're planning for near-term production of 300,000 to 350,000 ounces of gold and 80 million to 120 million pounds of copper per year at cash costs of $400 to $450 per ounce and $1.25 to $1.75 per pound. Capital spending attributable to Newmont is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. This is an increase of our previous guidance of $1.8 billion. The cost increases are as a result of scope developments, estimate refinement, as well as Forex and escalation.
We have a great team on board and ready to execute the projects under the leadership of Pol Guzman, who will serve as our Project Director. Pol has tremendous experience and a great track record of successfully delivering large projects around the globe and, in particular, in South America, where he successfully delivered the Escondida and Antamina projects on time and under budget.
On Slide 15, we provided an update on the Tanami Shaft project in Australia, which also received board approval on Wednesday. The shaft will increase Newmont's gold production from the Callie underground mine at Tanami to greater than 340,000 ounces per year in a sustainable, profitable and responsible manner. We expect it has the potential to increase the resource through reduced cutoff grades and improved access at depth. The shaft will also reduce our CAS by around $100 per ounce by increasing efficiency.
It will strategically position Newmont to potentially expand existing mine reserves through access to the ore and orebody and other exploration targets while leveraging off Newmont's existing position at the Tanami, including existing infrastructure and positive relationships with regulators and traditional owners. 
We're encouraged by Wednesday's board approval of the Conga and Tanami projects, and we hope to bring more projects through the development pipeline over the next several quarters. Richard?"

And with all that, we expect that we will see political changes in Peru, just like we do everywhere else around the world. I would say specifically, with respect to the change of presidents in Peru, one, it's always, I think, good to note that in any country in the world, where changes happen in a democracy and things go without really any revolution or anything to go with that, Peru certainly qualifies for that. I think people in Peru pride the vote that they get, and they use it appropriately. I hope that President Humala will be a president who values the contribution of business in general and mining in particular. And at this point, I think given the ministerial staff that he has selected, I think he is looking for experienced individuals who will help guide the government of Peru in exactly the same direction that it's been driven. And I think what we could expect is to see some ongoing thoughts and discussions around how best to close the gap between rich and poor and better share some of the wealth of Peru. And I think we're all for that, done in the right way. And so far, what I would tell you is we expect, just as when President Garcia came to into office, that there will be some discussions about what we will do as mining companies on royalties. I don't expect that gold or Yanacocha and Conga will be picked on in particular. I think it will be industry-wide. And I think we have a pretty good sense of what that is, and we've incorporated that into our economics. I won't tell you what our assumption is, but we have made some assumptions. And what I'll tell you is going forward, John, we learned how to live around the world in changing political environments and will continue to do so."

In the second quarter, we continue to focus on delivering growth, generating profits and returning capital to shareholders. On April 6, we closed the Fronteer Gold acquisition and began our drilling program at Long Canyon, Nevada. We've now completed over 20,000 meters of drilling at Long Canyon, some encouraging initial intercepts identified earlier this month. At the same time, our discovery and development team remains focused on advancing several key projects in our growth plan as evidenced by Wednesday's announcement of full funds approval for our Conga and Tanami projects. As you may remember, we also announced full funds approval for our Akyem project in March. Collectively, those projects, Conga, Tanami, Akyem and Long Canyon will deliver over 1 million ounces of annual gold production when completed.
Meanwhile, our existing top rating teams continue to focus on execution and cost control, providing our shareholders with continuing margin expansion in a rising gold price environment. Our second quarter highlights included an average realized gold sales price of $15.01, allowing us to boost our dividend to $0.30 per share for the third quarter. This is a 100% increase over our third quarter 2010 dividend.
On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend yield is now an industry leading over 2%. This is higher also than the current S&P 500 average yield. We're also maintaining our outlook for production and cost attributable to sales and capital expenditures. And although capital spending through the first half of 2011 has been lower than expected across the portfolio, we do expect to accelerate capital spending in the second half of the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our second quarter results."
291795,133969185,149170,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2011",2011-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.As Richard mentio",883,"Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio.
As Richard mentioned, we're maintaining our full year 2011 outlook, and we're on track to meet our goal of 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces and attributable copper production of between 190 million and 220 million pounds. We're also maintaining our outlook for costs. Despite upward pressure from assumption changes we made in respect of the gold price, the Aussie dollar exchange rate and the oil price, which are key drivers of our costs. So we had a very good first half, maintaining cost pressures, and we think we're on line to deliver for the balance of the year.
Focusing on Q2 operating costs, we did see pressure from a weaker U.S. dollar and higher labor commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. As expected, our second quarter costs applicable to sales of gold are towards the higher end of our annual outlook due to a combination of scheduled roaster maintenance in Nevada, which required a shutdown of approximately 30 days, and processing of lower grades in Nevada as a function of mine sequencing and the final remediation of the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in December 2009.
Copper cost applicable to sales for the second quarter were higher than last year as expected due to higher waste stripping related to Phase 6 at Batu Hijau and an extended mill maintenance shutdown at Batu. In order to provide better comparability with our peers, last quarter, we also began reporting costs applicable to sales on an attributable and net attributable basis. Second quarter costs applicable to sales on a net attributable basis were just under $500 an ounce.
Slide 5 highlights some of the key financial metrics for the quarter. Revenue of $2.4 billion was 11% higher than the year-ago quarter, driven by higher realized gold and copper prices. In respect of earnings, we had another strong quarter, generating net income attributable to shareholders and continuing operations of $523 million or $1.06 a share, up from $382 million or $0.78 a share for the year-ago quarter.
During the quarter, we closed on the Fronteer acquisition and expensed transaction costs of approximately $20 million. In addition, during the quarter, we incurred a copper provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of approximately $16 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had 84 million pounds of copper provisioning priced at $4.22 a pound.
It is interesting to note that if you look at quarterly adjusted net income over the past 3 years, you will see that we have a distinct seasonality effect to our numbers, with the second quarter approximately 15% weaker than the other 3 quarters due to a combination of factors, some of which are covered above. And while we don't run the business on a quarterly basis, we will try to do a better job providing quarterly direction in respect to production since in the absence thereof, the quarterly expectations become the annual guidance divided by 4, which is not how the regions perform.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $414 million after an Indonesian tax payment of approximately $300 million for the 2010 year. Operating cash flow was also impacted by a timing issue related to concentrate shipments that occurred right before quarter-end, for which provisional payments are only received in early Q3.
For the first half of the year, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, and if current metal prices continue, I expect we will deliver very strong operating cash flow and earnings in the second half of the year.
Finally, bottom line earnings were negatively impacted by an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $136 million related to the finalization of litigation related to our royalty on the Holt mine, currently operated by St. Andrew Goldfields. The St. Andrew royalty and our obligation to pay the sliding scale royalty is a legacy of the former Newmont capital business that we divested at the end of 2007. We previously announced details of the expected charge for this quarter in an 8-K filing on July 15.
On Slide 6, you will see the significant gold margin expansion experienced over the past 10 quarters, with a 90% increase in margin on a 66% increase in gold price. It is this margin expansion on current attributable production in excess of 5 million ounces that enables us to fund a truly unique combination of aggressive internal growth, increased investment for the long term through exploration and the ability to return additional capital to shareholders.
Slide 7 provides evidence of our commitment to returning additional capital to shareholders, and you'll see a 200% increase in dividends over the past 6 quarters. On Wednesday this week, in line with our stated gold price-linked dividend policy, the board approved a $0.30 per share dividend payable for the third quarter, payable on September 29 to shareholders of record on September 28. As Richard mentioned, the yield of the current stock price is an excess of 2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our regional operating performance in a little more detail."

An overview of Q2 results by region can be found on Slide 8, with a view of performance versus the prior year quarter. Russell detailed the key production variances from the quarter in his remarks, and full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can be found in this morning's release or in our 10-Q. For the current discussion, I'd like to focus my remarks on relevant updates from each of our 4 operating regions.
Turning to Slide 9, our North American Q2 results were down slightly from last year's second quarter due to mine sequencing at Leeville and the temporary suspension of mining at Chukar, which was partially offset by the initiation of mining at Exodus. As you can see in the picture, in July, we completed remediation work at Gold Quarry, and we have recently recommenced mining ore from the pit. There is significant development activity underway throughout our Nevada operations, including Exodus, which is an underground refractory deposit that commenced commercial production in May and is expected to produce about 65,000 to 75,000 ounces per year for at least 5 years and provide a platform for further underground exploration.
Emigrant is the near-surface oxide leach deposit which is anticipated to be begin production in 2012 at about 80,000 ounces per year, while Pete Bajo, another underground refractory deposit which delivered its first ounces in July, is expected to produce 60,000 to 70,000 ounces in 2012 and will also provide underground exploration access between Pete and Carlin East.
At Twin Creeks, we are expecting regulatory approval to initiate mining of the Vista 7 layback later this year. Approximately 600,000 ounces in total are expected to be mined from this deposit over the next 4 to 5 years. 
At our Phoenix operation, we continue to see opportunities for increasing production. We are permitting and preparing to construct the copper leach project, which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year beginning in the second half of 2013, and we are studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase in-excess copper and gold production. 
At Long Canyon, drilling is focused on in-fill, mineralized extensions and district exploration, and our extension drilling program continues to highlight growth potential.
In Mexico, construction of the Noche Buena mine in La Herradura is progressing according to schedule. We are also supporting our partner as they consider developing a gold mill that will have a capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis.
Moving to Slide 10, South American production was up over the prior year due to the contribution of the new La Zanja mine in Peru, partially offset by lower leach placement at Yanacocha. On the development front, we have re-sequenced the mine plant at Yanacocha to deal with geotechnical and paleosol issues at La Quinua. And as previously announced this week, our board approved the Conga project, which Guy will speak to in more detail in a moment.
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 11, regional volumes and costs in the second quarter were impacted by the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, production was ahead of budget at 205,000 ounces of gold for the quarter, and optimization study is advancing. CAS was slightly higher than planned in Q2 related to a conveyor belt maintenance at Boddington. However, we are still on track to meet our guidance range of $580 to $620 per ounce. This region is making good progress in achieving its strategic planned goals and is moving forward with the Tanami Shaft project after this week's board approval.
In Indonesia,PTNNT signed a memorandum of understanding allowing resumption of exploration activity at Elang and at other locations in eastern Indonesia. At Elang, we are reestablishing the exploration camp in advance of initiating our drilling program later this year.
I'll wrap up the regional discussion on Slide 12 with Africa. While Richard mentioned future milestones to growth, I'd like to recognize the significant milestone in our African region. On July 18, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our first full gold core at Ahafo. In its short history, our Ahafo operations have become the base for the fastest-growing region in our portfolio. So far, Newmont Ghana gold has safely produced almost 2.5 million ounces, contributing significantly to the overall value of our company since 2006. In addition to job creation, many community development projects have come to the area due in part to Newmont's social investments, including programs dealing with malaria treatment and prevention, HIV/AIDS awareness and education and community infrastructure projects. Ahafo demonstrated another strong quarter of gold production growth due to higher grades and recoveries at the Apensu and Amoma pits. Recent development activities include a successful public hearing with respect to our Subika underground project, which paves the way for advancement towards issuance of the production permit, while construction is well underway at Akyem after our Board of Directors approved the project in March, 2011. Both of these projects are important contributors to our growth plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Guy Lansdown, who will speak to the recent board approvals for Conga and the Tanami Shaft."

Earlier this week, we announced that the Conga and Tanami Shaft projects received full funds approval from our board. Collectively, these projects are major steps towards achieving our goal of growing to 7 million ounces of gold production by 2017. I'd like to shed some additional light on those projects.
On Slide 14, you'll see a picture of the drilling activity at our Conga project in Peru. Conga's size and quality of its current reserves and NRM make it one of the premier gold and copper mining projects in the world. In addition, we have established relationships with the local communities and an experienced base of employees and stakeholders. Furthermore, Conga provides a bridge to the future of Yanacocha, allowing time for the potential development of the sulfidic and underground opportunities and continued exploration exposure on our 300,000-hectare land package. Conga will also provide a strategic advantage to develop potential surrounding opportunities with our construction of the first copper concentrator in the region. We're planning for near-term production of 300,000 to 350,000 ounces of gold and 80 million to 120 million pounds of copper per year at cash costs of $400 to $450 per ounce and $1.25 to $1.75 per pound. Capital spending attributable to Newmont is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. This is an increase of our previous guidance of $1.8 billion. The cost increases are as a result of scope developments, estimate refinement, as well as Forex and escalation.
We have a great team on board and ready to execute the projects under the leadership of Pol Guzman, who will serve as our Project Director. Pol has tremendous experience and a great track record of successfully delivering large projects around the globe and, in particular, in South America, where he successfully delivered the Escondida and Antamina projects on time and under budget.
On Slide 15, we provided an update on the Tanami Shaft project in Australia, which also received board approval on Wednesday. The shaft will increase Newmont's gold production from the Callie underground mine at Tanami to greater than 340,000 ounces per year in a sustainable, profitable and responsible manner. We expect it has the potential to increase the resource through reduced cutoff grades and improved access at depth. The shaft will also reduce our CAS by around $100 per ounce by increasing efficiency.
It will strategically position Newmont to potentially expand existing mine reserves through access to the ore and orebody and other exploration targets while leveraging off Newmont's existing position at the Tanami, including existing infrastructure and positive relationships with regulators and traditional owners. 
We're encouraged by Wednesday's board approval of the Conga and Tanami projects, and we hope to bring more projects through the development pipeline over the next several quarters. Richard?"

I would just say that this is a company which has been in Peru for a very long period of time. We have undergone several changes of not just presidents but political styles, from revolutionary through left- and right-leaning. And I think as we look into the future, this company -- this asset, based on reserves today, will be producing, I believe, 20 to 30 years Conga, not to mention Yanacocha, we believe will have a second life as we get into sulfide ores. And with all that, we expect that we will see political changes in Peru, just like we do everywhere else around the world. I would say specifically, with respect to the change of presidents in Peru, one, it's always, I think, good to note that in any country in the world, where changes happen in a democracy and things go without really any revolution or anything to go with that, Peru certainly qualifies for that. I think people in Peru pride the vote that they get, and they use it appropriately. I hope that President Humala will be a president who values the contribution of business in general and mining in particular. And at this point, I think given the ministerial staff that he has selected, I think he is looking for experienced individuals who will help guide the government of Peru in exactly the same direction that it's been driven. And I think what we could expect is to see some ongoing thoughts and discussions around how best to close the gap between rich and poor and better share some of the wealth of Peru. And I think we're all for that, done in the right way. And so far, what I would tell you is we expect, just as when President Garcia came to into office, that there will be some discussions about what we will do as mining companies on royalties. I don't expect that gold or Yanacocha and Conga will be picked on in particular. I think it will be industry-wide. And I think we have a pretty good sense of what that is, and we've incorporated that into our economics. I won't tell you what our assumption is, but we have made some assumptions. And what I'll tell you is going forward, John, we learned how to live around the world in changing political environments and will continue to do so."

Across our wider project pipeline, we have advanced approximately 20 earlier stage development assets through our project pipeline in each of our 4 operating regions thus far in 2011. Our investment grade balance sheet continues to strengthen as we delivered our 11th straight quarter of increase in gross margin, while generating quarterly records of revenue at $2.7 billion, operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and net income of $635 million adjusted. We also ended the quarter with over $3 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also continued to explore one of the most extensive land positions in the gold industry. Across our exploration portfolio, we are currently operating 100 drill rigs around the globe in over 40 locations in Greenfields and Brownfields projects, as well as surface and underground opportunities. And as we announced on Wednesday, we increased our dividend again for the sixth straight quarter to $0.35 per share based on our average realized gold sales.
[Audio Gap]
Our outlook for production operating costs and capital expenditures as described further in our press release. 
As illustrated on Slide 4, I'm pleased to be able to talk to you this morning about another strong quarter of operating and financial results. Clearly, we benefited from a 39% increase in the gold price, realizing $16.95 an ounce which was $7 or approximately 0.4% lower than the average of the daily fixed. This is due to the timing of the rate sales, concentrated shipments and mark-to-market adjustments at quarter-end in what was a very volatile quarter. Details of the realized gold price calculation for the quarter and year-to-date are included in our 10-Q on Page 49. 
Net income from continuing operations of $493 million is impacted by a noncash impairment charge of approximately $152 million on an after-tax basis. And this is related to marketable securities of Taliban Energy Limited, a uranium producer, and Pilot Gold, both acquired on April 6, 2011, as part of the acquisition of Fronteer. These charges were offset by a $10 million after-tax gain realized on the sale of a minority position in Lithium resources. The net noncash impairment of $142 million equates to $0.29 a share on an after-tax basis and results in adjusted net income for the quarter of $1.29 a share. Net income for the quarter was also adversely impacted by an effective tax rate of 36% due to some timing issues and a valuation allowance on certain capital losses. In comparison with the quarter, the effective tax rate for the first 9 months of the year was 30% and our estimated effective tax rate for the year remains somewhere around 30%. The standout number for the quarter was the continued strong operating cash flow generation of almost $1.3 billion, a 48% increase from the year-ago quarter. The portfolio continues to deliver on what we considered to be the most important determinant of long-term value, operating cash flow per share. 
Moving to Slide 5. Gold production was down by about 7% from a year ago due to the transition from Phase 5 ore production to largely phased 6 way stripping within Zoll in Indonesia, and lower grades and mill throughput in Nevada. Cost applicable to sales of $6.22 an ounce was up 32%. This the prior year quarter due to a combination of lower production, higher input costs and a higher coproduct allocation of operating costs to gold from copper as the result of the relative outperformance of gold in the quarter. The gold accounting issue is of course just a geography issue, and on the income statement and has no bottom line impact. Gold CAS on the net attributable basis was $5.56 an ounce, again up significantly as a function of lower copper production from and a lower realized copper price. The realized copper price for the quarter of 294 a pound was 20% lower than the year ago quarter, affecting both the weakest spot market during the quarter and a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss for the quarter of $74 million or $0.80 a pound. At the end of the third quarter, we had 102 million pounds of copper, provisioning priced at $3.24 a pound. 
Slide 6 provides a little more detail on the increase in our cost applicable to sales. Increased operating costs, including unscheduled maintenance, higher labor and contracted services costs increased CAS by about $45 an ounce. Lower production at all of our assets, including Batu Hijau, at least on a portfolio basis, increased CAS by $36 an ounce. Lower production at Batu Hijau and the co-product accounting issues discussed earlier increased gold CAS by about $27 an ounce. The balance in fact, of the chart are largely self-explanatory with a stronger Aussie dollar, a higher gold price, higher fuel costs and lower by product, copper and silver revenues collectively adding $45 an ounce. However, the strong  fourth quarter expected particularly for a better operations as and gold had significant ounces compared to the third quarter. As such, our 2011 outlook for CAS remains unchanged at between $5.60 and $5.90 an ounce although likely to be towards the upper end of the range. Remember that these numbers are calculated under U.S. GAAP, which is generally has between $20 and $50 an ounce to somewhat cost calculated under IFRS. 
On Slide 7, you'll see how are gold margins have expanded over time versus the gold price, as our disciplined focus on execution has yielded consistent margin growth despite industrywide cost pressures. Based on the current spot prices and assuming the top end of our CAS outlook for 2011, we expect our gold margin for the year to be in excess of $1100 or approximately 65%, a healthy margin by any measure. 
Turning to Slide 8 and our gold price link dividend policy. I wanted to take just a couple of minutes to explain the mechanics of the policy we originally announced in April, and then subsequently enhanced in September. Firstly, the amounts on the slide reflect annual dividend estimates since we pay a quarterly dividend divide the annual amounts by 4 to get the quarterly equivalent. The amount of the quarterly dividend payable is determined by the trailing quarters realized gold price which can be found in our Form 10-Q and 10-K filings as discussed earlier. The dividend payable in December announced earlier this week of $0.35 a share reflects the realized gold price of $16.95 an ounce for the third quarter. Based on a $65 share price, this result in an effective annual yield of approximately 2.1% or approximately double that of our peers. The gold price is between $1100 and $16.99 an ounce. Dividend increases or decreases by $0.20 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. Gold price is between $1700 and $19.99 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.30 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. And then gold prices between $2025 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.40 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. The results of this formula is that our shareholders will see an increasing share of incremental operating cash flows as the gold price increases. We are able to share these incremental cash flows based on the fact that we have the highest leverage to gold prices through the highest gold production per share outstanding. This allows us to pay the highest dividend per share while still investing organically to grow the business at the top line level. We have inconsistent in our belief that at the end the day, per share metrics has to matter. I believe this commitment to retaining capital to our shareholders, distinguishes us from our peers and the gold ETF in particular, and provides a compelling investment thesis this year in the current interest rate environment. With that, I'll turn the call back to Richard."

And full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can also be found in the release or in our 10-Q. So rather than restate what's already been written, I'll discuss some relevant updates from our operations, and then we can devote a bit more time to your specific questions. 
We recently announced some organizational changes which will further strengthen Newmont's leadership team. Mary Goldberg will join Newmont on December 5 as our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And Brian Hill will be taking on a new leadership role as our Executive Vice President for Sustainability and External Affairs. Barry joins us from Rio Tinto where he spent approximately 30 years and he will be responsible for our worldwide operations, business excellence, help safety and loss prevention, and security. Since joining Newmont, Brian has been instrumental in leading strong and consistent performance from our operating portfolio. And in addition, has built a world-class operations leadership team and has assisted invisibly leading Newmont's culture shift. In his new role, Brian will help Newmont stay at the forefront of sustainability and stakeholder alignment on a global basis. We believe that bringing ESR and Government Relations under the same leadership will enhance Newmont's effectiveness in each of these disciplines at a time when our industry is facing growing challenges to access and government approvals. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our North American Q3 results were down from last year's third quarter due to lower than expected grades, as well as mine sequencing changes. At Levo, we had a slight movement in our ventilation/backfill shaft, which impacted planned stoke sequencing. The shift is being repaired, the shaft is being repaired and we are utilizing a secondary backfill delivery system in order to safely maintain our Q4 production level and into 2012. Since completing our remediation work at Gold Quarry this quarter, the pit has been resequenced and we are encountering higher grade mill feed which should continue throughout Q4. We've also successfully ramped up the Exodus mine and expect to continue to produce at targeted tonnage us. Slightly lower grades are reflected in the revised outlook and we are ahead of schedule with the development of Pete Bajo underground mine as we are producing amortization at higher grades than anticipated. And while as Russell stated, we are expecting a strong fourth quarter in Nevada, I can tell you that those plants showing that strength do not put out risk our performance in 2012. The team in Nevada feels confident in its capabilities to deliver this quarter and continuing into 2012 and beyond. In Mexico at La Herradura, quarterly and year-to-date attributable production reached record levels due to increased ore placements at La Herradura and higher ore grade at Soledad and Dipolos. Construction of the Noche Buena mine remains on schedule for completion in the first half of 2012. We are also supporting our partner as they embark on the construction of a gold mill that will have capacity of 8000 tons per day and could result in an ad average gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis. 
Moving to Slide 11. As you've probably read, recent roadblock activity has intermittently affected access to our Yanacocha mine and the Conga and Western oxides projects this month. Mining operations in the pits were temporarily suspended but are now back to full operation. We continued to engage with central and regional government and  community leaders who to understand and address concerns of our stakeholders in that region. Our team in Peru continues to do a very commendable job of working with local authorities for the safety of our people and the public. 
Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 12. Regional volumes and costs in the third quarter were impacted, as Russell said, by the planned Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, work continues on optimizing the dry plant conveyor circuit to improve availability. Also at Boddington CAS increased by $102 per ounce, driven mainly by lower tons mined at lower grade, 7 days of unscheduled downtime, mostly related to the conveyor issues, higher coproduct allocation of cost to gold, higher operating costs, and other gold related costs such as royalties, partially offset by a favorable a dollar exchange rate variance net of hedges. Meanwhile at, we've increased the exploration programs to expand mineralization and we are adding mineral inventory in new areas, reporting an extended my life. 
I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 13 with Africa. Ahafo's production was down slightly versus the prior year quarter due to lower mill grade, which impacted CAS, as well as higher label labor, diesel and royalty costs. In Q3, we successfully completed our Occoquan, this is Ghana's actual EPA review and Ahafo achieved a blue rating for 2010 performance, 1 of only 2 mines in Ghana to receive that high rating. The Ghana region continues to be our highest growth portfolio region in our portfolio and we continued to see numerous opportunities around the Ahafo mine for expansion. 
Concluding on Slide 14, as I noted earlier, we continue to make good progress in advancing our strategic growth plans in each of our 4 regions. And I'd like to close today's call by noting some of the key milestones we've achieved across our development portfolio. At, since full funding approval in March 2011, the project has continued to advance with confirmation of the main civil and mechanical construction contracts. The management of both bulk earthworks and civil activities, first structural concrete pour and the establishment of the first set of resettlement villages. At Conga, following the full funding approval, the project has continued to progress: infrastructure works, earth works construction, drilling, detailed engineering, procurement of materials and equipment, and securing remaining permits for construction. At mine, following full funding approval in July, the development efforts have progressed according to plans. The pilot old for the shaft has been completed and the contractor is mobilized. The project will support underground expansion at the County and Oran Auron ore bodies, reduce cut offgrade, enhance productivity and facilitate additional mine expansion. The project is expected to add average annual attributable gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces during the first 5 years of production, while also lowering costs applicable to sales for the first 5 years at approximately $100 per ounce. And at Long Canyon in Nevada, drilling is focusing on infield, mineralized extensions and district exploration. Extension drilling continues to highlight growth potential. We have advanced our studies and are on track to submit our plan of operations to begin the permitting process in the first half of 2012. Also in Nevada, we continued to work on several projects, including Pete Bajo which achieved commercial production last month and is performing above our expectations with better grade and higher tonnage. At our emigrant project which is on schedule and on budget, we expect to start mining in the second quarter of 2012 with the first ounces expected to come up the leach pads later next year. At Twin Creeks, we received the regulatory approval to commence mining at Vista 7 and we initiated stripping. At our Phoenix operation, we are preparing to construct the copper leach project which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year, beginning in the second half of 2013, which should reduce our CAS in Nevada. We are also studying options for a second mill which would substantially increase Phoenix copper and gold production. Meanwhile, in addition to the projects receiving full funding decisions in 2011, as I've just described, we are continuing to evaluate longer-term opportunities within the portfolio, which is the Sleeping Giants, élan, Hope Bay, Sara Keely and others. We will keep you up to date on our key decisions and milestones on each of these opportunities as we reach and push through them. 
Finally, as I've said recently, our company is well-positioned, with the right teams in place, a robust portfolio of development projects, the financial strength and flexibility to fund growth, internal growth, and generate economic returns for our shareholders. And as Russ described, we believe we have an industry-leading and unique dividend linked to the gold price. So taken in combination, and as you can see in the record earnings and margins that we continued to earn in this business, we believe that we offer both gold and generalist investors one of the most compelling investment opportunities available, particularly in the current economic environment where world instability and currency continues to build what we believe is a very attractive market for the gold price. So that I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

And how does that arise? The permit that we received in support with 3000 plus members from the community involved a lot of one-on-one engagement of our team in Peru with all of the regional authorities, as well as on the people who live in the region. And as a consequence of that, you've got a big push and support and no one showed up at that initial permitting hearing in anything other than a supportive position. So we started from a very great position. And I think what's happening now, John, is probably as we should expect over the next year or 2 as we continue in construction, we will see this intermittently from time to time as people, I believe, first, we recognize that we have a lot of people out in the field now actually beginning construction rather than just talking about it. Second, I think they are interested in making sure that their land and water are taking care of and that is something we are absolutely committed to. And third, we, as you know, we can't every offer everybody a job in the community but we are really trying to involve the local contractors and their employees in participating in what we're doing in the region so that they, too, share in the economics. And I think it's that balance that we will have to continue to explain to people that we are both up for the environmental and social challenges and we want to meet those in ways which are responsive to the community. We are also up for making sure that we provide a long-term basis upon which we can operate in the region, which means we're just going to have to continue to engage with the regional authorities, people who live in the region. And even as we're seeing here people from outside the region who are using this as a platform, for whatever ill they see in either the country or Peru or related to mining."

And as Richard said, and Russell said, we are having challenges on the drive plants, but we have a team that is getting on top of this. We've got a project in place to upgrade those conveyors as we speak. And in Addition, we are looking at some de-bottleneck and projects to further de-bottleneck the tri- plant because that's where our bottleneck is, our opportunity to increase production is in the drive plans where plant is operating much better than performance. So I would expect that once we get mining rates up to where they plan to be, our grade will come along with it."

And when he was elected, shortly after he came into office, he called the mining companies just as he said he would. He engaged in discussions with them and I think in a relatively short period of time, mining companies working together and together with the government came up, I think, with something which will be implemented here shortly. I think something that works for the country, works for us, it recognizes that mining is an important and integral part of the economy in Peru. And I think as a result of that, we feel like we were included in the discussion. He gave us a heads-up on what he was going to do and then it got down to the specifics and we got through it. As we get in the into Conga, I think that is more of a regional issue than a central government issue. But I would say, again, between ourselves and Buenaventura, I think working closely with central and regional governments because the central government obviously helps to set the pace for the country, and I think can influence the regions in the right way. And I think when we are sitting down with them in the last couple of weeks, we see the kind of support that we would hope for in the kind of leadership that we would hope for. So what I would say is, so far experience has been very good. We continue to hope that if we engage, they will support and engage back. And so far, that seems to be the case. I think as we get down into the regions and, in particular, what I think of them do micro regions of various mayoral district around Conga, that is really an individual to individual kind of approach and I think those are more complicated because each of those has their own kinds of outcomes that they're looking for, their own set of priorities and those are not necessarily set with or in conjunction with the central government. So it's kind of piece by piece which is why if you ever go out our Conga site, you see we have a fairly big environmental and community responsibility team. That team is out engaged with the community to make sure we do know where the issues are and I think even in this spirit over the last month, we knew there was activity coming. We're pretty well plugged in what we're trying to do is respond to those things and let people know that we will listen and that they don't need to stand in the road to protest because that's what leads to people either being in an area where there might get hurt, luckily that's not happen. But we do have lots of equipment and people out there and we're just going to ensure that we do everything possible to keep the community, our contractors in our employees safe, while we continue to build the project."

In the third quarter, we continued to advance our strategic growth plans. We achieved several key project milestones, including initiation of earthworks at Conga in Peru and our first concrete pour at Akyem in Ghana. 
Across our wider project pipeline, we have advanced approximately 20 earlier-stage development assets through our project pipeline in each of our 4 operating regions thus far in 2011. Our investment-grade balance sheet continues to strengthen as we delivered our 11th straight quarter of increase in gross margin, while generating quarterly records of revenue at $2.7 billion, operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and net income of $635 million adjusted. We also ended the quarter with over $3 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also continued to explore one of the most extensive land positions in the gold industry. Across our exploration portfolio, we are currently operating 100 drill rigs around the globe in over 40 locations, spanning greenfields and brownfields projects, as well as surface and underground opportunities. 
And as we announced on Wednesday, we increased our dividend again for the sixth straight quarter to $0.35 per share based on our average realized gold sales price for the third quarter of $1,695. This is a 133% increase over the year-ago quarter. On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend stands at a yield of over 2%, which is higher than the current S&P 500 average yield and certainly the highest in the gold industry.
And finally, thanks to the continued focus of our employees on disciplined execution, we are maintaining our outlook for production, operating costs and capital expenditures, as described further in our press release. Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, to discuss our third quarter results."

As illustrated on Slide 4, I'm pleased to be able to talk to you this morning about another strong quarter of operating and financial results. Clearly, we benefited from a 39% increase in the gold price, realizing $1,695 an ounce, which was $7 or approximately 0.4% lower than the average of the daily fix. This was due to the timing of doré sales, concentrated shipments and mark-to-market adjustments at quarter end in what was a very volatile quarter. Details of the realized gold price calculation for the quarter and year-to-date are included in our 10-Q on Page 49. 
Net income from continuing operations of $493 million was impacted by a noncash impairment charge of approximately $152 million on an after-tax basis. And this is related to marketable securities of Paladin Energy Limited, a uranium producer, and Pilot Gold, both acquired on April 6, 2011, as part of the acquisition of Fronteer. These charges were offset by a $10 million after-tax gain realized on the sale of a minority position in Lydian Resources. The net noncash impairment of $142 million equates to $0.29 a share on an after-tax basis and results in adjusted net income for the quarter of $1.29 a share. 
Net income for the quarter was also adversely impacted by an effective tax rate of 36% due to some timing issues and a valuation allowance on certain capital losses. In comparison with the quarter, the effective tax rate for the first 9 months of the year was 30% and our estimated effective tax rate for the year remains somewhere around 30%. The standout number for the quarter was a continued strong operating cash flow generation of almost $1.3 billion, a 48% increase from the year-ago quarter. The portfolio continues to deliver on what we consider to be the most important determinant of long-term value, operating cash flow per share. 
Moving to Slide 5. Gold production was down by about 7% from a year ago due to the transition from Phase 5 ore production to largely Phase 6 waste stripping at Batu Hijau in Indonesia and lower grades in mill throughput in Nevada. Gold cost applicable to sales of $622 an ounce was up 32% versus the prior year quarter due to a combination of lower production, higher input costs and a higher coproduct allocation of operating cost to gold from copper as a result of the relative outperformance of gold in the quarter. The coproduct accounting issue is, of course, just a geography issue on the income statement and has no bottom line impact. 
Gold CAS on a net attributable basis was $556 an ounce, again up significantly as a function of lower copper production from Batu Hijau and a lower realized copper price. The realized copper price for the quarter of $2.94 a pound was 20% lower than the year-ago quarter, reflecting both the weaker spot market during the quarter and a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss for the quarter of $74 million or $0.80 a pound. At the end of the third quarter, we had 102 million pounds of copper, provisionally priced at $3.24 a pound. 
Slide 6 provides a little more detail on the increase in our cost applicable to sales. Increased operating costs, including unscheduled maintenance, higher labor and contracted services costs increased CAS by about $45 an ounce. Lower production at all of our assets, excluding Batu Hijau, at least on a portfolio basis, increased CAS by $36 an ounce. Lower production at Batu Hijau and the coproduct accounting issue discussed earlier increased gold CAS by about $27 an ounce. The balances of the factors on the chart are largely self-explanatory, with a stronger Aussie dollar, a higher gold price, higher fuel costs and lower byproduct, copper and silver revenues collectively adding $45 an ounce. However, with a strong fourth quarter expected, particularly for our Nevada operations as Pete Bajo, Exodus, Chukar and Gold Quarry add significant ounces compared to the third quarter. As such, our 2011 outlook for CAS remains unchanged at between $560 and $590 an ounce, although likely to be towards the upper end of the range. Remember that these numbers are calculated under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar cost calculated under IFRS. 
On Slide 7, you'll see how are gold margins have expanded over time versus the gold price, as our disciplined focus on execution has yielded consistent margin growth despite industry-wide cost pressures. Based on current spot prices and assuming the top end of our CAS outlook for 2011, we expect our gold margin for the year to be in excess of $1,100 or approximately 65%, a healthy margin by any measure. 
Turning to Slide 8 and our gold price-linked dividend policy. I wanted to take just a couple of minutes to explain the mechanics of the policy we originally announced in April, and then subsequently enhanced in September. Firstly, the amounts on the slide reflect annual dividend estimates. And since we pay a quarterly dividend, we need to divide the annual amounts by 4 to get the quarterly equivalent. The amount of the quarterly dividend payable is determined by the trailing quarters realized gold price, which can be found in our Form 10-Q and 10-K filings as discussed earlier. 
The dividend payable in December announced earlier this week of $0.35 a share reflects the realized gold price of $1,695 an ounce for the third quarter. Based on a $65 share price, this results in an effective annual yield of approximately 2.1% or approximately double that of our peers. At gold prices between $1,100 and $1,699 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.20 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. At Gold price is between $1,700 and $1,999 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.30 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. And then at gold prices between $2,000 and $2,599 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.40 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. 
The result of this formula is that our shareholders will see an increasing share of incremental operating cash flows as the gold price increases. We are able to share these incremental cash flows based on the fact that we have the highest leverage to gold prices through the highest gold production per share outstanding. This allows us to pay the highest dividend per share while still investing organically to grow the business at the top line level. 
We have been consistent in our belief that at the end of the day, per share metrics has to matter. I believe this commitment to returning capital to our shareholders distinguishes us from our peers and the gold ETF in particular, and provides a compelling investment thesis, especially in the current interest rate environment. With that, I'll turn the call back to Richard."

An overview of our attributable Q3 results by region can be found on Slide 9, with the view of performance versus the prior year quarter. Russell has already discussed the key production and cost variances from Q3. And full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can also be found in the release or in our 10-Q. So rather than restate what's already been written, I'll discuss some relevant updates from our operations, and then we can devote a bit more time to your specific questions. 
We recently announced some organizational changes, which will further strengthen Newmont's leadership team. Gary Goldberg will join Newmont on December 5 as our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And Brian Hill will be taking on a new leadership role as our Executive Vice President for Sustainability and External Affairs. Gary joins us from Rio Tinto, where he spent approximately 30 years, and he will be responsible for our worldwide operations, business excellence, health, safety and loss prevention and security. Since joining Newmont, Brian has been instrumental in leading strong and consistent performance from our operating portfolio, and in addition, has built a world-class operations leadership team and has assisted invisibly leading Newmont's culture shift. In his new role, Brian will help Newmont stay at the forefront of sustainability and stakeholder alignment on a global basis. We believe that bringing ESR and Government Relations under the same leadership will enhance Newmont's effectiveness in each of these disciplines at a time when our industry is facing growing challenges to access and government approvals. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our North American Q3 results were down from last year's third quarter due to lower than expected grades, as well as mine sequencing changes. At Leeville, we had a slight movement in our ventilation/backfill shaft, which impacted planned stope sequencing. The shift is being repaired -- the shaft is being repaired and we are utilizing a secondary backfill delivery system in order to safely maintain our Q4 production level and into 2012. Since completing our remediation work at Gold Quarry this quarter, the pit has been resequenced and we are encountering higher grade mill feed, which should continue throughout Q4. We have also successfully ramped up the Exodus mine and expect to continue to produce at targeted tonnages. Slightly lower grades are reflected in the revised outlook, and we are ahead of schedule with the development of a Pete Bajo underground mine, as we are producing more tons at higher grades than anticipated. 
And while as Russell stated, we're expecting a strong fourth quarter in Nevada, I can tell you that those plans showing that strength do not put at risk our performance in 2012. The team in Nevada feels confident in its capabilities to deliver this quarter and continuing into 2012 and beyond. In Mexico at La Herradura, quarterly and year-to-date attributable production reached record levels due to increased ore placements at La Herradura and higher ore grade at Soledad and Dipolos. Construction of the Noche Buena mine remains on schedule for completion in the first half of 2012. We are also supporting our partner as they embark on the construction of a gold mill that will have capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis. 
Moving to Slide 11. As you've probably read, recent roadblock activity has intermittently affected access to our Yanacocha mine and the Conga and Western Oxides projects this month. Mining operations in the pits were temporarily suspended but are now back to full operation. We continue to engage with central and regional government and  community leaders to understand and address the concerns of our stakeholders in that region. Our team in Peru continues to do a very commendable job of working with local authorities for the safety of our people and the public. 
Turning to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 12. Regional volumes and costs in the third quarter were impacted, as Russell said, by the planned Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, work continues on optimizing the dry plant conveyor circuit to improve availability. Also at Boddington, CAS increased by $102 per ounce, driven mainly by lower tons mined at lower grade, 7 days of unscheduled downtime, mostly related to the conveyor issues, higher coproduct allocation of cost to gold, higher operating costs, and other gold-related costs such as royalties, partially offset by a favorable A dollar exchange rate variance net of hedges. Meanwhile at Jundee, we've increased exploration programs to expand mineralization and we are adding mineral inventory in new areas, reporting an extended mine life. 
I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 13 with Africa. Ahafo's production was down slightly versus the prior year quarter due to lower mill grade, which impacted CAS, as well as higher labor, diesel and royalty costs. In Q3, we successfully completed our AKOBEN audit. This is Ghana's annual EPA review, and Ahafo achieved a blue rating for 2010 performance, 1 of only 2 mines in Ghana to receive that high rating. The Ghana region continues to be our highest growth portfolio region in our portfolio, and we continue to see numerous opportunities around the Ahafo mine for expansion. 
Concluding on Slide 14. As I noted earlier, we continue to make good progress in advancing our strategic growth plans in each of our 4 regions. And I'd like to close today's call by noting some of the key milestones we've achieved across our development portfolio. At Akyem, since full funding approval in March 2011, the project has continued to advance with confirmation of the main civil and mechanical construction contracts, commencement of bulk earthworks and civil activities, the first structural concrete pour and the establishment of the first set of resettlement villages. 
At Conga, following the full funding approval, the project has continued to progress: infrastructure works, earthworks construction, drilling, detailed engineering, procurement of materials and equipment and securing remaining permits for construction. At Tanami, following full funding approval in July, the development efforts have progressed according to plans. The pilot hole for the shaft has been completed and the contractor is mobilized. The project will support underground expansion at the Callie and Auron ore bodies, reduce cutoff grade, enhance productivity and facilitate additional mine expansion. The project is expected to add average annual attributable gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces during the first 5 years of production, while also lowering costs applicable to sales for the first 5 years by approximately $100 per ounce. 
And at Long Canyon in Nevada, drilling is focusing on infill, mineralized extensions and district exploration. Extension drilling continues to highlight growth potential. We have advanced our studies and are on track to submit our plan of operations to begin the permitting process in the first half of 2012. Also in Nevada, we continue to work on several projects, including Pete Bajo, which achieved commercial production last month and is performing above our expectations with better grade and higher tonnage. At our Emigrant project, which is on schedule and on budget, we expect to start mining in the second quarter of 2012, with the first ounces expected to come off the leach pads later next year. 
At Twin Creeks, we received regulatory approval to commence mining at Vista 7 and we initiated stripping. And at our Phoenix operation, we're preparing to construct a copper leach project, which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year, beginning in the second half of 2013, which should reduce our CAS in Nevada. We're also studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase Phoenix's copper and gold production. 
Meanwhile, in addition to the projects receiving full funding decisions in 2011, as I've just described, we're continuing to evaluate longer-term opportunities within the portfolio, such as the Sleeping Giants, Elang, Hope Bay, Cerro Quilish and others. We will keep you up to date on our key decisions and milestones on each of these opportunities as we reach and push through them. 
Finally, as I've said recently, our company is well positioned, with the right teams in place, a robust portfolio of development projects, the financial strength and flexibility to fund growth, internal growth, and generate economic returns for our shareholders. And as Russ described, we believe we have an industry-leading and unique dividend linked to the gold price. So taken in combination, and as you can see in the record earnings and margins that we continue to earn in this business, we believe that we offer both gold and generalist investors one of the most compelling investment opportunities available, particularly in the current economic environment where world instability and currency continues to build what we believe is a very attractive market for the gold price. So with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

And how does that arise? The permit that we received in support with 3,000-plus members from the community involved a lot of one-on-one engagement of our team in Peru with all of the regional authorities, as well as all the people who live in the region. And as a consequence of that, we've got a big push and support and no one showed up at that initial permitting hearing in anything other than a supportive position. So we started from a very great position. And I think what's happening now, John, is probably as we should expect over the next year or 2 as we continue in construction, we will see this intermittently from time to time. As people, I believe, first, they recognize that we have a lot of people out in the field now actually beginning construction rather than just talking about it. Second, I think they are interested in making sure that their land and water are taken care of and that's something we are absolutely committed to. And thirdly, as you know, we can't every offer everybody a job in the community, but we are really trying to involve the local, local contractors and their employees in participating in what we're doing in the region so that they, too, share in the economics. And I think it's that balance that we will have to continue to explain to people that we are both up for the environmental and social challenges and we want to meet those in ways which are responsive to the community. We're also up for making sure that we provide a long-term basis upon which we can operate in the region, which means we're just going to have to continue to engage with the regional authorities, the people who live in the region. And even as we're seeing here, people from outside the region who are using this as a platform for whatever ill they see in either the country or Peru or related to mining."

And we just didn't hit the peak, so to speak, for the quarter. The issue on concentrate, and to answer your question directly, is both. When we sell, we declare and we recognize provisional revenue based on the spot price the day of sale. We only get paid somewhere around 97.5% of that because the smelters take that as a discount, and that's pretty standard terms. Then at the end of the quarter, we are forced to mark-to-market. And then in a down quarter, obviously, we saw that on the copper side. We saw a slightly positive adjustment as you'll see on Page 49. So there's a number of factors moving around. The provisional pricing is much less of an issue in my mind than the volatility in this quarter. So really it was question of timing.

This is just my impression after talking with Carlos Santa Cruz, who is our Regional Vice President. And if you look at the outcome of what's happened since President Humala has been elected, first, throughout his campaign, he was very clear that there was going to be a mining tax put in place shortly after his administration came into office. And when he was elected, shortly after he came into office, he called the mining companies just as he said he would. We engaged in discussions with them. And I think in a relatively short period of time, the mining companies working together and together with the government came up, I think, with something which will be implemented here shortly. But I think something that works for the country, works for us, I think, recognizes that mining is an important and integral part of the economy in Peru. And I think as a result of that, we feel like we were included in the discussion. He gave us a heads-up on what he was going to do, and then it got down to the specifics and we got through it. As we get into Conga, I think that is more of a regional issue than a central government issue. But I would say, again, between ourselves and Buenaventura, I think working closely with central and regional governments, because the central government obviously helps to set the pace for the country and I think can influence the regions in the right way. And I think when we are sitting down with them in the last -- when we have been in the last couple of weeks, we see the kind of support that we would hope for and the kind of leadership that we would hope for. So what I would say is so far, our experience has been very good. We continue to hope that if we engage, they will support and engage back. And so far, that seems to be the case. I think as we get down into the regions and in particular -- these are not what they're called, but what I think of them, the micro regions of the various mayoral districts around Conga, that is really an individual to individual kind of approach. And I think those are more complicated because each of those has their own kinds of outcomes that they're looking for, their own set of priorities and those are not necessarily set with or in conjunction with the central government. So it's kind of piece by piece, which is why if you ever go out our Conga site, you'll see we have a fairly big environmental and community responsibility team. That team is out engaged with the community to make sure we do know what the issues are. And I think even in this period over the last month, we knew there was activity coming. We're pretty well plugged in. What we're trying to do is respond to those things and let people know that we will listen and that they don't need to stand in the road to protest because that's what leads to people either being in an area where there might get hurt, luckily, that's not happen. But we do have lots of equipment and people out there, and we're just going to ensure that we do everything possible to keep the community, our contractors and our employees safe, while we continue to build the project."

While GAAP accounting requires you to write down Pilot Gold because its stock price fell this past quarter, it surprised me that we didn't hear you say that we bought x million shares of Pilot Gold in the open market because it was a good investment or something like that. Or the other successor to the other half of the team, Renaissance gold. Do you pay particular attention to these project generator companies?"

In the third quarter, we continued to advance our strategic growth plans. We achieved several key project milestones, including initiation of earthworks at Conga in Peru, and our first concrete pour at Akyem in Ghana. 
Across our wider project pipeline, we have advanced approximately 20 earlier-stage development assets through our project pipeline in each of our 4 operating regions thus far in 2011. Our investment-grade balance sheet continues to strengthen as we delivered our 11th straight quarter of increase in gross margin, while generating quarterly records of revenue at $2.7 billion, operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and net income of $635 million adjusted. We also ended the quarter with over $3 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also continued to explore one of the most extensive land positions in the gold industry. Across our exploration portfolio, we are currently operating 100 drill rigs around the globe in over 40 locations, spanning greenfields and brownfields projects, as well as surface and underground opportunities. 
And as we announced on Wednesday, we increased our dividend again for the sixth straight quarter to $0.35 per share based on our average realized gold sales price for the third quarter of $1,695. This is a 133% increase over the year-ago quarter. On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend stands at a yield of over 2%, which is higher than the current S&P 500 average yield and certainly the highest in the gold industry.
And finally, thanks to the continued focus of our employees on disciplined execution, we are maintaining our outlook for production, operating costs and capital expenditures, as described further in our press release. Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, to discuss our third quarter results."

As illustrated on Slide 4, I'm pleased to be able to talk to you this morning about another strong quarter of operating and financial results. Clearly, we benefited from a 39% increase in the gold price, realizing $1,695 an ounce, which was $7 or approximately 0.4% lower than the average of the daily fix. This was due to the timing of doré sales, concentrated shipments and mark-to-market adjustments at quarter end in what was a very volatile quarter. Details of the realized gold price calculation for the quarter and year-to-date are included in our 10-Q on Page 49. 
Net income from continuing operations of $493 million was impacted by a noncash impairment charge of approximately $152 million on an after-tax basis. And this is related to marketable securities of Paladin Energy Limited, a uranium producer, and Pilot Gold, both acquired on April 6, 2011, as part of the acquisition of Fronteer. These charges were offset by a $10 million after-tax gain realized on the sale of a minority position in Lydian Resources. The net noncash impairment of $142 million equates to $0.29 a share on an after-tax basis and results in adjusted net income for the quarter of $1.29 a share. 
Net income for the quarter was also adversely impacted by an effective tax rate of 36% due to some timing issues and a valuation allowance on certain capital losses. In comparison with the quarter, the effective tax rate for the first 9 months of the year was 30% and our estimated effective tax rate for the year remains somewhere around 30%. The standout number for the quarter was a continued strong operating cash flow generation of almost $1.3 billion, a 48% increase from the year-ago quarter. The portfolio continues to deliver on what we consider to be the most important determinant of long-term value, operating cash flow per share. 
Moving to Slide 5. Gold production was down by about 7% from a year ago due to the transition from Phase 5 ore production to largely Phase 6 waste stripping at Batu Hijau in Indonesia and lower grades in mill throughput in Nevada. Gold cost applicable to sales of $622 an ounce was up 32% versus the prior year quarter due to a combination of lower production, higher input costs and a higher coproduct allocation of operating cost to gold from copper as a result of the relative outperformance of gold in the quarter. The coproduct accounting issue is, of course, just a geography issue on the income statement and has no bottom line impact. 
Gold CAS on a net attributable basis was $556 an ounce, again up significantly as a function of lower copper production from Batu Hijau and a lower realized copper price. The realized copper price for the quarter of $2.94 a pound was 20% lower than the year-ago quarter, reflecting both the weaker spot market during the quarter and a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss for the quarter of $74 million or $0.80 a pound. At the end of the third quarter, we had 102 million pounds of copper, provisionally priced at $3.24 a pound. 
Slide 6 provides a little more detail on the increase in our cost applicable to sales. Increased operating costs, including unscheduled maintenance, higher labor and contracted services costs increased CAS by about $45 an ounce. Lower production at all of our assets, excluding Batu Hijau, at least on a portfolio basis, increased CAS by $36 an ounce. Lower production at Batu Hijau and the coproduct accounting issue discussed earlier increased gold CAS by about $27 an ounce. The balances of the factors on the chart are largely self-explanatory, with a stronger Aussie dollar, a higher gold price, higher fuel costs and lower byproduct, copper and silver revenues collectively adding $45 an ounce. However, with a strong fourth quarter expected, particularly for our Nevada operations as Pete Bajo, Exodus, Chukar and Gold Quarry add significant ounces compared to the third quarter. As such, our 2011 outlook for CAS remains unchanged at between $560 and $590 an ounce, although likely to be towards the upper end of the range. Remember that these numbers are calculated under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar cost calculated under IFRS. 
On Slide 7, you'll see how are gold margins have expanded over time versus the gold price, as our disciplined focus on execution has yielded consistent margin growth despite industry-wide cost pressures. Based on current spot prices and assuming the top end of our CAS outlook for 2011, we expect our gold margin for the year to be in excess of $1,100 or approximately 65%, a healthy margin by any measure. 
Turning to Slide 8 and our gold price-linked dividend policy. I wanted to take just a couple of minutes to explain the mechanics of the policy we originally announced in April, and then subsequently enhanced in September. Firstly, the amounts on the slide reflect annual dividend estimates. And since we pay a quarterly dividend, we need to divide the annual amounts by 4 to get the quarterly equivalent. The amount of the quarterly dividend payable is determined by the trailing quarters realized gold price, which can be found in our Form 10-Q and 10-K filings as discussed earlier. 
The dividend payable in December announced earlier this week of $0.35 a share reflects the realized gold price of $1,695 an ounce for the third quarter. Based on a $65 share price, this results in an effective annual yield of approximately 2.1% or approximately double that of our peers. At gold prices between $1,100 and $1,699 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.20 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. At Gold price is between $1,700 and $1,999 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.30 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. And then at gold prices between $2,000 and $2,599 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.40 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. 
The result of this formula is that our shareholders will see an increasing share of incremental operating cash flows as the gold price increases. We are able to share these incremental cash flows based on the fact that we have the highest leverage to gold prices through the highest gold production per share outstanding. This allows us to pay the highest dividend per share while still investing organically to grow the business at the top line level. 
We have been consistent in our belief that at the end of the day, per share metrics has to matter. I believe this commitment to returning capital to our shareholders distinguishes us from our peers and the gold ETF in particular, and provides a compelling investment thesis, especially in the current interest rate environment. With that, I'll turn the call back to Richard."

An overview of our attributable Q3 results by region can be found on Slide 9, with a view of performance versus the prior year quarter. Russell has already discussed the key production and cost variances from Q3. And full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can also be found in the release, or in our 10-Q. So rather than restate what's already been written, I'll discuss some relevant updates from our operations, and then we can devote a bit more time to your specific questions. 
We recently announced some organizational changes, which will further strengthen Newmont's leadership team. Gary Goldberg will join Newmont on December 5 as our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And Brian Hill will be taking on a new leadership role as our Executive Vice President for Sustainability and External Affairs. Gary joins us from Rio Tinto, where he spent approximately 30 years, and he will be responsible for our worldwide operations, business excellence, health, safety and loss prevention and security. Since joining Newmont, Brian has been instrumental in leading strong and consistent performance from our operating portfolio, and in addition, has built a world-class operations leadership team and has assisted invisibly leading Newmont's culture shift. In his new role, Brian will help Newmont stay at the forefront of sustainability and stakeholder alignment on a global basis. We believe that bringing ESR and Government Relations under the same leadership will enhance Newmont's effectiveness in each of these disciplines at a time when our industry is facing growing challenges to access and government approvals. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our North American Q3 results were down from last year's third quarter due to lower than expected grades, as well as mine sequencing changes. At Leeville, we had a slight movement in our ventilation/backfill shaft, which impacted planned stope sequencing. The shift is being repaired -- the shaft is being repaired and we are utilizing a secondary backfill delivery system in order to safely maintain our Q4 production level and into 2012. Since completing our remediation work at Gold Quarry this quarter, the pit has been resequenced and we are encountering higher grade mill feed, which should continue throughout Q4. We have also successfully ramped up the Exodus mine and expect to continue to produce at targeted tonnages. Slightly lower grades are reflected in the revised outlook, and we are ahead of schedule with the development of a Pete Bajo underground mine, as we are producing more tons at higher grades than anticipated. 
And while as Russell stated, we're expecting a strong fourth quarter in Nevada, I can tell you that those plans showing that strength do not put at risk our performance in 2012. The team in Nevada feels confident in its capabilities to deliver this quarter and continuing into 2012 and beyond. In Mexico at La Herradura, quarterly and year-to-date attributable production reached record levels due to increased ore placements at La Herradura and higher ore grade at Soledad and Dipolos. Construction of the Noche Buena mine remains on schedule for completion in the first half of 2012. We are also supporting our partner as they embark on the construction of a gold mill that will have capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis. 
Moving to Slide 11. As you've probably read, recent roadblock activity has intermittently affected access to our Yanacocha mine and the Conga and Western Oxides projects this month. Mining operations in the pits were temporarily suspended but are now back to full operation. We continue to engage with central and regional government and community leaders to understand and address the concerns of our stakeholders in that region. Our team in Peru continues to do a very commendable job of working with local authorities for the safety of our people and the public. 
Turning to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 12. Regional volumes and costs in the third quarter were impacted, as Russell said, by the planned Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, work continues on optimizing the dry plant conveyor circuit to improve availability. Also at Boddington, CAS increased by $102 per ounce, driven mainly by lower tons mined at lower grade, 7 days of unscheduled downtime, mostly related to the conveyor issues, higher coproduct allocation of cost to gold, higher operating costs, and other gold-related costs such as royalties, partially offset by a favorable A dollar exchange rate variance net of hedges. Meanwhile at Jundee, we've increased exploration programs to expand mineralization and we are adding mineral inventory in new areas, reporting an extended mine life. 
I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 13 with Africa. Ahafo's production was down slightly versus the prior year quarter due to lower mill grade, which impacted CAS, as well as higher labor, diesel and royalty costs. In Q3, we successfully completed our AKOBEN audit. This is Ghana's annual EPA review, and Ahafo achieved a blue rating for 2010 performance, 1 of only 2 mines in Ghana to receive that high rating. The Ghana region continues to be our highest growth portfolio region in our portfolio, and we continue to see numerous opportunities around the Ahafo mine for expansion. 
Concluding on Slide 14. As I noted earlier, we continue to make good progress in advancing our strategic growth plans in each of our 4 regions. And I'd like to close today's call by noting some of the key milestones we've achieved across our development portfolio. At Akyem, since full funding approval in March 2011, the project has continued to advance with confirmation of the main civil and mechanical construction contracts, commencement of bulk earthworks and civil activities, the first structural concrete pour and the establishment of the first set of resettlement villages. 
At Conga, following the full funding approval, the project has continued to progress: infrastructure works, earthworks construction, drilling, detailed engineering, procurement of materials and equipment and securing remaining permits for construction. At Tanami, following full funding approval in July, the development efforts have progressed according to plans. The pilot hole for the shaft has been completed and the contractor is mobilized. The project will support underground expansion at the Callie and Auron ore bodies, reduce cutoff grade, enhance productivity and facilitate additional mine expansion. The project is expected to add average annual attributable gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces during the first 5 years of production, while also lowering costs applicable to sales for the first 5 years by approximately $100 per ounce. 
And at Long Canyon in Nevada, drilling is focusing on infill, mineralized extensions and district exploration. Extension drilling continues to highlight growth potential. We have advanced our studies and are on track to submit our plan of operations to begin the permitting process in the first half of 2012. Also in Nevada, we continue to work on several projects, including Pete Bajo, which achieved commercial production last month and is performing above our expectations with better grade and higher tonnage. At our Emigrant project, which is on schedule and on budget, we expect to start mining in the second quarter of 2012, with the first ounces expected to come off the leach pads later next year. 
At Twin Creeks, we received regulatory approval to commence mining at Vista 7 and we initiated stripping. And at our Phoenix operation, we're preparing to construct a copper leach project, which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year, beginning in the second half of 2013, which should reduce our CAS in Nevada. We're also studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase Phoenix's copper and gold production. 
Meanwhile, in addition to the projects receiving full funding decisions in 2011, as I've just described, we're continuing to evaluate longer-term opportunities within the portfolio, such as the Sleeping Giants, Elang, Hope Bay, Cerro Quilish and others. We will keep you up to date on our key decisions and milestones on each of these opportunities as we reach and push through them. 
Finally, as I've said recently, our company is well positioned, with the right teams in place, a robust portfolio of development projects, the financial strength and flexibility to fund growth, internal growth, and generate economic returns for our shareholders. And as Russ described, we believe we have an industry-leading and unique dividend linked to the gold price. So taken in combination, and as you can see in the record earnings and margins that we continue to earn in this business, we believe that we offer both gold and generalist investors one of the most compelling investment opportunities available, particularly in the current economic environment where world instability and currency continues to build what we believe is a very attractive market for the gold price. So with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

And how does that arise? The permit that we received in support with 3,000-plus members from the community involved a lot of one-on-one engagement of our team in Peru with all of the regional authorities, as well as all the people who live in the region. And as a consequence of that, we've got a big push and support and no one showed up at that initial permitting hearing in anything other than a supportive position. So we started from a very great position. And I think what's happening now, John, is probably as we should expect over the next year or 2 as we continue in construction, we will see this intermittently from time to time. As people, I believe, first, they recognize that we have a lot of people out in the field now actually beginning construction rather than just talking about it. Second, I think they are interested in making sure that their land and water are taken care of and that's something we are absolutely committed to. And thirdly, as you know, we can't every offer everybody a job in the community, but we are really trying to involve the local, local contractors and their employees in participating in what we're doing in the region so that they, too, share in the economics. And I think it's that balance that we will have to continue to explain to people that we are both up for the environmental and social challenges and we want to meet those in ways which are responsive to the community. We're also up for making sure that we provide a long-term basis upon which we can operate in the region, which means we're just going to have to continue to engage with the regional authorities, the people who live in the region. And even as we're seeing here, people from outside the region who are using this as a platform for whatever ill they see in either the country or Peru or related to mining."

When we sell, we declare and we recognize provisional revenue based on the spot price the day of sale. We only get paid somewhere around 97.5% of that because the smelters take that as a discount, and that's pretty standard terms. Then at the end of the quarter, we are forced to mark-to-market. And then in a down quarter, obviously, we saw that on the copper side. We saw a slightly positive adjustment as you'll see on Page 49. So there's a number of factors moving around.

We're looking for anything that helps us enhance the combination of competitive growth. On returns, we look for returns usually in that kind of mid-teen level at a relatively conservative metal price, which isn't the easiest thing to do when you burden up acquisitions with premium. We also look at, number three, at opportunities that enhance our exploration position. We obviously try to balance out by keeping our balance sheet intact. As we've talked before, as Richard and Russ both mentioned, we have a bias toward keeping our share count down. We just put all of those into the mix and those criteria continued to be at the forefront of our thinking on M&A as well."

This is just my impression after talking with Carlos Santa Cruz, who is our Regional Vice President. And if you look at the outcome of what's happened since President Humala has been elected, first, throughout his campaign, he was very clear that there was going to be a mining tax put in place shortly after his administration came into office. And when he was elected, shortly after he came into office, he called the mining companies just as he said he would. We engaged in discussions with them. And I think in a relatively short period of time, the mining companies working together and together with the government came up, I think, with something which will be implemented here shortly. But I think something that works for the country, works for us, I think, recognizes that mining is an important and integral part of the economy in Peru. And I think as a result of that, we feel like we were included in the discussion. He gave us a heads-up on what he was going to do, and then it got down to the specifics and we got through it. As we get into Conga, I think that is more of a regional issue than a central government issue. But I would say, again, between ourselves and Buenaventura, I think working closely with central and regional governments, because the central government obviously helps to set the pace for the country and I think can influence the regions in the right way. And I think when we are sitting down with them in the last -- when we have been in the last couple of weeks, we see the kind of support that we would hope for and the kind of leadership that we would hope for. So what I would say is so far, our experience has been very good. We continue to hope that if we engage, they will support and engage back. And so far, that seems to be the case. I think as we get down into the regions and in particular -- these are not what they're called, but what I think of them, the micro regions of the various mayoral districts around Conga, that is really an individual to individual kind of approach. And I think those are more complicated because each of those has their own kinds of outcomes that they're looking for, their own set of priorities and those are not necessarily set with or in conjunction with the central government. So it's kind of piece by piece, which is why if you ever go out our Conga site, you'll see we have a fairly big environmental and community responsibility team. That team is out engaged with the community to make sure we do know what the issues are. And I think even in this period over the last month, we knew there was activity coming. We're pretty well plugged in. What we're trying to do is to respond to those things and let people know that we will listen and that they don't need to stand in the road to protest because that's what leads to people either being in an area where there might get hurt, luckily, that's not happened. But we do have lots of equipment and people out there, and we're just going to ensure that we do everything possible to keep the community, our contractors and our employees safe, while we continue to build the project."
