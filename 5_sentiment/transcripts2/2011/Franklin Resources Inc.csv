Thank you for taking the time out to join us on this call. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. Hopefully everyone had a chance to listen to the commentary we made available this morning, but just to quickly recap, it was another strong quarter driven by strong equity markets, as well as the depth and breadth of our global presence. 
AUM reached an all-time high of $671 billion, and we saw the benefits of diversification as flow trends to equity and Hybrid products improved while fixed income flow remains strong. We were able to recapture almost half of the muni fund outflows that we experienced during the quarter, the exchanges into other Franklin Templeton funds. 
Operating income was $659 million, again, we end the year the high on a high note, but while part of the increase was due to some nonrecurring items in seasonality, it that was largely driven by the growth of assets. I'd like to now open it up to your questions."

I guess, strategic question I have -- I know we keep asking this on these conference calls, but given your very robust balance sheet and the fact that you can continue build cash and try to understand strategically given where rates are and given where you are with the franchise as diverse as it is and recurring asset is, why you continue to husband so much capital? And just sort of what your thoughts are? Is there something that you're worried about strategically in the business or looking at similar transaction maybe why not one or more step up, if you will, in terms of the dividend payout or buyback?"

First, if you look at our balance sheet, keep in mind that a significant part of the balance sheet, we have to reinvest in the business. And by reinvesting in the business, we are talking about seeding new products and co-investing and also keeping money on reserve for restricted purposes. I would say that almost 2/3 of the balance sheet is for reinvesting in the business and earmarked for those purposes. And the remainder, as you know, a part of it is offshore and part of it is in the United States. So that's kind of give you the perspective how to use the balance sheet regarding the philosophy and strategy. I think that remains unchanged, if you look at our history. This quarter's payout ratio is kind of indicative of our long-term history, and I think that's proved to be very beneficial to shareholders over the last four years. I mean is that over the last four years, we generated over $1 billion of cash, kept stable, and we reduced the shareholder accounts significantly by about 12%, I think over the last four years. So we continue to be cognizant of returning and providing value to shareholders. And the other two comments I'd make is the market is do turn, so it's good to have a strong balance sheet. We saw that through the financial crisis, but not only from a financial point of view but from also from a client point of view. We found it to be the fact that we have a strong balance sheet to be one of the factors that we were able to retain and attract clients during that period."

It's a new category for retail. We talked about on our prior call about -- it had very small percentage coming from basically nothing to now, being a part of a lot of retail portfolio. So it's a nice way to diversify. I mean the records, and you look at the last decade, how well they've done. And obviously, the currency's played a big part in that. And also I think just around the globe, the consensus of people worrying about their own currencies and a nice way to diversify your purchasing power. It really is a new asset class for the retail investor. Now with that said, I mean anytime rates back up, you're going to have some pressure from rising rates further value portfolio, but it's not your typical fixed income fund as far as rate sensitivity. And our fund has a very low duration relative to other ones anyways. So it's really more about how well you manage the currencies versus how much interest rates are going to affect that.

So I think we're going to continue to be open to look at everything. Situation like Appelago is really more of a startup-type for us to dip our toes into the managed future derivatives, hedge fund replication and then build that into our solutions area. The solutions area is another area whether it's outcome-oriented or targeted-type retirement plan that will continue to build capabilities and have, as mentioned before, tactical asset location fund, hard asset funds, funds that we think and do well on a rising rate environment and funds that can utilize investments even outside of our own group but the majority of them will be within our own group.

And that's an area where I would say, historically, we've been underrated on an all U.S. equity side, but we do have some funds that are doing very well and are getting a whole new audience. I don't have all the numbers in front of me, but if you look at Franklin Equity Group as a whole, we talk about top two quartiles, but if you look at the first quartile overall performance, it's 77% in the three-year, 73% five-year and close to 80% in 10-year of those assets and about 70% in the one-year in the first quartile.

And when you have the headline risk and some of the -- I think this confusion around the possibility of state bankruptcies and things that you get an oversold market. But I think the good news about munis is, I think like most fixed income markets, the yields can get attracted to new buyers and you do a crossover buyers coming in and when those fields get above treasuries, and I think some of the better information gets out about the possibility of state bankruptcies that, that should settle down and I think the market will come back.

The question around munis, are we proactive, the answer is, no. As far as going out and trying to retain, that's probably a normal number for most fixed income funds where they would move somewhere else if somebody had a short-term concern on the market. And I think it goes to the strength the broker dealers sold funds and where they pay a commission and going to the fund family and if you have a well-diversified fund family, you will retain a lot of those assets because those people are in it to buy munis. That's what they want. But there maybe a period where they want to shift out a timeframe and having a strong fund family that allows you to do that, and also having a payday commission, we're not just going to jump out and move into something else because that wouldn't be appropriate.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. Hopefully everyone had a chance to listen to the commentary we made available this morning, but just to quickly recap, it was another strong quarter driven by strong equity markets, as well as the depth and breadth of our global presence. 
AUM reached an all-time high of $671 billion, and we saw the benefits of diversification as flow trends to equity and Hybrid products improved, while fixed income flow remains strong. We were able to recapture almost half of the muni [municipal] fund outflows that we experienced during the quarter, the exchanges into other Franklin Templeton funds. Operating income was $659 million, began the year on a high note, but while part of the increase was due to some non-recurring items in seasonality, it that was largely driven by the growth of assets. 
I'd like to now open it up for your questions."

You mentioned on your pre-recorded call that this quarter might be a bit more indicative relative to the last rolling five quarters, if you will, if you look at the payout ratio and I get that with the special dividend about a year ago. I guess, the strategic question I have is I know we keep asking on these conference calls, but given your very robust balance sheet and the fact that you can continue to sort of build cash and was trying to understand strategically given where rates are and given where you are with the franchise as diverse as it is and as recurring as it is, why you continue to husband so much capital?

First, if you look at our balance sheet, keep in mind that a significant part of the balance sheet we have to reinvest in the business. And by reinvesting in the business, we're talking about seeding new products and co-investing and also keeping money on reserve for restricted purposes. So I would say that almost 2/3 of the balance sheet is for reinvesting of the business and earmarked for those purposes. And the remainder, as you know, part of it is offshore and part of it is in the United States. So that's kind of give you the perspective from how we use the balance sheet regarding the philosophy and strategy. I think that remains unchanged, if you look at our history this quarter's payout ratio is kind of indicative of our long-term history, and I think that's proved to be very beneficial to shareholders over the last four years. I made this comment last quarter, but I'll just reiterate it. Over the last four years, we generated over $1 billion of cash, kept debt stable, and we've reduced the shareholder accounts significantly by about 12%, I think over the last four years. So we continued to be cognizant of returning and providing value to shareholders. And the other two comments I'd make is the markets do turn, so it's good to have a strong balance sheet. We saw that through the financial crisis and not only from a financial point of view but also from a client point of view. We found that to be -- the fact that we have a strong balance sheet to be one of the factors that we were able to retain and attract clients during that period."

We talked about it on prior calls about -- it had very small percentage coming from basically nothing to now being a part of a lot of that retail portfolio. So it's a nice way to diversify. I mean, the records and you look at the last decade, how well they've done. And obviously, the currencies play a big part in that. And also I think just around the globe, the consensus of people worrying about their own currencies and a nice way to diversify your purchasing power. It really is a new asset class for the retail investor. Now with that said, I mean any time rates back up, you're going to have some pressure from rising rates and just the value of the portfolio, but it's just not your typical fixed income fund as far as rate sensitivity, and our funds has a very low duration relative to other ones anyway. So it's really more about how well you manage the currencies versus how much interest rates are going to affect that. As long as you do that well, I think you'll continue to see very strong flows."

Situation like the Pelagos is really more of the startup type for us to dip our toes into the managed future derivatives, hedge fund replication and then build that into our solutions area. The solutions area is another area whether it's outcome-oriented or targeted-type retirement plans that we will continue to build capabilities and have. As I've mentioned before, tactical asset allocation fund, hard asset funds, funds that we think can do well in a rising rate environment and funds that can utilize investments even outside of our own group, but the majority of them will be within our own group.

And that's an area where I would say, historically we've been under weighted on the U.S. equity side, but we do have some funds that are doing very well and are getting a whole new audience. I don't have all of the numbers in front of me, but if you look at the Franklin Equity Group as a whole, we talk about top two quartiles.

The U.K. for us, a nice kind of fit where we get a group with long-term record and we can immediately try to leverage that through our sales relationships. And even we're optimistic that we can take that group and introduce them to some large distributors that we have global relationships with fairly quickly. Now I think the other market that we mentioned would be Australia, which is one that we've looked at some opportunities there and will probably continue to do so, just with the superannuation and the importance of having local Australian equity management there. Outside of that, I don't think there's any major markets. I mean you could look at Japan as one, but probably not high in our list. We do have a domestic equity capability there now. The question around munis, are we proactive? The answer is, no. As far as going out and trying to retain, that's probably a normal number for most fixed income funds where they would move somewhere else if somebody had a short-term concern on the market. And I think it goes to the strength the broker-dealers sold funds and where they pay a commission and go into the fund family. And if you have a well-diversified fund family, you will retain a lot of those assets because those people are in it to buy munis. That's what they want. But there maybe a period where they want to shift out for a time frame and having a strong fund family allows you to do that, and also having payday commission, they're not going to just jump out and move into something else because that wouldn't be appropriate. So I think the broker-dealer side, you do end up retaining more than you would on the direct side."

Hopefully everyone had a chance to listen to the commentary we made available this morning, but just to quickly recap, it was another strong quarter driven by strong equity markets, as well as the depth and breadth of our global presence. 
AUM reached an all-time high of $671 billion, and we saw the benefits of diversification as flow trends to equity and Hybrid products improved, while fixed income flows remained strong. We were able to recapture almost half of the muni [municipal] fund outflows that we experienced during the quarter, via exchanges into other Franklin Templeton funds. Operating income was $659 million, began the year on a high note, but while part of the increase was due to some non-recurring items in seasonality, it was largely driven by the growth of assets.

First, if you look at our balance sheet, keep in mind that a significant part of the balance sheet we have to reinvest in the business. And by reinvesting in the business, we're talking about seeding new products and co-investing and also keeping money on reserve for restricted purposes. So I would say that almost 2/3 of the balance sheet is for reinvesting in the business and earmarked for those purposes. And the remainder, as you know, part of it is offshore and part of it is in the United States. So that's kind of give you the perspective from how we use the balance sheet. Regarding the philosophy and the strategy, I think that remains unchanged. If you look at our history, this quarter's payout ratio is kind of indicative of our long-term history, and I think that's proved to be very beneficial to shareholders over the last four years. I made this comment last quarter, but I'll just reiterate it. Over the last four years, we’ve generated over $1 billion of cash, kept debt stable, and we've reduced the shareholder accounts significantly by about 12%, I think over the last four years. So we continue to be cognizant of returning and providing value to shareholders. And the other two comments I'd make is the markets do turn, so it's good to have a strong balance sheet. We saw that through the financial crisis and not only from a financial point of view but also from a client point of view. We found that to be -- the fact that we have a strong balance sheet to be one of the factors that we were able to retain and attract clients during that period."

We talked about it on prior calls about -- it has very small percentage coming from basically nothing to now being a part of a lot of retail portfolio. So it's a nice way to diversify. I mean, the records and you look at the last decade, how well they've done. And obviously, the currencies play a big part in that. And also I think just around the globe, the consensus of people worrying about their own currencies and a nice way to diversify your purchasing power. It really is a new asset class for the retail investor. Now with that said, I mean any time rates back up, you're going to have some pressure from rising rates and just the value of the portfolio, but it's just not your typical fixed income fund as far as rate sensitivity, and our fund has a fairly low duration relative to other ones anyway.

We recognize both on the institutional side, as well as retail, a growing appetite. We think it's a natural extension of what we do. We're a little bit hesitant about just going out and purchasing large hedge funds or alternative managers just because we think it's hard to have a consistent repeatable process where you can put different players into that like you can with a retail mutual fund process. So I think we're going to continue to be open to look at everything. A situation like a Pelagos is really more of a startup type for us to dip our toes into the managed future derivatives, hedge fund replication and then build that into our solutions area. The solutions area is another area whether it's outcome-oriented or targeted-type retirement plans that we will continue to build capabilities and have, as I've mentioned before, tactical asset allocation fund, hard asset funds, funds that we think can do well in a rising rate environment and funds that can utilize investments even outside of our own group, but the majority of them will be within our own group. So we'll continue to build that, but we're going to do it thoughtfully. And we've got no goal that says we have to be X size in a certain period. We just want to make sure that it fits within our organization."

I don't think that it's the order of magnitude that would take the margin down to that 32% level in the short term. We're not thinking about that.

We've also been very successful in getting them on DCIO platforms, and that is going to be very important in all markets to kind of keep generating consistent sales. And that's an area where I would say, historically we've been under weighted on the U.S. equity side, but we do have some funds that are doing very well and are getting a whole new audience. I don't have all of the numbers in front of me, but if you look at the Franklin Equity Group as a whole, we talk about top two quartiles. But if you look at the first quartile overall performance, it's 77% in the three year, 73% in the five year and close to 80% in the 10 year of those assets and about 70% in the one year in the first quartile.

It tends to be a lot more volatile because of that. And when you have the headline risk and some of the -- I think just confusion around the possibility of state bankruptcies and things, that you get an oversold market. But I think the good news about munis is, I think they -- like most fixed income markets, the yields can get attractive to new buyers and you do have crossover buyers coming in and when those yields get above treasuries, and I think some of the better information gets out about the possibility of state bankruptcies that, that issue will settle down and I think the market will come back. And already, in the last week or two, you've seen the market settling down a bit and hopefully that's a trend. But like everyone, we know these budget fights happen in the political arena, you're going to have a lot of volatility in the year or two ahead.

Outside that, I don't think there's any major markets. I mean you could look at Japan as one, but probably not high in our list. We do have a domestic equity capability there now. The question around munis, and are we proactive? The answer is, no. As far as going out and trying to retain, that's probably a normal number for most fixed income funds where they would move somewhere else if somebody had a short-term concern on the market. And I think it goes to the strength of broker-dealers’ sold funds and where they pay a commission and go into the fund family. And if you have a well-diversified fund family, you will retain a lot of those assets because those people are in it to buy munis. That's what they want. But there may be a period where they want to shift out for a time frame and having a strong fund family allows you to do that, and also having paid a commission, they're not going to just jump out and move into something else because that wouldn't be appropriate.

I think part of it is the advisor gravitating towards that instead of what used to be a momentum or even a large-cap growth. So I just think there's some shifts there that it's just very powerful when people are getting older and they're not going to want to take the risk that they were taking before and that's not true in every country, but I think that's the case I would make in the States.

Joining me is Ken Lewis, our CFO. This morning we reported a strong quarter of operating results, sales we're an all-time high and long-term net new flows improved to $9 billion due to the continued strength of global bonds and the pickup of U.S. equity and Hybrid flows. We did experience some lumpy institutional redemptions during the quarter, the flow trends improved in March. That trend has continued in April and we continue to see that we're well-positioned to benefit from increased investor demand for equities and Hybrid fund. Now I'd like to open it up to your questions."

Yes, it's true that in a particularly the IT, the occupancy expense came in a little under. What we were thinking is going to be that we continue to spend innovating, it should take a little bit longer for that spend to be reflected in the income statement. I guess, two reasons. One, there is a lot of projects at we're working on or capitalized. So you have to wait till its completed and then come through in depreciation expense. And two, there have been a lot of efficiencies realized in this fiscal year particularly given some strategic decisions on the technology side, for example, bringing the data center helps them. What kind of recognizing some of those fadings, sooner than we thought, so that's been maybe keeping the expense line static instead of increasing what we talked. The message is the same.

We have felt that the performance has been very strong especially on the Franklin equity side. Franklin Growth Fund has been a long time. We just spent, for the last six months, pushing hard on those bonds. And I think obviously the timing is right. And then I think more importantly for the longer-term trend is all of the new platforms that we've introduced those funds to in the last six months and the defining contribution tends to be a steadier place to go and that's probably where the battles won and lost as far as equity funds go. So our metric was getting them on as many platforms over the last year when equities were at a favor. Now, when you're see things come back, they were doing very well. The Franklin growth fund, the raising dividends fund, the offshore the Franklin U.S. opportunities fund, all had record quarters for that last quarter."

If you look at Templeton and with the early value by S. If you look at them, it's all international equity funds, they were under performing. Now that's turned around dramatically since that decision was made by those sovereign wealth funds to switch over. I'm not sure where the money went or whether passive or they're active, but it was performance related to the Templeton lag. Now that's really over the last three months it turned around dramatically. You could see most of the Templeton funds now are in the top first or second quartile, including the three-year number that moved quickly. And at that same time, we were winning global equity mandates at the same time when that redemption was made. So I don't think you can draw any conclusion that happened. These funds tend to move moneys around a little bit quicker than fair average. When you have to do a downturn and short-term performance, you're vulnerable. As far as the global equity flows go outside of the U.S., you're right, the big driver has been Asian growth. And that trailed off during the quarter, and I think the reason there is really the backup and rates in the January effect on emerging markets and overall. Those markets underperformed the overall MSCI during the quarter, and again those tend to be more short-term performance related. Now I would think that would, they would be coming back now."

Right now, the push in marketing is global, is a new core. And it doesn't mean we're forgetting about U.S. but all the tests and surveys that we've done in trends indicate that there'll be more moving to Global Equities.

I think they're under pressure everyday in the headlines and you certainly have some strategic buyers that come into the market but just overall retail buyer that is the dominant player in that marketplace. It's going to react what they read about what read about in headlines. And I think the bigger part was the they concern that rates are going up and taxes are staying down and not going up quickly. And I think those two on a less liquid market had a pretty dramatic impact, coupled with the headlines, it's hard to separate out what effect the most. But the bottom line is, we don't see that turning around quickly. It's better performance has been better. It was positive overall for munis. So that's positive and whether it settles down, and I think it should but we still run that risk of headlines everyday and budgets being battle and that's just going to put headwinds into muni flows. International equity, the issue, the core strength of our franchise around Franklin, around the Templeton side has a little bit larger cap value bias and less energy immaterial waiting. It was relative performance, not good news today as the dollars' been weak, they don't hedge anything. The move in the last quarter into Europe and other places where they've been overweighted that's hurt performance has helped performance here and helped it dramatically. So that's turned around quickly. It's hard to sell for your third and fourth quartile but now that we're back in the first and second, hopefully we can see some turn around there quickly on the retail side. And mutuals been steady and positive and mutual European and mutual discovery continue to be steady as far as inflows go. And again hopefully that will continue"

So that puts pressure on the overall net number. But I'd looked at the story to me is the strength of the global total return fund and how quickly it has grown in $2.5 billion of net inflows under that fund the last quarter. So while you could argue maybe the global bond has slowed a little bit but you can certainly say the global bond will return has become very meaningful and that's even a bigger market than the global bond. Because it's not only have sovereign debt but has corporate bonds in there. And that's had excellent performance and we'll continue to see strong interest there. I think, again, any country that's concerned about their currency whether it's U.S. or the Euro are going to be very interested in global bonds and that's certainly getting more headlines I would argue today than ever. I'm still pretty optimistic on flows there."

Joining me is Ken Lewis, our CFO. 
This morning we reported a strong quarter of operating results, sales we're at an all-time high and long-term net new flows improved to $9 billion, due to the continued strength of Global bonds and a pickup in U.S. Equity and Hybrid flows. We did experience some lumpy institutional redemptions during the quarter, but flow trends improved in March. That trend has continued in April, and we continue to see that we're well positioned to benefit from increased investor demand for equities and Hybrid fund.

One, is a lot of the projects that we're working on are capitalized, so you have to wait until its completed. And then it will come through in depreciation expense. And two, there have been a lot of efficiencies realized in this fiscal year, particularly due to some strategic decisions we've made on the technology side. For example, bringing these data centers in house. Where kind of recognizing some of those savings earlier than we thought.

So our metric was getting them on as many platforms over the last year when equities were at a favor. And now when you're see things come back, they're doing very well.

And if you look at Templeton and with the early value by us. If you look at them, it's all international equity funds, they were under performing. Now that's turned around dramatically since that decision was made by those sovereign wealth funds to switch over. I'm not sure where the moneys went going passive or they're active, but it was performance-related to the Templeton lag. Now that's really over the last three months it turned around dramatically. And you could see most of the Templeton funds now are in the top first or second quartile, including the three-year number that moved quickly. And at that same time, we were winning global equity mandates, at the same time that, that redemption was made. So I don't think you can draw any conclusion. That happens. And these funds tend to move moneys around a little bit quicker than, say, your average. So when you have downturns and short-term performance, you're vulnerable. As far as the global equity flows go outside of the U.S., you're right, the big driver has been Asian growth. And that trailed off during the quarter. And I think the reason there is really the backup in rates and the January effect on emerging markets. And overall, those markets underperformed the overall MSCI during the quarter. And again, those tend to be more short-term performance-related, and I would think that, that would be coming back now."

And I think those two on a less liquid market had a pretty dramatic impact, coupled with the headlines, and it's hard to separate out what affects it the most. But the bottom line is, we don't see that turning around quickly. It's better -- performance has been better. It was positive for the quarter overall for munis. So that's positive and whether it settles down, I think it should, but you still run that risk of headlines everyday and budgets being battle, and that's just going to put headwinds into muni flows. International equity, I mean, the issue, the core strength of our franchise around Franklin -- around the Templeton side has with its larger cap value bias and less energy in material waiting. It's hurt relative performance. Now the good news today, is the dollar has been weak, they don't hedge anything. The move in the last quarter into Europe and other places where they've been overweighted that's hurt performance, that's helped performance here and helped it dramatically. So that's turned around quickly. It's hard to sell when you're third and fourth quartile. But now that we're back in the first and second, hopefully we can see some turn around there quickly on the retail side. And mutuals has been steady and positive.

So that puts pressure on the overall net number. But I'd looked at -- the story to me is the strength of the Global Total Return fund and how quickly that's grown in $2.5 billion of net inflows into that fund the last quarter. So while you could argue maybe the Global bond has slowed a little bit, but you can certainly say the Global Total Return has become very meaningful, and that's even a bigger market than the Global Bond because it's not only has sovereign debt but has Corporate bonds in there. And that's had excellent performance, and we're continuing to see strong interest there. And I think, again, any country that's concerned about their currency whether it's U.S. or the euro are going to be very interested in Global bonds and that's certainly getting more headlines. I would argue today than ever. So I still am pretty optimistic on flows there."

This morning we reported a strong quarter of operating results, sales we're at an all-time high and long-term net new flows improved to $9 billion, due to the continued strength of Global bonds and a pickup in U.S. Equity and Hybrid flows. We did experience some lumpy institutional redemptions during the quarter, but flow trends improved in March. That trend has continued in April, and we continue to see that we're well positioned to benefit from increased investor demand for equities and Hybrid funds.

One is a lot of the projects that we're working on are capitalized, so you have to wait until its completed and then it will come through in depreciation expense. And two, there have been a lot of efficiencies realized in this fiscal year, particularly due to some strategic decisions we've made on the technology side. For example, bringing the data center in house. We're kind of recognizing some of those savings earlier than we thought. So that's been maybe keeping the expense line static instead of increasing what we thought. But the message is the same.

And then I think more importantly for the longer-term trend is all of the new platforms that we've introduced those funds to in the last 6 months and the defined contribution tends to be a steadier place to go and that's probably where the battle's won and lost as far as equity funds go. So our metric was getting them on as many platforms over the last year when equities were out of favor. And now when you're see things come back, they're doing very well.

And if you look at Templeton and with really a value bias if you look at them relative, it's all international equity funds, they were under performing. Now that's turned around dramatically since that decision was made by those sovereign wealth funds to switch over. I'm not sure where the monies went going passive or they're active, but it was performance-related to the Templeton lag. Now that's really over the last 3 months it turned around dramatically. And you could see most of the Templeton funds now are in the top first or second quartile, including the 3-year number that moved quickly. And at that same time we were winning global equity mandates at the same time that, that redemption was made. So I don't think you can draw any conclusions that, that happens. These funds tend to move monies around a little bit quicker than, say, your average. So when you do have downturns and short-term performance, you're vulnerable. As far as the global equity flows go outside of the U.S., you're right, the big driver's been Asian growth and that trailed off during the quarter. And I think the reason there is really the backup in rates and the January effect on emerging markets. And overall, those markets underperformed the overall MSCI during the quarter. And again, those tend to be more short-term performance-related, and I would think that, that would be coming back now."

But the bottom line is, we don't see that turning around quickly. It's better -- performance has been better. It was positive for the quarter overall for munis. So that's positive and whether it settles down, I think it should, but you still run that risk of headlines everyday and budgets being battle, and that's just going to put headwind into muni flows. International equity, I mean, the issue, the core strength of our franchise around Franklin -- around the Templeton side has with its larger cap value bias and less energy in material waiting has hurt relative performance. Now the good news today is the dollar's been weak, they don't hedge anything. The move in the last quarter into Europe and other places where they've been overweighted that's hurt performance has helped performance here and helped it dramatically. So that's turned around quickly. It's hard to sell when you're third and fourth quartile. But now that we're back into first and second, hopefully we can see some turn around there quickly on the retail side. And mutual's been steady and positive. And Mutual European and Mutual Discovery continue to be steady as far as inflows go. And again, hopefully that'll continue."

Are you getting any sense of either owner fatigue or buyer fatigue? The fund performance remains really good, but the net sales peaked last year in kind of the March and June quarters and gross redemption seems to be creeping higher. So any sense of fatigue? And do you think sales number kind of stabilize here or do you think they continue to decline from very strong levels?"

So that puts pressure on the overall net number. But I'd looked at -- the story to me is the strength of the Global Total Return fund and how quickly that's grown in $2.5 billion of net inflows into that fund the last quarter. So while you could argue maybe the Global bond has slowed a little bit, but you can certainly say the Global Total Return has become very meaningful, and that's even a bigger market than the Global Bond because it not only has sovereign debt, but has Corporate bonds in there. And that's had excellent performance and we're continuing to see strong interest there. And I think, again, any country that's concerned about their currency, whether it's U.S. or the euro, are going to be very interested in Global bonds and that's certainly getting more headlines I would argue today than ever. So I still am pretty optimistic on flows there."

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to be reporting another very strong quarter of operating results amidst what remains a volatile macroeconomic environment. Mos",1018,"Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to be reporting another very strong quarter of operating results amidst what remains a volatile macroeconomic environment. Most importantly, long-term investment performance remains strong across equity and fixed-income strategies and areas that have been under for performing the short term have improved. 
Performance, coupled with the debt and breadth of our global advisor relationships, translated into another quarter of record net flows led by the continued strength of our global fixed-income franchise. We continue execute our long-term strategy of investing in those areas that are complementary to our existing business and strengthen our capabilities in key markets. 
During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Balanced Equity Management, a well-respected institutional manager in Australia. The acquisition closed in early July and is consistent with our strategy to address home country investing by us with local asset management capabilities in key international markets. Assets under management ended the quarter at $734 billion slightly below May's reported high due to the June pullback in equity markets. Average AUM increased almost 6% to $727 billion. The strength of fixed-income flows combined with the pullback in equity markets in June caused the slight mix shift in AUM by investment objective away from equities towards fixed income. The overall attribution of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged from March, but Europe and Asia continue to be the fastest-growing regions for us, thanks to continued success in countries such as Italy, Switzerland and Taiwan. 
Turning to Slide 8. Net new flows outpaced market appreciation for the second time in the last 5 quarters. Long-term sales reached a new high, as well as this quarter, but the decrease in redemptions was the key driver of improved new flows. Redemptions have been running higher in the past 2 quarters due to some larger than normal institutional redemption activity that we discussed on previous calls. Long-term sales were strong in both the U.S. and internationally. While the Templeton Global Bond Fund remains our best-selling fund in the U.S. and abroad, our global total return fund continues to gain momentum with over $5 billion of net new flows this quarter from the U.S. in CCAP fund. In addition, this quarter, we saw a further diversification of global fixed-income flows from merging markets debt in Asian bond funds attracting a combined $1 billion of net new flows. 
In the U.S., redemptions from our municipal bond funds slowed throughout the quarter. Net outflows totaled $900 million compared to a peak of $3.5 billion in the prior quarter with a few funds returning to positive flows. We continue to actively communicate our perspective on immunity market to financial advisors to help them allay investor concerns, and our straight talk client use immunity brain chart has been one of our most viewed ever. 
Our U.S. institutional business continued to trend up net positive new flows with several new fundings in global equity mandates. More recently, the team is focused on promoting alternative strategies with roadshows highlighting private equity strategies managed by the global fixed-income and emerging markets equity team, as well as hosting a well-received emerging markets real estate roundtable in Chicago. 
Our international business continues to generate impressive growth on our CCAP range of funds of close to $150 billion in AUM at quarter end. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to have success across Europe and Asia and believe that our global presence will continue to be a key driver of future growth. 
One of the success stories has been Malaysia, with $2 billion in AUM and almost 1/3 of that coming from Sharia Investments for Islamic investors. It's been one of our fastest-growing countries, nearly tripling in the past year. We plan to add 3 Sharia funds to our CCAP range in the near future and will register some of our CCAP funds in Malaysia where the retail market to foreign asset managers. 
Turning to Slide 10. Overall equity outflows slowed during the quarter. However, flows were positive in April and May, with flow reversing course in June as the market pulled back and the industry experienced increased redemptions. Long-term sales of both global and U.S. Equity funds declined due to market volatility, but redemptions from global equity had a much more significant decrease from last quarter, and we had a slight in institutional redemptions from sovereign wealth of clients of near $5 billion. Addition to profit-taking we saw last quarter from Asian Growth Fund reversed net funded strong positive net new flows for this quarter. U.S. equity funds saw a modest increase in redemption activity, but funds that have been attracting flows such as the Franklin growth, rising dividends, U.S. opportunities remain in inflows although at a slower pace. We continue to promote the value of long-term investment and equity funds the financial advisors through the global, the new core, which is an expansion of our 2020 vision campaign. Hybrid net new flows were $1.6 billion, a bit of a decrease from last quarter as it did see a slowing of flows to the Franklin Income Fund that attracted $800 million in net new flows between the U.S. and CCAP funds. In April, we launched a new balance strategy to leverage the strengths of our global fixed income and emerging market teams. The Templeton Emerging Markets Balanced Fund was added to our CCAP lineup and is comanaged by Dr. Michael Hassenstub and Dr. Mark Mobius. Core fixed income flows continue to be very strong with net new flows of $20 billion, as I already explained. 
Overall, relative investment performance remains strong, and we saw improvement in the percent of assets in the top 2 quartiles across all the periods. The most significant change from last quarter was the relative performance of the 5-year period due mostly to Templeton growth and each mutual shares performance improvements. Short-term performance from mutual series and our muni funds remain under pressure, however, both have experienced improving performance in recent months. I'll now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

The strength of the company continues to be reflected in operating results this quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $683 million, which was an 8% increase from the second quarter and a 31% increase from the prior year. Net income for the quarter was flat from quarter 2 at $503 million, but earnings per share increased slightly to $2.26. 
Our share repurchase program continues to enhance our earnings growth on a per share basis by driving the share count down over time. Investment management fees increased 6% this quarter, slightly more than the increase in average assets under management due to 1 more day and $1.7 million of additional performance fees. This was partially offset by slightly lower effect of fee rate that was due to 2 factors. The first was a slight mix shift to fixed income and no change in sales region mix this quarter that highlighted Greg earlier. And the second was that daily average assets under management, which most of our fees are calculated on was a bit lower than the simple monthly average assets under management for the quarter. Looking forward, I want to remind everybody that we did cause on Balance Equity Management acquisition in early July and their assets under management during to lower effective fee rate than the mix we reported to due to the size and nature of their client accounts. And that acquisition will have a small impact on the reported effective fee rate going forward. 
Additionally, in July, Darby's Emerging Market Fund saw its most successful private equity investments to date returning more than 15x its original investment. And in conjunction with the sale, we now expect to earn about $48 million in carried interest, which will between Franklin and the team, which is consistent of imagery practices, and that will drive both performance fees and compensation and general and administrative expenses higher next quarter. Sales and distribution fees increased 6%, consistent with the increase in average assets under management and with sales. The asset base fee that comprises 69% of this line item increased almost 7% due to increased average assets under management and the 1 additional day in the quarter. Sales component increased 4.5% due to the increase in gross sales that made up 11% of total sales. Shareholder servicing fees were $77.5 million, an increase of 2%, which is less than the increase in billboard accounts. Two things contribute to that: first, with the normal mix shift between open and closed accounts that experience throughout the year; and second, is what we've experienced a number of conversions to omnibus accounts that earn lower fees. During the quarter, we purchased 272,000 Canadian closed accounts, and in July, we purchased 2.2 million U.S. accounts that will be reflected in the fourth quarter results. Other net revenue increased $2.4 million dollars this quarter due mostly to increased investment income from consolidated sponsored investment products. Operating expenses increased 4%, which is less than the 6% increase in revenue. Sales, distribution and marketing expense increased 6%, about 70% of this expense is driven by changes in assets under management with just over half coming from outside the United States. 
The asset base component increased 7% to $505 million, and the sales base component also increased 7% to $177 million. The average sales commission decreased 7% to about $38 million. Compensation and benefits was $340 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter as increased salaries and incentive compensation were more than upset by lower payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect this line to increase about 3% to 4%, reflecting increased headcount, that's up 4% since March. And in addition to that, about 1/2 of the expense associated with splitting carried interest with Darby team competition and benefits will run through other expenses. Information systems and technology and occupancy expenses were both relatively flat compared with last quarter, but we do expect technology expense to increase to a level similar to what we saw last September as projects get completed and are expensed in the fourth quarter. General and administrative and other expenses normalized as expected following the large insurance recovery in the prior quarter. Other income was $4.4 million this quarter, a $45 million increase from last quarter. But as you can see from the chart on Slide 17, the impact of consolidated variable interest entities cause designed to be lower, and I'm sure most of you expecting. Please keep in mind that those losses are reversed in the noncontrolling interest line. Otherwise, the biggest difference in the last quarter was about $17 million less of gains from available for sale investments. Gains and losses on the sale of available for sale investments have been running higher than normal in recent quarters and that's due to a blend of reallocating CCAP investment and the rebalancing of some of our corporate investments. Interest expense was a little higher this month due to a modest increase in our tax reserves. 
Turning to Slide 18. The effective tax rate for the quarter came in higher-than-expected due to increase in the fiscal year-to-date rate to 29.1%. The rates been fairly consistent for the past 4 years. We do experience quarterly volatility as foreign service earnings fluctuate. The operating margin for the quarter was 36.8%. Cash and investments was $8.7 billion at June 30, including about $1 billion from variable interest entities. And we repurchased another 1.6 million shares this quarter, decreasing shares outstanding to 220.4 million. Pay ratio for the quarter was 51%, and we remain committed to returning substantial portion of free cash flow to shareholders over time. However, a substantial portion of cash and investments is invested offshore and is used to see new products and is not currently available for repurchase or dividends. And that concludes our commentary on the third quarter results. As always, if you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations or corporate communications. The contact information is located in the presentation and in the press release."

Mos",1027,"Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to be reporting another very strong quarter of operating results amidst what remains a volatile macroeconomic environment. Most importantly, long-term investment performance remains strong across equity and fixed-income strategies, and areas that have been underperforming in the short term have improved. 
Performance, coupled with the debt and breadth of our global advisor relationships, translated into another quarter of record net flows led by the continued strength of our global fixed income franchise. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy of investing in those areas that are complementary to our existing business and strengthen our capabilities in key markets. 
During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Balanced Equity Management, a well respected institutional manager in Australia. The acquisition closed in early July and is consistent with our strategy to address home country investing buys, with local asset management capabilities in key international markets. 
Assets under management ended the quarter at $734 billion, slightly below May's reported high due to the June pullback in equity markets. Average AUM increased almost 6% to $727 billion. The strength of fixed income flows combined with the pullback in equity markets in June caused the slight mix shift in AUM by investment objective, away from equities towards fixed income. The overall attribution of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged from March, but Europe and Asia continue to be the fastest-growing regions for us, thanks to continued success in countries such as Italy, Switzerland and Taiwan. 
Turning to Slide 8. Net new flows outpaced market appreciation for the second time in the last 5 quarters. Long-term sales reached a new high, as well this quarter, but the decrease in redemptions was the key driver of improved net new flows. Redemptions had been running higher the past 2 quarters due to some larger-than-normal institutional redemption activity that we've discussed on previous calls. 
Long-term sales were strong in both the U.S. and internationally. While the Templeton Global Bond Fund remains our best-selling fund in the U.S. and abroad, our global total return fund continues to gain momentum with over $5 billion of net new flows this quarter from the U.S. and SICAV funds. In addition, this quarter, we saw further diversification of global fixed income flows from emerging markets debt in Asian bond funds, attracting a combined $1 billion of net new flows. 
In the U.S., redemptions from our municipal bond funds slowed throughout the quarter. Net new outflows totaled $900 million compared to a peak of $3.5 billion in the prior quarter, with the few funds returning to positive flows. We continue to actively communicate our perspective on the muni market to financial advisors to help them allay investor concerns. And our straight-talk, client-used muni brain chart has been one of our most viewed ever. 
Our U.S. institutional business continued the trend  of net positive new flows with several new fundings in global equity mandates. More recently, the team is focused on promoting alternative strategies with roadshows highlighting private equity strategies managed by the global fixed income and emerging markets equity team, as well as hosting a well received emerging markets real estate roundtable in Chicago. 
Our international business continues to generate impressive growth and our SICAV range of funds approached $150 billion in AUM at quarter end. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to have success across Europe and Asia and believe that our global presence will continue to be a key driver of future growth. 
One of those success stories has been Malaysia, with $2 billion in AUM, and almost 1/3 of that coming from Shariah investments for Islamic investors. It's been one of our fastest-growing countries, nearly tripling in the past year. We plan to add 3 Shariah funds to our SICAV range in the near future and will register some of our SICAV funds in Malaysia, where the retail market has recently been opened to foreign asset managers. 
Turning to Slide 10. Overall equity outflows slowed during the quarter. However, flows were positive in April and May, with flow reversing course in June, as the market pulled back and the industry experienced increased redemptions. Long-term sales of both global and U.S. equity funds declined due to market volatility, but redemptions from global equity had a much more significant decrease from last quarter, when we had a spike in institutional redemptions from sovereign wealth clients of near $5 billion. 
In addition, the profit-taking we saw last quarter from the Asian Growth Fund reversed and that funded strong positive net new flows for this quarter. U.S. equity funds saw a modest increase in redemption activity, but funds that have been attracting flows such as the Franklin growth, rising dividends and U.S. opportunities remained in inflows, although at a slower pace. 
We continue to promote the value of long-term investment and equity funds to financial advisors through the global, the new core theme [ph], which is an extension of our 2020 Vision campaign. Hybrid net new flows were $1.6 billion, a bit of a decrease from last quarter as we did see a slowing of flows to the Franklin Income Fund that attracted $800 million in net new flows between the U.S. and SICAV funds. 
In April, we launched a new balance strategy to leverage the strengths of our global fixed income and emerging market teams. The Templeton Emerging Markets balanced fund was added to our SICAV lineup and is comanaged by Dr. Michael Hassenstub and Dr. Mark Mobius. Core fixed income flows continue to be very strong with net new flows of $20 billion, as I already explained. 
Overall, relative investment performance remains strong, and we saw improvement in the percent of assets in the top 2 quartiles across all the periods. The most significant change from the last quarter was the relative performance of the 5-year period, due mostly to Templeton growth and mutual shares performance improvements. Short-term performance from mutual series in our muni funds remain under pressure. However, both have experienced improving performance in recent months. I'll now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

This was partially offset by slightly lower effect of fee rate that was due to 2 factors: The first was a slight mix shift to fixed income and no change in sales region mix this quarter that Greg highlighted earlier; and the second was that daily average assets under management, which most of our fees are calculated on, was a bit lower than the simple monthly average assets under management for the quarter. 
Looking forward, I want to remind everybody that we did close on Balance Equity Management acquisition in early July, and their assets under management do have a materially lower effective fee rate than the mix we've reported today due to the size and nature of their client accounts. And that acquisition will have a small impact on the reported effective fee rate going forward. 
Additionally, in July, Darby's emerging market fund sold its most successful private equity investments to date, returning more than 15x its original investment. And in conjunction with this sale, we now expect to earn about $48 million in carried interest, which will be split between Franklin and the team, which is consistent with industry practices, and that will drive both performance fees and compensation and general and administrative expenses higher next quarter. 
Sales and distribution fees increased 6%, consistent with the increase in average assets under management and with sales. The asset base fee that comprises 69% of this line item increased almost 7% due to increased average assets under management and the one additional day in the quarter. Sales component increased 4.5% due to the increase in commissionable gross sales that made up 11% of total sales. 
Shareholder servicing fees were $77.5 million, an increase of 2%, which is less than the increase in billable accounts. Two things contribute to that: First, with the normal mix shift between open and closed accounts that we experienced throughout the year; and second, is what we've experienced a number of conversions to omnibus accounts that earn lower fees.  During the quarter, we purchased 272,000 Canadian closed accounts, and in July, we purchased 2.2 million U.S. accounts that will be reflected in the fourth quarter results. 
Other net revenue increased $2.4 million this quarter due mostly to increased investment income from consolidated sponsored investment products. Operating expenses increased 4%, which is less than the 6% increase in revenue. Sales, distribution and marketing expense increased 6%, about 70% of this expense is driven by changes in assets under management, with just over half coming from outside the United States.  The asset base component increased 7% to $505 million, and the sales base component also increased 7% to $177 million. The amortization of deferred sales commission decreased 7% to about $38 million. 
Compensation and benefits was $340 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter, as increased salaries and incentive compensation were more than offset by lower payroll taxes and employee benefit's expenses.  Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect this line to increase about 3% to 4%, reflecting increased headcount that's up 4% since March. And in addition to that, about 1/2 of the expense associated with splitting carried interest with the Darby team will through a compensation and benefits, while the other 1/2 will through other expenses. 
Information systems and technology and occupancy expenses were both relatively flat compared with last quarter, but we do expect technology expense to increase to a level similar to what we saw last September, as projects get completed and are expensed in the fourth quarter. 
General, administrative and other expenses normalized as expected following the large insurance recovery in the prior quarter. Other income was $4.4 million this quarter, a $45 million decrease from last quarter. But as you can see from the chart on Slide 17, the impact of consolidated variable interest entities cause this line to be lower, and I'm sure most of you expecting. Please keep in mind that those losses are reversed in the noncontrolling interest line. Otherwise, the biggest difference from last quarter was about $17 million less of gains from available-for-sale investments. 
Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments had been running higher than normal in recent quarters and that's due to a blend of reallocating SICAV investment and the rebalancing of some of our corporate investments. Interest expense was a little higher this month due to a modest increase in our tax reserve. 
Turning to Slide 18. The effective tax rate for the quarter came in higher than expected due to an increase in the fiscal year-to-date rate to 29.1%. The rate's been fairly consistent for the past 4 years. We do experience quarterly volatility as foreign service earnings fluctuate. 
The operating margin for the quarter was 36.8%. Cash and investments was $8.7 billion at June 30, including about $1 billion from variable interest entities. And we repurchased another 1.6 million shares this quarter, decreasing shares outstanding to $220.4 million. Payout ratio for the quarter was 51%, and we remain committed to returning substantial portion of free cash flow to shareholders over time.  However, a substantial portion of cash and investments is invested offshore and is used to see new products and is not currently available for repurchase or dividends.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to be reporting another very strong quarter of operating results amidst what remains a volatile macroeconomic environment. Mos",1025,"Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to be reporting another very strong quarter of operating results amidst what remains a volatile macroeconomic environment. Most importantly, long-term investment performance remains strong across equity and fixed-income strategies, and areas that have been underperforming in the short term have improved. 
Performance, coupled with the depth and breadth of our global advisor relationships, translated into another quarter of record net flows led by the continued strength of our global fixed income franchise. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy of investing in those areas that are complementary to our existing business and strengthen our capabilities in key markets. 
During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Balanced Equity Management, a well-respected institutional manager in Australia. The acquisition closed in early July and is consistent with our strategy to address home country investing buys with local asset management capabilities in key international markets. 
Assets under management ended the quarter at $734 billion, slightly below May's reported high due to the June pullback in equity markets. Average AUM increased almost 6% to $727 billion. The strength of fixed income flows combined with the pullback in equity markets in June caused a slight mix shift in AUM by investment objective, away from equities towards fixed income. The overall attribution of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged from March, but Europe and Asia continue to be the fastest-growing regions for us, thanks to continued success in countries such as Italy, Switzerland and Taiwan. 
Turning to Slide 8. Net new flows outpaced market appreciation for the second time in the last 5 quarters. Long-term sales reached a new high as well this quarter, but the decrease in redemptions was the key driver of improved net new flows. Redemptions had been running higher the past 2 quarters due to some larger-than-normal institutional redemption activity that we've discussed on previous calls. 
Long-term sales were strong in both the U.S. and internationally. While the Templeton Global Bond Fund remains our best-selling fund in the U.S. and abroad, our global total return fund continues to gain momentum with over $5 billion of net new flows this quarter from the U.S. and SICAV funds. In addition, this quarter we saw further diversification of global fixed income flows from emerging markets debt in Asian bond funds, attracting a combined $1 billion of net new flows. 
In the U.S., redemptions from our municipal bond funds slowed throughout the quarter. Net new outflows totaled $900 million compared to a peak of $3.5 billion in the prior quarter, with a few funds returning to positive flows. We continue to actively communicate our perspective on the muni market to financial advisors to help them allay investor concerns, and our straight-talk, client-used muni brain chart has been one of our most viewed ever. 
Our U.S. institutional business continued the trend of net positive new flows with several new fundings in global equity mandates. More recently, the team is focused on promoting alternative strategies with roadshows highlighting private equity strategies managed by the global fixed income and emerging markets equity team, as well as hosting a well-received emerging markets real estate roundtable in Chicago. 
Our international business continues to generate impressive growth and our SICAV range of funds approached $150 billion in AUM at quarter end. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to have success across Europe and Asia and believe that our global presence will continue to be a key driver of future growth. 
One of those success stories has been Malaysia, with $2 billion in AUM, and almost 1/3 of that coming from Shariah investments for Islamic investors. It's been one of our fastest-growing countries, nearly tripling in the past year. We plan to add 3 Shariah funds to our SICAV range in the near future and will register some of our SICAV funds in Malaysia, where the retail market has recently been opened to foreign asset managers. 
Turning to Slide 10. Overall equity outflows slowed during the quarter. However, flows were positive in April and May before reversing course in June, as the market pulled back and the industry experienced increased redemptions. Long-term sales of both global and U.S. equity funds declined due to market volatility, but redemptions from global equity had a much more significant decrease from last quarter, when we had a spike in institutional redemptions from sovereign wealth clients of near $5 billion. 
In addition, the profit taking we saw last quarter from the Asian Growth Fund reversed and that funded strong positive net new flows for this quarter. U.S. equity funds saw a modest increase in redemption activity, but funds that have been attracting flows such as the Franklin growth, rising dividends and U.S. opportunities remained in inflows, although at a slower pace. 
We continue to promote the value of long-term investment and equity funds to financial advisors through the GLOBAL - THE NEW CORE theme, which is an extension of our 2020 Vision campaign. Hybrid net new flows were $1.6 billion, a bit of a decrease from last quarter as we did see a slowing of flows to the Franklin Income Fund that attracted $800 million in net new flows between the U.S. and SICAV funds. 
In April, we launched a new balance strategy to leverage the strengths of our global fixed income and emerging market teams. The Templeton Emerging Markets balanced fund was added to our SICAV lineup and is co-managed by Dr. Michael Hassenstub and Dr. Mark Mobius. Core fixed income flows continue to be very strong with net new flows of $20 billion, as I already explained. 
Overall, relative investment performance remains strong, and we saw improvement in the percent of assets in the top 2 quartiles across all the periods. The most significant change from the last quarter was the relative performance of the 5-year period, due mostly to Templeton growth and mutual shares performance improvements. Short-term performance from mutual series in our muni funds remain under pressure. However, both have experienced improving performance in recent months. 
I'll now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

The strength of the company continues to be reflected in operating results this quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $683 million, which was an 8% increase from the second quarter and a 31% increase from the prior year.

The asset base component increased 7% to $505 million, and the sales base component also increased 7% to $177 million. The amortization of deferred sales commission decreased 7% to about $38 million. 
Compensation and benefits was $314 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter, as increased salaries and incentive compensation were more than offset by lower payroll taxes and employee benefit's expenses.  Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect this line to increase about 3% to 4%, reflecting increased headcount that's up 4% since March. And in addition to that, about 1/2 of the expense associated with splitting carried interest with the Darby team will run through compensation and benefits, while the other 1/2 will run through other expenses. 
Information systems and technology and occupancy expenses were both relatively flat compared with last quarter, but we do expect technology expense to increase to a level similar to what we saw last September, as projects get completed and are expensed in the fourth quarter. 
General, administrative and other expenses normalized as expected following the large insurance recovery in the prior quarter.

I think some of the pressure in prior quarters, we've seen the dramatic turnaround in Templeton's performance, has taken some of the pressure off the institutional accounts where we had we had some large redemptions 2 quarters ago. So we don't see any of that activity. We actually saw some increases to existing accounts over the quarter. I think the activity was pretty consistent with what we've seen, as well as the pipeline. It seems the global aggregates and some low duration type fixed income. Some specialty China equities and India equities, nothing really unusual. So global equity continues to probably lead the number of searches, as well as global aggregate and the pipeline now still looks relatively good. I think the positive development, as I've mentioned, is just the Templeton turnaround. That's where the majority of institutional assets are. I think on the alternative side, you're probably referring to maybe the global summits effort and the hedge fund that we've been talking about with our global bond group. And that's something we are out there talking about, and the there a longer lead time. And in that category, we don't expect to get the large assets quickly, but it is getting a positive reception out there. And outside of that, I think it's really the development on the retail side of these asset allocation funds using some alternatives within them that, hopefully, will be well-received in the retail channel."

First, you have the consolidated densities that had much bigger negative this quarter. And most of that is offset on the, below the net income line for the noncontrolling interests. If you look at -- there's been no real change in even year-over-year on the core dividend interest category, which is, I guess, roughly around $10 million the quarter. And then the rest of that variability is either due to the accounting or the markets, or resulting from gains that we take. So there's 2 things that drives the variability, there's the mark-to-market. And we have, it's in the file about $900 million of trading securities that will get marked and which kind of show you what category investments therein.

Peter was a member of the Franklin Resources Board of Directors since 1993, a 17-year tenure on our board, gave us great perspective as he helped guide our business, strategy and culture. He will be missed by all who had the honor of working with him. 
And now I'd like to open it up for your questions."

I think some of the pressure in prior quarters, we seem -- the dramatic turnaround in Templeton's performance has taken some of the pressure off the institutional accounts, where we had we had some large redemptions 2 quarters ago. So we don't see any of that activity. We actually saw some increases to existing accounts over the quarter. I think the activity was pretty consistent with what we've seen as well as the pipeline. It seems the global aggregates, some low duration type fixed income, some specialty China equities and India equities, nothing really unusual. So global equity continues to probably lead the number of searches as well as global aggregate, and the pipeline now still looks relatively good. And I think we -- I think the positive development, as I mentioned, is just the Templeton turnaround. That's where the majority of the institutional assets are. I think on the alternative side, you're probably referring to maybe the global summits effort and the hedge fund that we've been talking about with our global bond group. And that's something we are out there talking about, and it was a longer lead time in that category. We don't expect to get large assets quickly, but it is getting a positive reception out there. And outside of that, I think it's really the development on the retail side of these asset allocation funds using some alternatives within them that hopefully will be well received in the retail channel."

So they tend to offset. And on balance, the profitability tends to be the same. The mix between -- in this quarter, between the U.S. non-U.S. really didn't change that much. So in terms of the distribution margin, it wasn't too much of a change. But it depends how you're calculating distribution margin.

And we -- I think if you look at the world and what money funds are paying today and then you couple that with the concern over your own currency or your own sovereign debt and you may have individuals and high net worth investors that have a lot invested in their own sovereign debt, in markets like Italy, where we've seen tremendous growth over the last couple of years, it's just the way for those high net worth investors to diversify some of the more conservative holdings. And I think we've been in a key position because we've had good relationships with the big banks and those that represent a lot of those high net worth investors. And obviously, you've had very strong consistent performance with that group, and that's really led to those flows. And that's why I think that that trend should continue in the near-term because I don't think any of the debt noise and all the sovereign debt issues that are out there are going to go away any time soon. And that's been the case in the U.S. as well, where it's a relatively new category for the retail investor. People are concerned about rates going up. People are concerned about the economy. And this is somewhat of an alternative asset class, where they can get gains from growth in other economies and other stronger currencies. So again, it's just a way to diversify a lower risk in a portfolio, and it's gone from 0 to some percentage. It's still very low in the average holder and one that we think will continue to grow. But it's the areas in Europe where Switzerland, we're always seeing in the growth as well as Italy for the European market and then obviously a lot of it here in the United States."

I mean, that's the big portion of your net number. But on a gross basis, it's not nearly as concerning when you look at the amount being sold in all the other areas. So I think the key strengths, and you know better than I, the flows in the industry and the pressure, the traditional equity, managers are under and especially domestic equity managers, you can have very strong gross sales and still have fairly large net redemptions. And that's been a headwind for everyone. So we have been consistent about pounding the message in on our other funds. We feel like we're making good headway, we're making progress in market share, but that's not going to show up on a net flow number until those flows really turn around the other way. So I don't -- I'm not that concerned. I think I still feel there's things that get lost in a shuffle. I mean, we've raised $1 billion in Shariah compliant funds. We're offering new funds there. That's an exciting new area for us. We talked about tactical asset allocation. That's another huge category that we think we could get a nice momentum. And I think that the seeds that we planted in place with the long-term records on the Franklin growth funds should put us in great position when that turns around.

I think some of the pressure in prior quarters, we seem -- the dramatic turnaround in Templeton's performance has taken some of the pressure off the institutional accounts, where we had we had some large redemptions 2 quarters ago. So we don't see any of that activity. We actually saw some increases to existing accounts over the quarter. I think the activity was pretty consistent with what we've seen as well as the pipeline. It seems the global aggregates, some low duration type fixed income, some specialty China equities and India equities, nothing really unusual. So global equity continues to probably lead the number of searches as well as global aggregate, and the pipeline now still looks relatively good. And we  -- I think the positive development, as I mentioned, is just the Templeton turnaround. That's where the majority of the institutional assets are. I think on the alternative side, you're probably referring to maybe the global summits effort and the hedge fund that we've been talking about with our global bond group. And that's something we are out there talking about, and it was a longer lead time in that category. We don't expect to get large assets quickly, but it is getting a positive reception out there.

And we -- I think if you look at the world and what money funds are paying today and then you couple that with the concern over your own currency or your own sovereign debt and you may have individuals and high net worth investors that have a lot invested in their own sovereign debt, in markets like Italy, where we've seen tremendous growth over the last couple of years, it's just a way for those high net worth investors to diversify some of the more conservative holdings. And I think we've been in a key position because we've had good relationships with the big banks and those that represent a lot of those high net worth investors. And obviously, you've had very strong consistent performance with that group, and that's really led to those flows. And that's why I think that that trend should continue in the near-term because I don't think any of the debt noise and all the sovereign debt issues that are out there are going to go away any time soon. And that's been the case in the U.S. as well, where it's a relatively new category for the retail investor. People are concerned about rates going up. People are concerned about the economy. And this is somewhat of an alternative asset class, where they can get gains from growth in other economies and other stronger currencies. So again, it's just a way to diversify in lower risk in a portfolio, and it's gone from 0 to some percentage. It's still very low in the average holder and one that we think will continue to grow. But it's the areas in Europe where Switzerland, we're always seeing the growth as well as Italy for the European market and then obviously a lot of it here in the United States."

And when you get in difficult markets, like we've had over the last few years, we think it's one of the big reasons why we've been able to come out of that stronger than we came into it. And it is important to clients to have that strong balance sheet because they don't really want to invest in companies where they're worried about how they're going to survive a big downturn in the market. So I think that's an intangible that still is very important in why we will always generally be looked at as too conservative on the balance sheet. But I think the board is still going to look at tax issues and things, and all those things around a special dividend are always out there."

And that's been a headwind for everyone. So we have been consistent about pounding the message in on our other funds. We feel like we're making good headway, we're making progress in market share, but that's not going to show up on a net flow number until those flows really turn around the other way. So I don't -- I'm not that concerned. I think I still feel there's things that get lost in the shuffle. I mean, we've raised $1 billion in Shariah compliant funds. We're offering new funds there.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was overall a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows for the year to almost $37 b",1480,"Welcome to the fourth quarter commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was overall a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows for the year to almost $37 billion, one of our best years ever despite heightened market volatility over the past quarter. 
Long term sales for the year exceeded $200 billion for the first time with the more than 50% coming from non-U.S. sources. That success was reflected in our operating results as revenues exceeded $7.1 billion and operating income and earnings per share rose 36% for the year.  Driving those results was a growth in operating revenue of 22% with expenses increasing 15%. The greatest source of our organic asset growth continued to be our global Fixed Income business with $11 billion in net new flows for the quarter. Equity markets continue to be under pressure amidst negative market sentiments following the downgrade of the U.S. Treasury debt rating and the increasing concerns related to sovereign debt in the Eurozone. 
Most importantly, our long-term investment performance rankings have remained strong in this market environment with the majority of our assets ranking in Lippers first quartile over the past 10 years. Strategically, we have continued to expand our global presence in key markets, including the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management, which closed in July and the continued integration of U.K.-based Rensberg under the Franklin Templeton brand. In addition to expanding our capabilities across the globe, we continue to strengthen our presence in existing markets. We launched several new funds to meet evolving investor demand and extend our product lineup, particularly in technical asset allocation and won several new sovereign and institutional mandates this quarter. 
Overall, relative investment performance remains solid across our equity and fixed income strategies. Over the past 2 months, there's been increased retention focused on the short-term underperformance of some of our global bond strategies due primarily to the rally in long dated U.S. Treasuries and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and yen relative to other currencies held in those portfolios. This is not the first time this strategy has experienced a period of short-term underperformance. But over the long term, it has delivered outstanding risk adjusted return relative to its peers. 
We're also encouraged at the funds recent rebound in relative performance over the past few weeks. I'd also like to remind everyone that 40% of our fixed income assets under management are in U.S. products where several of our funds benefited from the rally in Treasuries. This diversification continues to offer our clients many appealing investment options and cross-selling opportunities for our sales teams. 
Our assets under management were up 2% for the year but we were not immune to the downturn in global markets seen in recent months. This is evidenced by a 10% decrease in AUM to $659.9 billion for the quarter, average AUM also decreased to 2% to $714.4 billion. Positive fixed income flows combined with the continued slump in equity markets continued to drive the mix in AUM by investment objective towards fixed income. The mix of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged from June, but Europe and Asia continued to be the fastest-growing regions for us. Despite industry outflows in Italy and Germany, Italy remained our top selling non-U.S. market this quarter followed by Hong Kong and Germany. 
Turning to Slide 10, the decrease in AUM since June was due almost entirely to market depreciation of $87.6 billion. Net new flows remained positive at $3.1 billion. Though the part of the summer was clearly more favorable as market turmoil impacted flows later in the quarter. Long-term sales dropped 8% this quarter but increased 4% versus the quarter a year ago. Lower net new flows resulted from a combination of declining long-term gross sales and increasing redemptions in retail funds through the second half of the quarter, as well as a few large institutional redemptions. 
Long-term sales were once again strongest in global fixed income this quarter. The Templeton Global Bond Fund and the Global Total Return Fund continued to be our best sellers but did suffered net outflows in 1 week late in the quarter. Concerns over a decline in short-term performance drilled these outflows. We believe that most financial advisors who are familiar with the investment strategies for these funds remained confident that when the high levels of market volatility subside and fundamentals once again drive currencies, credit spreads and interest rates, the fund's NAVs will extend their recent recovery. 
While long-term growth sales and other asset classes have generally declined this quarter, sales in our tax refunds have picked up, resulting in decline in net outflows to $300 million for the quarter, the lowest level since the first quarter of the fiscal year. In fact, 10 more funds returned to positive flows. 
Our Institutional business experienced some significant redemptions and new mandates this quarter. In the global equity category, we saw redemptions of $2.7 billion in institutional separate account closures from 5 investors in a variety of global strategies. However this was partially offset by several new institutional mandates and new sovereign and pension fund accounts in both the U.S. and internationally. 
We continue to expand our international product offerings this quarter, including the registration of 11 C Cap funds for sale in Romania. In addition, we completed the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management in July. In the U.K., the former Rensburg Trust have been converted to OIX and will now be actively promoted under the Franklin Templeton Investments brand. We also launched the Global Asset Allocation Fund in July to extend our product lineup in tactical asset allocation. 
Looking a little further along the product development cycle, you can see the potential long-term benefits of these types of investments. The C Cap versions of our Franklin World Perspectives Fund, which we launched near the depths of the financial crisis hit their key 3-year anniversary marks earlier this month, with both top quartile relative performance numbers and exceptional absolute returns since inception. This is a unique product created to leverage the strengths of the firm's local asset management teams around the world by combining our global perspective and local focus within a single portfolio, providing clients with a global growth fund featuring access to both local research and local asset management. 
Overall, we're pleased with our continued sales amount of during this fiscal year. We ended the year with $221 billion in long-term gross sales, a 17% increase over the record-breaking year in 2010. Europe was the largest contributor of assets and net sales with $87 billion and $22 billion respectively. Taiwan remains our largest market in Asia with $21 billion in assets while Hong Kong is closing in on the $10 billion mark. Our business in Malaysia also continues to grow quickly with $2 billion in assets further illustrating the strength and breath of our global business and product offerings. 
Turning to Slide 12, overall equity outflows have steadily increased since March due to the pullback in equity markets and flows have been negative since June as the industry experienced redemptions. Long-term sales of both global and U.S. equity funds declined in the face of the market turmoil and redemptions from global equity were elevated this quarter due to institutional withdrawals I mentioned earlier. A few funds on the retail side attracted increased sales and net new flows compared to last quarter, most notably the Franklin gold and precious metals and the Franklin India blue-chip funds. But overall, we saw an increase in outflows from retail investors. 
U.S. equity funds saw a continued increase in redemption activity though some funds have been attracting continued debt inflow such as the Franklin growth, rising dividends and Franklin utilities. We continue to promote the value of long-term investment global equity funds to financial advisors and their clients through the GLOBAL - THE NEW CORE theme, which is an extension of our 2020 Vision campaign. We've also focused on maintaining transparent and informative commentaries with advisors and investors, especially following the recent events that led to increased market volatility and have provided commentary with a market perspective from a variety of portfolio managers. 
Hybrid funds, including the Franklin income fund experienced net outflows of $800 million this quarter, primarily due to a variable annuity insurance program redemption. Global international fixed income flows were once again strongly positive for the quarter led by Global Bond and Global Total Return. U.S. fixed income slipped into outflows, the tax-free fixed income net outflows improved significantly with the Franklin Federal Intermediate-term tax-free income fund showing the biggest turnaround in this category.

The strength of the company continues to be reflected in our operating results. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million, a 1% increase from the third quarter and a 35% from the prior year and a record for the company. Net inc",1043,"Okay, thanks, Greg. The strength of the company continues to be reflected in our operating results. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million, a 1% increase from the third quarter and a 35% from the prior year and a record for the company. Net income for the quarter was down 17% from the third quarter at $416 million and earnings per share decreased accordingly to $1.88 due to unrealized mark-to-market losses on various investments, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Net income for the year was $1.9 billion, up 33% from the prior year and earnings per share was $8.62 for the year, up 36% from the prior year. Investment management fees increased 2% for the quarter and included some items requiring explanation. Normalizing the results to exclude these items, results in the 3% decreased in investment management fees, which makes sense given a 2% decrease in average assets under management and a slight reduction to the blended effectively fee rate due to the mixshift towards fixed income that Greg mentioned earlier, as well as the acquisition of Balanced Equity Management in July. 
Balanced Equity Management has a lower effective fee rate due to the size of nature of their client base. Part of the increase in total investment management fee revenue was attributable to an increase in performance face of $47.6 million and that related to the carried interest from the sale of assets from Darby emerging markets fund which we mentioned last quarter. 
It's also worth noting that on October 3, the second and final piece of a previously discussed redemption of a very low and flat fee advisory count was incurred. The first portion of this redemption was reported in the first fiscal quarter of the year and the remaining $11 billion of assets in this account will come out in this month's assets under management release but effect on our earnings should be immaterial as the account was only generating about $2 million of annual revenue. What you should see as a result is a decrease in average assets under management with nearly offsetting the increase in the effectively rate. 
Sales and distribution fees decreased 7% consistent with the decrease in average assets under management and sales. The asset base revenue component, which comprises most of this line declined 2% due to decreased average assets under management and the sales component decreased by 6.8% because of the decrease in U.S. sales, which was partially offset by an increase in international sales. Shareholder servicing fees were $75.5 million, a decrease of 3%, which is less than a decrease in billable accounts due to the July purge of 2.2 million U.S. accounts that we mentioned last quarter. The remaining decrease was attributable to a decline in networking fees due to the conversion of network accounts into omnibus accounts.  Other net revenue was essentially flat for the quarter. 
Now turning to expenses on Slide 16, we can see that they decreased 2% compared with the previous quarter. The decrease of 7% in sales, distribution and marketing expense was consistent with the 7% increase in revenue. Compensation and benefits was $309 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter as increased salaries and incentive compensation were more than offset by lower sick and vacation pay, retirement and commission expenses. 
Information Systems and Technology expenses were up 21% this quarter as projects were expensed is completed in the final quarter of the fiscal year. Occupancy expense was up 10% due to the increases in building maintenance, utility costs and equipment depreciation. General, administrative and other expense was up 32% this quarter largely due to $11.1 million of fees related to the Darby carried interest payments and seasonal increase in advertising and promotional expenses. Now because the relationship between noncontrolling interest and consolidated sponsored investment products and variable interest entities was having some confusion since they impact different parts of the income statement, we've updated Slide 17 to make their relationship clear. Other income net of noncontrolling interests swung to a loss of $68.5 million compared to a gain of almost $30 million last quarter. The primary reason for that change was mark-to-market losses in investment securities. And although we had income from dividends, interest capital gains, gains on available-for-sale investments and positive foreign exchange revaluations, we experienced approximately $160 million of mark-to-market unrealized losses in our equity method and trading investments, consolidated sponsored investment products and consolidated variable interest entities. 
And of course, we seen those marks turn favorable as the market environment has improved recently. Interest expense was a little higher this month due to an increase in our tax reserve. 
Turning to Slide 18. The year-to-date effective tax rate increased 1.5% this quarter, although this rate is higher than we expected, the increase is primarily due to a shift in the net earnings mix towards higher tax jurisdictions as a significant portion of our unrealized losses on investments were in lower tax jurisdictions and that reduced earnings in those jurisdictions as a percentage of taxable income. The annual rate has been fairly consistent over the past 4 years but we do experience quarterly volatility particularly as foreign-sourced earnings fluctuate. 
The operating margin for the quarter was 37.5% and that's roughly flat with the last 4 quarters. Cash and investments was $9.4 billion at September 30, including about $1 billion from variable interest entities. And we repurchased 3.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing shares outstanding to 217.7 million. Note that our 36% year-over-year growth in earnings per share exceeded the growth in net income attributable to the company by approximately 3% due to the benefits of EPS accretion resulting from this program. 
The payout ratio for the quarter was 94% due to the acceleration of repurchase activity as our stock price decreased. We remain committed to returning a substantial portion of free cash flow to shareholders over time. However, a substantial portion of cash and investments is held offshore or used to see new products and may not be available for repurchases or dividends. 
And that concludes our commentary on the fourth quarter results. As always, if you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations or Corporate Communications. Their contact information is located in the presentation and the press release. Thank you."

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was, overall, a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows",1487,"Hello, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was, overall, a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows for the year to almost $37 billion, one of our best years ever, despite heightened market volatility over the past quarter. 
Long term sales for the year exceeded $200 billion for the first time, with more than 50% coming from non-U.S. sources. That success was reflected in our operating results, as revenues exceeded $7.1 billion and operating income and earnings per share rose 36% for the year.  Driving those results was a growth in operating revenue of 22% with expenses increasing 15%. 
The greatest source of our organic asset growth continued to be our global fixed income business with $11 billion in net new flows for the quarter. Equity markets continue to be under pressure amidst negative market sentiments, surrounding global financial markets, following the downgrade of the U.S. Treasury debt rating and the increasing concerns related to sovereign debt in the Eurozone. 
Most importantly, our long-term investment performance rankings have remained strong in this market environment with the majority of our assets ranking in Lipper's first quartile over the past 10 years. Strategically, we have continued to expand our global presence in key markets, including the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management, which closed in July and the continued integration of U.K.-based Rensburg under the Franklin Templeton brand. 
In addition to expanding our capabilities across the globe, we continue to strengthen our presence in existing markets. We launched several new funds to meet evolving investor demand and extend our product lineup, particularly in technical asset allocation and won several new sovereign and institutional mandates this quarter. 
Overall, relative investment performance remains solid across our equity and fixed income strategies. Over the past 2 months, there's been increased retention focused on the short-term underperformance of some of our global bond strategies, due primarily to the rally in long-dated U.S. Treasuries and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and yen relative to other currencies held in those portfolios. This is not the first time a strategy has experienced a period of short-term underperformance. But over the long term, it has delivered outstanding risk-adjusted return relative to its peers. 
We're also encouraged at the fund's recent rebound in relative performance over the past few weeks. I'd also like to remind everyone that 40% of our fixed income assets under management are in U.S. products, where several of our funds benefited from the rally in treasuries. This diversification continues to offer our clients many appealing investment options and cross-selling opportunities for our sales teams. 
Our assets under management were up 2% for the year but we were not immuned to the downturn in global markets seen in recent months. This is evidenced by a 10% decrease in AUM to $659.9 billion for the quarter. Average AUM also decreased 2% to $714.4 billion. Positive fixed income flows combined with the continued slump in equity markets continued to drive the mix in AUM by investment objective towards fixed income. The mix of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged from June, but Europe and Asia continued to be the fastest-growing regions for us. Despite industry outflows in Italy and Germany, Italy remained our top selling non-U.S. market this quarter followed by Hong Kong and Germany. 
Turning to Slide 10. The decrease in AUM since June was due almost entirely to market depreciation of $87.6 billion. Net new flows remained positive at $3.1 billion. Though the early part of the summer was clearly more favorable, as market turmoil impacted flows later in the quarter. Long-term sales dropped to 8% this quarter but increased 4% versus the quarter a year ago. Lower net new flows resulted from a combination of declining long-term gross sales and increasing redemptions in retail funds through the second half of the quarter, as well as a few large institutional redemptions. 
Long-term sales were once again strongest in global fixed income this quarter. The Templeton Global Bond Fund and the Global Total Return Fund continued to be our best sellers but did suffer net outflows in one week late in the quarter. Concerns over a decline in short-term performance drilled these outflows. We believe that most financial advisors, who are familiar with the investment strategy for these funds, remained confident that when the high levels of market volatility subside and fundamentals once again drive currencies, credit spreads and interest rates, the fund's NAVs will extend their recent recovery. 
While long-term growth sales and other asset classes had generally declined this quarter, sales in our tax refunds have picked up, resulting in decline in net outflows to $300 million for the quarter, the lowest level since the first quarter of the fiscal year. In fact, 10 more funds returned to positive flows. 
Our institutional business experienced some significant redemptions and new mandates this quarter. In the global equity category, we saw redemptions of $2.7 billion in institutional separate account closures from 5 investors in a variety of global strategies. However, this was partially offset by several new institutional mandates and new sovereign and pension fund accounts in both the U.S. and internationally. 
We continue to expand our international product offerings this quarter, including the registration of 11 C Cap funds for sale in Romania. In addition, we completed the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management in July. In the U.K., the former Rensburg Unit Trust have been converted to OEIC and will now be actively promoted under the Franklin Templeton Investments brand. We also launched the Global Asset Allocation Fund in July to extend our product lineup in tactical asset allocation. 
Looking a little further along the product development cycle, you can see the potential long-term benefits of these types of investments. The C Cap versions of our Franklin World Perspectives Fund, which we launched near the depths of the financial crisis hit their key 3-year anniversary marks earlier this month, with both top quartile relative performance numbers and exceptional absolute returns since inception. This is a unique product created to leverage the strengths of the firm's local asset management teams around the world by combining our global perspective and local focus within a single portfolio, providing clients with a global growth fund, featuring access to both local research and local asset management. 
Overall, we are pleased with our continued sales momentum during this fiscal year. We ended the year with $221 billion in long-term gross sales, a 17% increase over the record-breaking year in 2010. Europe was the largest contributor of assets and net sales with $87 billion and $22 billion respectively. Taiwan remains our largest market in Asia with $21 billion in assets, while Hong Kong is closing in on the $10 billion mark. Our business in Malaysia also continues to grow quickly with $2 billion in assets further illustrating the strength and breadth of our global business and product offerings. 
Turning to Slide 12. Overall equity outflows have steadily increased since March due to the pullback in equity markets and flows have been negative since June as the industry experienced redemptions. Long-term sales of both global and U.S. equity funds declined in the face of the market turmoil, and redemptions from global equity were elevated this quarter due to institutional withdrawals I mentioned earlier. A few funds on the retail side attracted increased sales and net new flows compared to last quarter, most notably the Franklin Global precious metals and the Franklin India Bluechip funds. But overall, we saw an increase in outflows from retail investors. 
U.S. equity funds saw a continued increase in redemption activity, though some funds have been attracting continued debt inflow such as the Franklin Growth, Rising Dividends and Franklin Utilities. We continue to promote the value of long-term investment in global equity funds to financial advisors and their clients through the GLOBAL - THE NEW CORE theme, which is an extension of our 2020 Vision campaign. We have also focused on maintaining transparent and informative commentaries with advisors and investors, especially following the recent events that led to increased market volatility and have provided commentary with market perspective from a variety of portfolio managers. 
Hybrid funds, including the Franklin Income Fund experienced net outflows of $800 million this quarter, primarily due to a variable annuity insurance program redemption. Global international fixed income flows were once again strongly positive for the quarter led by Global Bond and Global Total Return. U.S. fixed income slipped into outflows. The tax-free fixed income net outflows improved significantly with the Franklin Federal Intermediate-Term Tax-free Income Fund, showing the biggest turnaround in this category. Cash management products had inflows of $600 million this quarter but still represent a very small part of our business. 
I will now turn it over to Ken for the operating results."

But as far as the -- it has a positive return for the year, close to a positive return today. I think that, that's very important in the psychology of money and new money coming in. And we're still encouraged by the tremendous overall record that it has, and short-term things can move very quickly especially with currencies."

and some of that is performance, and some of it's moving to passive, but it did result in, I think, about $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, between the 2 of those.

And some of the weakness, which we felt was more short term certainly turned around here in the last few weeks.

We don't really like to comment a whole lot on where fund flows are going, but I think in this case, just due to some of the misinformation that's been out there, we'll say that we have been pleased to see how it has been very steady despite that one short period of underperformance.

And if we look back in the history of this fund, it's had a couple of periods where it's been down 7% or 8%. So it's not unusual to have that. And it's the kind of style that I think a lot of people are looking for as far as trying to get that outflow from active management in there. So we've already been encouraged by the snapback in flows and positive flows with the U.S. -- certainly on the U.S. side with Global Bond. I think if you look at the absolute numbers and for the year, nobody's lost money in that. Our relative performance is down a little bit, but that's been coming back. But as far as the -- it has a positive return for the year, close to a positive return today. So that -- I think that, that's very important in the psychology of money and new money coming in.

So that hasn't gotten a lot of attention in the system, but now it that it has strong performance and have been out there for a while and has a unique story, it's one that, that we'll be talking about in the next year. But really, as far as flows, I think we're pleased to see that munis have come back and continue to come back and hopefully it will be in   a positive net mode this quarter, which is a long way from where we were a few quarters ago. I think the Franklin income fund had a -- hybrid had an unusually tough quarter and most of that again was due to a variable annuity account that affected the flow number there. And I expect the income fund to  come back as well as far. So those will be the areas that I think are going to continue to do well."

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was, overall, a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows",1487,"Hello, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was, overall, a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows for the year to almost $37 billion, one of our best years ever, despite heightened market volatility over the past quarter. 
Long term sales for the year exceeded $200 billion for the first time, with more than 50% coming from non-U.S. sources. That success was reflected in our operating results, as revenues exceeded $7.1 billion and operating income and earnings per share rose 36% for the year.  Driving those results was a growth in operating revenue of 22% with expenses increasing 15%. 
The greatest source of our organic asset growth continued to be our global fixed income business with $11 billion in net new flows for the quarter. Equity markets continue to be under pressure amidst negative market sentiments, surrounding global financial markets, following the downgrade of the U.S. Treasury debt rating and the increasing concerns related to sovereign debt in the Eurozone. 
Most importantly, our long-term investment performance rankings have remained strong in this market environment with the majority of our assets ranking in Lipper's first quartile over the past 10 years. Strategically, we have continued to expand our global presence in key markets, including the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management, which closed in July and the continued integration of U.K.-based Rensburg under the Franklin Templeton brand. 
In addition to expanding our capabilities across the globe, we continue to strengthen our presence in existing markets. We launched several new funds to meet evolving investor demand and extend our product lineup, particularly in technical asset allocation and won several new sovereign and institutional mandates this quarter. 
Overall, relative investment performance remains solid across our equity and fixed income strategies. Over the past 2 months, there's been increased retention focused on the short-term underperformance of some of our global bond strategies, due primarily to the rally in long-dated U.S. Treasuries and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and yen relative to other currencies held in those portfolios. This is not the first time a strategy has experienced a period of short-term underperformance. But over the long term, it has delivered outstanding risk-adjusted return relative to its peers. 
We're also encouraged at the fund's recent rebound in relative performance over the past few weeks. I'd also like to remind everyone that 40% of our fixed income assets under management are in U.S. products, where several of our funds benefited from the rally in treasuries. This diversification continues to offer our clients many appealing investment options and cross-selling opportunities for our sales teams. 
Our assets under management were up 2% for the year but we were not immune to the downturn in global markets seen in recent months. This is evidenced by a 10% decrease in AUM to $659.9 billion for the quarter. Average AUM also decreased 2% to $714.4 billion. Positive fixed income flows combined with the continued slump in equity markets continued to drive the mix in AUM by investment objective towards fixed income. The mix of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged from June, but Europe and Asia continued to be the fastest-growing regions for us. Despite industry outflows in Italy and Germany, Italy remained our top selling non-U.S. market this quarter followed by Hong Kong and Germany. 
Turning to Slide 10. The decrease in AUM since June was due almost entirely to market depreciation of $87.6 billion. Net new flows remained positive at $3.1 billion. Though the early part of the summer was clearly more favorable, as market turmoil impacted flows later in the quarter. Long-term sales dropped 8% this quarter but increased 4% versus the quarter a year ago. Lower net new flows resulted from a combination of declining long-term gross sales and increasing redemptions in retail funds through the second half of the quarter, as well as a few large institutional redemptions. 
Long-term sales were once again strongest in global fixed income this quarter. The Templeton Global Bond Fund and the Global Total Return Fund continued to be our best sellers but did suffer net outflows in one week late in the quarter. Concerns over a decline in short-term performance drilled these outflows. We believe that most financial advisors, who are familiar with the investment strategy for these funds, remained confident that when the high levels of market volatility subside and fundamentals once again drive currencies, credit spreads and interest rates, the fund's NAVs will extend their recent recovery. 
While long-term growth sales and other asset classes had generally declined this quarter, sales in our tax refunds have picked up, resulting in decline in net outflows to $300 million for the quarter, the lowest level since the first quarter of the fiscal year. In fact, 10 more funds returned to positive flows. 
Our institutional business experienced some significant redemptions and new mandates this quarter. In the global equity category, we saw redemptions of $2.7 billion in institutional separate account closures from 5 investors in a variety of global strategies. However, this was partially offset by several new institutional mandates and new sovereign and pension fund accounts in both the U.S. and internationally. 
We continue to expand our international product offerings this quarter, including the registration of 11 C Cap funds for sale in Romania. In addition, we completed the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management in July. In the U.K., the former Rensburg Unit Trust have been converted to OEIC and will now be actively promoted under the Franklin Templeton Investments brand. We also launched the Global Asset Allocation Fund in July to extend our product lineup in tactical asset allocation. 
Looking a little further along the product development cycle, you can see the potential long-term benefits of these types of investments. The C Cap versions of our Franklin World Perspectives Fund, which we launched near the depths of the financial crisis hit their key 3-year anniversary marks earlier this month, with both top quartile relative performance numbers and exceptional absolute returns since inception. This is a unique product created to leverage the strengths of the firm's local asset management teams around the world by combining our global perspective and local focus within a single portfolio, providing clients with a global growth fund, featuring access to both local research and local asset management. 
Overall, we are pleased with our continued sales momentum during this fiscal year. We ended the year with $221 billion in long-term gross sales, a 17% increase over the record-breaking year in 2010. Europe was the largest contributor of assets and net sales with $87 billion and $22 billion respectively. Taiwan remains our largest market in Asia with $21 billion in assets, while Hong Kong is closing in on the $10 billion mark. Our business in Malaysia also continues to grow quickly with $2 billion in assets further illustrating the strength and breadth of our global business and product offerings. 
Turning to Slide 12. Overall equity outflows have steadily increased since March due to the pullback in equity markets and flows have been negative since June as the industry experienced redemptions. Long-term sales of both global and U.S. equity funds declined in the face of the market turmoil, and redemptions from global equity were elevated this quarter due to institutional withdrawals I mentioned earlier. A few funds on the retail side attracted increased sales and net new flows compared to last quarter, most notably the Franklin Gold and Precious Metals and the Franklin India Bluechip funds. But overall, we saw an increase in outflows from retail investors. 
U.S. equity funds saw a continued increase in redemption activity, though some funds have been attracting continued debt inflow such as the Franklin Growth, Rising Dividends and Franklin Utilities. We continue to promote the value of long-term investment in global equity funds to financial advisors and their clients through the GLOBAL - THE NEW CORE theme, which is an extension of our 2020 Vision campaign. We have also focused on maintaining transparent and informative commentaries with advisors and investors, especially following the recent events that led to increased market volatility and have provided commentary with market perspective from a variety of portfolio managers. 
Hybrid funds, including the Franklin Income Fund experienced net outflows of $800 million this quarter, primarily due to a variable annuity insurance program redemption. Global international fixed income flows were once again strongly positive for the quarter led by Global Bond and Global Total Return. U.S. fixed income slipped into outflows. The tax-free fixed income net outflows improved significantly with the Franklin Federal Intermediate-Term Tax-free Income Fund, showing the biggest turnaround in this category. Cash management products had inflows of $600 million this quarter but still represent a very small part of our business. 
I will now turn it over to Ken for the operating results."
28703,141522446,179682,"Franklin Resources Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","The strength of the company continues to be reflected in our operating results. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million, a 1% increase from the third quarter and a 35% from the prior year and a record for the company. Net income for the quarter",1042,"The strength of the company continues to be reflected in our operating results. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million, a 1% increase from the third quarter and a 35% from the prior year and a record for the company. Net income for the quarter was down 17% from the third quarter at $416 million. And earnings per share decreased accordingly to $1.88 due to unrealized marked-to-market losses on various investments, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Net income for the year was $1.9 billion, up 33% from the prior year and earnings per share was $8.62 for the year, up 36% from the prior year. Investment management fees increased 2% for the quarter and included some items requiring explanation. Normalizing the results to exclude these items, results in the 3% decrease in investment management fees, which makes sense given a 2% decrease in average assets under management and a slight reduction to the blended effective fee rate due to the mix shift towards fixed income that Greg mentioned earlier, as well as the acquisition of Balanced Equity Management in July. 
Balanced Equity Management has a lower effective fee rate due to the size and nature of their client base. Part of the increase in total investment management fee revenue was attributable to an increase in performance fees of $47.6 million, and that related to the carried interest from the sale of assets from Darby emerging markets fund which we mentioned last quarter. 
It's also worth noting that on October 3, the second and final piece of a previously discussed redemption of a very low and flat-fee advisory count was incurred. The first portion of this redemption was reported in the first fiscal quarter of the year, and the remaining $11 billion of assets in this account will come out in this month's assets under management release, though effect on our earnings should be immaterial, as the account was only generating about $2 million of annual revenue. What you should see, as a result, is a decrease in average assets under management with a nearly-offsetting increase in the effective fee rate. 
Sales and distribution fees decreased 7% consistent with the decrease in average assets under management and sales. The asset-based revenue component, which comprises most of this line declined 2% due to decreased average assets under management and, the sales component decreased by 6.8% because of a decrease in U.S. sales, which was partially offset by an increase in the international sales. Shareholder servicing fees were $75.5 million, a decrease of 3%, which is less than the decrease in billable accounts due to the July purge of 2.2 million U.S. accounts that we mentioned last quarter. The remaining decrease was attributable to a decline in networking fees due to the conversion of network accounts into omnibus accounts.  Other net revenue was essentially flat for the quarter. 
Now turning to expenses on Slide 16, we can see that they decreased 2% compared with the previous quarter. The decrease of 7% in sales, distribution and marketing expense was consistent with the 7% decrease in revenue. Compensation and benefits was $309 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter as increased salaries and incentive compensation were more than offset by lower sick and vacation pay, retirement and commission expenses. 
Information systems and technology expenses were up 21% this quarter as projects were expensed and is completed in the final quarter of the fiscal year. Occupancy expense was up 10% due to the increases in building maintenance, utility costs and equipment depreciation. 
General, administrative and other expense was up 32% this quarter largely due to $11.1 million of fees related to the Darby carried interest payment and a seasonal increase in advertising and promotional expenses. 
Now because the relationship between noncontrolling interest and consolidated sponsored investment products and variable interest entities was causing some confusion, since they impact different parts of the income statement, we've updated Slide 17 to make their relationship clearer. 
Other income net of noncontrolling interests swung to a loss of $68.5 million compared to a gain of almost $30 million last quarter. The primary reason for that change was marked-to-market losses in investment securities. And although we had income from dividends, interest capital gains, gains on available-for-sale investments and positive foreign exchange revaluations, we experienced approximately $160 million of marked-to-market unrealized losses in our equity method and trading investments, consolidated sponsored investment products and consolidated variable interest entities.  And of course, we've seen those marks turn favorable as the market environment has improved recently. Interest expense was a little higher this month due to an increase in our tax reserve. 
Turning to Slide 18. The year-to-date effective tax rate increased 1.5% this quarter. Although this rate is higher than we expected, the increase is primarily due to a shift in the net earnings mix towards higher tax jurisdictions, as a significant portion of our unrealized losses on investments were in lower tax jurisdictions, and that reduced earnings in those jurisdictions as a percentage of taxable income. The annual rate has been fairly consistent over the past 4 years, but we do experience quarterly volatility, particularly, as foreign-source earnings fluctuate. 
The operating margin for the quarter was 37.5%, and that's roughly flat with the last 4 quarters. Cash and investments was $9.4 billion at September 30, including about $1 billion from variable interest entities. And we repurchased 3.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing shares outstanding to 217.7 million. Note that our 36% year-over-year growth in earnings per share exceeded the growth in net income attributable to the company by approximately 3% due to the benefits of EPS accretion, resulting from this program. 
The payout ratio for the quarter was 94% due to the acceleration of repurchase activity as our stock price decreased. We remain committed to returning a substantial portion of free cash flow to shareholders over time. However, a substantial portion of cash and investments is held offshore or used to see new products and may not be available for repurchases or dividends. 
And that concludes our commentary on the fourth quarter results. As always, if you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations or Corporate Communications. Their contact information is located in the presentation and the press release. Thank you."

and some of that is performance, and some of it's moving to passive, but it did result in, I think, about $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion, between the 2 of those. And then we had another significant account in the variable annuity side on the Mutual Series Discovery side that moved to an in-house manager within one of the large insurance companies that wasn't as much performance-related. And sometimes there's just timing differences. When these redemptions were made, it could have been lagging at that time and then taken a while.

And some of the weakness, which we felt was more short term certainly turned around here in the last few weeks.

We don't really like to comment a whole lot on where fund flows are going, but I think in this case, just due to some of the misinformation that's been out there, we'll say that we have been pleased to see how it has been very steady despite that one short period of underperformance. And net-net, year-to-date, probably around breakeven overall with an improving trend and U.S. doing better than Europe as far as looking at the flows within the 2 regions."

And as far as how it's run and how its performance has been so outstanding over time that you will have short-term periods of underperformance. And if we look back in the history of this fund, it's had a couple of periods where it's been down 7% or 8%. So it's not unusual to have that. And it's the kind of style that I think a lot of people are looking for as far as trying to get that outflow from active management in there. So we've already been encouraged by the snapback in flows and positive flows with the U.S. -- certainly on the U.S. side with Global Bond. I think if you look at the absolute numbers and for the year, nobody's lost money in that. Our relative performance is down a little bit, but that's been coming back. But as far as the -- it has a positive return for the year, close to a positive return today. So that -- I think that, that's very important in the psychology of money and new money coming in.

And then in terms of these products, do they fund into a variety of your products or are they just specific products in and of themselves?"

So our expectations there are that will take a little bit of time to get going. I think the World Perspectives Fund just gives us another arrow on the global equities side where we have leveraged the local asset managers and really built a very strong record that in hitting the 3-year number, we highlight that because that's always a hurdle for getting on platforms and making sure you've been out there for 3 years. So that hasn't gotten a lot of attention in the system, but now it that it has strong performance and have been out there for a while and has a unique story, it's one that, that we'll be talking about in the next year. But really, as far as flows, I think we're pleased to see that munis have come back and continue to come back and hopefully it will be in a positive net mode this quarter, which is a long way from where we were a few quarters ago. I think the Franklin Income Fund had a -- Hybrid had an unusually tough quarter and most of that again was due to a variable annuity account that affected the flow number there. And I expect the income fund to come back as well as far. So those will be the areas that I think are going to continue to do well."

And net-net, year-to-date, probably around breakeven overall with an improving trend and U.S. doing better than Europe as far as looking at the flows within the 2 regions."

And as far as how it's run and how its performance has been so outstanding over time that you will have short-term periods of underperformance. And if we look back in the history of this fund, it's had a couple of periods where it's been down 7% or 8%. So it's not unusual to have that. And it's the kind of style that I think a lot of people are looking for as far as trying to get that outflow from active management in there. So we've already been encouraged by the snapback in flows and positive flows with the U.S. -- certainly on the U.S. side with Global Bond. I think if you look at the absolute numbers and for the year, nobody's lost money in that. Our relative performance is down a little bit, but that's been coming back. But as far as the -- it has a positive return for the year, close to a positive return today. So that -- I think that, that's very important in the psychology of money and new money coming in. And we're still encouraged by the tremendous overall record that it has. And short-term things can move very quickly especially with currencies."

and some of that is performance, and some of it's moving to passive, but it did result in, I think, about $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion, between the 2 of those.

And if we look back in the history of this fund, it's had a couple of periods where it's been down 7% or 8%. So it's not unusual to have that. And it's the kind of style that I think a lot of people are looking for as far as trying to get that outflow from active management in there. So we've already been encouraged by the snapback in flows and positive flows with the U.S. -- certainly on the U.S. side with Global Bond. I think if you look at the absolute numbers and for the year, nobody's lost money in that. Our relative performance is down a little bit, but that's been coming back.

I think the World Perspectives Fund just gives us another arrow on the global equities side where we have leveraged the local asset managers and really built a very strong record that in hitting the 3-year number, we highlight that because that's always a hurdle for getting on platforms and making sure you've been out there for 3 years. So that hasn't gotten a lot of attention in the system, but now it that it has strong performance and have been out there for a while and has a unique story, it's one that, that we'll be talking about in the next year. But really, as far as flows, I think we're pleased to see that munis have come back and continue to come back and hopefully it will be in a positive net mode this quarter, which is a long way from where we were a few quarters ago.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was, overall, a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows",1487,"Hello, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Our fourth quarter cap was, overall, a very successful year for the firm. Fourth quarter net new flows of $3.1 billion brought total flows for the year to almost $37 billion, one of our best years ever, despite heightened market volatility over the past quarter. 
Long term sales for the year exceeded $200 billion for the first time, with more than 50% coming from non-U.S. sources. That success was reflected in our operating results, as revenues exceeded $7.1 billion and operating income and earnings per share rose 36% for the year.  Driving those results was a growth in operating revenue of 22% with expenses increasing 15%. 
The greatest source of our organic asset growth continued to be our global fixed income business with $11 billion in net new flows for the quarter. Equity markets continue to be under pressure amidst negative market sentiments, surrounding global financial markets, following the downgrade of the U.S. Treasury debt rating and the increasing concerns related to sovereign debt in the Eurozone. 
Most importantly, our long-term investment performance rankings have remained strong in this market environment with the majority of our assets ranking in Lipper's first quartile over the past 10 years. Strategically, we have continued to expand our global presence in key markets, including the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management, which closed in July and the continued integration of U.K.-based Rensburg under the Franklin Templeton brand. 
In addition to expanding our capabilities across the globe, we continue to strengthen our presence in existing markets. We launched several new funds to meet evolving investor demand and extend our product lineup, particularly in technical asset allocation and won several new sovereign and institutional mandates this quarter. 
Overall, relative investment performance remains solid across our equity and fixed income strategies. Over the past 2 months, there's been increased retention focused on the short-term underperformance of some of our global bond strategies, due primarily to the rally in long-dated U.S. Treasuries and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and yen relative to other currencies held in those portfolios. This is not the first time a strategy has experienced a period of short-term underperformance. But over the long term, it has delivered outstanding risk-adjusted return relative to its peers. 
We're also encouraged at the fund's recent rebound in relative performance over the past few weeks. I'd also like to remind everyone that 40% of our fixed income assets under management are in U.S. products, where several of our funds benefited from the rally in treasuries. This diversification continues to offer our clients many appealing investment options and cross-selling opportunities for our sales teams. 
Our assets under management were up 2% for the year but we were not immune to the downturn in global markets seen in recent months. This is evidenced by a 10% decrease in AUM to $659.9 billion for the quarter. Average AUM also decreased 2% to $714.4 billion. Positive fixed income flows combined with the continued slump in equity markets continued to drive the mix in AUM by investment objective towards fixed income. The mix of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged from June, but Europe and Asia continued to be the fastest-growing regions for us. Despite industry outflows in Italy and Germany, Italy remained our top selling non-U.S. market this quarter followed by Hong Kong and Germany. 
Turning to Slide 10. The decrease in AUM since June was due almost entirely to market depreciation of $87.6 billion. Net new flows remained positive at $3.1 billion. Though the early part of the summer was clearly more favorable, as market turmoil impacted flows later in the quarter. Long-term sales dropped 8% this quarter but increased 4% versus the quarter a year ago. Lower net new flows resulted from a combination of declining long-term gross sales and increasing redemptions in retail funds through the second half of the quarter, as well as a few large institutional redemptions. 
Long-term sales were once again strongest in global fixed income this quarter. The Templeton Global Bond Fund and the Global Total Return Fund continued to be our best sellers but did suffer net outflows in one week late in the quarter. Concerns over a decline in short-term performance drilled these outflows. We believe that most financial advisors, who are familiar with the investment strategy for these funds, remained confident that when the high levels of market volatility subside and fundamentals once again drive currencies, credit spreads and interest rates, the fund's NAVs will extend their recent recovery. 
While long-term growth sales and other asset classes had generally declined this quarter, sales in our tax refunds have picked up, resulting in decline in net outflows to $300 million for the quarter, the lowest level since the first quarter of the fiscal year. In fact, 10 more funds returned to positive flows. 
Our institutional business experienced some significant redemptions and new mandates this quarter. In the global equity category, we saw redemptions of $2.7 billion in institutional separate account closures from 5 investors in a variety of global strategies. However, this was partially offset by several new institutional mandates and new sovereign and pension fund accounts in both the U.S. and internationally. 
We continue to expand our international product offerings this quarter, including the registration of 11 C Cap funds for sale in Romania. In addition, we completed the acquisition of Australian-based Balanced Equity Management in July. In the U.K., the former Rensburg Unit Trust have been converted to OEIC and will now be actively promoted under the Franklin Templeton Investments brand. We also launched the Global Asset Allocation Fund in July to extend our product lineup in tactical asset allocation. 
Looking a little further along the product development cycle, you can see the potential long-term benefits of these types of investments. The C Cap versions of our Franklin World Perspectives Fund, which we launched near the depths of the financial crisis hit their key 3-year anniversary marks earlier this month, with both top quartile relative performance numbers and exceptional absolute returns since inception. This is a unique product created to leverage the strengths of the firm's local asset management teams around the world by combining our global perspective and local focus within a single portfolio, providing clients with a global growth fund, featuring access to both local research and local asset management. 
Overall, we are pleased with our continued sales momentum during this fiscal year. We ended the year with $221 billion in long-term gross sales, a 17% increase over the record-breaking year in 2010. Europe was the largest contributor of assets and net sales with $87 billion and $22 billion respectively. Taiwan remains our largest market in Asia with $21 billion in assets, while Hong Kong is closing in on the $10 billion mark. Our business in Malaysia also continues to grow quickly with $2 billion in assets further illustrating the strength and breadth of our global business and product offerings. 
Turning to Slide 12. Overall equity outflows have steadily increased since March due to the pullback in equity markets and flows have been negative since June as the industry experienced redemptions. Long-term sales of both global and U.S. equity funds declined in the face of the market turmoil, and redemptions from global equity were elevated this quarter due to institutional withdrawals I mentioned earlier. A few funds on the retail side attracted increased sales and net new flows compared to last quarter, most notably the Franklin Gold and Precious Metals and the Franklin India Bluechip funds. But overall, we saw an increase in outflows from retail investors. 
U.S. equity funds saw a continued increase in redemption activity, though some funds have been attracting continued debt inflow such as the Franklin Growth, Rising Dividends and Franklin Utilities. We continue to promote the value of long-term investment in global equity funds to financial advisors and their clients through the GLOBAL - THE NEW CORE theme, which is an extension of our 2020 Vision campaign. We have also focused on maintaining transparent and informative commentaries with advisors and investors, especially following the recent events that led to increased market volatility and have provided commentary with market perspective from a variety of portfolio managers. 
Hybrid funds, including the Franklin Income Fund experienced net outflows of $800 million this quarter, primarily due to a variable annuity insurance program redemption. Global international fixed income flows were once again strongly positive for the quarter led by Global Bond and Global Total Return. U.S. fixed income slipped into outflows. The tax-free fixed income net outflows improved significantly with the Franklin Federal Intermediate-Term Tax-free Income Fund, showing the biggest turnaround in this category. Cash management products had inflows of $600 million this quarter but still represent a very small part of our business. 
I will now turn it over to Ken for the operating results."
28703,141522446,180267,"Franklin Resources Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","Okay, thanks, Greg. The strength of the company continues to be reflected in our operating results. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million, a 1% increase from the third quarter and a 35% from the prior year and a record for the company. Net inc",1045,"Okay, thanks, Greg. The strength of the company continues to be reflected in our operating results. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million, a 1% increase from the third quarter and a 35% from the prior year and a record for the company. Net income for the quarter was down 17% from the third quarter at $416 million. And earnings per share decreased accordingly to $1.88 due to unrealized marked-to-market losses on various investments, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Net income for the year was $1.9 billion, up 33% from the prior year and earnings per share was $8.62 for the year, up 36% from the prior year. Investment management fees increased 2% for the quarter and included some items requiring explanation. Normalizing the results to exclude these items, results in the 3% decrease in investment management fees, which makes sense given a 2% decrease in average assets under management and a slight reduction to the blended effective fee rate due to the mix shift towards fixed income that Greg mentioned earlier, as well as the acquisition of Balanced Equity Management in July. 
Balanced Equity Management has a lower effective fee rate due to the size and nature of their client base. Part of the increase in total investment management fee revenue was attributable to an increase in performance fees of $47.6 million, and that related to the carried interest from the sale of assets from Darby emerging markets fund which we mentioned last quarter. 
It's also worth noting that on October 3, the second and final piece of a previously discussed redemption of a very low and flat-fee advisory count was incurred. The first portion of this redemption was reported in the first fiscal quarter of the year, and the remaining $11 billion of assets in this account will come out in this month's assets under management release, though effect on our earnings should be immaterial, as the account was only generating about $2 million of annual revenue. What you should see, as a result, is a decrease in average assets under management with a nearly-offsetting increase in the effective fee rate. 
Sales and distribution fees decreased 7% consistent with the decrease in average assets under management and sales. The asset-based revenue component, which comprises most of this line declined 2% due to decreased average assets under management and, the sales component decreased by 6.8% because of a decrease in U.S. sales, which was partially offset by an increase in the international sales. Shareholder servicing fees were $75.5 million, a decrease of 3%, which is less than the decrease in billable accounts due to the July purge of 2.2 million U.S. accounts that we mentioned last quarter. The remaining decrease was attributable to a decline in networking fees due to the conversion of network accounts into omnibus accounts.  Other net revenue was essentially flat for the quarter. 
Now turning to expenses on Slide 16, we can see that they decreased 2% compared with the previous quarter. The decrease of 7% in sales, distribution and marketing expense was consistent with the 7% decrease in revenue. Compensation and benefits was $309 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter as increased salaries and incentive compensation were more than offset by lower sick and vacation pay, retirement and commission expenses. 
Information systems and technology expenses were up 21% this quarter as projects were expensed and is completed in the final quarter of the fiscal year. Occupancy expense was up 10% due to the increases in building maintenance, utility costs and equipment depreciation. 
General, administrative and other expense was up 32% this quarter largely due to $11.1 million of fees related to the Darby carried interest payment and a seasonal increase in advertising and promotional expenses. 
Now because the relationship between noncontrolling interest and consolidated sponsored investment products and variable interest entities was causing some confusion, since they impact different parts of the income statement, we've updated Slide 17 to make their relationship clearer. 
Other income net of noncontrolling interests swung to a loss of $68.5 million compared to a gain of almost $30 million last quarter. The primary reason for that change was marked-to-market losses in investment securities. And although we had income from dividends, interest capital gains, gains on available-for-sale investments and positive foreign exchange revaluations, we experienced approximately $160 million of marked-to-market unrealized losses in our equity method and trading investments, consolidated sponsored investment products and consolidated variable interest entities.  And of course, we've seen those marks turn favorable as the market environment has improved recently. Interest expense was a little higher this month due to an increase in our tax reserve. 
Turning to Slide 18. The year-to-date effective tax rate increased 1.5% this quarter. Although this rate is higher than we expected, the increase is primarily due to a shift in the net earnings mix towards higher tax jurisdictions, as a significant portion of our unrealized losses on investments were in lower tax jurisdictions, and that reduced earnings in those jurisdictions as a percentage of taxable income. The annual rate has been fairly consistent over the past 4 years, but we do experience quarterly volatility, particularly, as foreign-source earnings fluctuate. 
The operating margin for the quarter was 37.5%, and that's roughly flat with the last 4 quarters. Cash and investments was $9.4 billion at September 30, including about $1 billion from variable interest entities. And we repurchased 3.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing shares outstanding to 217.7 million. Note that our 36% year-over-year growth in earnings per share exceeded the growth in net income attributable to the company by approximately 3% due to the benefits of EPS accretion, resulting from this program. 
The payout ratio for the quarter was 94% due to the acceleration of repurchase activity as our stock price decreased. We remain committed to returning a substantial portion of free cash flow to shareholders over time. However, a substantial portion of cash and investments is held offshore or used to see new products and may not be available for repurchases or dividends. 
And that concludes our commentary on the fourth quarter results. As always, if you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations or Corporate Communications. Their contact information is located in the presentation and the press release. Thank you."
