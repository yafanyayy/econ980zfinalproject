My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we like to welcome our fourth quarter earnings results conference call. Fourth quarter will release this morning. I will provi",1031,"Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we like to welcome our fourth quarter earnings results conference call. 
Fourth quarter will release this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record fourth quarter, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $950 million, up slightly from Q3 2010 and up 25% in U.S. dollars and local currencies over the fourth quarter of 2009. 
From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in Q4 2010, were up 21% from last year. Breaking down sales into our two major components, our Cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was down 7% from last year and 12% from last quarter. The sales declines relate primarily to lower spending in North America and broadband markets. The Interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales was up 28% from last year and 1%, sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $191 million compared to $138 million last year. Operating margin was 20.1% compared to 18.3% last year. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $6.8 million in Q4 2010, compared to $5 million in Q4 2009, 0.7% of sales in both periods. 
From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 12.3%, down from 15.5% last year. The margin decline relates to higher relative material costs, the impact of market price reductions and lower volumes. 
In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.4% compared to 20.6% last year. The improvement in margin reflects the benefit of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the company's record operating margin achievement of 20.1%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over the fourth quarter of 2009 of approximately 27%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly in the face of increasing global cost pressures. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10.2 million compared to $9.5 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of a seasoned company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of new accounting rules effective January 1. In 2009, approximately $400,000 were included in other expense.
In the fourth quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 27.2% compared to a rate of 27.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. we currently expect the rate approximately 27.5% in 2011. 
Net income in the quarter was approximately 14% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.74 and grew $0.48 over the prior-year quarter on an as-reported basis and 42% after adjusting the prior-year earnings per share for onetime item. This represents an EPS growth rate of approximately 1.7x sales growth, demonstrating the company's significant operating leverage.
Orders for the quarter were not $948 million, up 24% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1:1. The company continued the strong focus on balance sheet management in the quarter. Accounts receivable was $719 million, down 1% from the end of Q3. 
Days sales outstanding were up the high end of the company's normal range at 68 days at the end of 2010, up from 64 days at the end of 2009. In addition, payable days increased from 61 days at the end of 2009 to 54 days at the end of 2010. 
Inventory in the quarter was $549 million, up about 2% from the end of Q3. From a day's perspective, inventory was at 77 days at the end of 2010, down from 80 days at the end of 2009. This is a good performance for the company for a historical perspective, although we continue to focus on improving inventory performance.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $161 million in Q4, over 120% of net income. Cash from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $36 million, were used primarily for capital expenditures of $36 million, acquisition payments relating to previous acquisitions of $15 million and a reduction in borrowings under the company's credit receivable facility of $104 million. 
In addition, the cash and short-term investments increased $29 million to $604 million at the end of the year. Total debt was $800 million and net debt approximately $176 million at year end. In August, as previously reported, the company refinanced with senior of credit facility. The new $1 billion facility matures at August 2014. And at the end of the year, the company had availability under that facility of $896 million.
To company also had $100 million receivable securitization facility that expires in 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, the facility was accounted for balance sheet as are several receivable. Effective January 1, those rules were changed end of facility was brought on balance sheet, reducing the company's operating cash flow in Q1 of 2010 and for the year by $82 million.
At December 31, 2010, borrowings under that facility were $92 million and are reflected as long-term debt. At December 31, '09, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and were excluded from the balance sheet. 
Operating cash flow for 2010, excluding this accounting change impact, was $507 million, over 100% of net income. Supporting the high-quality of the company's earnings. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong as have less than 1x and 22x, respectively. And EBITDA in the fourth quarter was approximately $226 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.  Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight first the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 achievements for the company, giving a little bit of color to what Diana had just mentioned. I'll discuss the trends and progress in our markets. And then, I'll take a few moments to comment on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2011.
Before going into our performance, however, I would like to recognize wanting. We announced done early December that after 37 years with the company Martin Loeffler, would retire as the Executive Chairman but will continue to serve as nonexecutive Chairman of our Board of Directors. I'd like to take this moment on behalf of all the Amphenol employees as well as our Board of Directors to thank Martin for his extraordinary contribution to long-term success of Amphenol. I personally look forward to the discontinued support as nonexecutive chairman of our board.
Now with respect to the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased to report record revenues and earnings in what is still a very dynamic economic environment. Revenues increased a very strong 25% from prior year, up slightly from a record third quarter. And we were especially excited to build on our already strong operating margin, achieving, as Diana mentioned a record return on sales of 20.1%. 
Our achievement of this level of profitability despite the significant inflationary pressures around the world is a clear reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team.
with respective the full year 2010, we're very proud of the strong recovery and our results and 2010, which reached new levels at every stage, revenues of $3,554,000,000, operating margins of 19.7% and earnings per share of $2.82. We are especially pleased that in 2010, we were able to exceed our 2008 sales levels by nearly 10%, while the industry as a whole has not yet necessarily recovered to these precrisis levels. 
Our consistent focus and technology innovation and customer support through all phases of this economic cycle have resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across each of end market. In addition, our organization has continued to create innovative technologies, which capitalize on exciting new areas of an ever-expanding electronics market, thereby, broadening the opportunity for our future growth.
in 2010, we have also successfully continued our acquisition program adding three new family members for Amphenol during the course of the year among creating you all excellent platform for future expansion. As we closed the year, we find it very rewarding that our entire organization has created an excellent new platform of strength, which creates optimism for our future performance.
Not turning to the specifics of our performance in each of our served markets, the Military and Aerospace market represented 22% of sales in the quarter and sales increase ever be strong 27% from prior year. This strength was broad-based and included especially straight in military vehicles and commercial air application together with gain from our recent acquisitions. As expected, our sales were stable in the fourth quarter from the third quarter.
We feel increasingly positive about trends in the Commercial Aircraft market, as existing program volumes grow and as your our growth platform will begin to materialize during the course of 2011. Although there remains uncertainty in defense budgets of certain developed economies, we're very optimistic that the increasing electronic content in military equipment, together with our broad program participation and our strong positions in high-growth emerging markets, will continue to drive performance in the future. While we expect demand to remain stable in the first quarter, we look forward to a very strong long-term outlook for this important market for Amphenol.
The Industrial market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this very diverse market increased a very strong 69% from prior year and had a slight increase from the third quarter. Our growth in Industrial was broad based, but that led especially in sales into the geophysical and oil and gas, alternative energy, factory automation and instrumentation segments of the market. We were's very pleased that we closed 2010 that we have experienced a very broad-based recovery in virtually all the segments of the Industrial market. While we expect this market to be stable in the first quarter, we continue to be encouraged by a strong outlook and 2011 as our new technologies continue to proliferate into these exciting growth areas.
The automotive market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increase in that market 11% from prior year, and a very strong vendor percent sequentially as we benefited from an increase in vehicle volumes as well as the ramp-up of new hybrid electric vehicle platforms. 
We continue to be excited by the new opportunities that we see, which are driven by rapidly expanding electronics platforms in cars. We expect demand in the automotive market to strengthen in the first quarter, led by our further progress in these new onboard electronics as well as the ongoing ramp-up of hybrid vehicles.
Sales into the broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market decreased 8% from prior year and declined sequentially by 15%, as the expected seasonal pause in spending by cable operators started earlier than we typically would see. While profitability in this segment continued to be pressured by rising material prices as well as market pricing dynamics, we continue to be encouraged by our increasing position with new Cable and Interconnect products as well as our strong position in international markets. We expect demand in the broadband market to improve seasonally in the first quarter and look forward to realizing further benefits from our diversification efforts.
Our sales into the information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and increased 10% from prior year, although declined by 7% sequentially on what was unexpected pause in activity by customers in the IT market. We're continuing to see acceleration of adoption of our broad range of next-generation technologies into networking, storage and servers, creating a strong basis for our long-term positive outlook. While we expect demand to remain at these near-term levels in the first quarter, we're excited by our ongoing new program wins with our advanced new technologies, which position us for a strong 2011 and beyond.
Our sales into the mobile networks market represented 12% of sales in the quarter, an increase 12% from prior year as we benefited from increased buildout of next-generation wireless network. Sales also increased slightly on a sequential basis in what is typically a more seasonally soft fourth quarter. We expect demand to be stable in be first quarter as operators on a worldwide basis continue to invest in network buildout and capacity upgrades in support of the accelerating data usage that's arising smart Mobile Devices. we look also to further long-term strength driven by or broad design and position on many new base station platforms.
Our sales into mobile device market represented 20% of the total in the quarter, an increase of very strong 58% from prior year and 10% sequentially, as we benefited from strong sales of new Mobile Devices incorporating our leading Interconnect antenna products. While we do anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of demand in the first quarter, we remain very excited by our strengthening position in the rapidly expanding range of new smart Mobile Devices and the growth potential that these create for the company and 2011. Our comprehensive portfolio for products for Mobile Devices as well as the solid preferred supplier relationships that we have with all major device makers positions us strongly for the future.
So in summary, I am extremely proud of our entire organization around the world as we continue to execute well in a very dynamic demand environment. Our achievement of these two records in sales earnings and especially operating profitability is extremely rewarding, especially given the many challenges that we see in the marketplace. 
Our success is reflected in these new record results as a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure and very importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2011. With the more normal market conditions that we are seeing in that we foresee further future, we are pleased to be able to return to our customer not providing was again full year guidance for our performance. 
Based on content exchange rates and normal seasonal patterns, we now expect in the first quarter and the full year of 2011 the following results: We expect sales in the range of $925 million to $940 million and $3,885,000,000  to $3,960,000,000, respectively and we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.72 and $3 to $#.10, respectively. For the full year, this guidance represents the sales growth of 9% to 11% and 11% to 15%, respectively. 
We are very encouraged by the strong outlook for sales and earnings, and I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon of these do record levels of performance as they capitalize on the many, many opportunities to expand our market position as well as our profitability for the future. At this time operator, would be happy to entertain any questions that there may be."

I mean, in fact by 2:1. In 2009, obviously, we were down less than half. last year, we would see what the final results are, but I think at least grew close to the level of industry even though we were down by less than half in '09. And that has come from really some very simple strategic principles that we think have a lot to share essentially and essentially. first and foremost, there's been a driver technology and we have seen in the last several years and really out acceleration of that the requirements for technology and Interconnect products are truly accelerating. With the demands on speed, with the demand on the harsh environments, the miniaturization, all of these things have put requirements on Interconnect products that make it more and more difficult for niche companies to survive. And that has allowed us through a broad range of technologies and a real leading innovation to take new positions of customers that we didn't necessarily have. so that has clearly been a great effort. I think another driver of that kind of above-average growth has been over many years of the desire of customers to consolidate the supply base. Non-GAAP does not change. We have seen that certainly the very mature fashion in the IT and the telecom industry and we start to see that more and more with the last couple of years and will allow of the Industrial as those companies manage their supply chain. Once again, they're looking for a supplier who can be truly a partner for them on a broad basis of Interconnect technology. I think our acquisition program and, Diana mentioned that in the past, that has generated over many years somewhere around a third of our growth in that acquisition program please bear well into those two elements, while the supplier consolidation where we find these companies as well as the innovation of technology will were able to continually add the very portfolio of technology that we have in the many markets that charter. So I think with all of that, we see just tremendous opportunity that the segments of the market that are really still so exciting that the data in mobility that the electronic proliferation and aerospace and Industrial and then in automotive and these are tremendous trends, which we believe will, for Amphenol, is going to continue to allow us to outperformed industry."

Relative to inventories, again, we have said in the past and this still remains the case that we don't have full visibility on the inventory our customers with the exception of the small percent of sales that we have through distribution, which is somewhat less than 15% today. And in that area, we have not seen any significant big moves. There are always leader but we have not seen any trends in the fourth quarter in the inventories of our distributors nor have we heard in other markets. I think, the only area where I would comment is, we mentioned that I mentioned in my remarks that in the IT market, where we did see a sequential downturn, we saw somewhat of a pause in buying activity. if that is somehow also related to inventory, it's a certain IT customer. again, I don't have that visibility into their warehouses but it would not shopping for decades that some of that lost that we signed a sequential basis in the fourth quarter could have been related to inventory corrections in that market."

But what I can tell you is there's certainly substantial contribution from both of those things that you talk about, both the volume, which on a global basis vehicle volumes here I think hits something like 73 million, 74 million cars, which is I think 20%, 25% increase over the year early. Clearly, there has been a strong or were all volume increase for the full year. But in addition, we have certainly seen the ramp-up of this hybrid platforms and the ramp-up of new electronics. Well, One thing that is a very exciting for as is, we've seen the proliferation of electronics beyond just kind of the headlines high-end cars. And more in more you're seeing the electronic functionalities that maybe were prototypes in a high-end car being then spread and proliferated across cars at all levels. And that can be true with airbags. That can be true with onboard infotainment. That can be true with tell them Onex. With antilock brakes. Whatever it is, this niche application product our bread and butter in the automotive industry have started proliferate across more and more car platforms, which is really a response to the automakers to the fact that's where they can make money. And so, they see that these options allow them to make higher margins. And I think they are really rushing to push them into every car platform. and so from a future standpoint, I think whether rigs volume growth whether it's the poorer for Asian of electronics, whether it's new hybrids coming up, and those are all can be good drivers of growth for us for the future. Automotive remains for us one of our smallest markets. And we're excited about our niche position in that market as it relates to those two applications having further perverse ration."

So that as that market came back, we can get kind of a lever effect on the growth by having altered the new product coming in. Relative to energy, I mean, we have actually seen really strong growth in the quarter in alternative energy, which has been a market that's really supported us through 2010 and help to offset some of the pain in 2009. These are efforts in to things like solar and wind and a variety of other new, exciting growth markets and alternative energy. But also, the geophysical market is one where we're very strong both through some organic product development over the years and acquisitions we have made throughout the years. And that market also grew very, very strongly in the quarter. But those are not the only ones. We saw a real strength in motion control, we saw strength in instrumentation, strength in medical. On across-the-board basis, our strategy are really attacking on a broad basis the Industrial market with niche-focus strategies with each into the segments with new technologies.

And so in the end, that fuel saving and with a price of oil having done what it does, becoming more and more important. That gives us a great deal of optimism for the future, because all of these two platforms are really tight around the ability to use less fuel rather be in the 787, the A35, certainly even with the delay that I think there even the 787 the plane will fly. I have said it many times that I continue do to believe it is a tremendous amount of conviction biggest airlines need that plane. And we just have a much higher content on these two platforms because of the complexity of electronics. Relative to the military, we believe, also and I believe first a very strongly that guess there maybe budget restrictions. But in that the developed markets specifically in the U.S. and in the European markets, the demand for electronic functionality is going to create further opportunities for us this year and beyond. and I see that really in the last couple of weeks, you may have seen that there were some of the announcement by Secretary Gates with respect to the budget. And in these, in fact, what comes true in this budgetary announcement is they are pushing for a lot of savings. I think they talked about some $78 billion in savings, which are coming not from equipment purchases but rather from things like reducing the cost of health insurance, reducing the number of flag officers, streamlining procurement, reducing contractors. all these things. And then not taking that money out of a budget but rather reallocating it to equipment upgrades. And they're talking about electronic upgrades of planes, they're talking new UAVs, they're talking about you radar systems, new long-range bombers. And yes, they talk maybe a bit a lot of programs that were a little bit more to be canceled. But in fact, we believe that, that electronic proliferation that's something the military  as a real requirement for the future and one were Amphenol is very well positioned to participate. And then a final thing I would mention is the emerging market. And we continue to see these emerging markets, places like India in particular, where the long-range, growth prospects for our participation with the military are excellent. As a would all of that on balance between commercial share in the military and what we see, we continue to have a very positive outlook for the Military/Aerospace market in the future. If Military/Aerospace were to grow on a can of the average rate that we have guided, that would very strong performance historically for aerospace.

And my rebuttal is, if you look at gross margins as one thing, but as the company leverages sales base to grow higher, there's still room for operating margin improvement as the company sees more leverage from the operating base.

Is there still more leverage to model there from looking it from that framework?"

But we truly believe that there is still margin expansion potentially in the business, and the 25% conversion margin that we talk about for quite a while and continue to be committed to and is reflected in the guidance that we just gave. It certainly does show the commitment that we do have to continued the margin expansion in the business. I think particularly if you look at the Interconnect margins, which were almost 22.5% ROS in the quarter, this is I think the part of the business where we would see the potential, as you say, as we grow the top line with really technology-focused products and continue to drive costs. This has been the combination that's in the past in terms of margin expansion and the Interconnect portion of the business and specifically where the vast majority of our operating units are involved in. This is the part of the business where, clearly, the management team has taken on that next return objective from an internal perspective. I mean their next long-term goal is to drive certainly towards the 25% return on sales for that portion of our business. And so, we do believe that with that growth on the top line and that strong technology focus, that we will continue to drive of margin expansion in the business."

So I wouldn't have any read necessarily from customers from the forecast standpoint. What I can tell you, which is more of a qualitative reason I guess from meeting with customers, talking to our real sales, who's meeting our customers are very excited and they see the same trends but I talk about. In mobility, the demand is created by the smart Mobile Devices. In military, and there's no question in the military that these electronics are proliferating. you go, I mean, I encourage you to read the transcript that Gates and press conference when he talk about these budgets transformation.

And so, I think that these are trends that our customers are seeing and they feel that they are feet are a little bit more on solid ground. And we have seen that, there have been a couple of releases in the technology industry, which have been not so bad, I think.

India is certainly a market that we know very well, and we watch it very carefully. And I think I have commented over the last couple of calls that we will see when they build it, they will do that at the second time when it's most opportune for into it from a cost standpoint. What clearly seems to be the case is that operators in India start to move more towards of build phase of 3G. What we do understand is that the OEM or the manufacturer of the equipment and really the breakdown of who is getting what awards in India is very different this time around that it was in the 2G. For all of the talk, politics about chinese vendors and everything else, the Chinese seem to have done an excellent job in terms of positioning themselves with a lot of presence in India. they talk in India very familiar Brian with the circle and who has how many circles in India. And it appears that the Chinese have gained nearly as many circles as the two other large Western players at that others would are dissipated maybe have been added bit more left out in India. I can tell you that we participate with all of the OEMs who stand to gain in India. What I can tell you also, though, is that the 3G buildup in India is going to be based on equipment, which may not be necessarily just kind of large refrigerator-type cabinet base station of the past, but moreover, it will be more modular base station, more flexible cheaper to install, easier to install in the field, which in India important criteria for do operator. And so, what that means for us is that we will certainly benefit, and we have a strong position with those base stations. The content in a small base station naturally would be less than the content of the large base station. If there are more of them, you can make up for that. So we continue to find it very carefully and we are very well positioned for that buildup, which we certainly hope to come year end of year. It won't be in India though in China was, which is all of India will build it and then they turn it on one day. Because you have so many operators, so many different circles, I think there are some 65, 70 circles in India, who each are going to have a different schedule in which they will build their network. And so, I wouldn't anticipate a real sort of one-off hit that would come from India, but rather there could be a general positive for us for the year and for beyond."

And so, that's excellent. And from a net-net relative to PCs and laptops, where we have very little participation, that can be a driver of growth for the future.

We're very much by virtue of the organizational structure that we have where we have 70 general managers are around the world. Each of them operating really at the slightly different context. we're able to tailor make our reactions. There are certainly operations is China the right place for me to be. There are others who are saying I've got to go to China right now because I'm not yet there. and so, that really runs the entire spectrum in Amphenol. I think that with respect to China, it's a very important market for us, China is also not just a monolith. You have invested in China opportunities. You have outside of the places like Shenzhen and Shanghai opportunities. By virtue of our organization the fact that we have today in China 24 operations around the country, we have an experience operating essentially everywhere in the country and in every context in the country. That allows us to really a leg up. Where when we see a pressure in an area where we decide to slowly migrate to another, it is not just a greenfield start-up, where we have to go commissioned studies about what's the environment, or our delever. We're already an expert essentially everywhere in China, and that gives us a significant leg up. We're also seeing strong progress of our facilities in other geographies in India, in Eastern Europe, in Africa, in Latin America. So there are going to be and there are in Amphenol other options in China. The other thing is because of our organization, the general managers who our real business people in China, these are not just plant managers. They know that they've got to offset whatever pressure are there. whether the government renminbi, whether that be the rages. And the do that for automation, they do that through changing driving material costs down, through working also on price. And so, I think that the same thing that a general manager would do in the West, they would also do in China in terms of looking to offset those challenges that are there.

My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our fourth quarter earnings results conference call. Fourth quarter results were released this m",1045,"Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our fourth quarter earnings results conference call. Fourth quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record fourth quarter, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $950 million, up slightly from Q3 2010 and up 25% in U.S. dollars and local currencies over the fourth quarter of 2009. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in Q4 2010 were up 21% from last year. 
Breaking down sales into our two major components, our Cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was down 7% from last year and 12% from last quarter. The sales decline relate primarily to lower spending in North America and broadband markets. The Interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 28% from last year and 1%, sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $191 million compared to $138 million last year. Operating margin was 20.1% compared to 18.3% last year. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $6.8 million in Q4 2010 compared to $5 million in Q4 2009, 0.7% of sales in both periods. 
From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 12.3%, down from 15.5% last year. The margin decline relates to higher relative material costs, the impact of market price reductions and lower volumes. In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.4% compared to 20.6% last year. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the company's record operating margin achievement of 20.1%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over the fourth quarter of 2009 of approximately 27%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly in the face of increasing global cost pressures. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10.2 million compared to $9.5 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of new accounting rules effective January 1. In 2009, these fees, which were approximately $400,000, were included in other expense.
In the fourth quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 27.2% compared to a rate of 27.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. we currently expect a rate of approximately 27.5% in 2011. Net income in the quarter was approximately 14% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.74 and grew $0.48 over the prior year quarter on an as reported basis and 42% after adjusting the prior year earnings per share for one-time item. This represents an EPS growth rate of approximately 1.7x sales growth, demonstrating the company's significant operating leverage.
Orders for the quarter were $948 million, up 24% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1:1. The company continued the strong focus on balance sheet management in the quarter. Accounts receivable was $719 million, down 1% from the end of Q3. Days sales outstanding were at the high end of the company's normal range of 68 days at the end of 2010, up from 64 days at the end of 2009. In addition, payable days increased from 51 days at the end of 2009 to 54 days at the end of 2010. 
Inventory in the quarter was $549 million, up about 2% from the end of Q3. From a day's perspective, inventory was at 77 days at the end of 2010, down from 80 days at the end of 2009. This is a good performance for the company from a historical perspective, although we continue to focus on improving inventory performance.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $161 million in Q4, over 120% of net income. Cash from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $36 million, were used primarily for capital expenditures of $36 million, acquisition payments relating to previous acquisitions of $15 million and a reduction in borrowings under the company's credit receivable facility of $104 million. 
In addition, the cash and short-term investments increased $29 million to $624 million at the end of the year. Total debt was $800 million and net debt approximately $176 million at year end. In August, as previously reported, the company refinanced its senior credit facility. The new $1 billion facility matures in August of 2014. And at the end of the year, the company had availability under that facility of $896 million.
The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization facility that expires in 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, this facility was accounted for our balance sheet as a sale of receivable. Effective January 1, those rules were changed and the facility was brought on balance sheet, reducing the company's operating cash flow in Q1 of 2010 and for the year by $82 million. At December 31, 2010, borrowings under that facility were $92 million and are reflected as long-term debt. At December 31, '09, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under this facility and were excluded from the balance sheet. 
Operating cash flow for 2010, excluding this accounting change impact, was $507 million, over 100% of net income, supporting the high-quality of the company's earnings. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at less than 1x and 22x, respectively. And EBITDA in the fourth quarter was approximately $226 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.  
Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

And I'd like to take this opportunity to wish all of you a happy new year as we start 2011. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight first the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 achievements for the company, giving a little bit of color to what Diana had just mentioned. I'll discuss the trends and progress in our served markets, and then I'll take a few moments to comment on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2011.
Before going into our performance, however, I would like to recognize one thing. We announced in early December that after 37 years with the company, Martin Loeffler would retire as the Executive Chairman but would continue to serve as non-Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors. I'd like to take this moment on behalf of all the Amphenol employees as well as our Board of Directors to thank Martin for his extraordinary contributions to long-term success of Amphenol. I personally look forward to his continued support as non-Executive Chairman of our Board.
Now with respect to the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased to report record revenues and earnings in what is still a very dynamic economic environment. Revenues increased a very strong 25% from prior year, up slightly from a record third quarter. And we were especially excited to build on our already strong operating margins, achieving, as Diana mentioned, a record return on sales of 20.1%. 
Our achievement of this level of profitability despite the significant inflationary pressures around the world is a clear reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team.
with respective the full year 2010, we're very proud of the strong recovery in our results in 2010, which reached new levels at every stage, revenues of $3,554,000,000, operating margins of 19.7% and earnings per share of $2.82. We're especially pleased that in 2010, we were able to exceed our 2008 sales levels by nearly 10%, while the industry as a whole has not yet necessarily recovered to these pre-crisis levels. 
Our consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of this economic cycle have resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across each of our end markets. In addition, our organization has continued to create innovative technologies, which capitalize on exciting new areas of an ever-expanding electronics market, thereby, broadening the opportunity for our future growth.
in 2010, we have also successfully continued our acquisition program adding three new family members to Amphenol during the course of the year creating all new excellent platforms for future expansion. As we close the year, we find it very rewarding that our entire organization has created an excellent new platform of strength, which creates optimism for our future performance.
Now turning to the specifics of our performance in each of our served markets. The Military and Aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased a very strong 27% from prior year. This strength was broad-based and included especially strength in military vehicles and commercial air applications, together with gains from our recent acquisitions. As expected, our sales were stable in the fourth quarter from the third quarter.
We feel increasingly positive about trends in the Commercial Aircraft market, as existing program volumes grow and as new aircraft platforms will begin to materialize during the course of 2011. Although there remains uncertainty in defense budgets of certain developed economies, we're very optimistic that the increasing electronic content in military equipment, together with our broad program participation and our strong positions in high-growth emerging markets, will continue to drive performance in the future. While we expect demand to remain stable in the first quarter, we look forward to a very strong long-term outlook for this important market for Amphenol.
The Industrial market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this very diverse market increased a very strong 69% from prior year and had a slight increase from the third quarter. Our growth in Industrial was broad-based, but was led especially by sales into the geophysical and oil and gas, alternative energy, factory automation and instrumentation segments of the market. We were very pleased as we close 2010 that we have experienced a very broad-based recovery in virtually all the segments of the Industrial market. While we expect this market to be stable in the first quarter, we continue to be encouraged by a strong outlook in 2011 as our new technologies continue to proliferate into these exciting growth areas.
The Automotive market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased in that market 11% from prior year and a very strong 20%, sequentially, as we benefited from an increase in vehicle volumes as well as the ramp-up of new hybrid electric vehicle platforms. 
We continue to be excited by the new opportunities that we see, which are driven by a rapidly expanding electronics platforms in cars. We expect demand in the Automotive market to strengthen in the first quarter, led by our further progress in these new onboard electronics as well as the ongoing ramp-up of hybrid vehicles.
Sales into the broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market decreased 8% from prior year and declined sequentially by 15%, as the expected seasonal pause in spending by cable operators started earlier than we typically would see. While profitability in this segment continued to be pressured by rising material prices as well as market pricing dynamics, we continue to be encouraged by our increasing position with new Cable and Interconnect products as well as our strong position in international markets. We expect demand in the broadband market to improve seasonally in the first quarter and look forward to realizing further benefits from our diversification efforts.
Our sales into the Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and increased 10% from prior year, although declined by 7%, sequentially, on what was an expected pause in activity by customers in the IT market. We're continuing to see an acceleration of adoption of our broad range of next-generation technologies into networking, storage and servers, creating a strong basis for our long-term positive outlook. While we expect demand to remain at these near-term levels in the first quarter, we're excited by our ongoing new program wins with our advanced new technologies, which position us for a strong 2011 and beyond.
Our sales into the mobile networks market represented 12% of sales in the quarter and increased 12% from prior year, as we benefited from increased buildout of next-generation wireless network. Sales also increased slightly on a sequential basis in what is typically a more seasonally soft fourth quarter. We expect demand to be stable in be first quarter as operators on a worldwide basis continue to invest in network buildout and capacity upgrades in support of the accelerating data usage that's arising out of smart mobile devices. We look forward also to further long-term strength driven by our broad design and position on many new base station platforms.
Our sales into Mobile Device market represented 20% of the total in the quarter, an increase of very strong 58% from prior year and 10%, sequentially, as we benefited from strong sales of new Mobile Devices incorporating our leading Interconnect and antenna products. While we do anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of demand in the first quarter, we remain very excited by our strengthening position in the rapidly expanding range of new smart mobile devices and the growth potential that these create for the company in 2011. Our comprehensive portfolio of products for Mobile Devices, as well as the solid preferred supplier relationships that we have with all major device makers, positions us strongly for the future.
So in summary, I am extremely proud of our entire organization around the world as we continue to execute well in a very dynamic demand environment. Our achievement of these new records in sales, earnings and especially operating profitability is extremely rewarding, especially given the many challenges that we see in the marketplace. 
Our success is reflected in these new record results as a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure and very importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2011. With the more normal market conditions that we are seeing and that we foresee for the future, we are pleased to be able to return to our custom of now providing once again full year guidance for our performance. 
Based on content exchange rates and normal seasonal patterns, we now expect in the first quarter and the full year of 2011 the following results: We expect sales in the range of $925 million to $940 million and $3,885,000,000  to $3,960,000,000, respectively. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.72 and $3 to $3.10, respectively. For the full year, this guidance represents the sales in EPS growth of 9% to 11% and 11% to 15%, respectively. 
We are very encouraged by the strong outlook for sales and earnings. And I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these do record levels of performance and to capitalize on the many, many opportunities to expand our market position as well as our profitability for the future. 
At this time, operator, we'd be happy to entertain any questions that there may be."

In 2009, obviously, we were down less than half. Last year, we will see what the final results are, but I think it will turn out also that we at least grew close to the level of industry even though we were down by less than half in '09. And that has come from really some very simple strategic principles that we think have allowed us to take share in such an industry. First and foremost has been a drive technology. And we have seen over the last several years and really an acceleration over the last several years that the requirements for technology in Interconnect products are truly accelerating. With the demands on speed, with the demands on harsh environments, the miniaturization, all of these things have put requirements on Interconnect products that make it more and more difficult for niche companies to survive. And that has allowed us, through a broad range of technologies and a real leading innovation, to take new positions at customers that we didn't necessarily have. so that has clearly been a great effort. I think another driver of that kind of above average growth has been over many years the desire of customers to consolidate their supply base, and that does not change. We have seen that, certainly, in a very mature fashion in the IT and the telecom industries. And we start to see that more and more over the last couple of years in mil aero and Industrial. As those companies get more sophisticated in how they manage their supply chain, once again, they're looking for a supplier who can be truly a partner for them on a broad basis of Interconnect technology. I think our acquisition program, and Diana mentioned that in the past, that has generated over many years somewhere around a third of our growth. And that acquisition program plays very well into those two elements, both the supplier consolidation where we find these growing companies, as well as the innovation of technology where we're able to continually add to the various portfolios of technology that we have in the many markets that we serve. So I think with all of that, we see just tremendous opportunities. The segments of the market that are really still so exciting, the data in Mobility, the electronic proliferation, and Aerospace, and Industrial and in Automotive. And these are just tremendous trends, which we believe will, for Amphenol, are going to continue to allow us to outperform the industry."

I think lead times, we have not seen among our own lead times any significant variation. I just recalled that throughout this whole cycle, we really never did see any generalized increase of our lead times through that whole recovery in anyway that upset customers. In fact, we're very proud at the year end, we were recognized by several of our customers in a very public fashion by them in front of other suppliers to say, you never disappointed us this year in a year where virtually everybody else did. And that's not just talking about our industry, it's their entire supply base. And I think a lot of credit goes to our organization around the world for having managed in a very flexible fashion through the downturn and then the follow on upswing that we've tamed. Relative to inventories, again, we have said in the past and this still remains the case, that we don't have full visibility on the inventory of our customers, with the exception of the small percent of sales that we have through distribution, which is somewhat less than 15% today. And in that area, we have not seen any significant big moves. They're always little moves either way, but we have not seen any trends in the fourth quarter in the inventories of our distributors nor have we heard in other markets. I think the only area where I would comment is we mentioned and I mentioned in my remarks that in the IT market where we did see a sequential downturn, we saw somewhat of a pause in buying activity. if that is somehow also related to inventory to a certain IT customer, again, I don't have that visibility into their warehouses but it would not shock me if it were the case that some of that pause that we saw in the sequential basis in the fourth quarter could have been related to inventory corrections in that market."

And I wouldn't be able to break it down so specifically for you, but what I can tell you is there is certainly substantial contribution from both of those things that you talk about, both the volume, which on a global basis, vehicle volumes here I think hits something like 73 million, 74 million cars which was I think a 20%, 25% increase over the year early so clearly, there has been a strong overall volume increase for the full year. But in addition, we have certainly seen the ramp-up of this hybrid platforms and the ramp-up of new electronics. Well, one thing that is really very exciting for us is we've seen the proliferation of electronics beyond just kind of the headline high-end cars. And more and more, you're seeing the electronic functionalities that maybe were prototypes in a high-end car being then spread and proliferated across cars at all levels. And that can be true with airbags, that can be true with onboard infotainment, that can be true with telematics with anti-lock brakes. Whatever it is, this niche electronic applications that our kind of our bread and butter in the Automotive industry have started proliferate across more and more car platforms, which is really a response of the automakers to the fact that, that's where they can make money. And so they see that these options allow them to make higher margins. And I think they are really rushing to push them into every car platform. And so from a future standpoint, I think whether it is volume growth, whether it is the proliferation of electronics, whether it is these new hybrids coming up, and those are all can be good drivers of growth for us for the future. Automotive remains for us one of our smallest markets. And we're excited about our niche position in that market as it relates to those new applications having further proliferation."

I mean, there was -- Industrial was one of the hardest hit markets in 2009, you may certainly recall. And I think during that time, our organization really circled the wagons and focused on accelerating the innovation efforts that we had and the interaction with customers so that as that market came back, we can get kind of a lever effect on that growth by having also the new products coming in. Relative to energy, I mean, we have actually seen really strong growth in the quarter in alternative energy, which has been a market that's really supported us through 2010 and help to offset some of the pain in 2009. These are efforts into things like solar and wind and a variety of other new, exciting growth markets and alternative energy. But also, the geophysical market is one where we are very strong, both through some organic product development over the years and acquisitions we have made throughout the years. And that market also grew very, very strongly in the quarter. But those are not the only ones. We saw a real strength in motion control. We saw strength in instrumentation, strength in medical. On across-the-board basis, our strategy of really attacking on a broad basis the Industrial market with niche-focus strategies across each of the segments with new technologies has proven, I think, to be a very successful strategy in the short term and will be a successful one for the long term for that market for us."

I think, I mentioned that we feel very good about Commercial Air. And we feel good about Commercial Air really because, it is not a secret, the companies, the manufacturers continue to announce upgrades for their production schedules in response to the demand from customers for new high-technology airplanes that essentially can save fuel. And so in the end, that fuel saving and with a price of oil having done what it does, becoming more and more important, that gives us a great deal of optimism for the future because all of these new platforms are really tied around the ability to use less fuel whether it be the 787, the A35. Certainly, even with the delays and I think there were even some announced today on the 787, the plane will fly. I have said it many times and I continue do to believe it was a tremendous amount of conviction, because airlines need that plane. And we just have a much higher content on these new platforms because of the complexity of electronics. Now relative to the military, we believe, also and I believe personally very strongly, that, yes, there may be budget restrictions, but in the developed markets specifically in the U.S. and in the European markets, the demand for electronic functionality is going to create further opportunities for us this year and beyond, and I see that really. In the last couple of weeks, you may have seen that there was another announcement by Secretary Gates with respect to the budget. And in these, in fact, what comes true in this budgetary announcement is they are pushing for a lot of savings. I think they talked about some $78 billion in savings, which are coming not from equipment purchases but rather from things like reducing the cost of health insurance, reducing the number of flag officers, streamlining procurement, reducing contractors. all these things, and then not taking that money out of a budget but rather reallocating it to equipment upgrades. And they're talking about electronic upgrades of planes, they're talking new UAVs, they're talking about you radar systems, new long-range bombers. And yes, they talked maybe about a couple of programs that were a little bit more speculative from the get-go to be canceled. But in fact, we believe that, that electronic proliferation is something that the military recognizes as a real requirement for the future, and one where Amphenol is very well positioned to participate. And then the final thing I would mention is the emerging markets. And we continue to see these emerging markets, places like India in particular, where the long-range growth prospects for our participation with the military are excellent. And so with all of that on balance between the Commercial Air and the Military and what we see, we continue to have a very positive outlook for the Military/Aerospace market in the future. If Military/Aerospace were to grow at kind of the average rate that we have guided, that would very strong performance historically for Aerospace. And I think that we feel positive about that and look forward to that strong performance."

It certainly does show the commitment that we do have to continue a margin expansion in the business. I think particularly if you look at the Interconnect margins, which were almost 22.5% ROI in the quarter, this is I think the part of the business where we would see the potential, as you say, as we grow the top line with really technology-focused products and continue to drive for low cost. This has been the combination that's worked for us in the past in terms of margin expansion and in the Interconnect portion of the business and specifically where the vast majority of our operating units are involved in.

What I can tell you, which is more of the qualitative reason that I get from meeting with customers, talking to our sales teams who's meeting also with customers around the world, is that are very excited and they see those same trends that I talk about. In mobility, the demand that's created by the smart mobile devices. In Military -- and there's just no question in the Military that these electronics are proliferating. You go -- I mean, I encourage you to read the transcript of Gates' press conference when he talked about these budget transformation. The word electronic upgrade was listed so many times in here. And that's something that we're hearing from our customers, and that they're very excited to hear as well. And so I think that these are trends that our customers are seeing, and they feel like their feet are a little bit more on solid ground. And we have seen that. There have been already in this earning season a couple of releases in the technology industry, which have been not so bad, I think. And I think that, that gives further credibility to that sense of confidence that we have. It was not without a lot of consideration that we went through to make that decision to issue a full year guidance at this time. And that was really based on our conviction that we were kind of back to normal, whatever normal may be, but certainly back to a normal that was not the last two years."

India is certainly a market that we know very well, and we watch it very carefully. And I think I have commented over the last couple of calls that we'll see when they build it, they will build it at a certain time when it's most opportune for India from a cost standpoint. What clearly seems the case is that operators in India start to move more towards the build phase of 3G. What we do understand is that the OEM or the manufacturer of the equipment and really the breakdown of who is getting what awards in India is very different this time around than it was in the 2G. For all of the talk, of politics about Chinese vendors and everything else, the Chinese seem to have done an excellent job in terms of positioning themselves with a lot of presence in India. They talk in India, I'm sure you're very familiar Brian, with circles, and who has how many circles in India. And it appears that the Chinese have gained nearly as many circles as the two other large Western players. And that others who in the past would have participated have maybe been a little bit more left out in India. I can tell you that we participate with all of the OEMs who stand to gain in India. What I can tell you also, though, is that the 3G buildout in India is going to be based on equipment, which may not be necessarily this kind of large refrigerator-type cabinet base station of the past, but moreover, it will be this more modular base station, more flexible, cheaper to install, easier to install in the field, which in India is a very important criteria for the operators. And so what that means -- what that translates to for us is that we will certainly benefit, and we have a strong position with those base stations. The content in a small base station naturally would be less than the content in the large base station. If there are more of them, you can make up for that. So we continue to mind it very carefully, and we're very well positioned for that buildout, which we certainly hope to come here in the year. It won't be in India though as China was, which is all of India will build it and then they turn it on, on one day because you have so many operators, so many different circles. And I think there are some 65, 70 circles in India who each are going to have a different schedule in which they will build their network. And so I wouldn't anticipate a real sort of one-off hit that would come from India, but rather that can be a general positive for us for the year and for beyond."

We continue to expand the types of products that we get designed in on. And that is not just all one customer or another but really on a broad basis. And that market, whether that be smartphones or whether it'd be tablets or whatever other new device is going to be released in the future, we are really viewed by the major OEMs in that market as a partner of choice. And so, that's excellent. And from a net-net relative to PCs and laptops, where we have very little participation, that can be a driver of growth for us in the future. Because as the devices become mobile, the demand to put upon the Interconnect and the antennas are much, much more significant than they were for just a simple laptop or a PC."

We're very much by virtue of the organizational structure that we have where we have 70 general managers around the world, each of them operating really at the slightly different context, we're able to tailor-make our reactions. There are certainly operations who are saying is China the right place for me to be? There are others who are saying I got to go to China right now because I'm not yet there. And so that really runs the entire spectrum in Amphenol. I think that with respect to China, which is a very important market for us, China is also not just a monolith. You have, in Western China, opportunities, you have outside of the places like Shenzhen and Shanghai opportunities. By virtue of our organization, the fact that we have today in China 24 operations around the country, we have an experience operating essentially everywhere in the country and in every context in the country. That allows us really a leg up where when we see a pressure in one area and we decide to slowly migrate to another, it is not just a greenfield start-up where we have to go commission studies about what's the environment, what are the labor regulations, what are the environmental regulations. We're already an expert essentially everywhere in China. And that gives us a significant leg up. We have also seen strong progress of our facilities in other geographies in India, in Eastern Europe, in Africa, in Latin America. So there are going to be and there are in Amphenol other options in China. The other thing is because of our organization, the general managers who our real business people in China, these are not just plant managers, they know that they've got to offset whatever pressures are there, whether that be the renminbi  whether that be the wages. And they do that through automation. They do that through changing sourcing, through driving material costs down, through working also on price. And so I think that the same thing that a general manager would do in the West, he would also do in China in terms of looking to offset those challenges that are there. 
Well, at this time, we'd like to once again, on behalf of Diana and I and our whole team, thank you, all, and wish you a happy new year. And we wish you a very successful completion to January and the Q1 and look forward to talking to you here in about three months. Thank you."

My name’s Diana Reardon and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Fourth quarter results were released this morning.",1040,"Thank you. Good afternoon. My name’s Diana Reardon and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Fourth quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record fourth quarter, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $950 million, up slightly from Q3 2010 and up 25% in U.S. dollars and local currencies over the fourth quarter of 2009. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in Q4 2010 were up 21% from last year. 
Breaking down sales into our two major components. Our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 7% from last year and 12% from last quarter. The sales declines relate primarily to lower spending in North American broadband markets. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 28% from last year and 1% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $191 million compared to $138 million last year. Operating margin was 20.1% compared to 18.3% last year. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $6.8 million in Q4 2010 compared to $5 million in Q4 2009, 0.7% of sales in both periods. 
From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 12.3%, down from 15.5% last year. The margin decline relates to higher relative material costs, the impact of market price reductions and lower volume. In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.4% compared to 20.6% last year. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the company's record operating margin achievement of 20.1%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over the fourth quarter of 2009 of approximately 27%. This is excellent performance in any environment but particularly in the face of increasing global cost pressures. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10.2 million compared to $9.5 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of new accounting rules effective January 1. In 2009, these fees, which were approximately $400,000, were included in other expense.
In the fourth quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 27.2% compared to a rate of 27.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. We currently expect a rate of approximately 27½% in 2011. Net income in the quarter was approximately 14% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.74 and grew $0.48 over the prior-year quarter on an as-reported basis and 42% after adjusting the prior-year earnings per share for one-time items. This represents an EPS growth rate of approximately 1.7x sales growth, demonstrating the company's significant operating leverage.
Orders for the quarter were $948 million, up 24% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1:1. The company continued its strong focus on balance sheet management in the quarter. Accounts receivable was $719 million, down 1% from the end of Q3. Days sales outstanding were at the high end of the company's normal range at 68 days at the end of 2010, up from 64 days at the end of 2009. In addition, payable days increased from 51 days at the end of 2009 to 54 days at the end of 2010. 
Inventory in the quarter was $549 million, up about 2% from the end of Q3. From a days perspective, inventory was at 77 days at the end of 2010, down from 80 days at the end of 2009. This is a good performance for the company from a historical perspective, although we continue to focus on improving inventory performance.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $161 million in Q4, over 120% of net income. Cash from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $36 million, were used primarily for capital expenditures of $36 million, acquisition payments relating to previous acquisitions of $15 million and a reduction in borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $104 million. 
In addition, cash and short-term investments increased $29 million to $624 million at the end of the year. Total debt was $800 million and net debt approximately $176 million at year end. In August, as previously reported, the company refinanced its senior credit facility. The new $1 billion facility matures in August of 2014. And at the end of the year, the company had availability under that facility of $896 million.
The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization facility that expires in 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, this facility was accounted for off balance sheet as a sale of receivable. Effective January 1, those rules were changed and the facility was brought on balance sheet, reducing the company's operating cash flow in Q1 of 2010 and for the year by $82 million. At December 31, 2010, borrowings under that facility were $92 million and are reflected as long-term debt. At December 31, '09, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under this facility and were excluded from the balance sheet. 
Operating cash flow for 2010, excluding this accounting change impact, was $507 million, over 100% of net income, supporting the high quality of the company's earnings. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at less than 1x and 22x, respectively. And EBITDA in the fourth quarter was approximately $226 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.  
Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

And I'd like to take this opportunity to wish all of you a happy new year as we start 2011. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight first the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 achievements for the company, giving a little bit of color to what Diana has just mentioned. I'll discuss the trends and progress in our served markets, and then I'll take a few moments to comment on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2011.
Before going into our performance, however, I would like to recognize one thing. We announced in early December that after 37 years with the company, Martin Loeffler would retire as the Executive Chairman but would continue to serve as non-Executive Chairman of our board of directors. I'd like to take this moment on behalf of all the Amphenol employees as well as our board of directors to thank Martin for his extraordinary contributions to long-term success of Amphenol. I personally look forward to his continued support as non-Executive Chairman of our board.
Now with respect to the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased to report record revenues and earnings in what is still a very dynamic economic environment. Revenues increased a very strong 25% from prior year, up slightly from a record third quarter. And we were especially excited to build on our already strong operating margins, achieving, as Diana mentioned, a record return on sales of 20.1%. 
Our achievement of this level of profitability despite the significant inflationary pressures around the world is a clear reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team.
With respective the full year 2010, we're very proud of the strong recovery in our results in 2010, which reached new levels at every stage: revenues of $3,554,000,000, operating margins of 19.7% and earnings per share of $2.82. We're especially pleased that in 2010 we were able to exceed our 2008 sales levels by nearly 10%, while the industry as a whole has not yet necessarily recovered to those pre-crisis levels. 
Our consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of this economic cycle have resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across each of our end markets. In addition, our organization has continued to create innovative technologies, which capitalize on exciting new areas of an ever-expanding electronics market, thereby, broadening the opportunity for our future growth.
In 2010, we have also successfully continued our acquisition program adding three new family members to Amphenol during the course of the year creating all new excellent platforms for future expansion. As we close the year, we find it very rewarding that our entire organization has created an excellent new platform of strength, which creates optimism for our future performance.
Now turning to the specifics of our performance in each of our served markets. The Military and Aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased a very strong 27% from prior year. This strength was broad-based and included especially strength in military vehicles and commercial air applications, together with gains from our recent acquisitions. As expected, our sales were stable in the fourth quarter from the third quarter.
We feel increasingly positive about trends in the Commercial Aircraft market, as existing program volumes grow and as new aircraft platforms will begin to materialize during the course of 2011. Although there remains uncertainty in defense budgets of certain developed economies, we're very optimistic that the increasing electronic content in military equipment, together with our broad program participation and our strong positions in high-growth emerging markets, will continue to drive performance in the future. While we expect demand to remain stable in the first quarter, we look forward to a very strong long-term outlook for this important market for Amphenol.
The Industrial market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this very diverse market increased a very strong 69% from prior year and had a slight increase from the third quarter. Our growth in Industrial was broad-based but was led especially by sales into the geophysical and oil and gas, alternative energy, factory automation and instrumentation segments of the market. We are very pleased as we close 2010 that we have experienced a very broad-based recovery in virtually all the segments of the Industrial market. While we expect this market to be stable in the first quarter, we continue to be encouraged by a strong outlook in 2011 as our new technologies continue to proliferate into these exciting growth areas.
The Automotive market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased in that market 11% from prior year and a very strong 20%, sequentially, as we benefited from an increase in vehicle volumes as well as the ramp-up of new hybrid electric vehicle platforms. 
We continue to be excited by the new opportunities that we see, which are driven by a rapidly expanding electronics platforms in cars. We expect demand in the Automotive market to strengthen in the first quarter, led by our further progress in these new onboard electronics as well as the ongoing ramp-up of hybrid vehicles.
Sales into the Broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market decreased 8% from prior year and declined sequentially by 15%, as the expected seasonal pause in spending by cable operators started earlier than we typically would see. While profitability in this segment continued to be pressured by rising material prices as well as market pricing dynamics, we continue to be encouraged by our increasing position with new Cable and Interconnect products as well as our strong position in international markets. We expect demand in the broadband market to improve seasonally in the first quarter and look forward to realizing further benefits from our diversification efforts.
Our sales into the Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and increased 10% from prior year, although declined by 7% sequentially on what was an expected pause in activity by customers in the IT market. We're continuing to see an acceleration of adoption of our broad range of next-generation technologies into networking, storage and servers, creating a strong basis for our long-term positive outlook. While we expect demand to remain at these near-term levels in the first quarter, we're excited by our ongoing new program wins with our advanced new technologies, which position us for a strong 2011 and beyond.
Our sales into the Mobile Networks market represented 12% of sales in the quarter and increased 12% from prior year, as we benefited from increased build out of next-generation wireless networks. Sales also increased slightly on a sequential basis in what is typically our more seasonally soft fourth quarter. We expect demand to be stable in be first quarter as operators on a worldwide basis continue to invest in network build outs and capacity upgrades in support of the accelerating data usage that's arising out of smart mobile devices. We look forward also to further long-term strength driven by our broad design and position on many new base station platforms.
Our sales into the Mobile Device market represented 20% of the total in the quarter, an increase of very strong 58% from prior year and 10% sequentially, as we benefited from strong sales of new Mobile Devices incorporating our leading Interconnect and antenna products. While we do anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of demand in the first quarter, we remain very excited by our strengthening position in the rapidly expanding range of new smart mobile devices and the growth potential that these create for the company in 2011. Our comprehensive portfolio of products for Mobile Devices, as well as the solid preferred supplier relationships that we have with all major device makers, positions us strongly for the future.
So in summary, I am extremely proud of our entire organization around the world as we continue to execute well in a very dynamic demand environment. Our achievement of these new records in sales, earnings and especially operating profitability is extremely rewarding, especially given the many challenges that we see in the marketplace. 
Our success as reflected in these new record results is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure and very importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2011. With the more normal market conditions that we are seeing and that we foresee for the future, we are pleased to be able to return to our custom of now providing once again full year guidance for our performance. 
Based on content exchange rates and normal seasonal patterns, we now expect in the first quarter and the full year of 2011 the following results: We expect sales in the range of $925 million to $940 million and $3,885,000,000 to $3,960,000,000, respectively. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.72 and $3 to $3.10, respectively. For the full year, this guidance represents sales and EPS growth of 9% to 11% and 11% to 15%, respectively. 
We are very encouraged by the strong outlook for sales and earnings. And I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these do record levels of performance and to capitalize on the many, many opportunities to expand our market position as well as our profitability for the future. 
At this time, operator, we'd be happy to entertain any questions that there may be."

In 2009, obviously, we were down less than half. Last year, we will see what the final results are, but I think it will turn out also that we at least grew close to the level of the industry even though we were down by less than half in '09. And that has come from really some very simple strategic principles that we think have allowed us to take share in such an industry. First and foremost has been a drive technology. And we have seen over the last several years and really an acceleration over the last several years that the requirements for technology in Interconnect products are truly accelerating. With the demands on speeds, with the demands on harsh environments, the miniaturization, all of these things have put requirements on Interconnect products that make it more and more difficult for niche companies to survive. And that has allowed us, through a broad range of technologies and a real leading innovation, to take new positions at customers that we didn't necessarily have. So that has clearly been a great effort. I think another driver of that kind of above-average growth has been over many years the desire of customers to consolidate the supply base, and that does not change. We have seen that, certainly, in a very mature fashion in the IT and the telecom industries. And we start to see that more and more over the last couple of years in mil aero and Industrial. Those companies get more sophisticated in how they manage their supply chain. Once again, they're looking for a supplier who can be truly a partner for them on a broad basis of Interconnect technologies. I think our acquisition program, and Diana mentioned that in the past, that has generated over many years somewhere around a third of our growth. And that acquisition program plays very well into those two elements, both the supplier consolidation where we find these strong companies, as well as the innovation of technology where we're able to continually add to the various portfolios of technology that we have in the many markets that we serve. So I think that with all of that, we see just tremendous opportunities. The segments of the market that are really still so exciting, the data in Mobility, the electronic proliferation in Aerospace and Industrial and in Automotive, I mean, these are just tremendous trends, which we believe will, for Amphenol, are going to continue to allow us to outperform the industry."

And I wouldn't be able to break it down so specifically for you, but what I can tell you is there is certainly substantial contribution from both of those things that you talk about, both the volume, which on a global basis, vehicle volumes this year I think hit something like 73, 74 million cars which was I think a 20%, 25% increase over the year early, so clearly, there has been a strong overall volume increase for the full year. But in addition, we have certainly seen the ramp-up of this hybrid platforms and the ramp-up of new electronics. Well, one thing that is really very exciting for us is we've seen the proliferation of electronics beyond just kind of the headline high-end cars. And more and more, you're seeing the electronic functionalities that maybe were prototypes in a high-end car being then spread and proliferated across cars at all levels. And that can be true with airbags, that can be true with onboard infotainment, that can be true with telematics, with anti-lock brakes. Whatever it is, these niche electronic applications that our kind of our bread and butter in the Automotive industry have started to proliferate across more and more car platforms, which is really a response of the automakers to the fact that that's where they can make money. And so they see that these options allow them to make higher margins. And I think they are really rushing to push them into every car platform. And so from a future standpoint, I think whether it is volume growth, whether it is the proliferation of electronics, whether it is these new hybrids coming up. Those can be good drivers of growth for us for the future. Automotive remains for us one of our smallest markets. And we're excited about our niche position in that market as it relates to those new applications having further proliferation."

I mean, Industrial was one of the hardest hit markets in 2009, you may certainly recall. And I think during that time, our organization really circled the wagons and focused on accelerating the innovation efforts that we had and the interaction with customers so that as that market came back, we could get kind of a lever effect on that growth by having also the new product coming in. Relative to energy, I mean, we have actually seen really strong growth in the quarter in alternative energy, which has been a market that's really supported us through 2010 and help to offset some of the pain in 2009. These are efforts into things like solar and wind and a variety of other new, exciting growth markets and alternative energy. But also, the geophysical market is one where we are very strong, both through some organic product development over the years and acquisitions we have made throughout the years. And that market also grew very, very strongly in the quarter. But those are not the only ones. We saw real strength in motion control. We saw strength in instrumentation, strength in medical. On an across-the-board basis, our strategy of really attacking on a broad basis the Industrial market with niche-focused strategies across each of the segments with new technologies has proven, I think, to be a very successful strategy in the short term and will be a successful one for the long term for that market for us."

I think I mentioned that we feel very good about Commercial Air. And we feel good about Commercial Air really because, as is not a secret, the companies, the manufacturers continue to announce upgrades to their production schedules in response to the demand from customers for new high-technology airplanes that essentially can save fuel. And so in the end, that fuel saving and with the price of oil having done what it does, becoming more and more important, that gives us a great deal of optimism for the future because all of these new platforms are really tied around the ability to use less fuel whether it be the 787, the A350. Certainly, even with the delays and I think there were even some announced today on the 787, the plane will fly. I have said it many times and I continue do to believe it with a tremendous amount of conviction, because the airlines need that plane. And we just have a much higher content on these new platforms because of the complexity of electronics. Now relative to the military, I mean, we believe, also and I believe personally very strongly, that, yes, there may be budget restrictions but that in the developed markets, specifically in the U.S. and in the European markets, the demand for electronic functionality is going to create further opportunities for us this year and beyond, and I see that really -- in the last couple of weeks, you may have seen that there was another announcement by Secretary Gates with respect to the budget. And in this, in fact, what comes true in this budgetary announcement is they are pushing for a lot of savings. I think they talked about some $78 billion in savings, which are coming not from equipment purchases but rather from things like reducing the cost of health insurance, reducing the number of flag officers, streamlining procurement, reducing contractors, all these things, and then not taking that money out of a budget but rather reallocating it to equipment upgrades. And they're talking about electronic upgrades of planes; they're talking new UAVs; they're talking about you radar systems, new long-range bombers. And yes, they talked maybe about a couple of programs that were a little bit more speculative from the get-go to be canceled. But in fact, we believe that, that electronic proliferation is something that the military recognizes as a real requirement for the future, and one where Amphenol is very well positioned to participate. And then the final thing I would mention is the emerging markets. I mean, we continue to see these emerging markets, places like India in particular, where the long-range growth prospects for our participation with the military are excellent. And so with all of that on balance between the Commercial Air, the Military and what we see, we continue to have a very positive outlook for the Military/Aerospace market in the future. I mean, if Military/Aerospace were to grow at kind of the average rate that we have guided, that would very strong performance historically for Aerospace. And I think that we feel positive about that and look forward to that strong performance."

I think particularly if you look at the Interconnect margins, which were almost 22½% ROS in the quarter, this is I think the part of the business where we would see the potential, as you say, as we grow the top line with really technology-focused products and continue to drive for low cost. This has been the combination that's worked so well for us in the past in terms of margin expansion and in the Interconnect portion of the business, specifically where the vast majority of our operating units are involved in.

So I wouldn't have any read necessarily from customers from the forecast standpoint. What I can tell you, which is more the qualitative reason that I get from meeting with customers, talking to our sales teams who's meeting also with customers around the world, is that customers are very excited and they see those same trends that I talk about. In mobility, the demand that's created by the smart mobile devices. In Military, I mean, there's just no question in the Military that these electronics are proliferating.

There have been already in this earning season a couple of releases in the technology industry which have been not so bad, I think. And I think that, that gives further credibility to that sense of confidence that we have. It was not without a lot of consideration that we went through to make that decision to issue a full year guidance at this time.

And I think I have commented over the last couple of calls that we'll see when they build it, they will build it at a certain time when it's most opportune for India from a cost standpoint. And what clearly seems the case is that operators in India start to move more towards the build phase of 3G. What we do understand is that the OEM or the manufacturer of the equipment and really the breakdown of who is getting what awards in India is very different this time around than it was in the 2G. I mean, for all of the talk, of politics about Chinese vendors and everything else, the Chinese seem to have done an excellent job in terms of positioning themselves with a lot of presence in India. They talk in India, I'm sure you're very familiar Brian, with circles and who has how many circles in India. And it appears that the Chinese have gained nearly as many circles as the two other large Western players. And that others who, in the past would have participated, have maybe been a little bit more left out in India. I can tell you that we participate with all of the OEMs who stand to gain in India. What I can tell you also, though, is that the 3G build out in India is going to be based on equipment which may not be necessarily this kind of large refrigerator-type cabinet base station of the past, but moreover, it will be these more modular base station, more flexible, cheaper to install, easier to install in the field, which in India is a very important criteria for the operators. And so what that translates to for us is that we will certainly benefit, and we have a strong position with those base stations. The content in a small base station naturally would be less than the content in the large base station. If there are more of them, you can make up for that. So we continue to mind it very carefully, and we're very well positioned for that build out, which we certainly hope to come here in the year. It won't be in India, though, as China was, which is all of India will build it and then they turn it on, on one day because you have so many operators, so many different circles. And I think there are some 65, 70 circles in India who each are going to have a different schedule in which they will build their network. And so I wouldn't anticipate a real sort of one-off hit that would come from India, but rather that can be a general positive for us for the year and for beyond."

And that market, whether that be Smart phones or whether it'd be tablets or whatever other new device that’s going to be released in the future, we are really viewed by the major OEMs in that market as a partner of choice. And so, that's excellent. And from a net-net relative to PCs and laptops, where we had very little participation, that can be a driver of growth for us in the future. Because as the devices become mobile, the demand to put upon the Interconnect and the antennas are much, much more significant than they were for just a simple laptop or a PC."

How are we going to react on a global basis to something?” We're very much by virtue of the organizational structure that we have where we have 70 general managers around the world, each of them operating really at a slightly different context, we're able to tailor-make our reactions. There are certainly operations who are saying is China the right place for me to be? There are others who are saying I got to go to China right now because I'm not yet there. And so that really runs the entire spectrum in Amphenol. I think that with respect to China, which is a very important market for us, China is also not just a monolith. You have, in Western China, opportunities; you have outside of the places like Shenzhen and Shanghai opportunities. By virtue of our organization, the fact that we have today in China 24 operations around the country, we have an experience operating essentially everywhere in the country and in every context in the country. That allows us really to have really a leg up where when we see a pressure in one area and we decide to slowly migrate to another, it is not just a greenfield start-up where we have to go commission studies about what's the environment, what are the labor regulations, what are the environmental regulations. We're already an expert essentially everywhere in China. And that gives us a significant leg up. We have also seen strong progress of our facilities in other geographies in India, in Eastern Europe, in Africa, in Latin America. So there are going to be and there are in Amphenol other options in China. The other thing is because of our organization, the general managers who are real business people in China, these are not just plant managers, they know that they've got to offset whatever pressures are there, whether that be the renminbi  whether that be the wages. And they do that through automation. They do that through changing sourcing, through driving material costs down, through working also on price. And so I think that the same thing that a general manager would do in the West, he would also do in China in terms of looking to offset those challenges that are there. 
Well, at this time, we'd like to once again, on behalf of Diana and I and our whole team, thank you, all, and wish you a happy new year. And we wish you a very successful completion to January and the Q1 and look forward to talking to you here in about three months. Thank you."

Results were released this morning. I will provid",1162,"Thank you. Good afternoon. My name’s Diana Reardon and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. And we'd like to welcome you all to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. 
Results were released this morning. I will provide a financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed the first quarter with sales of $941 million and EPS of $0.72, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and meeting the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 22% in U.S. dollars and 21% in the local currencies over Q1 of 2010. From an organic standpoint excluding the effects of currency and acquisitions, sales in Q1 2011 were up 17% over last year.  From a sequential standpoint, sales were down 1% from a record Q4 2010. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our cable business, which comprised 7% of sales in the quarter, was down 6% from last year and up 7% from last quarter. The sales decline from last year relates primarily to lower spending in North American broadband markets. The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 25% from last year and down about 2% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $186 million compared to $145 million last year. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 18.8% last year. Operating income in both periods is net of stock option expense of about 0.7% of sales or $6.3 million in the 2011 quarter and $5.4 million in the 2010 quarter. From a segment standpoint in the cable business, margins were 11.8% down from 14.9% last year. The margin decline relates primarily due to higher raw material costs and lower volume.
In the interconnect business, margins were 22.1% compared to 21.1% last year. The improvement in margin of about 1% reflects the benefit of higher volume combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs. Overall, we're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.8%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over last year of about 24%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly in the face of unprecedented global cost pressures.  We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to continue to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million both this year and last year, reflecting a similar average debt level and interest rate. Other income was $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, up from about $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.5% compared to 26.1% last year. The prior year quarter included a onetime benefit of about $1.9 million or $0.01 per share from a reduction in tax expense for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of certain prior year audits. We currently expect a rate of about 27.5% for the remainder of this year.
Net income was approximately 14% of sales, a very strong performance. And diluted earnings for the first quarter grew 29% over the prior year on an as-reported basis and 31% after adjusting the prior year earnings per share for the onetime tax benefit.
Orders in the quarter were a record $961 million, up 16% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.02:1. The company continues to be an generator of cash. And cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $108 million, about 83% of net income in the quarter. Operating cash flow in Q1 is net of a $15 million contribution to the company's U.S. defined benefit plan and a 7% sequential increase in the operating component of working capital, reflecting an increase in inventory and receivables, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances.
Inventory increased about 10% over December to $603 million in the quarter, resulting in inventory days of about 85. Approximately 1/2 the inventory increase relates to higher investment in raw materials in the quarter. We consider this higher investment prudent, given the potential for disruptions in the broader supply chain resulting from events in Japan and the potential for further significant increases in commodity costs. The remaining increase is to support sequentially higher sales in Q2.
Accounts receivable was $744 million at the end of March, up 4% from the end of December, reflecting the heavy weighting of sales in March in the quarter. Days sales outstanding increased 3 days to 71 days at the end of March, up from 68 days at the end of December. In addition, accounts payable increased about 8% to $414 million at the end of the quarter. Payable days increased from 54 days at the end of 2010 to 59 days at the end of March, reflecting both the higher overall inventory producing level and the proportion of activities for the quarter that occurred in March. I would also add that the foreign exchange impact from the weaker dollar added about 1 day to all of these metrics for inventory, receivable and payable days at the end of the quarter.  In the second quarter, we would expect to see operating working capital and the related turnover metrics improve back to our historical norms, although we may to hold a slightly higher raw material inventory level. 
Our cash flow from operations of $108 million, along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $150 million and $17 million in proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises, were used primarily for $23 million of capital expenditures, an increase in cash and cash investments of $67 million and the purchase of about 3.5 million of shares of the company's stock for approximately $189 million under the company's stock buyback program. The company has about 16 million shares remaining under the 20 million shares stock buyback program that we announced earlier this year. And if you recall, the program expires in January of 2014.
At the end of March, the cash and short-term investments were $691 million, the majority of which continues to be held outside the U.S. And debt at the end of March was $906 -- $950 million, excuse me, bringing net debt to approximately $260 million at the end of the quarter. At March 31, the company had availability under its revolving credit facility of about $0.75 billion. And the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1x and 22x respectively. EBITDA in the quarter was $222 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was a very strong quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

And I would like to add my own welcome to all of you on the phone today at the time of our first quarter earnings call. I'll spend a little bit of time to highlight some of our first quarter achievements. I'll then discuss the trends in the progress in our served markets. And then I'll finish up by commenting on our outlook for the second quarter as well as for the full year of 2011.
As Diana just detailed, the first quarter was an excellent start to 2011 for Amphenol with the company reaching the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings per share, despite significant cost challenges and continued dynamic market condition. Revenues in the quarter grew a very strong 22% from prior year, reaching $941 million. And orders reached a new record of $961 million. Despite significant and pervasive challenges on costs around the world, the Amphenol operating team executed extremely well in the quarter. And we're very proud to have achieved operating margins of 19.8%. 
We also continued to generate excellent cash flow of $108 million, used in particular for our latest acquisition as well as the renewal of our stock buyback program. These results are a direct possession of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and the entrepreneurial management team of Amphenol.
In the quarter as mentioned, we completed the acquisition of a European and North American-based manufacturer of specialized, high-technology automotive lighting interconnect products. This company has annual sales of approximately $50 million. This acquisition builds upon our expanding range of high-technology interconnect products for automotive electronics applications and is consistent with our ongoing strategy of finding complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. We're very confident that our ongoing acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.
Turning now to the trends in our served markets. The military and aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased a very strong 27% from prior year, benefiting from continued strength in a broad range of military and commercial aerospace programs as well as from the contribution of the Borisch acquisition completed last year. On a sequential basis, sales declined slightly, reflecting some short-term caution on the part of defense contractors, resulting in particular from uncertainty surrounding the recent U.S. budgetary process. Looking ahead and despite any current market uncertainties, we remain very optimistic on our potential in this market due to the increasing electronics in military applications, the continued acceleration of spending and developing geographies, and the coming upgrades of commercial aircraft platforms. We expect demand in the military aerospace market to strengthen in the second quarter. I look forward to our technology leadership driving continued expansion of Amphenol's leading market position into the future.
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased an excellent 49% from prior year and 3% from the fourth quarter. We continued to benefit in the first quarter from a recovery in virtually all segments of the industrial markets, as well as from the momentum generated by our new high-technology products. In particular, sales grew strongly in alternative energy, oil and gas, factory automation as well as instrumentation segments, supported especially by strong progress in the high-growth markets of China and India. We expect in the industrial market to strengthen further in the second quarter and are optimistic that our efforts in the many diverse segment of this market will continue to drive growth into the future.
The automotive market represented 8% of sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a strong 26% from prior year and 11% sequentially. As we expanded our participation in many new electronics application in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles and also took advantage of continued growth in automotive volumes. We continue to broaden our range of high-value automotive interconnect solutions and are especially excited by the new strength created by this acquisition. 
There is some risk of Japan-related slowdowns in vehicle production in the coming quarter. Excluding this, however, we expect our sales to increase in the second quarter as our participation in electronics and hybrid vehicles continues to expand.
Sales into the broadband and hybrid fiber coax communication market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 11% from prior year and strengthened only slightly sequentially, as we did not ultimately experience the expected seasonal pickup in activity in the United States cable market. We expect demand in the broadband market to remain at these levels in the second quarter, as cable operators continue to restrain capital spending in the short term.
The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were flat from prior year and down 5% sequentially, as the fourth quarter 2010 pause in IT spending particularly in the networking market, continued into the first quarter. We expect improving conditions in this market in the second quarter and look forward to a more positive demand environment in the second half of 2011, driven especially by expanding requirements for enterprise equipment and our new program wins with advanced technology products, all of which position us strongly for continued long-term expansion in the IT datacom market.
Sales into the mobile networks market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and increased 11% from prior year and 8% sequentially. We benefited in the wireless infrastructure market from an acceleration of wireless build-out to support next generation mobile services as well as from continued subscriber growth in emerging markets. We're especially excited by expanding opportunities for our interconnect products and antennas in the many newly upgraded base station systems. I look forward to continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. We expect continued momentum in this market in the second quarter and look forward to a positive long-term trend in mobile networks.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter an increased a very strong 64% from prior year and were down sequentially by only 7%, as our new product launches offset the traditional first quarter seasonality that we had expected. We benefited especially from the expansion of our technology position on a broad range of rapidly expanding smart mobile devices, including especially our expansion of our addition in tablet computers. We expect sales to increase further in the second quarter as we continue to leverage our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers.
In sum, I'm extremely proud of our organization as we have executed very well in the truly challenging month environment. Despite the unprecedented inflationary pressures and the many market dynamics that we see everyday, our management team's consistent focus on reacting quickly to changing customer needs while driving always-superior operating margin, has resulted in a further strengthening of our market position and a continuation of our industry-leading profitability. These strong results are a direct result of Amphenol's distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our many diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Looking forward based on a continuation of the current economic trends as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter of 2011 and the full year of 2011 the following results: Sales in the second quarter -- we forecast sales in the second quarter of $985 million to $1 billion and for the full year, $3,955,000,000 to $4 billion, respectively. And we forecast EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.78 in the second quarter and $3.05 to $3.11 for the full year. 
We've not experience thus far any significant negative impact to our business from the natural disasters in Japan. However, our guidance does not reflect any possible disruptions to the electronics supply chain that could arise. 
Despite any of these challenges, I am extremely confident in the ability of Amphenol's outstanding organization to capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further expand both our market position and our profitability. At this time, operator, we'd be very happy to entertain any questions that there may be."

And the most important is that vis-a-vis Amphenol, we have such a broad position across every program that we are not dependent on one or another program to get today funding, tomorrow funding or the next day funding.

It's very true that automotive has not been, for us, a significant market. It is still just 8% of sales. At the same time, we have seen and that has helped to propel the growth in organically in our automotive business, a real adoption of new technologies into cars. And some of these new technologies come to us as attractive technologies, where we would want to participate, where our interconnect technologies can add value. And that's where we believe we -- those should be good returns for us. If we look at an example of hybrid, and we have talked before in many times, that we have not participated in the broad automotive wire harness. At the same time as cars transition to a hybrid drive chain, they require more environment, more knowledge of high-power, those are the things where Amphenol has traditionally had an outstanding leadership position in technology. These acquisitions that we have made, the one at the end of last year, which was in RF Technology, this one in the real sort of transforming area of lighting technology, are both areas which are not general automotive but rather consistent with our ongoing strategy of niche high-technology application in the car. To the extent that there's a continued adoption of new technologies in cars, I certainly would not tell you that we would shy away from finding other high-technology applications of our products in automotive. By virtue of it being automotive, it does not scare us away. What we don't like is things where our technology has no value and appreciation from the customer."

I think as you pointed out, I mean the company has a great, long-term track record of achieving very strong profitability. And certainly, the profitability that we did achieve in the first quarter is something that we feel very good about, 19.8% ROS, as you say 24% conversion margin over last year. And these are certainly very excellent accomplishments in any environment, but particularly as you point out in the current environment, which is really I think unprecedented from the pace and the amount of the acceleration of these cost pressures. We as a management team remain very committed to the goal of 25% conversion margins. Certainly, you who are familiar with, we've had it for quite some time. And I think that, that means that we are committed to further margin expansion in the future as the company grows. However, given the current global costs environment, we believe the margin expansion in the near term is going to be more difficult. And therefore, when we look at the guidance and think that it just makes more sense to be more prudent in the short term and to think more about the company, maintaining this very strong level of profitability that we have been able to achieve. And this really is the thought process that's reflected in the current guidance. And therefore, it's true to say that the conversion margin that you may have computed as inherent in our guidance is more in the low 20s and not the 25%, 24%, 25% that we were able to achieve in the first quarter. As a management team, we continue to be very committed to maximizing the profitability of the company irrespective of whatever obstacles may present themselves. Also it is true that all of these do come more challenging as the profitability level gets higher and as the cost increases just continue to accelerate. And so as a management team, I mean we certainly continue to work very aggressively as we have been in the past to pursue both pricing and cost reduction actions and to maximize the profitability of the company in the future."

In fact, what we see is that many of the new niche electronics applications in cars continue to have strong momentum.

There are maybe some small time, that I think people are feeling a little bit better. I think in general, the people, the communications of the people say, Okay, now the budget is passed. We can get back to our normal daily duties. And those daily duties will, at some stage, also involve placing orders to our vendors. I think clearly over time, that will have a positive effect. And that's why we do look forward in the second quarter to a more positive outlook for the military/aerospace market. I think in general, the trends that we have seen in this market, which in particular is the increasing adoption of electronics, that has not slowed by any means with any government budgetary issue. We see just more and more everyday the adoption by military contractors, by the U.S. and foreign military, the emerging markets of new technologies that help them to adapt to the new demand that are really in the world today. And these new technologies, whether they be unmanned vehicles, whether they be dual RF detection systems in cars, new communication systems, these are really accelerating in their prevalence. And if there is a short-term budgetary delay in placing orders, that does not at all take away from the real imperative that is there. It's very much analogous to what we're seeing in many other markets, where there's real acceleration in adoption. And I think in many respects, the military around the world is playing catch up there. The other element of that market there that is important to emphasize is about 1/4 of our sales are to the commercial aero market. And there clearly, we have seen strong performance on a year-over-year basis and see still good progress in that market on a sequential basis. And we're very hopeful and that is not just , that there will be good momentum in that market as we go through this year, into next year as the new airplane platform is very highly fuel-efficient. New planes that are being released really start to have production volumes behind them and as we start to participate on a broader basis in this new commercial air platforms, again with new, more high technology interconnect products."

And we continue to really incubate a very strong pipeline of deals for the future. Again, I said this many times, we are not going to predict when we will close the next deal, how many deals we were close, what value those deals will have or the future. But there is no question that Amphenol is positioned, continues to be positioned, will be positioned as really the acquirer of choice in this industry. As we go out and I go out and meet with companies and both large and small, there is a real warmness and open arms towards people who say, We want to be part of Amphenol. Our organizational structure and entrepreneurial managers, the general managers, my group executives, that is a very hospitable environment for a company to become a part of. When they become a part of Amphenol, it really is a seamless transition for them. I mean I spoke just 1 day afterwards to the general manager of our newest company. And he feels just right at home, because he gets to continue to run his business and gets to avail himself of really the opportunities around the company now that he is part of the global company. And I think that example, every time, plays out for those entrepreneurs who at the end decide to sell to Amphenol. Obviously, others want to do acquisitions, and we are not always going to win every acquisitions. We are certainly not going to pay the highest price for every acquisition. And these acquisitions can sometimes take a very long time to develop and to incubate and develop a mutual trust required in a relationship but in the end decide to get married. So what that will be this year, what that will be next quarter, that I'm not going to be able to forecast for you. But I can tell you that we continue to have a very active engagement in developing our acquisition pipeline, a strong pipeline. And there is a lot of companies in this industry that are attractive, that have unique technologies, that have broad application across our global customer base."

Pricing is an art. We have certainly, you can always to distributors. they are the regular price increases, but this represents less than 15% of our sales. And so with these discussions with OEM customers, that is a real art and a drive and it takes courage. And one thing that it takes most importantly where Amphenol has a strong position is it takes leadership of people who are really involved on both sides of that business, the operational, the engineering as well as the customer facing side. Our general managers are really our greatest asset in terms of being able to sense the costs going up, because they see it every day and then translate that into meaningful discussions with their customers as opposed to just say, Hey, the price goes up a flat number. We issued that from headquarters. Rather they are able to go in and truly adapt their pricing to the reality of the market that they see. 70 general managers around the world there, each taking different strategies. But one thing in common. It is an extreme focus. It is in front of everybody's mind. And no doubt with these commodities having done what they are, with the wages in China, with the currency and the renminbi and others, there is really fewer and fewer options except to go to the customer with price. And we're hopeful that we're not the only company in the industry who has that mindset."

It ranges everything from connectors that go into alternative energy, solar, wind and others to high-speed rails, to geophysical, to medical, to marine, entertainment, heavy equipment. It's just a wonderfully diverse marketplace for us and one where we're very excited to see ongoing technology adoption happening, really in every one of those segments. Relative to the price of oil and what that can mean, it can mean different things to different segments. I think clearly if you talk about oil exploration, you talk about energy generation, that can be not a bad thing. If price of oil is up, people are going to dig for more of it. But people are also going to try to use less of it. And so if you dig for more, that's more exploration. If you less, that's more alternative energy and more hybrid drives and more efficient power. So I think either way, that's not a bad thing. I wouldn't tell you though that we have seen our industrial business that is still correlated necessary to how the price of oil goes up or down in a given short or long term. We just feel very excited by the real diversity and the outlook of strength that comes across that industrial market. And as I mentioned earlier, we see excellent opportunities in particular in emerging markets. The infrastructure building that is happening in these emerging markets, you wish on one hand that you would have more infrastructure being built in the U.S. But you see this infrastructure being built in places like China and India, and that is not just roads and bridges and tunnels and airports. It is totally new rail systems. It is new energy generation systems, new medical equipment, new automation, motion control machine tool industry. And there is just such a broad-base of growth prospects that come in these emerging markets. And as they adopt these new technologies, they are adopting the latest generation. the latest generation have more and more of this electronic functionality in them, the stronger drive towards efficient power trends."

And we'd like to welcome you all to our first quarter call. 
Results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed the first quarter with sales of $941 million and EPS of $0.72, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and meeting the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 22% in U.S. dollars and 21% in the local currencies over Q1 of 2010. From an organic standpoint, excluding the effects of both currency and acquisitions, sales in Q1 2011 were up 17% over last year. From a sequential standpoint, sales were down 1% from a record Q4 of 2010. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business, which comprised 7% of sales in the quarter, was down 6% from last year and up 7% from last quarter. The sales decline from last year relates primarily to lower spending in North American broadband markets. The Interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 25% from last year and down about 2% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $186 million compared to $145 million last year. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 18.8% last year. Operating income in both periods is net of stock option expense of about 0.7% of sales or $6.3 million in the 2011 quarter and $5.4 million in the 2010 quarter. From a segment standpoint in the Cable business, margins were 11.8%, down from 14.9% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher relative material costs and lower volume.
In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.1% compared to 21.1% last year. The improvement in margin of about 1% reflects the benefit of higher volume combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost. Overall, we're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.8%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over last year of about 24%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly in the face of unprecedented global cost pressures. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to continue to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million both this year and last year, reflecting a similar average debt level and interest rates. Other income was $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, up from about $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.5% compared to 26.1% last year. The prior year quarter included a onetime benefit of about $1.9 million or $0.01 per share from a reduction in tax expense for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of certain prior year audits. We currently expect a rate of about 27.5% for the remainder of this year.
Net income was approximately 14% of sales, a very strong performance, and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter grew 29% over the prior year on an as-reported basis and 31% after adjusting the prior year earnings per share for the onetime tax benefit.
Orders in the quarter were a record $961 million, up 16% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.02:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. And cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $108 million, about 83% of net income in the quarter. Operating cash flow in Q1 is net of a $15 million contribution to the company's U.S. defined benefit plan and 7% sequential increase in the operating component of working capital, reflecting an increase in inventory and receivables partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances.
Inventory increased about 10% over December to $603 million in the quarter, resulting in inventory days of about 85. Approximately half the inventory increase relates to a higher investment in raw materials in the quarter. We consider this higher investment prudent given the potential for disruptions in the broader supply chain resulting from the events in Japan and the potential for further significant increases in commodity costs. The remaining increase is to support sequentially higher sales in Q2.
Accounts receivable was $744 million at the end of March, up 4% from the end of December, reflecting the heavy weighting of sales in March in the quarter. Days sales outstanding increased 3 days to 71 days at the end of March, up from 68 days at the end of December. In addition, accounts payable increased about 8% to $414 million at the end of the quarter. Payable days increased from 54 days at the end of 2010 to 59 days at the end of March, reflecting both the higher overall inventory purchasing level and a proportion of activity for the quarter that occurred in March. I would also add that the foreign exchange impact from the weaker dollar added about 1 day to all of these metrics for inventory, receivable and payable days at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, we would expect to see operating working capital and the related turnover metrics improve back to our historical norms, although we may continue to hold a slightly higher raw material inventory level. 
Our cash flow from operations of $108 million, along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivable facilities of $150 million and $17 million in proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises were used primarily for $23 million of capital expenditures, an increase in cash and cash investments of $67 million and the purchase of about 3.5 million of shares of the company's stock for approximately $189 million under the company's stock buyback program. The company has about 16 million shares remaining under the 20 million shares stock buyback program that we announced earlier this year. And if you recall, the program expires in January of 2014.
At the end of March, the cash and short-term investments were $691 million, the majority of which continues to be held outside the U.S. And debt at the end of March was $950 million, excuse me, bringing net debt to approximately $260 million at the end of the quarter. At March 31, the company had availability under its revolving credit facility of about $0.75 billion. And the company's leverage and interest coverage ratio has remained very strong at 1x and 22x respectively. EBITDA in the quarter was $222 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was a very strong quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

And I would like to add my own welcome to all of you on the phone today at the time of our first quarter earnings call. I'll spend a little bit of time to highlight some of our first quarter achievements. I'll then discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets. And then I'll finish up by commenting on our outlook for the second quarter as well as for the full year of 2011.
As Diana just detailed, the first quarter was an excellent start to 2011 for Amphenol with the company reaching the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings per share despite significant cost challenges and a continued dynamic market conditions. Revenues in the quarter grew a very strong 22% from prior year, reaching $941 million and orders reached a new record of $961 million. Despite significant and pervasive challenges on cost around the world, the Amphenol operating team executed extremely well in the quarter. And we're very proud to have achieved operating margins of 19.8%. 
We also continued to generate excellent cash flow of $108 million used in particular for our latest acquisition as well as the renewal of our stock buyback program. These results are a direct reflection of the strength and the discipline of our agile organization and the entrepreneurial management team of Amphenol.
In the quarter, as mentioned, we completed the acquisition of a European and North American-based manufacturer of specialized, high-technology automotive lighting interconnect products. This company has annual sales of approximately $50 million. This acquisition builds upon our expanding range of high-technology interconnect products for automotive electronics applications and is consistent with our ongoing strategy of finding complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. We're very confident that our ongoing acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.
Turning now to the trends in our served markets. The military and aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased a very strong 27% from prior year, benefiting from continued strength in a broad range of military and commercial aerospace programs as well as from the contribution of the Borisch acquisition completed last year. On a sequential basis, sales declined slightly, reflecting some short-term caution on the part of defense contractors, resulting in particular from uncertainty surrounding the recent U.S. budgetary process. Looking ahead, and despite any current market uncertainties, we remain very optimistic on our potential in this market due to the increasing electronics in military applications, the continued acceleration of spending and developing geographies and the coming upgrades of commercial aircraft platforms. We expect demand in the military aerospace market to strengthen in the second quarter. I look forward to our technology leadership driving continued expansion of Amphenol's leading market position into the future.
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased an excellent 49% from prior year and 3% from the fourth quarter. We continued to benefit in the first quarter from a recovery in virtually all segments of the industrial markets, as well as from the momentum generated by our new high-technology products. In particular, sales grew strongly in alternative energy, oil and gas, factory automation as well as instrumentation segments, supported especially by strong progress in the high-growth markets of China and India. We expect the industrial market to strengthen further in the second quarter and are optimistic that our efforts in the many diverse segments of this market will continue to drive growth into the future.
The automotive market represented 8% of sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a strong 26% from prior year and 11% sequentially. As we expanded our participation in many new electronics applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles and also took advantage of continued growth in automotive volumes. We continue to broaden our range of high-value automotive interconnect solutions and are especially excited by the new strength created by this Enthone [ph] acquisition. 
There is some risk of Japan-related slowdowns in vehicle production in the coming quarter. Excluding this, however, we expect our sales to increase in the second quarter as our participation in new electronics and hybrid vehicles continues to expand.
Sales into the broadband and hybrid fiber coax communication market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 11% from prior year and strengthened only a slightly sequentially as we did not ultimately experienced the expected seasonal pickup in activity in the United States cable market. We expect demand in the broadband market to remain at these levels in the second quarter as cable operators continue to restrain capital spending in the short term.
The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were flat from prior year and down 5% sequentially as the fourth quarter 2010 pause in IT spending, particularly in the networking market, continued into the first quarter. We expect improving conditions in this market in the second quarter and look forward to a more positive demand environment in the second half of 2011 driven especially by expanding requirements for enterprise equipment and our new program wins with advanced technology products, all of which position us strongly for continued long-term expansion in the IT datacom [data communications] market.
Sales into the mobile networks market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and increased 11% from prior year and 8% sequentially. We benefited in the wireless infrastructure market from an acceleration of wireless build-out to support next generation mobile services as well as from continued subscriber growth in emerging markets. We're especially excited by expanding opportunities for our interconnect products and antennas in the many newly upgraded base station systems. I look forward to a continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. We expect continued momentum in this market in the second quarter and look forward to a positive long-term trend in mobile networks.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and increased a very strong 64% from prior year and were down sequentially by only 7% as our new product launches offset the traditional first quarter seasonality that we had expected. We benefited especially from the expansion of our technology position on a broad range of rapidly expanding smart mobile devices, including especially our expansion of our addition in tablet computers. We expect sales to increase further in the second quarter as we continue to leverage our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers.
In sum, I'm extremely proud of our organization as we have executed very well in this truly challenging environment. Despite the unprecedented inflationary pressures and the many market dynamics that we see everyday, our management team's consistent focus on reacting quickly to changing customer needs while driving always-superior operating margins has resulted in a further strengthening of our market position and a continuation of our industry-leading profitability. These strong results are a direct result of Amphenol's distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our many diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Looking forward based on a continuation of the current economic trends as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter of 2011 and the full year of 2011 the following results: Sales in the second quarter -- we forecast sales in the second quarter of $985 million to $1 billion and for the full year, $3,955,000,000 to $4 billion, respectively. And we forecast EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.78 in the second quarter and $3.05 to $3.11 for the full year. 
We've not experience thus far any significant negative impact to our business from the natural disasters in Japan. However, our guidance does not reflect any possible disruption to the electronics supply chain that could arise. 
Despite any of these challenges, I am extremely confident in the ability of Amphenol's outstanding organization to capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further expand both our market position and our profitability. At this time, operator, we would be very happy to entertain any questions that there may be."

These programs that are long term, none of the budget discussions today have really impacted them. And the most important is that vis-a-vis Amphenol, we have such a broad position across every program that we are not dependent on one or another program to get today funding, tomorrow funding or the next day funding. It was really in this case that our customers were just more cautious in terms of where they place their orders. They don't want to extend themselves without knowing what is in the end going to be funded or in fact, whether the government will have funding at all."

It's very true that automotive has not been, for us, a significant market. It is still just 8% of sales. At the same time, we have seen and that has helped to propel the growth organically in our automotive business, a real adoption of new technologies into cars. And some of these new technologies come to us as attractive technologies, where we would want to participate, where our interconnect technologies can add value. And that's where we believe we -- those would be good returns for us. If we look, an example of hybrid and we have talked before many times, that we have not participated in the broad automotive wire harness. At the same time, as cars transition to a hybrid drive chain, they require more harsh environment, more knowledge of high-power, those are the things where Amphenol traditionally had an outstanding leadership position in technology. These acquisitions that we have made, the one at the end of last year, which was in RF Technology, this one in the real sort of transforming area of lighting technology are both areas which are not general automotive but rather consistent with our ongoing strategy of niche high-technology application in the car. To the extent that there is a continued adoption of new technologies in cars, I certainly would not tell you that we would shy away from finding other high-technology applications of our products in automotive. By virtue of it being automotive, it does not scare us away. What we don't like is things where our technology has no value and appreciation from the customer."

I think that as you pointed out, I mean the company has a great long-term track record of achieving very strong profitability. And certainly, the profitability that we did achieve in the first quarter is something that we feel very good about, 19.8% ROS, as you say, it was 24% conversion margin over last year. And these are certainly very excellent accomplishments in any environment. But particularly, as you point out in the current environment, which is really I think unprecedented from the pace and amount of the acceleration of these cost pressures. We as a management team remain very committed to the goal of 25% conversion margins. Certainly you call that you're familiar with. We've had it for quite some time. And I think that then means that we are committed to further margin expansion in the future as the company grows. However, given the current global cost environment, we believe the margin expansion in the near term is going to be more difficult. And therefore, when we look at the guidance and think that it just makes more sense to be more prudent in the short term and to think more about the company, maintaining this very strong level of profitability that we've been able to achieve. And this really is the thought process that's reflected in the current guidance. And therefore, it's true to say that the conversion margin that you may have computed as inherent in our guidance is more in the low 20s and not the 25%, 24%, 25% that we were able to achieve in the first quarter. As a management team, we continue to be very committed to maximizing the profitability of the company irrespective of whatever obstacles may present themselves. Although it is true that all of these goals become more challenging as the profitability levels get higher and as these cost increases just continue to accelerate. And so as a management team, I mean we certainly continue to work very aggressively as we have done in the past to pursue both pricing and cost reduction actions and to maximize the profitability of the company in the future."

We can get back to our normal daily duties."" And those daily duties will, at some stage, also involve placing orders to our vendors. I think clearly over time, that will have a positive effect. And that's why we do look forward in the second quarter to a more positive outlook for the military/aerospace market. I think in general, the trends that we have seen in this market, which in particular is the increasing adoption of electronics, that has not slowed by any means with any government budgetary issues. We see just more and more everyday the adoption by military contractors, by the U.S. and foreign military, the emerging markets of new technologies that help them to adapt to the new demand that are really in the world today. And these new technologies, whether they be unmanned vehicles, whether they be new RF detection systems in cars, new communication systems, these are really accelerating in their prevalence. And if there is a short-term budgetary delay in placing orders, that does not at all take away from the real imperative that is there. It's very much analogous to what we are seeing in many other markets where there is this real acceleration of technology adoption. And I think, in many respects, the military around the world is playing catch up there. The other element of that market that is important to emphasize is about a quarter of our sales are to the commercial aero [aerospace] market. And there clearly, we have seen strong performance on a year-over-year basis and see still a good progress in that market on a sequential basis.

And there have clearly been instances where our customers have come to us to seek replacements of products that they need in the short term. Whether that translates into a long-term share gain, I think that's too early to say. Clearly, there will be in Japan, a significant reconstruction effort. And I mean I have heard numbers in the hundreds of millions being talked about here. And that is a large stimulus program that will come in and out of itself. And I'm sure there will be elements of that that come into the markets that we serve, the industrial market, the wireless infrastructure market, the aerospace market. So long term, any reconstruction, and I am very, very confident that with the resiliency of Japan, the economy and the people of Japan, that they will reconstruct. And they will no doubt build a bigger and better and higher technology than it was built in the past. And do we stand to be an enabler of that reconstruction, thereby benefit from it.

I mean that has been for a long time, seasonally, the first quarter where you would see an increase and build-out in demand, and we just simply did not see that this quarter.

Whether that is because of different competition that they have, different take up rates, whatever that is that maybe we are not so close to. But there are clearly was some restraining of capital spending. Vis-à-vis the pricing environment, I have to tell you that we certainly look forward to the market leader, always being aggressive in pricing when you have seen these increases in raw materials that have come. While there were some announced pricing actions, the actual implementation of those pricing actions was much less than one would have expected. We're still hopeful. We're very hopeful that there will be discipline in the market. And as always, we will be there within an extraordinarily short time to follow on any pricing activity from the market leader.

It is also much smaller than it ever was before. And in terms of kind of the impact on the total company at 7% of sales, it's much less. And I think our technology position in the cable market has allowed us on interconnect products to really achieve strong technology positions on the equipment. And there is a lot of new equipment upgrades that go into this in the broadband market. And that is something that we feel has been an excellent strategy of the company for some years now.

As we go out and I go out and meet with companies in both large and small, there is a real warmness and an open arms towards people saying, ""We want to be part of Amphenol."" Our organizational structure and entrepreneurial managers, the general managers, my group executives, that is a very hospitable environment for a company is to become a part of. When they become a part of Amphenol, it is really a seamless transition for them. I mean I spoke just one day afterwards to the general manager of our newest company, and he feels just right at home because he gets to continue to run his business yet he gets to avail himself of really the opportunities around the company now that he is part of the global company. And I think that example every time plays out for those entrepreneurs who at the end decide to sell to Amphenol. Obviously, others want to do acquisitions, and we are not always going to win every acquisitions. We are certainly not going to pay the highest price for every acquisition. And these acquisitions can sometimes take a very long time to develop and to incubate and develop the mutual trust that is required in a relationship, in the end, decide really to get married.

And so with these discussions with OEM customers, that is a real art and a drive and it takes courage. And one thing that it takes most importantly where Amphenol has a strong position is it takes leadership of people who are really involved on both sides of that business, both the operational, the engineering as well as the customer facing side. Our general managers are really our greatest asset in terms of being able to sense the costs going up because they see it every day and then translate that into meaningful discussions with their customers as opposed to just saying, ""Hey, the price goes up a flat number. We issued that from headquarters."" Rather, they are able to go in and truly adapt their pricing to the reality of the market that they see. 70 general managers around the world there each taking different strategies. But one thing in common. It is an extreme focus. It is in front of everybody's mind. And no doubt, with these commodities having done what they are, with the wages in China, with the currency, you know the renminbi and others, there is really fewer and fewer options except to go to the customer with price.

It ranges everything from connectors that go into alternative energy, solar, wind and other to high-speed rail, to geophysical, to medical, to marine, entertainment, heavy equipment. It's just a wonderfully diversed  marketplace for us and one where we're very excited to see that an ongoing technology adoption happening, really in every one of those segments. Relative to the price of oil and what that can mean, it can mean different things to different segments. I think clearly if you talk about oil exploration, you talk about energy generation, that can be not a bad thing. If price of oil is up, people are going to dig for more of it but people are also going to try to use less of it. And so if you dig for more, that's more exploration. If you use less, that's more alternative energy and more hybrid drives and more efficient power. So I think, either way, that's not a bad thing. I wouldn't tell you though that we have seen our industrial business that is so correlated necessarily to how the price of oil goes up or down in a given short or long term. We just feel very excited by the real diversity and the outlook of strength that comes across that industrial market. And as I mentioned earlier, we see excellent opportunities, in particular, in emerging markets. The infrastructure building that is happening in these emerging markets. And you wish on one hand that you would have more infrastructure being built in the U.S. But you see this infrastructure being built in places like China and India, and that is not just roads and bridges and tunnels and airports, it is totally new rail systems. It is new energy generation systems, new medical equipment, new automation, motion control machine tool industry. And there is just such a broad-base of growth prospects that come in these emerging markets. And as they adopt these new technologies, they are adopting really the latest generation, and the latest generation have more and more of this electronic functionality and the stronger drive towards efficient power transmittal."

More importantly, we have seen a real kind of enhanced competitive marketplace in networking, where it has been no secret that there have been share shifts that are happening between the networking OEMs and driving price competition, different formats, different types of networking equipment into the different segments. And I think that, that can certainly have kind of, or in one instance, it can cause some customers to, every once in a while say, ""Well, maybe we wait. We got a better price if we wait a month or two to buy that equipment."" Because there seems to be some very, very aggressive actions between the OEMs and the networking market today."

And we'd like to welcome you all to our first quarter call. 
Results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed the first quarter with sales of $941 million and EPS of $0.72, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and meeting the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 22% in U.S. dollars and 21% in the local currencies over Q1 of 2010. From an organic standpoint, excluding the effects of both currency and acquisitions, sales in Q1 2011 were up 17% over last year. From a sequential standpoint, sales were down 1% from a record Q4 of 2010. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable [Cable Products] business, which comprised 7% of sales in the quarter, was down 6% from last year and up 7% from last quarter. The sales decline from last year relates primarily to lower spending in North American broadband markets. The Interconnect [Interconnect Products and Assemblies] business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 25% from last year and down about 2% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $186 million compared to $145 million last year. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 18.8% last year. Operating income in both periods is net of stock option expense of about 0.7% of sales or $6.3 million in the 2011 quarter and $5.4 million in the 2010 quarter.
From a segment standpoint, in the Cable business, margins were 11.8%, down from 14.9% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher relative material costs and lower volume. In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.1% compared to 21.1% last year. The improvement in margin of about 1% reflects the benefits of higher volume combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost.
Overall, we're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.8%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over last year of about 24%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly in the face of unprecedented global cost pressures. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to continue to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million both this year and last year, reflecting a similar average debt level and interest rates. Other income was $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, up from about $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.5% compared to 26.1% last year. The prior year quarter included a onetime benefit of about $1.9 million or $0.01 per share from a reduction in tax expense for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of certain prior year audits. We currently expect a rate of about 27.5% for the remainder of this year.
Net income was approximately 14% of sales, a very strong performance, and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter grew 29% over the prior year on an as-reported basis and 31% after adjusting the prior year earnings per share for the onetime tax benefit.
Orders in the quarter were a record $961 million, up 16% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.02:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, and cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $108 million, about 83% of net income in the quarter. Operating cash flow in Q1 is net of a $15 million contribution to the company's U.S. defined benefit plans and a 7% sequential increase in the operating components of working capital, reflecting an increase in inventory and receivables, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances.
Inventory increased about 10% over December to $603 million in the quarter, resulting in inventory days of about 85. Approximately half the inventory increase relates to a higher investment in raw materials in the quarter. We consider this higher investment prudent given the potential for disruptions in the broader supply chain resulting from the events in Japan and the potential for further significant increases in commodity costs. The remaining increase is to support sequentially higher sales in Q2.
Accounts receivable was $744 million at the end of March, up 4% from the end of December, reflecting the heavy weighting of sales in March in the quarter. Days sales outstanding increased 3 days to 71 days at the end of March, up from 68 days at the end of December. In addition, accounts payable increased about 8% to $414 million at the end of the quarter. Payable days increased from 54 days at the end of 2010 to 59 days at the end of March, reflecting both the higher overall inventory purchasing level and the proportion of activity for the quarter that occurred in March. I would also add that the foreign exchange impact from the weaker dollar added about 1 day to all of these metrics for inventory, receivable and payable days at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, we would expect to see operating working capital and the related turnover metrics improve back to our historical norms, although we may continue to hold a slightly higher raw-material inventory level. 
Our cash flow from operations of $108 million, along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivable facilities of $150 million and $17 million in proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises were used primarily for $23 million of capital expenditures, an increase in cash and cash investments of $67 million, and the purchase of about 3.5 million of shares of the company's stock for approximately $189 million under the company's stock buyback program. The company has about 16 million shares remaining under the 20-million-share stock buyback program that we announced earlier this year. And if you recall, the program expires in January of 2014.
At the end of March, the cash and short-term investments were $691 million, the majority of which continues to be held outside the U.S. And debt at the end of March was $950 million, excuse me, bringing net debt to approximately $260 million at the end of the quarter. At March 31, the company had availability under its revolving credit facility of about $0.75 billion, and the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remained very strong at 1x and 22x respectively. EBITDA in the quarter was $222 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was a very strong quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I'll spend a little bit of time to highlight some of our first quarter achievements. I'll then discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets. And then I'll finish up by commenting on our outlook for the second quarter as well as for the full year of 2011.
As Diana just detailed, the first quarter was an excellent start to 2011 for Amphenol, with the company reaching the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings per share despite significant cost challenges and a continued dynamic market condition. Revenues in the quarter grew a very strong 22% from prior year, reaching $941 million, and orders reached a new record of $961 million. Despite significant and pervasive challenges on cost around the world, the Amphenol operating team executed extremely well in the quarter and we're very proud to have achieved operating margins of 19.8%. 
We also continued to generate excellent cash flow of $108 million, used in particular for our latest acquisition as well as the renewal of our stock buyback program. These results are a direct reflection of the strength and the discipline of our agile organization and the entrepreneurial management team of Amphenol.
In the quarter, as mentioned, we completed the acquisition of a European and North American-based manufacturer of specialized, high-technology automotive lighting interconnect products. This company has annual sales of approximately $50 million. This acquisition builds upon our expanding range of high-technology interconnect products for automotive electronics applications and is consistent with our ongoing strategy of finding complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. We're very confident that our ongoing acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.
Turning now to the trends in our served markets. The military and aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased a very strong 27% from prior year, benefiting from continued strength in a broad range of military and commercial aerospace programs, as well as from the contribution of the Borisch acquisition completed last year. On a sequential basis, sales declined slightly, reflecting some short-term caution on the part of defense contractors, resulting in particular from uncertainty surrounding the recent U.S. budgetary process. Looking ahead, and despite any current market uncertainties, we remain very optimistic on our potential in this market due to the increasing electronics in military applications, the continued acceleration of spending in developing geographies and the coming upgrades of commercial aircraft platforms. We expect demand in the military aerospace market to strengthen in the second quarter. I look forward to our technology leadership driving continued expansion of Amphenol's leading market position into the future.
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased an excellent 49% from prior year and 3% from the fourth quarter. We continued to benefit in the first quarter from a recovery in virtually all segments of the industrial markets, as well as from the momentum generated by our new high-technology products. In particular, sales grew strongly in alternative energy, oil and gas, factory automation, as well as instrumentation segments, supported especially by strong progress in the high-growth markets of China and India. We expect the industrial market to strengthen further in the second quarter and are optimistic that our efforts in the many diverse segments of this market will continue to drive growth into the future.
The automotive market represented 8% of sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a strong 26% from prior year and 11% sequentially, as we expanded our participation in many new electronics applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles, and also took advantage of continued growth in automotive volumes. We continue to broaden our range of high-value, automotive interconnect solutions and are especially excited by the new strength created by the Santome [ph] acquisition. There is some risk of Japan-related slowdowns in vehicle production in the coming quarter. Excluding this, however, we expect our sales to increase in the second quarter as our participation in new electronics and hybrid vehicles continues to expand.
Sales into the broadband and hybrid-fiber coax communication market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 11% from prior year and strengthened only slightly sequentially as we did not ultimately experience the expected seasonal pickup in activity in the United States cable market. We expect demand in the broadband market to remain at these levels in the second quarter as cable operators continue to restrain capital spending in the short term.
The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were flat from prior year and down 5% sequentially as the fourth quarter 2010 pause in IT spending, particularly in the networking market, continued into the first quarter. We expect improving conditions in this market in the second quarter and look forward to a more positive demand environment in the second half of 2011, driven especially by expanding requirements for enterprise equipment and our new program wins with advanced technology products, all of which position us strongly for continued, long-term expansion in the IT datacom [data communications] market.
Sales into the mobile networks market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and increased 11% from prior year and 8% sequentially. We benefited in the wireless infrastructure market from an acceleration of wireless build-out to support next-generation mobile services as well as from continued subscriber growth in emerging markets. We're especially excited by expanding opportunities for our interconnect products and antennas in the many newly upgraded base-station systems and look forward to a continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. We expect continued momentum in this market in the second quarter and look forward to a positive long-term trend in mobile networks.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and increased a very strong 64% from prior year and were down sequentially by only 7% as our new product launches offset the traditional first quarter seasonality that we had expected. We benefited especially from the expansion of our technology position on a broad range of rapidly expanding smart mobile devices, including especially our expansion of our addition in tablet computers. We expect sales to increase further in the second quarter as we continue to leverage our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers.
In sum, I'm extremely proud of our organization as we have executed very well in this truly challenging environment. Despite the unprecedented inflationary pressures and the many market dynamics that we see every day, our management team's consistent focus on reacting quickly to changing customer needs while driving always-superior operating margins has resulted in a further strengthening of our market position and a continuation of our industry-leading profitability. These strong results are a direct result of Amphenol's distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across our many diverse markets; our worldwide presence; our lean and flexible cost structure; and, most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Looking forward, based on a continuation of the current economic trends as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter of 2011 and the full year of 2011 the following results: Sales in the second quarter -- we forecast sales in the second quarter of $985 million to $1 billion and for the full year, $3,955,000,000 to $4 billion, respectively. And we forecast EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.78 in the second quarter and $3.05 to $3.11 for the full year. 
We've not experienced, thus far, any significant negative impact to our business from the natural disasters in Japan. However, our guidance does not reflect any possible disruption to the electronics supply chain that could arise. 
Despite any of these challenges, I am extremely confident in the ability of Amphenol's outstanding organization to capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further expand both our market position and our profitability. At this time, operator, we would be very happy to entertain any questions that there may be."

And I think now that there is a budget, we see a positive outlook, as I mentioned, for the second quarter. These programs that are long term, none of the budget discussions today have really impacted them. And the most important is that vis-à-vis Amphenol, we have such a broad position across every program that we are not dependent on one or another program to get today funding, tomorrow funding or the next day funding. It was, really, in this case that our customers were just more cautious in terms of where they placed their orders. They don't want to extend themselves without knowing what is, in the end, going to be funded or, in fact, whether the government will have funding at all."

It's very true that automotive has not been, for us, a significant market. It is still just 8% of sales. At the same time, we have seen, and that has helped to propel the growth organically in our automotive business, a real adoption of new technologies into cars. And some of these new technologies come to us as attractive technologies where we would want to participate, where our interconnect technologies can add value. And that's where we believe we -- those would be good returns for us. If we look, as an example, of hybrid and we have talked before many times, that we have not participated in the broad automotive wire harness. At the same time, as cars transition to a hybrid drive chain, they require more harsh environment, more knowledge of high-power. Those are the things where Amphenol has traditionally had an outstanding leadership position in technology. These acquisitions that we have made, the one at the end of last year, which was in RF technology, this one in the real, sort of, transforming area of lighting technology, are both areas which are not general automotive but rather consistent with our ongoing strategy of niche, high-technology applications in the car. To the extent that there is a continued adoption of new technologies in cars, I certainly would not tell you that we would shy away from finding other high-technology applications of our products in automotive. By virtue of it being automotive, it does not scare us away. What we don't like is things where our technology has no value and appreciation from the customer."

I think that as you pointed out, I mean, the company has a great long-term track record of achieving very strong profitability. And certainly, the profitability that we did achieve in the first quarter is something that we feel very good about, 19.8% ROS. As you say, it was 24% conversion margin over last year. And these are certainly very excellent accomplishments in any environment. But particularly, as you point out, in the current environment, which is really, I think, unprecedented from the pace and amount of the acceleration of these cost pressures. We, as a management team, remain very committed to the goal of 25% conversion margins. Certainly a goal that you're familiar with. We've had it for quite some time. And I think that then means that we are committed to further margin expansion in the future as the company grows. However, given the current global cost environment, we believe that margin expansion in the near term is going to be more difficult and, therefore, when we look at the guidance and think that it just makes more sense to be more prudent in the short term and to think more about the company, maintaining this very strong level of profitability that we've been able to achieve. And this really is the thought process that's reflected in the current guidance and, therefore, it's true to say that the conversion margin that you may have computed as inherent in our guidance is more in the low 20s and not the 25% -- 24%, 25% that we were able to achieve in the first quarter. As a management team, we continue to be very committed to maximizing the profitability of the company irrespective of whatever obstacles may present themselves. Although, it is true that all of these goals become more challenging as the profitability levels get higher and as these cost increases just continue to accelerate. And so, as a management team, I mean we certainly continue to work very aggressively, as we have done in the past, to pursue both pricing and cost reduction actions to maximize the profitability of the company in the future."

It also reflects the stock buyback that was done in the quarter, which would also -- would not have been reflected in the old guidance that we gave last quarter, and other than that, reflects what we see the potential is for performance of the company for the rest of the year."

I think, as I have gone around and talked with customers around the world in a variety of our markets, none have been able and none are willing to or see the need to say anything tangible in terms of what the impact will be. The fact is, is everybody is working very hard to offset any problems that can come. It appears that of any industry, is the automotive on a broad basis is impacted more, especially among Japanese automakers where we have very limited, if any, exposure. In terms of that specific market going into the second quarter, again, we have not heard anything specific from customers. We have not seen any reductions in forecast or downgrades to the outlook. And in fact, what we see is that many of the new niche electronics applications in cars continue to have strong momentum. At the same time it is still, I think, for many, too early to say whether some of these products that come out of Japan, whether they'd be semiconductors or other things, whether those could have some impact onto the broader supply chain. That's something that, despite many questions that we've asked to customers, we don't have any real visibility on it this stage. It does not appear today that there will be anything really meaningful for the company."

I mean, this was just passed a couple of weeks ago, and as you may know, the government does not operate necessarily as quickly as private enterprises do. And so we have not seen any meaningful change. There are maybe some small sign that, I think, people are feeling a little bit better, I think, in general. The people -- the communications of the people say, ""Okay, now the budget has passed. We can get back to our normal daily duties."" And those daily duties will, at some stage, also involve placing orders to our vendors. I think, clearly, over time that will have a positive effect. And that's why we do look forward in the second quarter to a more positive outlook for the military/aerospace market. I think in general, the trends that we have seen in this market, which in particular is the increasing adoption of electronics, that has not slowed by any means with any government budgetary issues. We see just more and more, every day, the adoption by military contractors, by the U.S. and foreign military, the emerging markets, of new technologies that help them to adapt to the new demands that are really in the world today. And these new technologies, whether they be unmanned vehicles, whether they be new RF detection systems in cars, new communication systems, these are really accelerating in their prevalence. And if there is a short-term budgetary delay in placing orders, that does not at all take away from the real imperative that is there. It's very much analogous to what we are seeing in many other markets where there is this real acceleration of technology adoption. And I think, in many respects, the military around the world is playing catch-up there. The other element of that market that is important to emphasize is about a quarter of our sales are to the commercial aero [aerospace] market. And there, clearly, we have seen strong performance on a year-over-year basis and see still good progress in that market on a sequential basis. And we're very hopeful, and that is not just a misplaced hope, that there will be good momentum in that market as we go through this year into next year, as the new airplane platform is very highly fuel-efficient. New planes that are being released really start to have production volumes behind them and as we start to participate on a broader basis in these new commercial air platforms, again with new, more high technology interconnect products."

At the same time, Japan is a relatively small footprint for us and there have clearly been instances where customers have come to us to seek replacements of products that they need in the short term.

And I mean I have heard numbers in the hundreds of millions being talked about here. And that is a large stimulus program that will come in and of itself. And I'm sure there will be elements of that that come into the markets that we serve: the industrial market, the wireless infrastructure market, the aerospace market. So long term, any reconstruction -- and I am very, very confident that with the resiliency of Japan, the economy and the people of Japan, that they will reconstruct and they will no doubt build it bigger and better and higher technology than it was built in the past. And do we stand to be an enabler of that reconstruction and thereby benefit from it? I think long term we certainly would. Vis-à-vis short-term share gains, there may be some odd things.

Whether that is because of different competition that they have, different take up rates, whatever that is that maybe we are not so close to -- but there are clearly was some restraining of capital spending. Vis-à-vis the pricing environment, I have to tell you that we certainly look forward to the market leader always being aggressive in pricing when you have seen these increases in raw materials that have come. While there were some announced pricing actions, the actual implementation of those pricing actions was much less than one would have expected. We're still hopeful. We're very hopeful that there will be discipline in the market. And as always, we will be there within an extraordinarily short time to follow on any pricing activity from the market leader.

It is also much smaller than it ever was before. And in terms of kind of the impact on the total company at 7% of sales, it's much less. And I think our technology position in the cable market has allowed us, on interconnect products, to really achieve strong technology positions on the equipment, and there is a lot of new equipment upgrades that go into this in the broadband market.

But there is no question that Amphenol is positioned, continues to be positioned, will be positioned as really the acquirer of choice in this industry. As we go out and I go out and meet with companies in -- both large and small, there is a real warmness and an open arms towards people saying, ""We want to be part of Amphenol."" Our organizational structure and entrepreneurial managers, the general managers, my group executives, that is a very hospitable environment for companies to become a part of. When they become a part of Amphenol, it is really a seamless transition for them. I mean, I spoke just 1 day afterwards to the general manager of our newest company, and he feels just right at home because he gets to continue to run his business, yet he gets to avail himself of really the opportunities around the company now that he is part of a global company. And I think that example every time plays out for those entrepreneurs who at the end decide to sell to Amphenol. Obviously, others want to do acquisitions and we are not always going to win every acquisitions. We are certainly not going to pay the highest price for every acquisition. And these acquisitions can sometimes take a very long time to develop and to incubate and develop the mutual trust that is required in a relationship to, in the end, decide really to get married.

Our general managers are really our greatest asset in terms of being able to sense the costs going up, because they see it every day, and then translate that into meaningful discussions with their customers as opposed to just saying, ""Hey, the price goes up a flat number. We issue that from headquarters."" Rather, they are able to go in and truly adapt their pricing to the reality of the market that they see. 70 general managers around the world. They're each taking different strategies. But 1 thing in common. It is an extreme focus. It is in front of everybody's mind.

Our -- relative to what amount of sales is U.S. versus others, it is largely similar to if you were to look at what amount the U.S. spends compared to other companies and so clear -- to other countries. Clearly, the U.S. has the largest expenditures for military, and that would accordingly be for us also the largest piece. That being said, we have very, very strong position in essentially all of the other global markets where we are, as an American company, allowed to participate. That includes in Europe, that includes in India where we are really the leader in that extremely fast-growing market. And so we see that while the U.S. continues to be very important for us, there remain excellent growth opportunities in other areas around the world. And those growth opportunities may actually be with U.S. military contractors who are exporting their products. That we have seen more and more of over the recent years. Relative to our outlook for the full year, we were obviously very pleased that, that market grew 27% in this quarter. And I think we said -- last quarter, when we gave our full year guidance, that military will be sort of in line with the overall growth of the company, and we wouldn't see that to be much different at this stage."

It ranges everything from connectors that go into alternative energy, solar, wind and other to high-speed rail, to geophysical, to medical, to marine, entertainment, heavy equipment. It's just a wonderfully diverse marketplace for us and one where we're very excited to see just an ongoing technology adoption happening, really, in every one of those segments. Relative to the price of oil and what that can mean, it can mean different things to different segments. I think clearly if you talk about oil exploration, you talk about energy generation, that can be not a bad thing. If price of oil is up, people are going to dig for more of it but people are also going to try to use less of it. And so if you dig for more, that's more exploration and if you use less, that's more alternative energy and more hybrid drives and more efficient power. So I think, either way, that's not a bad thing. I wouldn't tell you, though, that we have seen our industrial business that is so correlated necessarily to how the price of oil goes up or down in a given short or long term. We just feel very excited by the real diversity and the outlook of strength that comes across that industrial market. And as I mentioned earlier, we see excellent opportunities, in particular, in emerging markets. The infrastructure building that is happening in these emerging markets, and you wish on one hand that you would have more infrastructure being built in the U.S., but you see this infrastructure being built in places like China and India, and that is not just roads and bridges and tunnels and airports. It is totally new rail systems. It is new energy-generation systems, new medical equipment, new automation, motion-controlled machine tool industry. And there is just such a broad-base of growth prospects that come in these emerging markets. And as they adopt these new technologies, they are adopting really the latest generation, and the latest generation have more and more of this electronic functionality and the stronger drive towards efficient power transmittal."

Good afternoon, my name's Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter call.
Q2 Results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed Q2 achieving strong growth and beating the high end of the company's expectations. Sales were $1,018,000,000 and EPS was $0.85 including $0.06 relating to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.79, this represents the company's first quarter with sales over $1 billion and represents new record for both sales and earnings per share. 
Sales were up 15% in US dollars and 12% in local currencies over the second quarter of 2010. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales in Q2 2011 were up 8% over last year. Sequentially sales were up 8% in US dollars and 6% organically from Q1. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 major components. Our Cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was up 9% from last year and up 17% from last quarter. The sales growth from last quarter relates primarily to increased spending in both North American and international broadband markets. The growth from last year relates primarily to strong demand in the South American communications market. 
The Interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 15% from last year and 8% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
Operating income for the quarter was $215 million compared to $176 million last year. Operating margin was 21.1% compared to 19.8% last year. Operating income includes income of approximately $18 million relating to an adjustment to reduce a previously recorded contingent payment obligation for a 2010 U.S.-based acquisition. 
In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, contingent obligations are reassessed based on current performance and expectations and adjusted accordingly through operating income. This adjustment relates primarily to the push out of certain defense-related program to periods beyond this year. 
We continue to be excited about the acquisition and expect strong future performance. Excluding these adjustments, operating margin was 19.4% for Q2 2011. Operating income as net of stock option expense of approximately $7 million this quarter and $6.2 million in the prior year quarter, or 0.7% of sales in both quarters. 
From a segment standpoint in the Cable business, margins were 12.8%, down from 13.5% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher relative material costs. 
From a sequential standpoint, Cable margins improved from 11.8% in Q1 as a result of higher volume and pricing action. In the interconnect business, margins were 21.6% compared to 22.3% last year. The lower Interconnect operating margins reflect a slight reduction in gross margin as positive impacts of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases were more than offset by increases in material input cost. 
In addition, there were costs in the quarter that were somewhat higher as workforce reductions of about 4% were implemented in the areas of the business with slower demand. Overall, we are pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. Excluding the one-time acquisition adjustment, this represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over Q2 2010 of approximately 16%. While this conversion margin is below our long-term goal, the company's overall profitability level continued to be very strong in the face of significant global cost pressures and a mixed demand environment. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $11 million compared to $10 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $2 million compared to $0.8 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
In Q2, the company had an effective tax rate of 27.6% compared to a rate of 21.3% in the second quarter of 2010. The prior year quarter included a net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense, primarily due to the favorable outcome of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year tax audits of about $10 million or $0.06 per share. 
The 2011 quarter includes tax expense of approximately $6.6 million relating to the $18 million acquisition-related gain. Excluding this, the effective tax rate in Q2 2011 was just under 27%. We currently expect to rate of about 27% in the second half of this year. The reduction in the rate from 2010 reflects primarily at lower mix of U.S. income.
Net income, excluding the one-time items was approximately 13.4% of sales in Q2 2011 compared to 13.5% of sales in Q2 2010, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share for Q2 was on as reported basis $0.85 this year and $0.74 last year. After adjustment for one-time items, diluted earnings per share was $0.79 in 2011 and $0.68 in 2010, up 16% from the prior year. 
Orders for the quarter were a record 1,007,000,000, up 11% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1. The company is an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations with $105 million in the quarter. This is approximately 77% of net income for the quarter and 82% for the 6 months. The computation excludes the one-time acquisition gain. Operating cash flow in Q2 does reflect higher interest and tax payments in accordance with normal payment schedule. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory in the quarter was $642 million at the end of June. This is up about 4% from March, excluding the impacts of acquisition and translation. Inventory days declined 2 days from March to 83 days. While we made some progress improving inventory turnover, we continue to hold a portion of the inventory build in Q1 and we'll continue to work in the second half to further improve inventory turns. 
Accounts receivable was $793 million at the end of June, up 4%, excluding the impact of exchange and acquisitions and reflecting the sequential sales increase. Days sales outstanding decreased 2 days to 69 days at the end of June from 71 days at the end of March. 
The cash flow from operations along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $209 million and $10 million in proceeds from option exercises were used primarily to fund $23 million in capital expenditures, $92 million in acquisition-related expenditures relating to both the previously announced acquisition in April of an automotive interconnect company and a performance-based payment for a 2010 acquisition. 
We also made payments to noncontrolling shareholders of $27 million to purchase the remaining shareholder interest. And cash and cash investments increased $5 million in the quarter. In addition, the company purchased 3.2 million shares of its stock for $172 million in the quarter under the company's stock buyback plan. We have approximately 13.4 million shares remaining under that plan and as you may recall the plan expires in January of 2014. 
At the end of the quarter, cash and short-term cash investments were $697 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. And debt was 1,158,000,000. Net debt therefore was $461 million at the end of the quarter. 
In late June we completed an amendment to our $1 billion revolving credit facility to extend the maturity 2 years to July 2016 and reduce the pricing to market rates. This amendment results in a more staggered debt maturity schedule for the company and the current borrowing level will save about $5.5 million a year in interest expense. 
At June 30, the company had availability under its facility of $537 million. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remained very strong at 1.26x and 22x, respectively. And EBITDA for Q2 was approximately $237 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business"

And I'd like also to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. I'll spend a few moments to highlight our second quarter achievements then I plan to discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets and then I will close with some comments in our outlook for the third quarter and the full year of 2011. 
The second quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol, as we achieved quarterly sales of more than $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. We are very pleased that despite continued uncertainty in the economy, we were able to exceed in the high end of our guidance in both sales and earnings per share with revenues growing 15% from prior year and 8% sequentially to $1,018,000,000 and EPS reaching the record $0.79, excluding one-time items. 
And although we continue to face significant cost challenges around the world, the Aptel operating team executed extremely well in the quarter, achieving these operating margins of 19.4%. We're especially proud that our net margins reached 13.4% of sales, which remains a clear reflexion of the financial strength of Amphenol. The strong cash flow of $105 million in the quarter, which was used in part for the continuation of our stock buyback program, is another excellent sign of Amphenol's national strength. These results are clear and direct reflection of the strength and discipline of Amphenol's agile and entrepreneurial team of more than 70 general managers and group executives around the world.
Turning to the trends and the progress on our served markets. The Military Aerospace market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 20% from prior year, benefiting from an accelerated growth of our products sold into Commercial Aero programs as well as from the contribution from the Borish acquisition. 
On a sequential basis, sales were up slightly with Military sales relatively flat from the first quarter as defense contractors continue to be cautious in placing orders. This was offset by stronger demand in the Commercial Aero market. In light of continued budget uncertainties as well as normal third quarter seasonality, we expect sales in the third quarter to moderate, particularly in the military market. Although we have a positive outlook for the Commercial Aero market as jet liner volumes increase and as new programs take flight in the second half of 2011. 
Longer term, we're extremely confident that our technology leadership will drive continued expansion of Amphenol's market position into the future as we continue to expand our potential in the many new electronics applications that are emerging in the Military and Aerospace market. 
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 21% from prior year and an excellent 11% from the first quarter as we capitalized on the many exciting new technology opportunities in the global industrial market. Our progress is continuing to accelerate in emerging markets including especially in China and India. And we saw excellent performance in the factory automation, oil and gas, instrumentation, as well as the heavy equipment segments of the industrial market. While we expect this market to moderate seasonally in the third quarter, we remain very optimistic that our efforts in the many diverse segments of the industrial market will continue to drive strong growth into the future.
Sales in the Automotive market represented 8% of our total this quarter and sales there increased a very strong 55% from prior year and 20% sequentially. As we benefited from the continued expansion of our participation in new electronics applications, in both traditional and hybrid-electric vehicles and as we benefited as well from the recent Centome acquisition. We are continually broadening our range of high-technology Automotive Interconnect Solutions to capitalize on the many new electronics applications in vehicles. In addition, we are very encouraged by our expanding geographic diversification in this important automotive market. Although we expect normal seasonal moderation of the automotive market in the third quarter, we remain very excited about the many opportunities for future growth in both traditional and hybrid vehicle applications.
The Broadband market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in Broadband were stronger than expected in the second quarter, rising 15% sequentially and down only slightly from prior year, as buildout activity increased in the U.S. Cable market and as operator investment accelerated in Latin America and other emerging markets. We expect demand in the Broadband market to further strengthen in the third quarter as we continue to expand our technology offering to this very important market.
The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. While sales were down 3% from prior year, we were very pleased to experience 9% sequential growth in the IT market, as we were able to capitalize on renewed demand for our advanced interconnect products used, in particular, in networking and storage equipment. We continued to see accelerating in customer demand for higher performance equipment that is to support rapidly expanding IP video and other bandwidth-hungry applications, many of which are being driven in part by the proliferation of new data intensive mobile Internet devices. We expect demand in the IT market to further improve in the third quarter and beyond as we take advantage of new design wins with our high-technology products across a broad array of IT customers as well as equipment platforms.
The Mobile Networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased slightly from prior year and were flat sequentially as operators in certain geographies paused their wireless buildout activities. Nevertheless, we're excited by the expanding opportunities that we see for our interconnect products and antennas in the many newly upgraded base station systems, and we look forward  to continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. We expect demand to be stable in this market in the third quarter, and we look forward  to a positive long-term trend in Mobile Networks as network operators upgrade their systems to support the explosive growth of new smartphones and tablets.
The Mobile Devices market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 36% from prior year and increased sequentially by 11% as we capitalized on our expanded product position in new smart mobile Devices. We're especially excited that our successful product and customer diversification drive has positioned us to participate in the expanding market for these devices, whether standard handsets, smartphones or tablet computers. We expect sales in the Mobile Device market to increase further in the third quarter as we continue to leverage our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers.
In summary, I'm extremely proud of our organization as we have executed very well in this tremendous and challenging environment. These strong results are a direct result of our distinct and resilient competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers and diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team. 
Although there are unprecedented inflationary pressures as well as uncertainties in several end markets, I have tremendous confidence in the Amphenol management team in such an environment. We will continue to excel by reacting quickly to our changing customer needs to further strengthen our market position and we'll continue to drive proactive actions to secure our leading operating margin. Most importantly, it is our commitment as a management team to pursue these results with the level of passion and effectiveness that ensures the continued superior performance of Amphenol. 
Now looking forward into the third quarter and the remainder of 2011, and based on the continuation of current economic trends and constant exchange rates, we now expect the following. Sales in the third quarter in the range of $1 billion to $1,015,000,000 and for the full year 2011, $3,975,000,000 to $4,005,000,000, respectively. Our earnings per share we expect in the range of $0.77 to $0.79 for the third quarter and $3.07 to $3.11 for the full year, respectively. 
Despite the many uncertainties that are in the economy today, I'm extremely confident in our ability of our organization to build on these new record results by capitalizing on the many opportunities that we see to further expand both our market position, as well as our strong financial performance. Thank you very much and at this time, operator, we would be very happy to entertain any questions that might be there."

Clearly now with all the governmental negotiations in the background, the budgets have not yet been released and there continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty in that market. Long-term with the Military market, we're still extremely committed to that market. We believe that there is, and we continue to see that there is, a tremendous explosion of electronics activities in that market. We are participating still on all the major platforms and really enabling these new electronics. In addition, I've spoken about in the past that Military is not just a U.S., a U.K. or Western Europe phenomenon. We see a lot of opportunities in the Military market. In the long term, in emerging markets and we are very well positioned to take advantage of those. But obviously we will continually adjust our sort of feet on the street, the engineering resources, the sales resources, all across the board to attack those growth opportunities and that's the beauty of Amphenol. The beauty of the agility of our organization is such that we are not sort of locked in organizationally to one or another market or segment within that market. We're constantly re apportioning people to go after the growth segments. And within the Military there continues to be very, very strong growth segments. Things like unmanned aerial vehicle, things like upgraded communication systems, the new jetliner new avionics system and these are still areas of the Military where we see tremendous strength. And obviously we reapportion our engineering, our technology development, our sales resources very rapidly to sort of redeploy onto these exciting opportunities. And with that I'm very confident that regardless of what will happen long-term with the budgets, we're going to continue to be very, very well positioned in that market."

It is clearly accelerating as we push the limits of performance on new products in high-speed, as we push the limits on power efficiency, as we push the limits of products that can be put into harsh environment, in our harsh environment.

I think that when we talked about profitability for this quarter, clearly the pressures from a cost perspective more than offset the pricing actions that we were able to realize in the quarter. I think that our guidance assumes at this point a continuation of the margin levels that we've seen in Q2. As we move into Q3, we will continue to have some additional costs relating to some of the headcount actions that we will be completing early in Q3. I think that we would hope that as we move into Q4 that the benefit of these cost reduction actions perhaps pricing and then if the material environment were to stabilize more at these current levels then it maybe in the end that our Q4 expectation that we have from that perspective may prove to be a conservative one.

And I think this quarter we achieved new records in 3 areas, orders, sales and earnings per share. We would have loved to achieve new records in ROS also, but the environment right now is a little bit more, more tougher.

But I have a tremendous confidence that our organization as it is, more than 70 general managers, each of them being able and empowered to attack every element of cost.

I think we just truly believe that you have got to deal on a more permanent basis with these cost increases. And many of the pressures on commodities seemed to some extent to be permanent increases in cost, at least in the medium term here. So we just feel that overall from an execution standpoint it to take that responsibility away from the operating units would be a mistake and cause an erosion of overall profitability that would more than offset any benefit we might get when we would hedge at a headquarters level. And so we really believe that it's got to come through pricing. It's got to come through other cost reduction actions, some may be related as your next part of your question. Goes towards reducing labor cost as an example. And so I really don't think that with our structure in the entrepreneurial way that we allowed each business unit to be run to layer a hedge on top of that which is at some point is in terms, of which commodities are going to go would help us from an overall profitability perspective and maybe Adam you want to talk about the second part of the question"

And relative to China, I mean, no doubt. We are looking at every element of how do we offset these labor increases and that can come through automation, that can come through driving more efficiencies and the factories and it can come from relocating facilities and we have a tremendous effort ongoing to find new places for certain of our facilities and those are really in the middle of progress. And as you know, we don't consolidate all of these facilities, we have 24 of them around China in different regions. The good fortune that we have and having done that is that each individual place has different time schedules for increases, different dynamics that go along with the cost. And so as we seek to move production to lower cost either lower cost into China or lower cost into different regions, it is not such a cataclysmic change where you have to move this monstrous facility is more the ongoing normal course of business movement of production from one facility to another, that is done on a more sort of business unit level within Amphenol. And clearly though, that is an area where we spend a lot of our focus, there are opportunities in other parts of China, which we have done extensive reviews of. And we have actually teams on the ground in several of those places even today looking at new facilities and new places where you can reduce the labor within China. The thing is China remains for us a significant marketplace, a lot of our customers are producing in China. And in fact, the end market of China has become a very significant market for Amphenol. And so to say that you move out of China and export into China, that also doesn't necessarily make a tremendous amount of sense. But clearly you got to go to those parts of China where the labor availability and such, where the cost of labor is such that you can get a benefit and that's something that we are really driving over the course of next quarter and beyond to make sure that we can offset these labor increases. The increases this year were particularly strong and acute. They were coupled with tax increases, they were coupled with other benefit increases. So there was a lot to chew on this year in China. But I can tell you that our team is one that can clearly manage through that over the long term."

So we feel it is important to take these actions quickly so that we get those appropriate cost structures and get the benefit down the road.

We are very careful in that business in terms of how we run the business in every aspect. We run the business to a business which lasts between 3 and 6 and 9 months for each product lifecycle. So you are not going to build up 3, 6 months of inventory something that only has a 6 month life cycle. So no, that was inventory issue. I can tell you that running that Mobile Devices business is really one of the most nimble, agile organization that we have. They are constantly reallocating people to different customers constantly re apportioning engineering resources. Because what we don't try to do, and I think I've said this many times, Matt, we are not trying to guess which is going to be the hit product on the market. We're just trying to be on the hit product by being on as many of the products as possible. And that means you've got to do this in a very low cost environment, essentially we do all of our engineering in Asia for this non-high-cost area. We have a very lean customer coverage teams who are there to really be again constantly reallocating their time to those accounts where there is the opportunity. We never know which model is going to be successful. I mean so many times we have thought one would not be successful and it was a wild success and vice versa. It's very, very exciting market on Mobile Devices. Because as you think about it, the technology, the transformational technology, given the short lifecycle of the product is such that we can constantly innovate and constantly be gaining share, gaining position with new customers as we then create new technologies that help them enable the functionality of their end device. And that's something that Amphenol and our organization just does so well. And we have a tremendous reception from our customers. And then in the end, you have to execute and the execution on those designs means you've got to ramp as quickly as the customer needs you to ramp. Sometimes you have to double your capacity from what they originally told you to do. How you do that in the less capital-intensive way? How do you do that in a rapid way or maybe others don't have the flexibility in how they do business? That has been a tremendous asset for us and has a lot of to really capitalize on what has been a wonderful trend for the business. Now we certainly don't expect that always to grow 36% year-over-year. I mean that clearly, the law of large numbers would take hold. But we do expect to always be participating very strongly in that market and we're very excited about that market going forward."

Obviously, we did not participate so strongly in things like laptop, computers and PCs and to the extent that tablets, which we view really as an extension of the smartphone and its functionality and the technology that needs to be embedded in it, those tablets have, I believe, replaced to some extent the purchases or at least the replacement cycles of products that we never participated in the past. And so net-net that has been a real positive for us. I think tablets are a product where the end customer and thereby the equipment manufacturers demand on technology on the ability to ramp, the things that I just spoke about, are magnified even more than they are in the smartphone. And so to that extent, our ability again to execute and to deliver the strong technologies in tablets is something that I think our customers very, very much appreciate.

Good afternoon, my name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter call.
Q2 Results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed Q2 achieving strong growth and beating the high end of the company's expectations. Sales were $1,018,000,000 and EPS was $0.85 including $0.06 relating to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.79, this represents the company's first quarter with sales over $1 billion and represents new record for both sales and earnings per share. 
Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies over the second quarter of 2010. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales in Q2 2011 were up 8% over last year. Sequentially, sales were up to 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically from Q1. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 major components. Our cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was up 9% from last year and up 17% from last quarter. The sales growth from last quarter relates primarily to increased spending in both North America and international broadband markets. The growth from last year relates primarily to strong demand in South American communications market. 
The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 15% from last year and 8% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
Operating income for the quarter was $215 million compared to $176 million last year. Operating margin was 21.1% compared to 19.8% last year. Operating income includes income of approximately $18 million relating to an adjustment to reduce a previously recorded contingent payment obligation for a 2010 U.S.-based acquisition. 
In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, contingent obligations are reassessed based on current performance expectations and adjusted accordingly through operating income. This adjustment relates primarily to the push out of certain defense-related program to periods beyond this year. 
We continue to be excited about the acquisition and expect strong future performance. Excluding this adjustment, operating margin was 19.4% for Q2 2011. Operating income as net of stock option expense of approximately $7 million this quarter and $6.2 million in the prior year quarter, or 0.7% of sales in both quarters. 
From a segment standpoint in the cable business, margins were 12.8%, down from 13.5% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher relative material costs. 
From a sequential standpoint, cable margins improved from 11.8% in Q1 as a result of higher volume and pricing action. In the interconnect business, margins were 21.6% compared to 22.3% last year. The lower interconnect operating margins reflect a slight reduction in gross margin as a positive impact of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases were more than offset by increases in material input cost. 
In addition, there were costs in the quarter that were somewhat higher as workforce reductions of about 4% were implemented in the areas of the business with slower demand. Overall, we're pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. Excluding the one-time acquisition adjustment, this represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over Q2 2010 of approximately 16%. While this conversion margin is below our long-term goal, the company's overall profitability level continued to be very strong in the face of significant global cost pressures and a mixed demand environment. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $11 million compared to $10 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $2 million compared to $0.8 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
In Q2, the company had an effective tax rate of 27.6% compared to a rate of 21.3% in the second quarter of 2010. The prior year quarter included a net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense, primarily due to the favorable outcome of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year tax audits of about $10 million or $0.06 per share. 
The 2011 quarter includes tax expense of approximately $6.6 million relating to the $18 million acquisition-related gain. Excluding this, the effective tax rate in Q2 2011 was just under 27%. We currently expect a rate of about 27% in the second half of this year. The reduction in the rate from 2010 reflects primarily a lower mix of U.S. income.
Net income, excluding the one-time items was approximately 13.4% of sales in Q2 2011 compared to 13.5% of sales in Q2 2010, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share for Q2 was on -- and as reported basis $0.85 this year and $0.74 last year. After adjustment for one-time items, diluted earnings per share was $0.79 in 2011 and $0.68 in 2010, up 16% from the prior year. 
Orders for the quarter were a record 1,007,000,000, up 11% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1. The company is an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations with $105 million in the quarter. This is approximately 77% of net income for the quarter and 82% for the 6 months. The computation excludes the one-time acquisition gain. Operating cash flow in Q2 does reflect higher interest and tax payments in accordance with normal payment schedule. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory in the quarter was $600 and -- $42 million at the end of June. This is up about 4% from March, excluding the impacts of acquisition and translation. Inventory days declined 2 days from March to 83 days. While we made some progress improving inventory turnover, we continue to hold a portion of the inventory build in Q1 and we'll continue to work in the second half to further improve inventory turns. 
Accounts receivable was $793 million at the end of June, up 4%, excluding the impact of exchange and acquisitions and reflecting the sequential sales increase. Day sales outstanding decreased 2 days to 69 days at the end of June from 71 days at the end of March. 
The cash flow from operations along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $209 million and $10 million in proceeds from option exercises were used primarily to fund $23 million in capital expenditures, $92 million in acquisition-related expenditures relating to both the previously announced acquisition in April of an automotive interconnect company and a performance-based payment for a 2010 acquisition. 
We also made payments to noncontrolling shareholders of $27 million to purchase the remaining shareholder interest, and cash and cash investments increased $5 million in the quarter. In addition, the company purchased 3.2 million shares of its stock for $172 million in the quarter under the company's stock buyback plan. We have approximately 13.4 million shares remaining under that plan and as you may recall the plan expires in January of 2014. 
At the end of the quarter, cash and short-term cash investments were $697 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. And debt was $1,158,000,000. Net debt therefore was $461 million at the end of the quarter. 
In late June, we completed an amendment to our $1 billion revolving credit facility to extend the maturity 2 years to July 2016 and reduce the pricing-to-market rates. This amendment results in a more staggered debt maturity schedule for the company and the current borrowing level will save about $5.5 million a year in interest expense. 
At June 30, the company had availability under its facility of $537 million. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remained very strong at 1.26x and 22x, respectively. And EBITDA for Q2 was approximately $237 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I'll spend a few moments to highlight our second quarter achievements then I plan to discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets",1436,"Well, thank you very much, Diana, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. I'll spend a few moments to highlight our second quarter achievements then I plan to discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets and then I'll close with some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year of 2011. 
The second quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol, as we achieved quarterly sales of more than $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. We are very pleased that despite continued uncertainty in the economy, we were able to exceed the high end of our guidance in both sales and earnings per share with revenues growing 15% from prior year and 8% sequentially to $1,018,000,000 and EPS reaching the record $0.79, excluding one-time items. 
And although we continue to face significant cost challenges around the world, the Amphenol operating team executed extremely well in the quarter, achieving these operating margins of 19.4%. We're especially proud that our net margins reached 13.4% of sales, which remains a clear reflexion of the financial strength of Amphenol. The strong cash flow of $105 million in the quarter, which was used in part for the continuation of our stock buyback program, is another excellent sign of Amphenol's financial strength. These results are clear and direct reflection of the strength and discipline of Amphenol's agile and entrepreneurial team of more than 70 general managers and group executives around the world.
Turning to the trends and the progress in our served markets. The Military, Aerospace market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 20% from prior year, benefiting from an accelerated growth of our products sold into Commercial Aero programs as well as from the contributions from the Borisch acquisition. 
On a sequential basis, sales were up slightly with Military sales relatively flat from the first quarter as defense contractors continue to be cautious in placing orders. This was offset by stronger demand in the Commercial Aero market. In light of continued budget uncertainties as well as normal third quarter seasonality, we expect sales in the third quarter to moderate, particularly in the Military market. Although we have a positive outlook for the Commercial Aero market as jet liner volumes increase and as new programs take flight in the second half of 2011. 
Longer term, we're extremely confident that our technology leadership will drive continued expansion of Amphenol's market position into the future as we continue to expand our potential in the many new electronics applications that are emerging in the Military and Aerospace market. 
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 21% from prior year and an excellent 11% from the first quarter as we capitalized on the many exciting new technology opportunities in the global industrial market. Our progress is continuing to accelerate in emerging markets including especially in China and India. And we saw excellent performance in the factory automation, oil and gas, instrumentation, as well as the heavy equipment segments of the industrial market. While we expect this market to moderate seasonally in the third quarter, we remain very optimistic that our efforts in the many diverse segments of the industrial market will continue to drive strong growth into the future.
Sales in the Automotive market represented 8% of our total this quarter and sales there increased a very strong 55% from prior year and 20% sequentially. As we benefited from the continued expansion of our participation in new electronics applications, in both traditional and hybrid-electric vehicles and as we benefited as well from the recent Santome [ph] acquisition. We are continually broadening our range of high-technology Automotive, interconnect solutions to capitalize on the many new electronics applications in vehicles. In addition, we are very encouraged by our expanding geographical diversification in this important automotive market. Although we expect normal seasonal moderation of the Automotive market in the third quarter, we remain very excited about the many opportunities for future growth in both traditional and hybrid vehicle applications.
The Broadband market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in Broadband were stronger than expected in the second quarter, rising 15% sequentially and down only slightly from prior year, as build-out activity increased in the U.S. cable market and as operator investment accelerated in Latin America and other emerging markets. We expect demand in the Broadband market to further strengthen in the third quarter as we continue to expand our technology offering to this very important market.
The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. While sales were down 3% from prior year, we were very pleased to experience 9% sequential growth in the IT market, as we were able to capitalize on renewed demand for our advanced interconnect products used, in particular, in networking and storage equipment. We continued to see accelerating in customer demand for higher performance equipment that is to support rapidly expanding IP video and other bandwidth-hungry applications, many of which are being driven in part by the proliferation of new data-intensive mobile Internet devices. We expect demand in the IT market to further improve in the third quarter and beyond as we take advantage of new design wins with our high-technology products across a broad array of IT customers as well as equipment platforms.
The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased slightly from prior year and were flat sequentially as operators in certain geographies paused their wireless build-out activities. Nevertheless, we are excited by the expanding opportunities that we see for our interconnect products and antennas in the many newly upgraded base-station systems, and we look forward  to continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. We expect demand to be stable in this market in the third quarter, and we look forward  to a positive long-term trend in mobile networks as network operators upgrade their systems to support the explosive growth of new smartphones and tablets.
The Mobile Devices market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 36% from prior year and increased sequentially by 11% as we capitalized on our expanded product position in new smart mobile devices. We are especially excited that our successful product and customer diversification drive has positioned us to participate in the expanding market for these devices, whether standard handsets, smartphones or tablet computers. We expect sales in the Mobile Device market to increase further in the third quarter as we continue to leverage our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers.
In summary, I'm extremely proud of our organization as we have executed very well in this tremendously challenging environment. These strong results are a direct result of our distinct and resilient competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team. 
Although there are unprecedented inflationary pressures as well as uncertainties in several end markets, I have tremendous confidence in the Amphenol management team in such an environment. We will continue to excel by reacting quickly to our changing customer needs to further strengthen our market position and we will continue to drive proactive actions to secure our leading operating margin. Most importantly, it is our commitment as a management team to pursue these results with the level of passion and effectiveness that ensures the continued superior performance of Amphenol. Now looking forward into the third quarter and the remainder of 2011, and based on the continuation of current economic trends and constant exchange rates, we now expect the following: Sales in the third quarter in the range of $1 billion to $1,015,000,000 and for the full year 2011, $3,975,000,000 to $4,005,000,000, respectively. Our earnings per share we expect in the range of $0.77 to $0.79 for the third quarter and $3.07 to $3.11 for the full year, respectively. 
Despite the many uncertainties that are in the economy today, I am extremely confident in our ability of our organization to build on these new record results by capitalizing on the many opportunities that we see to further expand both our market position, as well as our strong financial performance. Thank you very much and at this time, operator, we'd be very happy to entertain any questions that might be there."

And certainly we recognize that defense budgets are under pressure. I mean, our country does not appear to be able to make a budget, let alone to say what that budget will be. So clearly we thought in the first quarter that with the budget passing that, that would bring some relief and that the orders would begin to become more strongly. Clearly now with all the governmental negotiations in the background, the budgets have not yet been released and there continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty in that market. Long term with the Military market, we're still extremely committed to that market. We believe that there is, and we continue to see that there is a tremendous explosion of electronics activities in that market. We are participating still on all the major platforms and really enabling these new electronics. In addition, I've spoken about it in the past that Military is not just a U.S., a U.K. or Western Europe phenomenon. We see a lot of opportunities in the Military market. In the long term, in emerging markets and we are very well positioned to take advantage of those. But obviously we will continually adjust our sort of feet on the street, the engineering resources, the sales resources, all across the board to attack those growth opportunities and that's the beauty of Amphenol. The beauty of the agility of our organization is such that we are not sort of locked in organizationally to one or another market or segment within that market. We're constantly reapportioning people to go after the growth segments. And within the Military, there continues to be very, very strong growth segments. Things like unmanned aerial vehicle, things like upgraded communication systems, the new jetliner, new avionics system and these are still areas of the Military where we see tremendous strength. And obviously we reapportion our engineering, our technology development, our sales resources very rapidly to sort of redeploy onto these exciting opportunities. And with that, I'm very confident that regardless of what will happen long term with the budgets, we're going to continue to be very, very well positioned in that market."

I mean, look, the beauty of our company is we are very diversified and the diversification of Amphenol has always been really -- not just a real strategy of our management team but a real asset for the company. And there's no question. In any given quarter, some markets can be stronger than others and you see that in the consistency of the results. But clearly within each market, there can be ups and downs. I think as we sit today, I won't repeat myself from all the markets that I talked about, because I talked through each of those where we see them, but clearly there are ones like mobile phones, IT, where we feel that there is a good momentum, Automotive has good momentum, Industrial has a good momentum. We wish that the government would have a quicker ability to make budgets and thereby could get rid of some of the caution in the defense industry, feel strong about Commercial Aero. I mean, there is a real diverse in these markets. Overall, I think to your question, with an overall sense, I am not a macroeconomist so I'm not going to tell you my views on the economy, but I can tell you that we continue to believe that the opportunities in our industry and the opportunities in the electronics industry are fabulous. And those are really fabulous long-term because we see that there is a real revolution of electronics being proliferated into all aspects of life. And so whether that be in a fighter jet or in a smartphone, the new functionalities that are being driven and really being driven by end consumers are creating demand for our products. And we are matching that with leading technology innovation. And our technology innovation is accelerating. It is clearly accelerating as we push the limits of performance on new products in high-speed, as we push the limits on power efficiency, as we push the limits of products that can be put into harsh environment, in ROS environment. Our technology innovation machine is really running at high speed today to capitalize on those growth segments of the market that we see. So in overall, I feel very good about the market. I think the economy is going to be what it's going to be and we're going to deal with it as it comes."

I mean, I think that we certainly have worked very hard at pricing over the last 6 to 9 months and certainly had some success with pricing actions in certain markets. I think that the mix demand environment has made in certain parts of the business pricing harder. But clearly it continues to be a focus. I think that when we talked about profitability for this quarter, clearly the pressures from a cost perspective more than offset the pricing actions that we were able to realize in the quarter. I think that our guidance assumes at this point, a continuation of the margin levels that we've seen in Q2. As we move into Q3, we will continue to have some additional costs relating to some of the headcount actions that we will be completing early in Q3. I think that we would hope that as we move into Q4 that the benefit of these cost reduction actions perhaps pricing and then if the material environment were to stabilize more at these current levels, then it maybe in the end that the Q4 expectation that we have from an ROS perspective may prove to be a conservative one. But I think we feel at this point in time, that the guidance that we've given for the second half which essentially incorporate the Q2 ROS levels is the right one to give at this moment."

Clearly, there is, in IT, we saw a couple of quarters in a row where we do not see that kind of sequential strength. We are very pleased to finally see that this quarter. And our position, especially in networking equipment and storage equipment with high-speed products, that has helped us in the second quarter to see that, finally, the sequential growth. And we expect to see further sequential growth going into the third quarter as companies continually have to upgrade especially their networking and their storage equipment. Relative to Mobile Devices, I think there is just a real expansion still of smartphones even if there are massive share shift that happened among the various vendors within that market, we're very pleased that we participate essentially with all of them and so we're able to enjoy the upside that comes when one or another wins or loses.

Hedging, I mean, we -- I think, Amit, probably have done and maybe we'll continue to do a little bit more prebuying, whether you call that a hedge, and I don't think that's exactly what your question is aimed at. I think we just truly believe that you have got to deal on a more permanent basis with these cost increases. And many of the pressures on commodities seem, to some extent, to be permanent increases in cost, at least in -- since the medium term here. And so we just feel that overall from an execution standpoint, to take that responsibility away from the operating units would be a mistake and it would cause an erosion of overall profitability that would more than offset any benefit we might get as when we would hedge at a headquarters level. And so we really believe that it's got to come through pricing, it's got to come through other cost reduction actions. Some may be related as your next part of your question goes towards reducing labor cost as an example.

And relative to China, I mean, no doubt we are looking at every element of how do we offset these labor increases. And that can come through automation, that can come through driving more efficiencies in the factories and it can come from relocating facilities. And we have a tremendous effort ongoing to find new places for certain of our facilities and those are really in the middle of progress. And as you know, we don't consolidate all of these facilities, we have 24 of them around China in different regions. The good fortune that we have in having done that, is that each individual place has different time schedules for increases, different dynamics that go along with the cost. And so as we seek to move production to lower cost, either lower cost areas of China or lower cost into different regions, it is not such a cataclysmic change where you have to move this monstrous facility. It is more the ongoing normal course of business movement of production from one facility to another, that is done on a more sort of business unit level within Amphenol. And clearly though, that is an area where we spend a lot of our focus, there are opportunities in other parts of China, which we have done extensive reviews of. And we have actually teams on the ground in several of those places even today looking at new facilities and new places where you can reduce the labor within China. The thing is China remains for us a significant marketplace. A lot of our customers are producing in China, and in fact, the end market of China has become a very significant market for Amphenol. And so to say that you move out of China and export into China, that also doesn't necessarily make a tremendous amount of sense. But clearly, you've got to go to those parts of China where the labor availability is such, where the cost of labor is such that you can get a benefit. And that's something that we are clearly driving over the course of the next quarter and beyond to make sure that we can offset these labor increases. The increases this year were particularly strong and acute. They were coupled with tax increases, they were coupled with other benefit increases. So there was a lot to chew on this year in China. But I can tell you that our team is one that can clearly manage through that over the long term."

Because what we don't try to do, and I think I've said this many times, Matt, we are not trying to guess which is going to be the hit product on the market. We're just trying to be on the hit product by being on as many of the products as possible. And that means you've got to do this in a very low cost environment. Essentially, we do all of our engineering in Asia for this non -- I mean, high-cost areas. We have very lean customer coverage teams who are there to really be, again, constantly reallocating their time to those accounts where there is the opportunity. We just -- we never know which model is going to be successful. I mean, so many times we have thought one would not be successful and it was a wild success and vice versa. It's a very, very exciting market on Mobile Devices. Because as you think about it, the technology, the transformation of the technology, given the short life cycle of the product is such that we can constantly innovate and constantly be gaining share, gaining position with new customers as we then create new technologies that help them enable the functionality of their end device. And that's something that Amphenol and our organization just does so well. And we have a tremendous reception from our customers. And then in the end, you have to execute and the execution on those new designs means you've got to ramp as quickly as the customer needs you to ramp. Sometimes you've got to double your capacity from what they originally told you to do. How do you do that in a less capital-intensive way? How do you do that in a rapid way where maybe others don't have the flexibility in how they do business? That has been a tremendous asset for us and has allowed us to really capitalize on what has been just a wonderful trend for the business. Now we certainly don't expect that always to grow 36% year-over-year. I mean, that -- clearly the law of large numbers would take hold. But we do expect to always be participating very strongly in that market and we're very excited about that market going forward."

Obviously, we did not participate so strongly in things like laptop, computers and PCs and to the extent that tablets, which we view really as an extension of a smartphone in its functionality and the technology that needs to be embedded in it, those tablets have, I believe, replaced to some extent, the purchases or at least the replacement cycles of products that we never participated in the past. And so net-net that has been a real positive for us. I think tablets are a product where the end customer and thereby the equipment manufacturers demand on technology on the ability to ramp, the things that I just spoke about, they're magnified even more than they are in a smartphone. And so to that extent, our ability again to execute and to deliver the strong technologies in tablets is something that I think our customers very, very much appreciate. And that translates then into getting the good position. Obviously, there appears to be one who has had the most successful tablet but that doesn't mean that that's the only one that we're going to work on. We work on many, many of these applications. In the end, it appears that customers migrate towards one of those models."

I think that real uplift that we are seeing from those efforts is something that's helping us out. In addition, we continue to drive the relationship of those customers, the total solution with those customers allows us to take share with them. There are ups and downs clearly in the IT market.

Good afternoon, my name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter call.
Q2 Results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed Q2 achieving strong growth and beating the high end of the company's expectations. Sales were $1,018,000,000 and EPS was $0.85 including $0.06 relating to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.79. This represents the company's first quarter with sales over $1 billion and represents new record for both sales and earnings per share. 
Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies over the second quarter of 2010. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales in Q2 2011 were up 8% over last year. Sequentially, sales were up to 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically from Q1. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 major components. Our cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was up 9% from last year and up 17% from last quarter. The sales growth from last quarter relates primarily to increased spending in both North America and international broadband markets. The growth from last year relates primarily to strong demand in South American communications market. 
The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 15% from last year and 8% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
Operating income for the quarter was $215 million compared to $176 million last year. Operating margin was 21.1% compared to 19.8% last year. Operating income includes income of approximately $18 million relating to an adjustment to reduce a previously recorded contingent payment obligation for a 2010 U.S.-based acquisition. 
In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, contingent obligations are reassessed based on current performance expectations and adjusted accordingly through operating income. This adjustment relates primarily to the push out of certain defense-related program to periods beyond this year. 
We continue to be excited about the acquisition and expect strong future performance. Excluding this adjustment, operating margin was 19.4% for Q2 2011. Operating income as net of stock option expense of approximately $7 million this quarter and $6.2 million in the prior year quarter, or 0.7% of sales in both quarters. 
From a segment standpoint in the cable business, margins were 12.8%, down from 13.5% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher relative material costs. 
From a sequential standpoint, cable margins improved from 11.8% in Q1 as a result of higher volume and pricing action. In the interconnect business, margins were 21.6% compared to 22.3% last year. The lower interconnect operating margins reflect a slight reduction in gross margin as a positive impact of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases were more than offset by increases in material input cost. 
In addition, there were costs in the quarter that were somewhat higher as workforce reductions of about 4% were implemented in the areas of the business with slower demand. Overall, we're pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. Excluding the one-time acquisition adjustment, this represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over Q2 2010 of approximately 16%. While this conversion margin is below our long-term goal, the company's overall profitability level continued to be very strong in the face of significant global cost pressures and a mixed demand environment. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $11 million compared to $10 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $2 million compared to $0.8 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
In Q2, the company had an effective tax rate of 27.6% compared to a rate of 21.3% in the second quarter of 2010. The prior year quarter included a net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense, primarily due to the favorable outcome of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year tax audits of about $10 million or $0.06 per share. 
The 2011 quarter includes tax expense of approximately $6.6 million relating to the $18 million acquisition-related gain. Excluding this, the effective tax rate in Q2 2011 was just under 27%. We currently expect a rate of about 27% in the second half of this year. The reduction in the rate from 2010 reflects primarily a lower mix of U.S. income.
Net income, excluding the one-time items was approximately 13.4% of sales in Q2 2011 compared to 13.5% of sales in Q2 2010, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share for Q2 was on -- and as reported basis $0.85 this year and $0.74 last year. After adjustment for one-time items, diluted earnings per share was $0.79 in 2011 and $0.68 in 2010, up 16% from the prior year. 
Orders for the quarter were a record 1,007,000,000, up 11% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1. The company is an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations with $105 million in the quarter. This is approximately 77% of net income for the quarter and 82% for the 6 months. The computation excludes the one-time acquisition gain. Operating cash flow in Q2 does reflect higher interest and tax payments in accordance with normal payment schedule. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory in the quarter was $600 and -- $42 million at the end of June. This is up about 4% from March, excluding the impacts of acquisition and translation. Inventory days declined 2 days from March to 83 days. While we made some progress improving inventory turnover, we continue to hold a portion of the inventory build in Q1 and we'll continue to work in the second half to further improve inventory turns. 
Accounts receivable was $793 million at the end of June, up 4%, excluding the impact of exchange and acquisitions and reflecting the sequential sales increase. Day sales outstanding decreased 2 days to 69 days at the end of June from 71 days at the end of March. 
The cash flow from operations along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $209 million and $10 million in proceeds from option exercises were used primarily to fund $23 million in capital expenditures, $92 million in acquisition-related expenditures relating to both the previously announced acquisition in April of an automotive interconnect company and a performance-based payment for a 2010 acquisition. 
We also made payments to noncontrolling shareholders of $27 million to purchase the remaining shareholder interest, and cash and cash investments increased $5 million in the quarter. In addition, the company purchased 3.2 million shares of its stock for $172 million in the quarter under the company's stock buyback plan. We have approximately 13.4 million shares remaining under that plan and as you may recall the plan expires in January of 2014. 
At the end of the quarter, cash and short-term cash investments were $697 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. And debt was $1,158,000,000. Net debt therefore was $461 million at the end of the quarter. 
In late June, we completed an amendment to our $1 billion revolving credit facility to extend the maturity 2 years to July 2016 and reduce the pricing-to-market rates. This amendment results in a more staggered debt maturity schedule for the company and the current borrowing level will save about $5.5 million a year in interest expense. 
At June 30, the company had availability under its facility of $537 million. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remained very strong at 1.26x and 22x, respectively. And EBITDA for Q2 was approximately $237 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I'll spend a few moments to highlight our second quarter achievements then I plan to discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets",1436,"Well, thank you very much, Diana, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. I'll spend a few moments to highlight our second quarter achievements then I plan to discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets and then I'll close with some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year of 2011. 
The second quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol, as we achieved quarterly sales of more than $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. We are very pleased that despite continued uncertainty in the economy, we were able to exceed the high end of our guidance in both sales and earnings per share with revenues growing 15% from prior year and 8% sequentially to $1,018,000,000 and EPS reaching the record $0.79, excluding one-time items. 
And although we continue to face significant cost challenges around the world, the Amphenol operating team executed extremely well in the quarter, achieving these operating margins of 19.4%. We're especially proud that our net margins reached 13.4% of sales, which remains a clear reflection of the financial strength of Amphenol. The strong cash flow of $105 million in the quarter, which was used in part for the continuation of our stock buyback program, is another excellent sign of Amphenol's financial strength. These results are clear and direct reflection of the strength and discipline of Amphenol's agile and entrepreneurial team of more than 70 general managers and group executives around the world.
Turning to the trends and the progress in our served markets. The Military, Aerospace market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 20% from prior year, benefiting from an accelerated growth of our products sold into Commercial Aero programs as well as from the contributions from the Borisch acquisition. 
On a sequential basis, sales were up slightly with Military sales relatively flat from the first quarter as defense contractors continue to be cautious in placing orders. This was offset by stronger demand in the Commercial Aero market. In light of continued budget uncertainties as well as normal third quarter seasonality, we expect sales in the third quarter to moderate, particularly in the Military market. Although we have a positive outlook for the Commercial Aero market as jet liner volumes increase and as new programs take flight in the second half of 2011. 
Longer term, we're extremely confident that our technology leadership will drive continued expansion of Amphenol's market position into the future as we continue to expand our potential in the many new electronics applications that are emerging in the Military and Aerospace market. 
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 21% from prior year and an excellent 11% from the first quarter as we capitalized on the many exciting new technology opportunities in the global industrial market. Our progress is continuing to accelerate in emerging markets including especially in China and India. And we saw excellent performance in the factory automation, oil and gas, instrumentation, as well as the heavy equipment segments of the industrial market. While we expect this market to moderate seasonally in the third quarter, we remain very optimistic that our efforts in the many diverse segments of the industrial market will continue to drive strong growth into the future.
Sales in the Automotive market represented 8% of our total this quarter and sales there increased a very strong 55% from prior year and 20% sequentially. As we benefited from the continued expansion of our participation in new electronics applications, in both traditional and hybrid-electric vehicles and as we benefited as well from the recent Santome [ph] acquisition. We are continually broadening our range of high-technology Automotive, interconnect solutions to capitalize on the many new electronics applications in vehicles. In addition, we are very encouraged by our expanding geographical diversification in this important automotive market. Although we expect normal seasonal moderation of the Automotive market in the third quarter, we remain very excited about the many opportunities for future growth in both traditional and hybrid vehicle applications.
The Broadband market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in Broadband were stronger than expected in the second quarter, rising 15% sequentially and down only slightly from prior year, as build-out activity increased in the U.S. cable market and as operator investment accelerated in Latin America and other emerging markets. We expect demand in the Broadband market to further strengthen in the third quarter as we continue to expand our technology offering to this very important market.
The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. While sales were down 3% from prior year, we were very pleased to experience 9% sequential growth in the IT market, as we were able to capitalize on renewed demand for our advanced interconnect products used, in particular, in networking and storage equipment. We continued to see accelerating in customer demand for higher performance equipment that is to support rapidly expanding IP video and other bandwidth-hungry applications, many of which are being driven in part by the proliferation of new data-intensive mobile Internet devices. We expect demand in the IT market to further improve in the third quarter and beyond as we take advantage of new design wins with our high-technology products across a broad array of IT customers as well as equipment platforms.
The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased slightly from prior year and were flat sequentially as operators in certain geographies paused their wireless build-out activities. Nevertheless, we are excited by the expanding opportunities that we see for our interconnect products and antennas in the many newly upgraded base-station systems, and we look forward to continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. We expect demand to be stable in this market in the third quarter, and we look forward to a positive long-term trend in mobile networks as network operators upgrade their systems to support the explosive growth of new smartphones and tablets.
The Mobile Devices market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 36% from prior year and increased sequentially by 11% as we capitalized on our expanded product position in new smart mobile devices. We are especially excited that our successful product and customer diversification drive has positioned us to participate in the expanding market for these devices, whether standard handsets, smartphones or tablet computers. We expect sales in the Mobile Device market to increase further in the third quarter as we continue to leverage our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers.
In summary, I'm extremely proud of our organization as we have executed very well in this tremendously challenging environment. These strong results are a direct result of our distinct and resilient competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team. 
Although there are unprecedented inflationary pressures as well as uncertainties in several end markets, I have tremendous confidence in the Amphenol management team in such an environment. We will continue to excel by reacting quickly to our changing customer needs to further strengthen our market position and we will continue to drive proactive actions to secure our leading operating margin. Most importantly, it is our commitment as a management team to pursue these results with the level of passion and effectiveness that ensures the continued superior performance of Amphenol. Now looking forward into the third quarter and the remainder of 2011, and based on the continuation of current economic trends and constant exchange rates, we now expect the following: Sales in the third quarter in the range of $1 billion to $1,015,000,000 and for the full year 2011, $3,975,000,000 to $4,005,000,000, respectively. Our earnings per share we expect in the range of $0.77 to $0.79 for the third quarter and $3.07 to $3.11 for the full year, respectively. 
Despite the many uncertainties that are in the economy today, I am extremely confident in our ability of our organization to build on these new record results by capitalizing on the many opportunities that we see to further expand both our market position, as well as our strong financial performance. Thank you very much and at this time, operator, we'd be very happy to entertain any questions that might be there."

So clearly we thought in the first quarter that with the budget passing that, that would bring some relief and that the orders would begin to become more strongly. Clearly now with all the governmental negotiations in the background, the budgets have not yet been released and there continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty in that market. Long term with the Military market, we're still extremely committed to that market. We believe that there is, and we continue to see that there is a tremendous explosion of electronics activities in that market. We are participating still on all the major platforms and really enabling these new electronics. In addition, I've spoken about it in the past that Military is not just a U.S., a U.K. or Western Europe phenomenon. We see a lot of opportunities in the Military market. In the long term, in emerging markets and we are very well positioned to take advantage of those. But obviously we will continually adjust our sort of feet on the street, the engineering resources, the sales resources, all across the board to attack those growth opportunities and that's the beauty of Amphenol. The beauty of the agility of our organization is such that we are not sort of locked in organizationally to one or another market or segment within that market. We're constantly reapportioning people to go after the growth segments. And within the Military, there continues to be very, very strong growth segments. Things like unmanned aerial vehicles, things like upgraded communication systems, the new jetliner, new avionics systems and these are still areas of the Military where we see tremendous strength. And obviously we reapportion our engineering, our technology development, our sales resources very rapidly to sort of redeploy onto these exciting opportunities. And with that, I'm very confident that regardless of what will happen long term with the budgets, we're going to continue to be very, very well positioned in that market."

It really depends on the individual case, it depends what type of a seller you have. It depends on what type of universe of buyers you have.

And so whether that be in a fighter jet or in a smartphone, the new functionalities that are being driven and really being driven by end consumers are creating demand for our products. And we are matching that with leading technology innovation. And our technology innovation is accelerating. It is clearly accelerating as we push the limits of performance on new products in high-speed, as we push the limits on power efficiency, as we push the limits of products that can be put into harsh environment, in ROS environment. Our technology innovation machine is really running at high speed today to capitalize on those growth segments of the market that we see. So in overall, I feel very good about the market.

I think that our guidance assumes at this point, a continuation of the margin levels that we've seen in Q2. As we move into Q3, we will continue to have some additional costs relating to some of the headcount actions that we will be completing early in Q3. I think that we would hope that as we move into Q4 that the benefit of these cost reduction actions perhaps pricing and then if the material environment were to stabilize more at these current levels, then it maybe in the end that the Q4 expectation that we have from an ROS perspective may prove to be a conservative one.

This certainly will help. We continue to work on pricing. I think that some volumes certainly never hurts either. So, I mean, I think it's going to be a combination of those things. I mean, we as a management team, work extremely hard every day to maximize the performance of the company. And I think this quarter, we achieved new records in 3 areas: orders, sales and earnings per share. We would have loved to achieve new records in ROS also, but the environment right now is a little bit more tougher. So we are continuing to work towards margin expansion as we look down the road. It's just in the near term certainly it is tougher. But we have not given up at all on that goal, which has been a long-term goal for the company."

Offset the raw material prices, offset the labor increases in China, offset the currency shifts that are there. And clearly that is the real fight. This is in many ways the battle that they are doing. But I have a tremendous confidence that our organization as it is, is more than 70 general managers, each of them being able and empowered to attack every element of cost, are going to find a way to do that. Can that come without volume? That makes it obviously much harder. But there is a clear commitment around the organization, one that Diana and I are driving, reviewing, really working together with our sleeves up with them to make that happen."

Hedging, I mean, we -- I think, Amit, probably have done and maybe we'll continue to do a little bit more prebuying, whether you call that a hedge, and I don't think that's exactly what your question is aimed at. I think we just truly believe that you have got to deal on a more permanent basis with these cost increases. And many of the pressures on commodities seem, to some extent, to be permanent increases in cost, at least in -- since the medium term here. And so we just feel that overall from an execution standpoint, to take that responsibility away from the operating units would be a mistake and it would cause an erosion of overall profitability that would more than offset any benefit we might get as when we would hedge at a headquarters level. And so we really believe that it's got to come through pricing, it's got to come through other cost reduction actions. Some may be related as your next part of your question goes towards reducing labor cost as an example. And so I really don't think that with our structure in the entrepreneurial way that we allowed each business unit to be run to layer a hedge on top of that, which at some point is a guess in terms of which way commodities are going to go, will help us from an overall profitability perspective.

And relative to China, I mean, no doubt we are looking at every element of how do we offset these labor increases. And that can come through automation, that can come through driving more efficiencies in the factories and it can come from relocating facilities. And we have a tremendous effort ongoing to find new places for certain of our facilities and those are really in the middle of progress. And as you know, we don't consolidate all of these facilities. We have 24 of them around China in different regions. The good fortune that we have in having done that is that each individual place has different time schedules for increases, different dynamics that go along with the cost. And so as we seek to move production to lower cost, either lower cost areas of China or lower cost into different regions, it is not such a cataclysmic change where you have to move this monstrous facility. It is more the ongoing normal course of business movement of production from one facility to another. That is done on a more sort of business unit level within Amphenol. And clearly though, that is an area where we spend a lot of our focus, there are opportunities in other parts of China, which we have done extensive reviews of. And we have actually teams on the ground in several of those places even today looking at new facilities and new places where you can reduce the labor within China. The thing is China remains for us a significant marketplace. A lot of our customers are producing in China, and in fact, the end market of China has become a very significant market for Amphenol. And so to say that you move out of China and export into China, that also doesn't necessarily make a tremendous amount of sense. But clearly, you've got to go to those parts of China where the labor availability is such, where the cost of labor is such that you can get a benefit. And that's something that we are clearly driving over the course of the next quarter and beyond to make sure that we can offset these labor increases. The increases this year were particularly strong and acute. They were coupled with tax increases. They were coupled with other benefit increases. So there was a lot to chew on this year in China. But I can tell you that our team is one that can clearly manage through that over the long term."

And so we feel it's important to take these actions quickly so that we get those appropriate cost structures and get the benefit down the road.

We are very careful in that business in terms of how we run the business in every aspect. We've run the business to a business which lasts between 3 and 6 and 9 months for each product life cycle. So you're not going to build up 3, 6 months of inventory on something that only has a 6-month life cycle. So no, that was not an inventory issue. I can tell you that running that Mobile Devices business is really one of the most nimble, agile organizations that we have. They are constantly reallocating people to different customers constantly reapportioning engineering resources. Because what we don't try to do and I think I've said this many times, Matt, we are not trying to guess which is going to be the hit product on the market. We're just trying to be on the hit product by being on as many of the products as possible. And that means you've got to do this in a very low cost environment. Essentially, we do all of our engineering in Asia for this non -- I mean, high-cost areas. We have very lean customer coverage teams who are there to really be, again, constantly reallocating their time to those accounts where there is the opportunity. We just -- we never know which model is going to be successful. I mean, so many times we have thought one would not be successful and it was a wild success and vice versa. It's a very, very exciting market Mobile Devices. Because as you think about it, the technology, the transformation of the technology, given the short life cycle of the product is such that we can constantly innovate and constantly be gaining share, gaining position with new customers as we then create new technologies that help them enable the functionality of their end device. And that's something that Amphenol and our organization just does so well. And we have a tremendous reception from our customers. And then in the end, you have to execute and the execution on those new designs means you've got to ramp as quickly as the customer needs you to ramp. Sometimes you've got to double your capacity from what they originally told you to do. How do you do that in a less capital-intensive way? How do you do that in a rapid way where maybe others don't have the flexibility in how they do business? That has been a tremendous asset for us and has allowed us to really capitalize on what has been just a wonderful trend for the business. Now we certainly don't expect that always to grow 36% year-over-year. I mean, that -- clearly the law of large numbers would take hold. But we do expect to always be participating very strongly in that market and we're very excited about that market going forward."

Obviously, we did not participate so strongly in things like laptop computers and PCs and to the extent that tablets, which we view really as an extension of a smartphone in its functionality and the technology that needs to be embedded in it, those tablets have, I believe, replaced to some extent, the purchases or at least the replacement cycles of products that we never participated in the past. And so net-net that has been a real positive for us. I think tablets are a product where the end customer and thereby the equipment manufacturers demand on technology on the ability to ramp, the things that I just spoke about, they're magnified even more than they are in a smartphone. And so to that extent, our ability again to execute and to deliver the strong technologies in tablets is something that I think our customers very, very much appreciate.

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter call.
Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed the third quarter achieving strong growth and beating the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $1.33 billion and EPS, excluding the effects of one-time items was $0.81, both new records for the company. On an as-reported basis, EPS was $0.79 and included a one-time charge of $0.05 cents relating to the impact of the previously reported flood at the company's New York facility, partially offset by a $0.03 benefit related to a reduction in tax expense from the completion of the audit of certain prior year tax returns. 
Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies over the third quarter of 2010. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in Q3 2011 were up 5% over last year. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from Q2. In comparing Q3 to the midpoint of the company's guidance of $1.8 billion sales exceeded guidance by approximately $25 million. Sales in the Mobile Devices market were particularly strong, growing over 20% sequentially as demand previously planned for the fourth quarter was put forward by certain customers. 
This was partially offset by softness in the industrial market, particularly in Europe reflecting weaker economic conditions and by a reduction of about $11 million as a result of the previously announced flooding at the company's New York facility, which resulted in limited manufacturing and sales activity in the month of September. Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business, which comprise 7% of our sales in the quarter, was up 13% from last year and 2% from last quarter. The Interconnect business which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 9% from last year and 1% sequentially. 
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income for the quarter, excluding the $12.8 million casualty loss relating to the flood, was $199 million compared to $189 million last year. Operating margin was 19.3% compared to 19.9% last year and 19.4% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expenses of approximately $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $7 million in the third quarter of 2010 or about 0.7% of sales in both periods. 
From a segment perspective, in the Cable business, margins were 13.1%, down from 13.5% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher material costs. From a sequential standpoint however, Cable margins improved from 12.8% primarily as a result of lower material costs. In the Interconnect business, margins were 21.5% compared to 22.3% last year. The lower Interconnect operating margins reflect the impacts of increases in material input cost and to a lesser extent, the cost associated with workforce reductions of approximately 5% or 2,000 people in the quarter. 
It also was impacted by the impact of the loss of sales and margin due to the temporary flood related shutdown of the company's New York facility in September. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases. Overall, we're very pleased with the company's margin achievement. The company's overall profitability level continues to be very strong in the face of significant global pressures and the mix demand environment. 
We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and cultural cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward. Interest expense for the quarter was $10.5 million compared to $10.6 million last year, reflecting lower average borrowing costs, partially offset by the higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $2.3 million in the quarter, up from $1.3 million last year primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
The tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 was 23.5% compared to a rate of 22.8% in the third quarter of 2010. The prior year quarter included a net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense, primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits of about $8.4 million or $0.05 per share. The 2011 quarter includes a tax benefit of about $4.8 million or 37% of the $12.8 million casualty loss related to the flood described before and a benefit of $4.5 million or $0.03 relating to the completion of certain prior year tax audits. 
Excluding these effects, the effective tax rate on Q3 2011 was about 26.8% and we currently expect the same rate in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income, excluding one-time items, was approximately 13.4% of sales in Q3, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share on an as-reported basis was $0.79 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.78 in the third quarter of 2010. After adjustment for one-time items, diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.81 in the quarter. 
Orders for the quarter were a record 1.17 billion up 8% from last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.98:1. As we announced last month, in early September, the company incurred flood damage at its Sidney, New York facility. In addition to the loss of sales and margin from the temporary shutdown of the facility in September and October, the company incurred a one-time charge relating to the write-off of damaged inventory and productive asset in addition to cleanup costs. 
Net of insurance recoveries, this resulted in a charge of about $12.8 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter and we currently expect an additional charge of $7 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter relating to the remainder of the cleanup costs associated with the flood. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was about $184 million, approximately 136% of net income in the quarter and 96% of net income on a 9-month basis in 2011. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days declined to 79 days from 83 days at the end of June. Inventory was 635 million at the end of September. Days sales outstanding increased 1 day to 70 days at the end of September and accounts receivable is 803 million at the end of September. The cash from operations along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $107 million was used primarily for $19 million of net capital expenditures, a $79 million increase in cash and cash investments and about $173 million to purchase 3.8 million shares of the company stock under stock buyback program. 
The company currently has about 9.6 million shares remaining under the 20 million share stock buyback program that was announced in January of this year and expires in January of 2014. At September 30, cash and short-term cash investments were $781 million and these are primarily held up by the U.S. Debt at the end of the quarter was $1.265 billion and net debt therefore was $484 million at the end of the quarter. The company had availability under its revolving credit facility of $425 million at the end of the quarter. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratio has remained very strong at 1.36x and 22x, respectively. And EBITDA in the quarter was $242 million. 
From a financial perspective both an excellent quarter. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple of comments relative to the assumption that we've included in our guidance. The midpoint of our sales guidance for the year has been revised from $3.990 billion to $3.922 billion, a reduction of approximately $68 million or 2%. About half of this reduction is due to the impact of the floods and changes in currency rates, specifically a loss of approximately $18 million in revenues resulting from the flood in our New York facility due to a lack of production capacity in September and October and a reduction of approximately $15 million in revenues resulting from current translation impact primarily from the weaker euro. 
The remaining reduction reflects incremental weakness in demand in the defense market and in the communications equipment market including Wireless Infrastructure, IP data, broadband. And to a lesser extent, a slowdown in European industrial markets. We believe this weaker demand is a result of a higher level of market uncertainty caused by the multitude of fiscal and budgetary issues facing the global economy. 
Our fourth quarter guidance of $920 million to $940 million in sales or a 9% to 11% sequential decline reflects the majority of the impact of this item. And in addition, it's further impacted by the anticipated sequential reduction in sales in the Mobile Devices market. As I mentioned earlier in Q3, sales for the Mobile Device market were unexpectedly strong and we believe included some amount of customer pull-in of Q4 demand. Therefore, while sales in the Mobile Devices market in the second half of 2011 in total will be generally in line with our previous expectations, fourth quarter sales are expected to be lower. And we now expect sequential decline over 20% in this market in Q4. For the full year, our gross expectation of about 30% for the Mobile Device market remain relatively unchanged. 
Of the 10% sequential decline in consolidated sales expected at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, about 2% relates to the impact of the flood and currency exchange rates. Another 3% to 4% relates to the shift in the Mobile Device demand. Given our current expectations for Q4 sales, we are taking appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure, including Q4 headcount reduction in addition to those already made in Q2 and Q3. Our guidance in Q4 considering the lower volume and these actions assumes an ROS decline of about 1% from Q3 level. Additionally, I would note that the guidance assumes a diluted share count of approximately 167 million shares. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

And I'd like to add my own welcome to all of you on the phone today at the time of our third quarter earnings call. I'm going to spend a few moments to highlight our third quarter achievements that Diana has just detailed. I'll discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets and then I plan to make a few comments further on the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
The third quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol with orders and sales in excess of $1 billion. We are very pleased that despite increased uncertainty in the worldwide economy, we were able to exceed the high end of our guidance in sales and EPS with revenues growing 9% from prior year and 1% sequentially to a new record $1.33 billion and with EPS reaching a record of $0.81, excluding the onetime items. Although we continue to face significant cost challenges in the quarter, the Amphenol management team executed very well in the quarter, achieving industry leading operating margins of 19.3%. We're particularly pleased that we were able to produce net income of 13.4% of sales, which is a clear indication of the financial strength of Amphenol. 
We also generated record cash flow of $184 million, which was used in part for the continuation of our stock buyback program. These excellent results in the third quarter are a direct reflection of the strength as well as the discipline of our agile and entrepreneurial management team. I'd like to make a few comments on the flood recovery effort. Diana discussed some of the specifics of the financial of the flood. As announced on September 8, we experienced a severe and sudden flood in our Sidney, New York Military/Aerospace factory, which resulted from the back-to-back impact of Hurricane Irene and tropical storm Lee [ph]. No doubt a flood like this has tremendous personal impact on the people and our heart goes out to those in Thailand who are experiencing similar things today. 
Following previous flood in 2006 we took significant flood abatement measures in conjunction with state and local governments and these measures allowed us to minimize the impact. We're very pleased with the phenomenal reaction of our local team together with our suppliers, equipment manufacturers and clean up specialists. Our data systems were intact and operational within hours. Our offices where relocated within 24 hours and the facility is largely operational today, ramping up to full production later on in this month. Most importantly, our customers and distribution partners have been extremely supportive and understanding during this difficult time for us. 
As Diana mentioned, the flood resulted in approximately $11 million in lost sales in the third quarter and we expect incrementally another $7 million in lost sales in the fourth quarter. Certainly, in light of having suffered through 2 floods in the last 5 years, we're working closely with state and local authorities to establish an alternative production location, safely away from flood risk. Again we are very proud of our organization, which once again to whatever challenges can come our way. 
Now turning to the trends and the progress in our served markets. Just like to comment that during the course of the third quarter, we have seen more conservatism from customers in many of our end markets as of the various political in economic uncertainties around the world have increased most notably in developed economies. Turning first to the Military and Aerospace market. That market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 13% from prior year and 11% sequentially, impacted certainly by the Sidney flood as well as by a moderation of orders in several Military programs. 
Net of the flood impact, sales in that market were down in the mid-single digits both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis as we had expected. We are pleased to experience strong double-digit growth in sales to commercial air customers as playing volumes began to increase and its new programs began to take off. We expect a slight improvement in sales in the Military/Aerospace market in the fourth quarter as our flood recovery efforts continue and as procurement begins to move ahead for certain Military programs. 
Longer term, we continue to be very excited about the expansion opportunity available to us. From the proliferation of new Military electronics, together with our new excellent positions on commercial air platforms. Turning to the industrial market. That market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 4% from prior year and were down 10% from the second quarter, as a result of moderation demand in certain sectors of the industrial market including in particular in Europe as well as resulting from expected seasonality. 
Our growth compared to prior year was driven by progress in the heavy equipment and energy related segments in particular and we remain encouraged by our continued inroads into many new industrial applications, including alternative and traditional energy, real mass transit and new lighting technologies. While we are sensitive to growing conservatism among certain customers, we do expect industrial market to see some seasonal growth in the fourth quarter. As Art Technology and diversified positions continue to create excellent growth potential into the future. 
The automotive market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased a very strong 55% from prior year and were down 3% from the second quarter on expected seasonality. We are benefiting from the continued expansion of our participation in new electronics applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as from the acquisition, which we completed earlier this year. That acquisition together with our ongoing internal technology development initiatives, has broadened our range of automotive interconnect solution and is enabling us to capitalize on the many new electronic applications in vehicles around the world. 
We expect sales in the automotive market to grow moderately in local currencies in the fourth quarter, increase of vehicle volumes. And we remain very excited about the many opportunities for future growth that we see today in the automotive market. The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market were down slightly from prior year and were flat sequentially as operators maintained stable build out levels. Once again we did experience strong growth in emerging markets with excellent sales progress in particular in Latin America. 
While we expect demand in the broadband market to moderate in the fourth quarter seasonally, we look forward to renewed momentum long-term through our ongoing drive to expand our range of technologies to broadband customers in both domestic as well as international markets. The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 4% from prior year and a strong 7% sequentially with growth in particular in storage and networking application. 
Recently, we have begun to see customers reducing their outlets to some degree. We believe this relates to market uncertainties and caution regarding inventory levels, which may have been built up in anticipation of stronger end market demand that our customers are seeing today. Nevertheless, our pipeline of high-technology new programs continues to grow. As customers are demanding higher performance equipment in support of the rapidly expanding IP video and other bandwidth applications, many of which are actually being driven by the proliferation of new data intensive mobile Internet devices. 
While we are expecting a reduction in sales from the third quarter on these recent pullbacks in demand, we remain optimistic due to our new design wins with our high-technology products across a very broad array of IT customers and equipment platforms. The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 6% from prior year as we benefited from expanded positions on new base station platforms, as well as from growing sales into site installation around the world. 
Sales were down slightly sequentially. We expect a reduction of demand in the fourth quarter as economic uncertainties appear to be causing operators as well as original equipment manufacturers to reduce their installation and build plans and to become more cautious with respect to their inventory levels. Regardless, we remain excited by the many expanding opportunities for our Interconnect products and antennas in a wide array of newly upgraded base station systems. And we look forward to continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. In particular, we do believe that the short-term conservatism and build out is creating some degree of pent-up demand as network operators will be forced to upgrade their systems to improve both coverage and capacity, especially in support of the explosive growth of new smartphones and tablet computers. 
The Mobile Devices market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 39% from prior year and increased sequentially by an unexpected 23% as we capitalized on our expanded product position in new smart Mobile Devices, in particular, tablets. We believe that this unexpected uptick in demand in the third quarter was driven in large part by pull-ins from certain customers that did not necessarily represent true levels of in demand and thus will not repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Accordingly, we expect a sales decline of more than 20% in the fourth quarter in the Mobile Devices market as those inventories of components and devices are consumed. Nevertheless, we still feel very positive about our full year outlook for performance in the Mobile Devices market with expected growth of approximately 30%. And we remain optimistic that our successful product and customer diversification efforts have positioned us to participate in the expanding market for new Mobile Devices whether that be standard feature phones, smartphones or tablet. We are very confident that our ongoing efforts will continue to drive success going forward in this very dynamic market. 
Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I just mentioned, we did see a significant shift to demand in the Mobile Device market from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. In addition, we expect growing economic uncertainties in the market to have near-term impacts in most communication equipment markets as well as in the European industrial market. Accordingly and based on constant currency exchange levels, we now expect in the fourth quarter 2011 and the full year 2011 the following results. 
We expect sales in the range of $920 million to $940 million and $3912 billion to $3.932 billion, respectively. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.69 to $0.71 and $3.01 to $3.03, respectively, excluding one-time items. As Diana mentioned in reaction to these near term changes in market conditions and the resulting lower demand levels that we now see, we are taking immediate and appropriate actions to adjust our cost, including headcount reduction. As is the custom in Amphenol our management team is taking these actions proactively and aggressively, with a 5% headcount reduction in third quarter and further plans to reduce as necessary going into the fourth quarter. 
In summary, I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol organization as we have executed well in what is still a very challenging environment. These strong results that we have produced in the third quarter are a direct result of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in our many diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Although there are growing uncertainties in many of our end markets as well as ongoing inflationary pressures, I have tremendous confidence in that Amphenol management team. 
I am confident that we'll continue to excel in these challenging times by reacting quickly to changing customer needs to further strengthen our market position and by driving proactively the actions that are necessary to secure our leading operating margins. Most importantly in this team will continue to execute with a level of passion and effectiveness that ensures the continued superior performance of Amphenol. Thank you very much. And Carol, at this point we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

Again, are they reading the newspapers, are they seeing what their end customers say. There was clearly more caution coming from customers starting in that time period. Relative to our regional performance, you can imagine that Asia was very strong in the quarter. I mean it grew fabulously on a year-over-year basis, that's where a lot of that Mobile Devices business is consumed. And Europe did also very well in the year-over-year basis in the quarter, given our strong performance in automotive. From a sequential standpoint, we really saw growth particularly in Asia.

We're very, very pleased how in reaction to the flood, our distribution partner as well as our own internal operations, sister divisions around the world, other factories have responded just tremendously to keep our customers whole. But you can imagine that we have certain proprietary products, which we have certain capacity levels and I will take some time to catch up to and our customers are being very understanding. If we look towards the next 6 months, our goal is certainly to get those sales back over such a time period. Does that come all in one month or 2 months or 1 quarter? It doesn't necessarily come that way. It is a very complex initiative to bring that factory back up. We have an outstanding distribution channel who is able to create an excellent buffer when necessary and has really been able to do that. I mean the thing that we are just most proud about here is that none of our customers have really had any complaints to Amphenol about how we handled this. I visited and spoken with many of those customers where we had critical products ongoing, testing new product ramps happening. And the team up in Sidney just did such a fabulous job to prioritize those things, which are so critical to the customer. We had machines running 3, 4 days after the flood for certain products, which were very very critical to have for customers. Others that we knew the distribution channel could support, those were ones where we were able to prioritize those a little less important than the most critical products. So I think the simple answer is yes, we would anticipate over the course of the .5-year but is that exactly a half year, that is impossible really to pin down."

So I think that, that continues to hang over people's heads. At the same time, he said quarter and we continue to see that the military industry has not just ground to a halt.

You mentioned that there is going to be, you're looking at potentially a new facility there. And can you just help us as investors, put our arms around, are there transactional or transition financial items that we need to be aware of such as facility qualifications or duplicated operating running operations or yield issues or timeline?

I don't think, Jim, we anticipate any significant negative financial impacts outside of the ones that we mentioned relative to the losses associated with the flooding itself and the loss of sales in the sales respect to make up at some point during 2012. I think Adam actually was the one that mentioned this facility and the fact that we are working very closely with government in the state to find an appropriate location and also to get support for a project that would help us to relocate the facility. We do not anticipate a significant negative financial impact there may be some costs associated with from a capital expenditure perspective but again in the grand scheme of things it would not expect to be a significant financial impact on the company and feel that some expenditure relative to their potentially another flood given the fact that we had to in 5 years with what makes this well worth the effort on our part. We do expect to get a substantial support from government on this. This is an excellent facility that produces high-tech products with a very, very heavy skilled workforce. So the importance of the facility and the employment to the state is, as you can imagine, is as important to them as it is to us. And so we expect a high level of cooperation and support and quite frankly, really look forward to being able to transition the facility to this new location.

One of the things that we did do at that time was we took the decision to move essentially our whole industrial business out of Sidney, New York and that was an outstanding move. That was why our industrial business essentially was not impacted by the flood. That was one of the mitigation efforts that we took. This time, we are going to continue to make sure that our customers and our people, our staff are not put at risk from a flood. I agree with Diana. This is not going to be any real meaningful expense to the company.

Obviously, the lower volumes will impact the margins. How much of the impact will be from the additional headcount reduction because I know you had those costs the last couple of quarters and the expectations that was going to go away now obviously you're doing some more cuts. So could you tell us sort of what that ballpark is going to look like. And then on the material side, I think that's been a headwind for you in the last few quarters.

Maybe starting with material first. I mean it certainly is true, Matt, that we have seen over the past few quarters this year certainly some negative impact resulting from this discontinued pressure on commodities, particularly in our case on the Interconnect side with gold and certainly also copper and aluminum are important particularly on the Cable side of the business as are plastic. I think that it's certainly fair to say that there has been some improvements in certain of those in the last couple of months. Gold unfortunately is still higher than it would have been when we had close Q2. I think that in terms of copper and aluminum, which have done better during the last quarter, I mean if those continue to stay at or come down from the levels that we're at. Today we would expect probably to see some improvement in the Cable side of the business towards the end of the fourth quarter, and then as we move into next year. As you know, we carry some inventory level of these items and so we don't get an immediate benefit. To the extent that from the Interconnect side of the business, to the extent that again as we look into next year we get improvement in both demand levels and the commodities maybe including gold would start to get a little bit better. I think that we would also hope to see some positive impact on the Interconnect side of the business. So I think from a commodity standpoint right now in the immediate short term, we don't see a large benefit. But I think it is very fair to say that things are moving in a more positive direction hopefully those continue. In terms of the restructuring, you're absolutely right that we didn't anticipate that -- there's a fire engine going by here. From a restructuring standpoint you're absolutely right that when we talked last time in July, said we were taking action in Q2 and Q3, that would put some pressure on ROS. And I think if you recall in Q2, we had about a 4 tenths of a percent decline in ROS. And we did say that there was a portion of that, a smaller portion than the material pressure but some portion of that, that was being impacted by restructuring costs. And we did not at that time expect to see lower volumes in Q4 and therefore more headcount reductions. We now do see that. And so we're ending up really with 3 quarters where we're taking out a fair number of folks in the workforce, which is resulting in the same type of pressure in Q4. And therefore, a little higher issue from a conversion margin standpoint. We don't, as you know, like to specifically quantify these things because we do consider them part of the normal operating part of the business. But it certainly does put some additional pressure on Q4. This is a fairly more significant volume reduction in Q4, which also makes from a profitability standpoint things a little bit harder. These actions by the end of Q4 and that should provide some support to profitability as we move into 2012."

And I think that is exactly the case. If that business comes back and when it comes back, they will add the resources using that kind of accordion like way of doing things that we have always done. And I think that is just the hallmark of how we run the business. You should not take away from the fact that we're making headcount reductions in 1 or another segment as the statement that we are, I mean to recharacterize what to say, we are losing share in that market. That is certainly not the case that we see. Just again to recharacterize that we saw in the third quarter a very significant pull-in of demand, which clearly now comes out, was demand that maybe otherwise would have been falling in for the fourth quarter. And we obviously have the resources in place to satisfy that demand. And these were significant pull-ins whereby customers hit us with orders that we didn't expect to come and we're able to ramp up and satisfy the demand from those customers in a very, very significant and effective fashion. And when you have that bend to reverse course, we're going to make the resource adjustment that we always make in Amphenol. And that is true across every one of the markets and every one of our 75 general managers around the company. They're running their business after having gone to the customer, they listen to what the customer says they need in the future. And they go back and adjust their resources really in realtime relative to what the market needs. And that has allowed us to always react in difficult time and always be able to ramp up more quickly in good times. And I think that flexibility that we preserved, that in the moment management of the resources of the company, that is something that we will continue to drive. And so whatever comes our way here, whether that be floods or whether that be pull-ins of demand, we're going to react very rapidly to those of events and we're going to drive them.

I mean clearly this is a case or we have also seen those same trends that you mentioned here. We see it from both the OEMs as well as the operators because we do business with both parts of the chain in the Wireless Infrastructure market. And I think what has happened recently I mean whether you have some big mergers that are sort of stalled, whether you have customers being more conservative about certain build plans, clearly the build plans and the installation class of operators in particular in developed markets have not met the expectations of the OEMs. And we have really see that on a global basis, but conservatism. What does it mean in the end? I think I am not the only one on the phone today who is just intensely frustrated by the coverage of my phone when I'm driving around the highways of the Northeast. And there is clearly a significant pent-up demand for both coverage and capacity. The new mobile devices, whether those be tablets or smart phones or whatever, Android, iOS, all of those formats, those are driving levels of data and levels of capacity restriction in these markets on a worldwide basis. And so we believe that there's no question that at one point, you got to have these things built. And what we hear from our OEM customers is certainly the same story, which is that they are hearing from their operator accounts that yes, there may be some pods here. We're doing whatever, whatever it takes to get a merger done or we're doing whatever it takes to sort of preserve capital in an uncertain time, they are going to have to install these base stations, they're going to have to install lot of them. The beauty of the new type of base station that the leading equipment manufacturers have created and where we have worked with them on new technologies is these new base stations are much smaller, they're much more flexible. And they allow the operators to more quickly make these installations. These are not big refrigerator boxes from the past. They are much smaller. In that sense that you can coverage in a much, much quicker fashion in certain places. And look, I know very well when I go home and I barely have cell phone coverage anymore that they're going to have to change, they're going to have to install these base stations. When that comes, does it come in the first quarter, does it come in the second quarter? This is very hard to predict. Only those in the boardrooms of these operators know that. But clearly it will come, because it is getting worst and worst around the world in terms of coverage. And the only answer is to put in place new and more of these base station platforms and we're very, very well-positioned on systems."

What we saw in the IT market very clearly was it going on to the quarter. Customers have certain expectations about what would normally be growth going into the fourth quarter. And I think you've seen in the many earnings releases that have come out over the last several months that those expectations have been moderated. But they already chose a supply chain to put in place the capacity for that uptick in demand, which in the end is not happen for those customers. And so that something that gets consumed in 1 quarter, does it get consumed in 2 quarters. Certainly I would hope it's not to last much longer than 2 quarters. It depends in the end on what the final customers take. An inventory position is only healthy given a certain level of demand and so to the extent that our customers see a level of demand that is kind of a more normal or flat demand from the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, then I would hope that would be a more positive outlook. If they see further caution from their customers, from the government, from the financial services the other big customers among then you could potentially have more time for inventory correction.

So very, very strong performance in commercial. And we have continued a very positive outlook for the commercial Aero segment. The number of new planes, the degree of kind of the electronic architecture changes in these new planes is really just fabulous. I have the good fortune to be crawling around some of these planes over the course of last month or 2. And it is really just not only the new platforms and the amount of electronics in them but the vision of our customers for the future of electronics, whether that be in the fuselage, in the avionic system, even in the engines which have been something that long-term has not changed so much. There's just a real drive to wherever possible implement electronic functionality to drive either fuel efficiency, either simplification of the control mechanism of the pilot, either to drive a better passenger experience. And there's really phenomenal things that our commercial customers are not just implementing today but even considering long-term for the future that creates just an amazing level of opportunity for the company. And we are really capturing that with technology. When I go out and I sit with the engineers of some of these customers and really talk about technology, that's where you get so excited because the new innovations that we are driving for those customers are real game changers in terms of allowing those customers to do things that they didn't know they could do in the past whether that's bring electronics closer to harsher environment in the plane, whether that is bringing new functionalities to the passenger, those are all things that the interconnect that we are innovating are helping to drive those customers to create those new experiences.

I mean when we will look for the fourth quarter, you would normally have a seasonal growth coming out of the third quarter. And we did see that the industrial business was down sequentially in the third quarter by some 10%. And because of the industrial business does have significant global in Europe as well in North America, that seasonal impact can be not insignificant going to the fourth quarter. I think we feel very good about our position in that market. Recall that our industrial business is very, very diversified. It ranges in things from high speed rail to alternative energy to oil and gas exploration to factory automation, industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment, I mean, I lighting I could go on for a long time about these subsegments. And I think we still see in many of those markets especially those new markets like alternative energy, like lighting where there is a big transition happening in the nature of lighting and outdoor and harsh environment lighting. Those are areas where we continue to see that there is momentum among the customers and there's still great opportunities for growth. I think you take those kind of new markets in industrial in addition, there is maybe a more muted but still a little bit of a seasonal uptick that comes in the fourth quarter.

And now it seems to be coming through realization that's going to happen with how long it's taking, the governments of the world to make resolution to some of these insurgencies and to really help to drive the economies in a better direction.

And I think we took a lot of pricing actions early in the year and as the market environment became more mixed and then later became more certain, the ability to execute on those price increases specially with OEMs became more of a struggle. I think relative to the channel as you correctly point out, distribution is one area where you can raise prices a little bit more easily. We do this on an ongoing basis. We don't do it monolithically. So you may not hear about it in a way that Amphenol raise prices monolithically across distribution channels, that's just not how we operate our price increases go out really other product or technology basis. And those are ongoing throughout the year, pricing exercise with our distributors and we will continue to follow that as well. Remember, distribution represents only some 14%, 15% of our sales and so that's not the big issue. The big issue is how you go about getting price increases with the OEMs. We will be disciplined on price. One of the areas that is the most essential for price is actually new product development. And as we look forward, new products for Amphenol consistently have represented more than 20%, nearly 25% of our sales for a number of years. And that is a focus that allows us to get pricing in the end, not by changing the price in a certain part number but by having more functionality embedded in the product rating more value for your customer and thereby they're willing to pay you a comparably higher price. But it's an apples and oranges comparison in the eyes of the customer. And so at the end of the day in a market like this, innovation is the real answer to the pricing. We're going to drive that innovation very, very hard going forward.
Thank you very much and I'd like to thank all of you for your time today and your attention and wish you all a very, very good completion here October and going into the full year. We will talk to you again in January. Thank you."

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed the third quarter achieving strong growth and beating the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $1,033,000,000 and EPS, excluding the effects of one-time items, was $0.81, both new records for the company. On an as-reported basis, EPS was $0.79 and included a one-time charge of $0.05 cents, relating to the impact of the previously reported flood at the company's New York facility, partially offset by a $0.03 benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense from the completion of the audit of certain prior year tax returns. 
Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies over the third quarter of 2010. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in Q3 2011 were up 5% over last year. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from Q2. In comparing Q3 to the midpoint of the company's guidance of $1,008,000,000, sales exceeded guidance by approximately $25 million. Sales in the Mobile Devices market were particularly strong, growing over 20% sequentially as demand previously planned for the fourth quarter was pulled forward by certain customers. 
This was partially offset by softness in the industrial market, particularly in Europe, reflecting weaker economic conditions and by a reduction of about $11 million as a result of the previously announced flooding at the company's New York facility, which resulted in limited manufacturing and sales activity in the month of September. Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our cable business, which comprise 7% of our sales in the quarter, was up 13% from last year and 2% from last quarter. The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 9% from last year and 1% sequentially. 
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income for the quarter, excluding the $12.8 million casualty loss relating to the flood, was $199 million compared to $189 million last year. Operating margin was 19.3% compared to 19.9% last year and 19.4% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expenses of approximately $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $7 million in the third quarter of 2010 or about 0.7% of sales in both periods. 
From a segment perspective, in the cable business, margins were 13.1%, down from 13.5% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher material costs. From a sequential standpoint however, Cable margins improved from 12.8%, primarily as a result of lower material costs. In the interconnect business, margins were 21.5% compared to 22.3% last year. The lower interconnect operating margins reflect the impacts of increases in material input costs and to a lesser extent, the costs associated with workforce reductions of approximately 5% or 2,000 people in the quarter. 
It also was impacted by the impact of the loss of sales and margin due to the temporary flood-related shutdown of the company's New York facility in September. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases. Overall, we're very pleased with the company's margin achievement. The company's overall profitability level continues to be very strong in the face of significant global pressures and a mixed demand environment. 
We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and cultural cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner, and achieve strong profitability going forward. Interest expense for the quarter was $10.5 million compared to $10.6 million last year, reflecting lower average borrowing cost, partially offset by the higher average debt levels, resulting from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $2.3 million in the quarter, up from $1.3 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
The tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 was 23.5% compared to a rate of 22.8% in the third quarter of 2010. The prior year quarter included a net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense, primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits of about $8.4 million or $0.05 per share. The 2011 quarter includes a tax benefit of about $4.8 million or 37% of the $12.8 million casualty loss related to the flood described before, and a benefit of $4.5 million or $0.03, relating to the completion of certain prior year tax audits. 
Excluding these effects, the effective tax rate on Q3 2011 was about 26.8% and we currently expect the same rate in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income, excluding one-time items, was approximately 13.4% of sales in Q3, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share on an as-reported basis was $0.79 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.78 in the third quarter of 2010. After adjustment for one-time items, diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.81 in the quarter. 
Orders for the quarter were a record 1,017,000,000, up 8% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.98:1. As we announced last month, in early September, the company incurred flood damage at its Sidney, New York facility. In addition to the loss of sales and margin from the temporary shutdown of the facility in September and October, the company incurred a one-time charge relating to the write-off of damaged inventory and productive asset in addition to cleanup costs. 
Net of insurance recoveries, this resulted in a charge of about $12.8 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter, and we currently expect an additional charge of $7 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter relating to the remainder of the cleanup costs associated with the flood. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was about $184 million, approximately 136% of net income in the quarter and 96% of net income on a 9-month basis in 2011. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days declined to 79 days from 83 days at the end of June. Inventory was 635 million at the end of September. Day sales outstanding increased 1 day to 70 days at the end of September, and accounts receivable is $803 million at the end of September. The cash from operations along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $107 million was used primarily for $19 million of net capital expenditures, a $79 million increase in cash and cash investments and about $173 million to purchase 3.8 million shares of the company stock under stock buyback program. 
The company currently has about 9.6 million shares remaining under the 20 million share stock buyback program that was announced in January of this year, and expires in January of 2014. At September 30, cash and short-term cash investments were $781 million and these are primarily held up by the U.S. Debt at the end of the quarter was $1,265,000,000 and net debt therefore was $484 million at the end of the quarter. The company had availability under its revolving credit facility of $425 million at the end of the quarter. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratio has remained very strong at 1.36x and 22x, respectively, and EBITDA in the quarter was $242 million.  From a financial perspective, both an excellent quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to the assumptions that we've included in our guidance. The midpoint of our sales guidance for the year has been revised from $3.990 billion to $3.922 billion, a reduction of approximately $68 million or 2%. About half of this reduction is due to the impact of the flood and changes in currency rates, specifically a loss of approximately $18 million in revenues, resulting from the flood in our New York facility due to a lack of production capacity in September and October, and a reduction of approximately $15 million in revenues, resulting from current translation impact primarily from the weaker euro. 
The remaining reduction reflects incremental weakness in demand in the defense market and in the communications equipment markets, including wireless infrastructure, IP data, broadband and to a lesser extent, a slowdown in European industrial markets. We believe this weaker demand is a result of a higher level of market uncertainty caused by the multitude of fiscal and budgetary issues plaguing the global economy. 
Our fourth quarter guidance of $920 million to $940 million in sales or a 9% to 11% sequential decline reflects the majority of the impact of this items. And in addition, it's further impacted by the anticipated sequential reduction in sales in the Mobile Devices market. As I mentioned earlier in Q3, sales for the Mobile Device market were unexpectedly strong and we believe included some amount of customer pull-in of Q4 demand. Therefore, while sales in the Mobile Devices market in the second half of 2011 in total will be generally in line with our previous expectations, fourth quarter sales are expected to be lower and we now expect a sequential decline of over 20% in this market in Q4. For the full year, our gross expectation of about 30% for the Mobile Device market remain relatively unchanged. 
Of the 10% sequential decline in consolidated sales expected at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, about 2% relates to the impact of the flood and currency exchange rates. Another 3% to 4% relates to the shift in the Mobile Device demand. Given our current expectations for Q4 sales, we are taking appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure, including Q4 headcount reduction in addition to those already made in Q2 and Q3. Our guidance in Q4, considering the lower volume and these actions, assumes an ROS decline of about 1% from Q3 level. Additionally, I would note that the guidance assumes a diluted share count of approximately 167 million shares. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

And I'd like to add my own welcome to all of you on the phone today at the time of our third quarter earnings call. I'm going to spend a few moments to highlight our third quarter achievements that Diana has just detailed. I'll discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets, and then I plan to make a few comments further on the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
The third quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol with orders and sales again in excess of $1 billion. We are very pleased that despite increased uncertainty in the worldwide economy, we were able to exceed the high end of our guidance in sales and EPS, with revenues growing 9% from prior year and 1% sequentially to a new record $1,033,000,000 and with EPS reaching a record of $0.81, excluding the one-time items. Although we continued to face significant cost challenges in the quarter, the Amphenol management team executed very well in the quarter, achieving industry-leading operating margins of 19.3%. We're particularly pleased that we were able to produce net income of 13.4% of sales, which is a clear indication of the financial strength of Amphenol. 
We also generated record cash flow of $184 million, which was used in part for the continuation of our stock buyback program. These excellent results in the third quarter are a direct reflection of the strength as well as the discipline of our agile and entrepreneurial management team. I'd like to make a few comments on the flood recovery efforts. Diana discussed some of the specifics of the financials of the flood. As announced on September 8, we experienced a severe and sudden flood in our Sidney, New York military/aerospace factory, which resulted from the back-to-back impacts of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. No doubt, a flood like this has tremendous personal impact on the people and our heart goes out to those in Thailand, who are experiencing similar things today. 
Following a previous flood in 2006, we took significant flood abatement measures in conjunction with state and local governments and these measures allowed us to minimize the impact. We're very pleased with the phenomenal reaction of our local team together with our suppliers, equipment manufacturers and clean-up specialists. Our data systems were intact and operational within hours. Our offices where relocated within 24 hours and the facility is largely operational today, ramping up to full production later on in this month. Most importantly, our customers and distribution partners have been extremely supportive and understanding during this difficult time for us. 
As Diana mentioned, the flood resulted in approximately $11 million in lost sales in the third quarter, and we expect incrementally another $7 million in lost sales in the fourth quarter. Certainly, in light of having suffered through 2 floods in the last 5 years, we are working closely with state and local authorities to establish an alternative production location, safely away from flood risk. Again, we are very proud of our organization, which, once again, rises to whatever challenges can come our way. 
Now turning to the trends and the progress in our served markets. I just like to comment that during the course of the third quarter, we have seen more conservatism from customers in many of our end markets, as the various political and economic uncertainties around the world have increased most notably in developed economies. 
Turning first to the military and aerospace market. That market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 13% from prior year and 11% sequentially, impacted certainly by the Sidney flood as well as by a moderation of orders in several Military programs. 
Net of the flood impact, sales in that market were down in the mid-single digits both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis as we had expected. We are pleased to experience strong double-digit growth in sales to commercial air customers, as plane volumes began to increase and as new programs began to take off. We expect a slight improvement in sales in the military/aerospace market in the fourth quarter as our flood recovery efforts continue and as procurement begins to move ahead for certain military programs. 
Longer term, we continue to be very excited about the expansion opportunity available to us from the proliferation of new military electronics, together with our new excellent positions on commercial air platforms. 
Turning to the industrial market. That market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 4% from prior year and were down 10% from the second quarter as a result of moderation demand in certain sectors of the industrial market, including, in particular, in Europe as well as resulting from expected seasonality.  Our growth compared to prior year was driven by progress in the heavy equipment and energy-related segments in particular. And we remain encouraged by our continued inroads into many new industrial applications, including alternative and traditional energy, real mass transit and new lighting technologies. While we are sensitive to growing conservatism among certain customers, we do expect the industrial market to see some seasonal growth in the fourth quarter, as our technology and diversified positions continue to create excellent growth potential into the future. 
The automotive market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased a very strong 55% from prior year, and were down 3% from the second quarter on expected seasonality. We are benefiting from the continued expansion of our participation in new electronics applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as from the Symtomei [ph] acquisition, which we completed earlier this year. That acquisition, together with our ongoing internal technology development initiatives, has broadened our range of automotive interconnect solution, and is enabling us to capitalize on the many new electronic applications and vehicles around the world. 
We expect sales in the automotive market to grow moderately in local currencies in the fourth quarter and increase vehicle volumes. And we remain very excited about the many opportunities for future growth that we see today in the automotive market. The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market were down slightly from prior year and were flat sequentially as operators maintained stable build-out levels. Once again, we did experience strong growth in emerging markets with excellent sales progress, in particular, in Latin America. 
While we expect demand in the broadband market to moderate in the fourth quarter seasonally, we look forward to renewed momentum long-term through our ongoing drive to expand our range of technologies to broadband customers in both domestic as well as international markets. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 4% from prior year and a strong 7% sequentially with growth, in particular, in storage and networking applications. 
Recently, we have begun to see customers reducing their outlets to some degree. We believe this relates to market uncertainties and caution regarding inventory levels, which may have been built-up in anticipation of stronger end-market demand that our customers are seeing today. Nevertheless, our pipeline of high-technology and new programs continues to grow. As customers are demanding higher performance equipment in support of the rapidly expanding IP video and other bandwidth-hungry applications, many of which are actually being driven by the proliferation of new data-intensive mobile Internet devices. 
While we are expecting reduction in sales from the third quarter on these recent pullbacks in demand, we remain optimistic due to our new design wins with our high-technology products across a very broad array of IT customers and equipment platforms. The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 6% from prior year as we benefited from expanded positions on new base station platforms, as well as from growing sales into site installations around the world. 
Sales were down slightly sequentially. We expect a reduction of demand in the fourth quarter, as economic uncertainties appear to be causing operators as well as original equipment manufacturers to reduce their installation and build plans, and to become more cautious with respect to their inventory levels. Regardless, we remain excited by the many expanding opportunities for our interconnect products and antennas in a wide array of newly upgraded base station systems. And we look forward to continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. In particular, we do believe that the short-term conservatism and build-out is creating some degree of pent-up demand, as network operators will be forced to upgrade their systems to improve both coverage and capacity, especially in support of the explosive growth of new smartphones and tablet computers. 
The Mobile Devices market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 39% from prior year and increased sequentially by an unexpected 23%, as we capitalized on our expanded product position in new smart Mobile Devices, in particular, tablets. We believe that this unexpected uptick in demand in the third quarter was driven in large part by pull-ins from certain customers that did not necessarily represent true levels of end demand, and thus will not repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Accordingly, we expect a sales decline of more than 20% in the fourth quarter in the Mobile Devices market, as those inventories of components and devices are consumed. Nevertheless, we still feel very positive about our full year outlook for performance in the Mobile Devices market with expected growth of approximately 30%. And we remain optimistic that our successful product and customer diversification efforts have positioned us to participate in the expanding market for new Mobile Devices, whether that be standard-feature phones, smartphones or tablet. We're very confident that our ongoing efforts will continue to drive success going forward in this very dynamic market. 
Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I just mentioned, we did see a significant shift of demand in the Mobile Device market from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. In addition, we expect growing economic uncertainties in the market to have near-term impacts in most communication equipment markets as well as in the European industrial market. 
Accordingly and based on constant currency exchange levels, we now expect in the fourth quarter 2011 and the full year 2011 the following results. 
We expect sales in the range of $920 million to $940 million and $3,912,000 to $3,932,000,000, respectively. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.69 to $0.71 and $3.01 to $3.03, respectively, excluding one-time items. As Diana mentioned, in reaction to these near-term changes in market conditions and the resulting lower demand levels that we now see, we are taking immediate and appropriate actions to adjust our cost, including headcount reductions. As is the custom in Amphenol, our management team is taking these actions proactively and aggressively, with a 5% headcount reduction in the third quarter and further plans to reduce as necessary going into the fourth quarter. 
In summary, I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol organization, as we have executed well in what is still a very challenging environment. These strong results that we have produced in the third quarter are a direct result of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in our many diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Although there are growing uncertainties in many of our end markets as well as ongoing inflationary pressures, I have tremendous confidence in that Amphenol management team. 
I am confident that we'll continue to excel in these challenging times by reacting quickly to changing customer needs to further strengthen our market position, and by driving proactively the actions that are necessary to secure our leading operating margins. Most importantly, this team will continue to execute with a level of passion and effectiveness that ensures a continued superior performance of Amphenol. 
Thank you very much. And Carol, at this point, we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

Again, are they reading the newspapers? Are they seeing what their end-customers say? There was clearly more caution coming from customers starting in that time period. Relative to the -- our regional performance, you can imagine that Asia was very strong in the quarter. I mean it grew fabulously on a year-over-year basis. That's where a lot of that Mobile Devices business is consumed. And Europe did also very well in the year-over-year basis in the quarter, given our strong performance in automotive. From a sequential standpoint, we really saw growth particularly in Asia. Again, not surprising given the strength of the Mobile Devices market."

That's a very good question and, certainly, we would anticipate to be able to recover those revenues. We're very, very pleased how in reaction to the flood, our distribution partner as well as our own internal operations, some sister divisions around the world, other factories have responded just tremendously to keep our customers whole. But you can imagine that we have certain amounts of proprietary products, which we have certain capacity levels of. And that will take some time to catch-up to and our customers are being very understanding. If we look towards the next 6 months, we -- our goal is certainly to get those sales back over such a time period. Does that come all in 1 month or 2 months or 1 quarter? It doesn't necessarily come that way. It is a very complex initiative to bring that factory back up. We have an outstanding distribution channel, who is able to create an excellent buffer when necessary, and has really been able to do that. I mean the thing that we are just most proud about here is that none of our customers have really had any complaints to Amphenol about how we've handled this. I have personally visited and spoken with many of those customers, where we had critical products ongoing, testing new product ramps happening. And the team up in Sidney just did such a fabulous job to prioritize those things, which are so critical to the customer. We had machines running 3, 4 days after the flood for certain products, which were very, very critical to have for customers. Others that we knew the distribution channel could support, those were ones where we were able to prioritize those, a little less important than the most critical sole-source products. So I think the simple answer is yes, we would anticipate over the course of the next kind of half year. But is that exactly a half year? That is impossible, really, to pin down."

And at one point, hopefully, they will issue a report and they will come to an agreement. Whether that happens, I can tell you that customers in the military industry don't have a tremendous amount of optimism that a committee of 12 people, 6 from each party, will eventually come to an agreement. So I think that, that continues to hang over people's heads. At the same time, we saw in the quarter and we continues to see that the military industry has not just gone to a halt. There are still programs being funded. There are things being made. I mean, we continue to have a very, very significant sales into that market. And yes, it was down on a year-over-year basis, certainly impacted by the flood, but also impacted by these concerns. But we still see a lot of programs that are ongoing. And what gives me optimism for the long-term, Jim, is even with that sword hanging over people's heads from a governmental and a congressional standpoint, the drive for new designs and new electronics and new functionalities, we have not seen that slow down whatsoever in terms of the programs and the type of engineering challenges that we see. And so I think from that perspective, our belief that long-term, the proliferation of electronics into this market is going to allow a significant offset to whatever budgetary pressures are going to come, we still subscribe very much to that conviction because of what we see with our customers, where they are, continue to innovate and to develop new technologies everyday of the week."

Maybe starting with materials first. I mean, it certainly is true, Matt, that we have seen over the past few quarters this year, certainly, some negative impact resulting from this discontinued pressure on commodities, particularly in our case on the interconnect side with gold. And then, certainly, also copper and aluminum are important, particularly on the cable side of the business as are plastics. I think that it's certainly fair to say that there has been some improvements in certain of those in the last couple of months. Gold, unfortunately, is still higher than it would have been when we had closed Q2. I think that in terms of copper and aluminum, which have done better during the last quarter, I mean, if those continue to stay at or come down from the levels that we're at, today, we would expect probably to see some improvement in the cable side of the business towards the end of the fourth quarter and then as we move into next year. As you know, we carry some inventory level of these items, and so we don't get an immediate benefit. To the extent that from the interconnect side of the business, to the extent that, again, as we look into next year, we get improvement in both demand levels and the commodities, maybe including gold, would start to get a little bit better. I think that we would also hope to see some positive impact on the interconnect side of the business. So I think from a commodity standpoint right now in the immediate short term, we don't see a large benefit. But I think it's very fair to say that things are moving in a more positive direction. Hopefully, those continue. In terms of the restructuring, you're absolutely right that we didn't anticipate -- from a restructuring standpoint, you're absolutely right that when we talked last time in July, we said we were taking action in Q2 and Q3 that would put some pressure on ROS. And I think if you recall in Q2, we had about a 4/10 of a percent decline in ROS. And we did say that there was a portion of that, a smaller portion than the material pressure, but some portion of that, that was being impacted by restructuring cost. And we did not, at that time, expect to see lower volumes in Q4 and therefore, more headcount reductions. We now do see that. And so we are ending up really with 3 quarters, where we're taking out a fair number of folks in the workforce, which is resulting in the same type of pressure in Q4. And therefore, a little higher issue from a conversion margin standpoint. We don't, as you know, like to specifically quantify these things because we do consider them part of the normal operating part of the business. But it certainly does put some additional pressure on Q4. This is a fairly more significant volume reduction in Q4, which also makes, from a profitability standpoint, things are a little bit harder. We'll be -- have gotten though these actions by the end of Q4, and that should provide some support to profitability as we move into 2012."

And so I think what has been the hallmark of the Amphenol organization over many, many years has been that we don't adjust our resources with an expectation of what the future is. We adjust our resources based on the reality of what the basis is today. And clearly, we have a sequential reduction of more than 20% in the Mobile Devices market, which we've -- both Diana and I mentioned, and that is going to lead the general managers to run the businesses within that Mobile Devices market to take immediate and significant actions. And I think that is exactly the case. If that business comes back and when it comes back, they will add the resources using that kind of accordion-like way of doing things that we have always done. And I think that is just the hallmark of how we run the business. You should not take away from the fact that we're making headcount reductions in one or another segment as a statement that we are -- I mean, to recharacterize what you say, we are losing share in that market. That is certainly not the case that we see. Just again to recharacterize it, we saw in the third quarter a very significant pull-in of demand, which clearly now comes out -- was demand that maybe otherwise would have been falling in for the fourth quarter. And we, obviously, had the resources in place to satisfy that demand. And these were significant pull-ins, whereby, customers hit us with orders that we didn't expect to come, and we're able to ramp up and satisfy the demand from those customers in a very, very significant and effective fashion. And when you have that bend to reverse course, we're going to make the resource adjustment that we always make in Amphenol. And that is true across every one of the markets and every one of our 75 general managers around the company. They're running their business after having gone to the customer, they listen to what the customer says they need in the future. And they go back and they adjust their resources, really, in realtime relative to what the market needs. And that has allowed us to always react in difficult time and always be able to ramp up more quickly in good times. And I think that flexibility that we preserved, that in-the-moment management of the resources of the company, that is something that we will continue to drive. And so whatever comes our way here, whether that be floods or whether that be pull-ins of demand, we're going to react very rapidly to those events and we're going to drive them. We're going to be successful following that."

No, I mean, clearly this is a case or we have also seen those same trends that you mentioned here. We see it from both the OEMs as well as the operators because we do business with both parts of the chain in the wireless infrastructure market. And I think what has happened recently, I mean, whether you have some big mergers that are sort of stalled, whether you have customers being more conservative about certain build plans, clearly, the build plans and the installation plans of operators, in particular, in developed markets have not met the expectations of the OEMs. And we have really see that on a global basis, that conservatism. What does it mean in the end? I think I am not the only one on the phone here today, who is just intensely frustrated by the coverage of my phone when I'm driving around the highways of the Northeast. And there is clearly a significant pent-up demand for both coverage and capacity. The new Mobile Devices, whether those be tablets or smartphones or whatever, Android, iOS, all of those formats, those are driving levels of data and levels of capacity restriction in these markets on a worldwide basis. And so we believe that there's no question that at one point, you got to have these things built. And what we hear from our OEM customers is certainly the same story, which is that they are hearing from their operator accounts that, yes, there may be some pods here. We're doing whatever, whatever it takes to get a merger done, or we are doing whatever it takes to sort of preserve capital in an uncertain time. They are going to have to install these base stations. They're going to have to install lot of them. The beauty of the new type of base stations that the leading equipment manufacturers have created and where we have worked with them on new technologies, is these new base stations are much smaller. They're much more flexible and they allow the operators to more quickly make these installations. These are not big refrigerator boxes from the past. They are much smaller. In that sense that you can get coverage in a much, much quicker fashion in certain places. And look, I know very well when I go home and I barely have cell phone coverage anymore that they're going to have to change. They're going to have to install these base stations. When that comes, does it come in the first quarter? Does it come in the second quarter? This is very hard to predict. Only those in the boardrooms of these operators know that. But clearly, it will come because it is getting worst and worst around the world in terms of coverage. And the only answer is to put in place new and more of these base station platforms and we're very, very well-positioned on those systems."

What we saw in the IT market very clearly was that going into the quarter, customers had certain expectations about what would normally be growth going into the fourth quarter. And I think you've seen in the many earnings releases that have come out over the last several months that those expectations have been moderated. But they already drove the supply chain to put in place the capacity for that uptick in demand, which in the end, does not happen for those customers. And so, is that something that gets consumed in 1 quarter? Does it get consumed in 2 quarters? Certainly, I would hope it not to last much longer than 2 quarters. It depends in the end on what the final customers take. An inventory position is only healthy, given a certain level of demand. And so to the extent that our customers see a level of demand that is kind of a more normal or flat demand from the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, then I would hope that, that would be a more positive outlook. If they see further caution from their customers, from the government, from the financial services, that other big customers, then you could potentially have more time for an inventory correction. I would hope this is not more than a 1, 2-quarter phenomenon."

It's more like the quarter of the market, if not, even slightly more than a quarter of the market. So we're very pleased with that development and we think that, that's something that's going to, long-term, be very favorable for the company. If we look at commercial air, as I mentioned, it grew very strongly in the quarter. And if you take out the impact of the flood, it would have grown somewhere around 20% year-over-year. So very, very strong performance in commercial air. And we have continued a very positive outlook for that commercial air segment. The number of new planes, the degree of kind of the electronic architecture changes in these new planes is really just fabulous. I have the good fortune to be crawling around some of these planes over the course of last month or 2. And it is really just not only the new platforms and the amount of electronics in them, but the vision of our customers for the future of electronics, whether that be in the fuselage, in the avionic system, even in the engines, which have been something that long-term has not changed so much. There is just a real drive to wherever possible implement electronic functionalities to drive either fuel efficiency, either a simplification of the control mechanisms of the pilot, either to drive a better passenger experience. And there's really phenomenal things that our commercial air customers are not just implementing today, but even considering long term for the future that creates just an amazing level of opportunities for the company. And we are really capturing that with technology. When I go out and I sit with the engineers, with some of these customers and really talk about technology, that's where you get so excited because the new innovations that we are driving for those customers are real game changers in terms of allowing those customers to do things that they didn't know they could do in the past, whether that is bringing electronics closer to harsher environments in the plane, whether that is bringing new functionalities to the passengers. Those are all things that -- the interconnect that we are innovating are helping to drive those customers to create those new experiences. And I think that's going to serve us very, very well in the future for commercial, and we're really excited about that market."

I think this is a little bit different. We have not seen everything fall off a cliff here. Certainly, we see that there are a lot of questions among our customers. People are nervous.

And because the industrial business does have a significant component in Europe as well in North America, that seasonal impact can be -- not insignificant going to the fourth quarter. I think we feel very good about our position in that market. Recall that our industrial business is very, very diversified. It ranges in things from high speed rail to alternative energy to oil and gas exploration to factory automation, industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment, I mean, lighting. I could go on for a long time about these sub-segments. And I think we still see in many of those markets, especially those new markets like alternative energy, like lighting, where there's a big transition happening in the nature of lighting and outdoor and harsh-environment lighting. Those are areas where we continue to see that there is momentum among the customers, and there's still great opportunities for growth.

I believe that the customers there, some of them may, just now, be coming to the realization, ""Hey, we're not going to hit that step-up that we thought we were going to get."" And so, that translates into a slightly more negative view today than 2 months ago. I would say in those markets, maybe we've seen those revisions more recently in terms of the mindset, only because they clung to the hope that they would have that real big sequential step-up that they all anticipated. And now, it seems to be coming through a realization that's not going to happen with how long it's taking, the governments of the world to make resolution to some of these uncertainties, and to really help to drive the economies in a better direction. I think that's causing some to just sort of say, ""Well, look, we're going to -- we're not going to have that step-up, so let's adjust it accordingly."""

And I think we took a lot of pricing actions early in the year. And as the market environment became more mixed and then later became more certain, the ability to execute on those price increases, especially with OEMs, became more of a struggle. I think relative to the channel, as you correctly had point out, distribution is one area where you can raise prices a little bit more easily. We do this on an ongoing basis. We don't do it monolithically. So you may not hear about it in a way that says, ""Well, Amphenol doesn't raise prices monolithically across distribution channels"" That's just not how we operate. Our price increases go out, really, on a product or a technology basis, and those are an ongoing -- throughout the year, pricing exercise with our distributors and we will continue to follow that as well. Remember, distribution represents only some 14%, 15% of our sales and so that's not the big issue. The big issue is how you go about getting price increases with the OEMs. We will be disciplined on price. One of the areas that is the most essential for price is actually new product development. And as we look forward, new products for Amphenol consistently have represented more than 20%, nearly 25% of our sales for a number of years. And that is a focus that allows us to get pricing in the end, not by changing the price on a certain part number, but by having more functionality embedded in the product, creating more value for your customer. And, thereby, they're willing to pay you a comparably higher price. But it's an apples-and-oranges comparison in the eyes of the customer. And so at the end of the day in a market like this, innovation is the real answer to that pricing. We're going to drive that innovation very, very hard going forward.
Thank you very much, Shawn. And I'd like to thank all of you for your time today and your attention and wish you all a very, very good completion here to October and going into the full year. We'll talk to you again in January. Thank you."

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company closed the third quarter achieving strong growth and beating the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $1,033,000,000 and EPS, excluding the effects of one-time items, was $0.81, both new records for the company. On an as-reported basis, EPS was $0.79 and included a one-time charge of $0.05, relating to the impact of the previously reported flood at the company's New York facility, partially offset by a $0.03 benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense from the completion of the audit of certain prior year tax returns. 
Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies over the third quarter of 2010. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in Q3 2011 were up 5% over last year. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from Q2. In comparing Q3 to the midpoint of the company's guidance of $1,008,000,000, sales exceeded guidance by approximately $25 million. Sales in the Mobile Devices market were particularly strong, growing over 20% sequentially as demand previously planned for the fourth quarter was pulled forward by certain customers. 
This was partially offset by softness in the industrial market, particularly in Europe, reflecting weaker economic conditions and by a reduction of about $11 million as a result of the previously announced flooding at the company's New York facility, which resulted in limited manufacturing and sales activity in the month of September. Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales in the quarter, was up 13% from last year and 2% from last quarter. The Interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 9% from last year and 1% sequentially. 
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income for the quarter, excluding the $12.8 million casualty loss relating to the flood, was $199 million compared to $189 million last year. Operating margin was 19.3% compared to 19.9% last year and 19.4% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expenses of approximately $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $7 million in the third quarter of 2010 or about 0.7% of sales in both periods. 
From a segment perspective, in the Cable business, margins were 13.1%, down from 13.5% last year. The margin decline relates primarily to higher material costs. From a sequential standpoint however, Cable margins improved from 12.8%, primarily as a result of lower material costs. In the Interconnect business, margins were 21.5% compared to 22.3% last year. The lower Interconnect operating margins reflect the impacts of increases in material input costs and to a lesser extent, the costs associated with workforce reductions of approximately 5% or 2,000 people in the quarter. 
It also was impacted by the impact of the loss of sales and margin due to the temporary flood-related shutdown of the company's New York facility in September. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume, cost reduction actions and price increases. Overall, we're very pleased with the company's margin achievement. The company's overall profitability level continued to be very strong in the face of significant global pressures and a mixed demand environment. 
We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner, and achieve strong profitability going forward. Interest expense for the quarter was $10.5 million compared to $10.6 million last year, reflecting lower average borrowing cost, partially offset by the higher average debt levels, resulting from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $2.3 million in the quarter, up from $1.3 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. 
The tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 was 23.5% compared to a rate of 22.8% in the third quarter of 2010. The prior year quarter included a net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense, primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits of about $8.4 million or $0.05 per share. The 2011 quarter includes a tax benefit of about $4.8 million or 37% of the $12.8 million casualty loss related to the flood described before, and a benefit of $4.5 million or $0.03, relating to the completion of certain prior year tax audits. 
Excluding these effects, the effective tax rate on Q3 2011 was about 26.8% and we currently expect the same rate in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income, excluding one-time items, was approximately 13.4% of sales in Q3, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share on an as-reported basis was $0.79 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.78 in the third quarter of 2010. After adjustment for one-time items, diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.81 in the quarter. 
Orders for the quarter were a record 1,017,000,000, up 8% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.98:1. As we announced last month, in early September, the company incurred flood damage at its Sidney, New York facility. In addition to the loss of sales and margin from the temporary shutdown of the facility in September and October, the company incurred a one-time charge relating to the write-off of damaged inventory and productive asset in addition to cleanup costs. 
Net of insurance recoveries, this resulted in a charge of about $12.8 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter, and we currently expect an additional charge of $7 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter relating to the remainder of the cleanup costs associated with the flood. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was about $184 million, approximately 136% of net income in the quarter and 96% of net income on a 9-month basis in 2011. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days declined to 79 days from 83 days at the end of June. Inventory was 635 million at the end of September. Day sales outstanding increased 1 day to 70 days at the end of September, and accounts receivable was $803 million at the end of September. The cash from operations along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $107 million was used primarily for $19 million of net capital expenditures, a $79 million increase in cash and cash investments and about $173 million to purchase 3.8 million shares of the company stock under stock buyback program. 
The company currently has about 9.6 million shares remaining under the 20 million share stock buyback program that was announced in January of this year, and expires in January of 2014. At September 30, cash and short-term cash investments were $781 million and these are primarily held up by the U.S. Debt at the end of the quarter was $1,265,000,000 and net debt therefore was $484 million at the end of the quarter. The company had availability under its revolving credit facility of $425 million at the end of the quarter. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.36x and 22x, respectively, and EBITDA in the quarter was $242 million.  From a financial perspective, both an excellent quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to the assumptions that we've included in our guidance. The midpoint of our sales guidance for the year has been revised from $3.990 billion to $3.922 billion, a reduction of approximately $68 million or 2%. About half of this reduction is due to the impact of the flood and changes in currency rates, specifically a loss of approximately $18 million in revenues, resulting from the flood in our New York facility due to a lack of full production capacity in September and October, and a reduction of approximately $15 million in revenues, resulting from current translations impact primarily from the weaker euro. 
The remaining reduction reflects incremental weakness in demand in the defense market and in the communications equipment markets, including wireless infrastructure, IP data and broadband, and to a lesser extent, a slowdown in European industrial markets. We believe this weaker demand is a result of a higher level of market uncertainty caused by the multitude of fiscal and budgetary issues plaguing the global economy.
Our fourth quarter guidance of $920 million to $940 million in sales or a 9% to 11% sequential decline reflects the majority of the impact of these items. And in addition, it's further impacted by the anticipated sequential reduction in sales in the Mobile Devices market. As I mentioned earlier in Q3, sales for the Mobile Device market were unexpectedly strong and we believe included some amount of customer pull-in of Q4 demand. Therefore, while sales in the Mobile Devices market in the second half of 2011 in total will be generally in line with our previous expectations, fourth quarter sales are expected to be lower and we now expect a sequential decline of over 20% in this market in Q4. For the full year, our gross expectations of about 30% for the Mobile Device market remain relatively unchanged. 
Of the 10% sequential decline in consolidated sales expected at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, about 2% relates to the impact of the flood and currency exchange rates. Another 3% to 4% relates to the shift in the Mobile Device demand. Given our current expectations for Q4 sales, we are taking appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure, including Q4 headcount reduction in addition to those already made in Q2 and Q3. Our guidance in Q4, considering the lower volume and these actions, assumes an ROS decline of about 1% from Q3 levels. Additionally, I would note that the guidance assumes a diluted share count of approximately 167 million shares. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

And I'd like to add my own welcome to all of you on the phone today at the time of our third quarter earnings call. I'm going to spend a few moments to highlight our third quarter achievements that Diana has just detailed. I'll discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets, and then I plan to make a few comments further on the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
The third quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol with orders and sales again in excess of $1 billion. We are very pleased that despite increased uncertainty in the worldwide economy, we were able to exceed the high end of our guidance in sales and EPS, with revenues growing 9% from prior year and 1% sequentially to a new record $1,033,000,000 and with EPS reaching a record of $0.81, excluding the one-time items. Although we continued to face significant cost challenges in the quarter, the Amphenol management team executed very well in the quarter, achieving industry-leading operating margins of 19.3%. We're particularly pleased that we were able to produce net income of 13.4% of sales, which is a clear indication of the financial strength of Amphenol. 
We also generated record cash flow of $184 million, which was used in part for the continuation of our stock buyback program. These excellent results in the third quarter are a direct reflection of the strength as well as the discipline of our agile and entrepreneurial management team. I'd like to make a few comments on the flood recovery efforts. Diana discussed some of the specifics of the financials of the flood. As announced on September 8, we experienced a severe and sudden flood in our Sidney, New York military/aerospace factory, which resulted from the back-to-back impacts of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. No doubt, a flood like this has tremendous personal impact on the people and our heart goes out to those in Thailand, who are experiencing similar things today. 
Following a previous flood in 2006, we took significant flood abatement measures in conjunction with state and local governments and these measures allowed us to minimize the impact. We're very pleased with the phenomenal reaction of our local team together with our suppliers, equipment manufacturers and clean-up specialists. Our data systems were intact and operational within hours. Our offices were relocated within 24 hours and the facility is largely operational today, ramping up to full production later on in this month. Most importantly, our customers and distribution partners have been extremely supportive and understanding during this difficult time for us. 
As Diana mentioned, the flood resulted in approximately $11 million in lost sales in the third quarter, and we expect incrementally another $7 million in lost sales in the fourth quarter. Certainly, in light of having suffered through 2 floods in the last 5 years, we are working closely with state and local authorities to establish an alternative production location, safely away from flood risk. Again, we are very proud of our organization, which, once again, rises to whatever challenges can come our way. 
Now turning to the trends and the progress in our served markets. I just like to comment that during the course of the third quarter, we have seen more conservatism from customers in many of our end markets, as the various political and economic uncertainties around the world have increased most notably in developed economies. 
Turning first to the military and aerospace market. That market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 13% from prior year and 11% sequentially, impacted certainly by the Sidney flood as well as by a moderation of orders in several Military programs. 
Net of the flood impact, sales in that market were down in the mid-single digits both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis as we had expected. We are pleased to experience strong double-digit growth in sales to commercial air customers, as plane volumes began to increase and as new programs began to take off. We expect a slight improvement in sales in the military/aerospace market in the fourth quarter as our flood recovery efforts continue and as procurement begins to move ahead for certain military programs. 
Longer term, we continue to be very excited about the expansion opportunity available to us from the proliferation of new military electronics, together with our new excellent positions on commercial air platforms. 
Turning to the industrial market. That market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 4% from prior year and were down 10% from the second quarter as a result of moderation demand in certain sectors of the industrial market, including, in particular, in Europe as well as resulting from expected seasonality.  Our growth compared to prior year was driven by progress in the heavy equipment and energy-related segments in particular. And we remain encouraged by our continued inroads into many new industrial applications, including alternative and traditional energy, real mass transit and new lighting technologies. While we are sensitive to growing conservatism among certain customers, we do expect the industrial market to see some seasonal growth in the fourth quarter, as our technology and diversified positions continued to create excellent growth potential into the future. 
The automotive market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased a very strong 55% from prior year, and were down 3% from the second quarter on expected seasonality. We are benefiting from the continued expansion of our participation in new electronics applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as from the Sylumis acquisition, which we completed earlier this year. That acquisition, together with our ongoing internal technology development initiatives, has broadened our range of automotive interconnect solution, and is enabling us to capitalize on the many new electronic applications and vehicles around the world. 
We expect sales in the automotive market to grow moderately in local currencies in the fourth quarter and increase vehicle volumes. And we remain very excited about the many opportunities for future growth that we see today in the automotive market. The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market were down slightly from prior year and were flat sequentially as operators maintained stable build-out levels. Once again, we did experience strong growth in emerging markets with excellent sales progress, in particular, in Latin America. 
While we expect demand in the broadband market to moderate in the fourth quarter seasonally, we look forward to renewed momentum long-term through our ongoing drive to expand our range of technologies to broadband customers in both domestic as well as international markets. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 4% from prior year and a strong 7% sequentially with growth, in particular, in storage and networking applications. 
Recently, we have begun to see customers reducing their outlooks to some degree. We believe this relates to market uncertainties and caution regarding inventory levels, which may have been built-up in anticipation of stronger end-market demand that our customers are seeing today. Nevertheless, our pipeline of high-technology new programs continues to grow. As customers are demanding higher performance equipment in support of the rapidly expanding IP video and other bandwidth-hungry applications, many of which are actually being driven by the proliferation of new data-intensive mobile Internet devices. 
While we expect a reduction in sales from the third quarter on these recent pullbacks in demand, we remain optimistic due to our new design wins with our high-technology products across a very broad array of IT customers and equipment platforms. The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 6% from prior year as we benefited from expanded positions on new base station platforms, as well as from growing sales into site installations around the world. 
Sales were down slightly sequentially. We expect a reduction of demand in the fourth quarter, as economic uncertainties appear to be causing operators as well as original equipment manufacturers to reduce their installation and build plans, and to become more cautious with respect to their inventory levels. Regardless, we remain excited by the many expanding opportunities for our interconnect products and antennas in a wide array of newly upgraded base station systems. And we look forward to continued growth across all the broad geographies that we serve. In particular, we do believe that this short-term conservatism in build-outs is creating some degree of pent-up demand, as network operators will be forced to upgrade their systems to improve both coverage and capacity, especially in support of the explosive growth of new smartphones and tablet computers. 
The Mobile Devices market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 39% from prior year and increased sequentially by an unexpected 23%, as we capitalized on our expanded product position in new smart Mobile Devices, in particular, tablets. We believe that this unexpected uptick in demand in the third quarter was driven in large part by pull-ins from certain customers that did not necessarily represent true levels of end demand, and thus will not repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Accordingly, we expect a sales decline of more than 20% in the fourth quarter in the Mobile Devices market, as those inventories of components and devices are consumed. Nevertheless, we still feel very positive about our full year outlook for performance in the Mobile Devices market with expected growth of approximately 30%. And we remain optimistic that our successful product and customer diversification efforts have positioned us to participate in the expanding market for new Mobile Devices, whether that be standard-feature phones, smartphones or tablets. We're very confident that our ongoing efforts will continue to drive success going forward in this very dynamic market. 
Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I just mentioned, we did see a significant shift of demand in the Mobile Device market from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. In addition, we expect growing economic uncertainties in the market to have near-term impacts in most communication equipment markets as well as in the European industrial market. 
Accordingly and based on constant currency exchange levels, we now expect in the fourth quarter 2011 and the full year 2011 the following results. 
We expect sales in the range of $920 million to $940 million and $3,912,000 to $3,932,000,000, respectively. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.69 to $0.71 and $3.01 to $3.03, respectively, excluding one-time items. As Diana mentioned, in reaction to these near-term changes in market conditions and the resulting lower demand levels that we now see, we are taking immediate and appropriate actions to adjust our cost, including headcount reductions. As is the custom in Amphenol, our management team is taking these actions proactively and aggressively, with a 5% headcount reduction in the third quarter and further plans to reduce as necessary going into the fourth quarter. 
In summary, I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol organization, as we have executed well in what is still a very challenging environment. These strong results that we have produced in the third quarter are a direct result of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in our many diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Although there are growing uncertainties in many of our end markets as well as ongoing inflationary pressures, I have tremendous confidence in that Amphenol management team. 
I am confident that we'll continue to excel in these challenging times by reacting quickly to changing customer needs to further strengthen our market position, and by driving proactively the actions that are necessary to secure our leading operating margins. Most importantly, this team will continue to execute with a level of passion and effectiveness that ensures a continued superior performance of Amphenol. 
Thank you very much. And Carol, at this point, we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

That's a very good question and, certainly, we would anticipate to be able to recover those revenues. We're very, very pleased how in reaction to the flood, our distribution partner as well as our own internal operations, some sister divisions around the world, other factories have responded just tremendously to keep our customers whole. But you can imagine that we have certain also proprietary products, which we have certain capacity levels of. And that will take some time to catch-up to and our customers are being very understanding. If we look towards the next 6 months, we -- our goal is certainly to get those sales back over such a time period. Does that come all in 1 month or 2 months or 1 quarter? It doesn't necessarily come that way. It is a very complex initiative to bring that factory back up. We have an outstanding distribution channel, who is able to create an excellent buffer when necessary, and has really been able to do that. I mean the thing that we are just most proud about here is that none of our customers have really had any complaints to Amphenol about how we've handled this. I have personally visited and spoken with many of those customers, where we had critical products ongoing, testing new product ramps happening. And the team up in Sidney just did such a fabulous job to prioritize those things, which are so critical to the customer. We had machines running 3, 4 days after the flood for certain products, which were very, very critical to have for customers. Others that we knew the distribution channel could support, those were ones where we were able to prioritize those, a little less important than the most critical sole-source products. So I think the simple answer is yes, we would anticipate over the course of the next kind of half year. But is that exactly a half year? That is impossible, really, to pin down."

That is something that is kind of out of everybody's hands. Nobody knows what they talk about inside the room. And at one point, hopefully, they will issue a report and they will come to an agreement. Whether that happens, I can tell you that customers in the military industry don't have a tremendous amount of optimism that a committee of 12 people, 6 from each party, will eventually come to an agreement. So I think that, that continues to hang over people's heads. At the same time, we saw in the quarter and we continue to see that the military industry has not just ground to a halt. There are still programs being funded. There are things being made. I mean, we continue to have a very, very significant sales into that market. And yes, it was down on a year-over-year basis, certainly impacted by the flood, but also impacted by these concerns. But we still see a lot of programs that are ongoing. And what gives me optimism for the long-term, Jim, is even with that sword hanging over people's heads from a governmental and a congressional standpoint, the drive for new designs and new electronics and new functionalities, we have not seen that slow down whatsoever in terms of the programs and the type of engineering challenges that we see. And so I think from that perspective, our belief that long-term, the proliferation of electronics into this market is going to allow a significant offset to whatever budgetary pressures are going to come, we still subscribe very much to that conviction because of what we see with our customers, where they are, continue to innovate and to develop new technologies everyday of the week."

I think Adam actually was the one that mentioned this facility and the fact that we are working very closely with government in the state to find an appropriate location and also to get support for a project that would help us to relocate the facility. We do not anticipate a significant negative financial impact. There may be some costs associated from a capital expenditure perspective. But, again, in the grand scheme of things, we would not expect this to be a significant financial impact on the company, and feel that some expenditure relative to the risk of potentially another flood, given the fact that we've had 2 in 5 years would -- makes this well worth the effort on our part. We do expect to get a substantial support from government on this. These are -- this is an excellent facility that produces high-tech products with a very, very heavy skilled workforce. And so the importance of the facility and the employment to the state is, as you can imagine, is as important to them as it is to us.

That was why our industrial business essentially was not impacted by this flood. That was one of the mitigation efforts that we took. This time, we are going to continue to make sure that our customers and our people, our staff are not put at risk from a flood. I agree with Diana.

Because I know you had those costs the last couple of quarters and the expectations that was going to go away. Now, obviously, you're doing some more cuts. So could you tell us sort of what that ballpark is going to look like? And then on the material side, I know that's been a headwind for you in the last few quarters.

Maybe starting with materials first. I mean, it certainly is true, Matt, that we have seen over the past few quarters this year, certainly, some negative impact resulting from this discontinued pressure on commodities, particularly in our case on the interconnect side with gold. And then, certainly, also copper and aluminum are important, particularly on the cable side of the business as are plastics. I think that it's certainly fair to say that there have been some improvements in certain of those in the last couple of months. Gold, unfortunately, is still higher than it would have been when we had closed Q2. I think that in terms of copper and aluminum, which have done better during the last quarter, I mean, if those can continue to stay at or come down from the levels that we're at, today, we would expect probably to see some improvement in the cable side of the business towards the end of the fourth quarter and then as we move into next year. As you know, we carry some inventory level of these items, and so we don't get an immediate benefit. To the extent that from the interconnect side of the business, to the extent that, again, as we look into next year, we get some improvement in both demand levels in the commodities maybe, including gold, would start to get a little bit better. I think that we would also hope to see some positive impact on the interconnect side of the business. So I think from a commodity standpoint right now in the immediate short term, we don't see a large benefit. But I think it's very fair to say that things are moving in a more positive direction. Hopefully, those continue. In terms of the restructuring, you're absolutely right that we didn't anticipate -- from a restructuring standpoint, you're absolutely right that when we talked last time in July, we said we were taking action in Q2 and Q3 that would put some pressure on ROS. And I think if you recall in Q2, we had about a 0.4% decline in ROS. And we did say that there was a portion of that, a smaller portion than the material pressure, but some portion of that, that was being impacted by structuring cost. And we did not, at that time, expect to see lower volumes in Q4 and therefore, more headcount reductions. We now do see that. And so we are ending up really with 3 quarters, where we're taking out a fair number of folks in the workforce, which is resulting in the same type of pressure in Q4. And therefore, a little higher issue from a conversion margin standpoint. We don't, as you know, like to specifically quantify these things because we do consider them part of the normal operating part of the business. But it certainly does put some additional pressure on Q4. This is a fairly more significant volume reduction in Q4, which also makes, from a profitability standpoint, things are a little bit harder. We'll be -- have gotten through these actions by the end of Q4, and that should provide some support to profitability as we move into 2012."

And so I think what has been the hallmark of the Amphenol organization over many, many years has been that we don't adjust our resources with an expectation of what the future is. We adjust our resources based on the reality of what faces us today. And clearly, we have a sequential reduction of more than 20% in the Mobile Devices market, which we've -- both Diana and I mentioned, and that is going to lead the general managers to run the businesses within that Mobile Devices market to take immediate and significant actions. And I think that is exactly the case. If that business comes back and when it comes back, they will add the resources using that kind of accordion-like way of doing things that we have always done. And I think that is just the hallmark of how we run the business. You should not take away from the fact that we're making headcount reductions in one or another segment as a statement that we are -- I mean, to recharacterize what you say, we are losing share in that market. That is certainly not the case that we see. Just again to recharacterize it, we saw in the third quarter a very significant pull-in of demand, which clearly now comes out -- was demand that maybe otherwise would have been falling into the fourth quarter. And we, obviously, had the resources in place to satisfy that demand. And these were significant pull-ins, whereby, customers hit us with orders that we didn't expect to come, and we're able to ramp up and satisfy the demand from those customers in a very, very significant and effective fashion. And when you have that than to reverse course, we're going to make the resource adjustment that we always make at Amphenol. And that is true across every one of the markets and every one of our 75 general managers around the company. They're running their business after having gone to the customer, they listen to what the customer says they need in the future. And they go back and they adjust their resources, really, in realtime relative to what the market needs. And that has allowed us to always react in difficult times and always be able to ramp up more quickly in good times. And I think that flexibility that we preserve, that in-the-moment management of the resources of the company, that is something that we will continue to drive. And so whatever comes our way here, whether that be floods or whether that be pull-ins of demand, we're going to react very rapidly to those events and we're going to drive them. We're going to be successful following that."

No, I mean, clearly this is a case or we have also seen those same trends that you mentioned here. We see it from both the OEMs as well as the operators because we do business with both parts of the chain in the wireless infrastructure market. And I think what has happened recently, I mean, whether you have some big mergers that are sort of stalled, whether you have customers being more conservative about certain build plans, clearly, the build plans and the installation plans of operators, in particular, in developed markets have not met the expectations of the OEMs. And we have really seen that on a global basis, that conservatism. What does it mean in the end? I think I am not the only one on the phone here today, who is just intensely frustrated by the coverage of my phone when I'm driving around the highways of the Northeast. And there is clearly a significant pent-up demand for both coverage and capacity. The new Mobile Devices, whether those be tablets or smartphones or whatever, Android, iOS, all of those formats, those are driving levels of data and levels of capacity restriction in these markets on a worldwide basis. And so we believe that there's no question that at one point, you’ve got to have these things built. And what we hear from our OEM customers is certainly the same story, which is that they are hearing from their operator accounts that, yes, there may be some pause here. We're doing whatever, whatever it takes to get a merger done, or we are doing whatever it takes to sort of preserve capital in an uncertain time. They are going to have to install these base stations. They're going to have to install lot of them. The beauty of the new type of base stations that the leading equipment manufacturers have created and where we have worked with them on new technologies, is these new base stations are much smaller. They're much more flexible and they allow the operators to more quickly make these installations. These are not big refrigerator boxes from the past. They are much smaller. In that sense that you can get coverage in a much, much quicker fashion in certain places. And look, I know very well when I go home and I barely have cell phone coverage anymore that they're going to have to change. They're going to have to install these base stations. When that comes, does it come in the first quarter? Does it come in the second quarter? This is very hard to predict. Only those in the boardrooms of these operators know that. But clearly, it will come because it is getting worst and worst around the world in terms of coverage. And the only answer is to put in place new and more of these base station platforms and we're very, very well-positioned on those systems."

What we saw in the IT market very clearly was that going into the quarter, customers had certain expectations about what would normally be growth going into the fourth quarter. And I think you've seen in the many earnings releases that have come out over the last several months that those expectations have been moderated. But they already drove the supply chain to put in place the capacity for that uptick in demand, which in the end, does not happen for those customers. And so, is that something that gets consumed in 1 quarter? Does it get consumed in 2 quarters? Certainly, I would hope it not to last much longer than 2 quarters. It depends in the end on what the final customers take. An inventory position is only healthy, given a certain level of demand. And so to the extent that our customers see a level of demand that is kind of a more normal or flat demand from the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, then I would hope that, that would be a more positive outlook. If they see further caution from their customers, from the government, from the financial services, that other big customers, then you could potentially have more time for an inventory correction. I would hope this is not more than a 1, 2-quarter phenomenon."

So we're very pleased with that development and we think that, that's something that's going to, long-term, be very favorable for the company. If we look at commercial air, as I mentioned, it grew very strongly in the quarter. And if you take out the impact of the flood, it would have grown somewhere around 20% year-over-year. So very, very strong performance in commercial air. And we have continued a very positive outlook for that commercial air segment. The number of new planes, the degree of kind of the electronic architecture changes in these new planes is really just fabulous. I had the good fortune to be crawling around some of these planes over the course of last month or 2. And it is really just not only the new platforms and the amount of electronics in them, but the vision of our customers for the future of electronics, whether that be in the fuselage, in the avionic system, even in the engines, which have been something that long-term has not changed so much. There is just a real drive to wherever possible implement electronic functionalities to drive either fuel efficiency, either a simplification of the control mechanisms for the pilot, either to drive a better passenger experience. And there's really just phenomenal things that our commercial air customers are not just implementing today, but even considering long term for the future that creates just an amazing level of opportunities for the company. And we are really capturing that with technology. When I go out and I sit with the engineers of some of these customers and really talk about technology, that's where you get so excited because the new innovations that we are driving for those customers are real game changers in terms of allowing those customers to do things that they didn't know they could do in the past, whether that is bringing electronics closer to harsher environments in the plane, whether that is bringing new functionalities to the passengers. Those are all things that -- the interconnect that we are innovating are helping to drive those customers to create those new experiences. And I think that's going to serve us very, very well in the future for commercial, and we're really excited about that market."

I think this is a little bit different. We have not seen everything fall off a cliff here. Certainly, we see that there are a lot of questions among our customers. People are nervous. People are nervous about the environment. They are nervous about the political, the economic environment and we did see this very significant shift between the Mobile Devices from the fourth quarter to the third quarter. If you take that shift away, and I think Diana went through the numbers, we would be -- if you take currency and that shift away, this would be something like a 4%, I think, reduction from Q3 to Q4. Certainly, not what we would like and not what we would normally see seasonally. And I think that difference is really the environment that we are facing today and that many of our customers are facing, in particular, in the communications market, as we talked about, in wireless infrastructure, in IT as well as in the European industrial market, which is one where, clearly, the events in Europe are causing many customers in some of the biggest industrial zones of Europe to tighten their belt, so to speak.

And because the industrial business does have a significant component in Europe as well in North America, that seasonal impact can be -- not insignificant going to the fourth quarter. I think we feel very good about our position in that market. Recall that our industrial business is very, very diversified. It ranges in things from high speed rail to alternative energy to oil and gas exploration to factory automation, industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment, I mean, lighting. I could go on for a long time about these sub-segments. And I think we still see in many of those markets, especially those new markets like alternative energy, like lighting, where there's a big transition happening in the nature of lighting and outdoor and harsh-environment lighting. Those are areas where we continue to see that there is momentum among the customers, and there's still great opportunities for growth. I think you take those kind of new markets in industrial, in addition, there's maybe a more muted, but still a little bit of a seasonal uptick that comes in the fourth quarter.

I believe that the customers there, some of them may, just now, be coming to the realization, ""Hey, we're not going to hit that step-up that we thought we were going to get."" And so, did that translate into a slightly more negative view today than 2 months ago. I would say in those markets, maybe we've seen those revisions more recently in terms of the mindset, only because they clung to the hope that they would have that real big sequential step-up that they all anticipated. And now, it seems to be coming through a realization that's not going to happen with how long it's taking, the governments of the world to make resolution to some of these uncertainties, and to really help to drive the economies in a better direction. I think that's causing some to just sort of say, ""Well, look, we're going to -- we're not going to have that step-up, so let's adjust accordingly."""

And I think we took a lot of pricing actions early in the year. And as the market environment became more mixed and then later became more certain, the ability to execute on those price increases, especially with OEMs, became more of a struggle. I think relative to the channel, as you correctly point out, distribution is one area where you can raise prices a little bit more easily. We do this on an ongoing basis. We don't do it monolithically. So you may not hear about it in a way that says, ""Well, Amphenol want and raised prices monolithically across distribution channel"" That's just not how we operate. Our price increases go out, really, on a product or a technology basis, and those are an ongoing -- throughout the year, pricing exercise with our distributors and we will continue to follow that as well. Remember, distribution represents only some 14%, 15% of our sales and so that's not the big issue. The big issue is how you go about getting price increases with the OEMs. We will be disciplined on price. One of the areas that is the most essential for price is actually new product development. And as we look forward, new products for Amphenol consistently have represented more than 20%, nearly 25% of our sales for a number of years. And that is a focus that allows us to get pricing in the end, not by changing the price on a certain part number, but by having more functionality embedded in the product, creating more value for your customer. And, thereby, they're willing to pay you a comparably higher price. But it's an apples-and-oranges comparison in the eyes of the customer. And so at the end of the day in a market like this, innovation is the real answer to that pricing. We're going to drive that innovation very, very hard going forward.
Thank you very much, Shawn. And I'd like to thank all of you for your time today and your attention and wish you all a very, very good completion here to October and going into the full year. We'll talk to you again in January. Thank you."
