Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published in AIMCO's website. 
Participants on today's call will be Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide opening remarks; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO, who will review fourth quarter results, capital market activities and guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011. Also on the room today and available to answer questions are Miles Cortez, our Chief Administrative Officer; John Bezzant, EVP of Transactions; Keith Kimmel, who runs our Property of Operations; and Dan [ph], who runs Three Doves and Construction Services.

336458,117982706,99439,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO. We had a good fourth quarter and a very solid 2010. In a few minutes, Ernie will discuss operating and financial results and provide 2011 guidance. But before I turn the call over to",760,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO. We had a good fourth quarter and a very solid 2010. In a few minutes, Ernie will discuss operating and financial results and provide 2011 guidance. 
But before I turn the call over to him, I'd like to offer my perspective on where AIMCO has been and where we are going. As we all know, the last few years have been extremely difficult for the U.S. economy and it's not been an easy time for apartments either. But the apartment business has fared far better than the overall economy. 
Looking back, here's how AIMCO did. Total same-store income was up 3.7% in 2008, it was down 3.3% in 2009 and it was up 80 basis points last year. In other words, same store net operating income was positive for two of the last three years. And taken together, same store net operating income over that same three-year period was up 1.1%. So the big picture is we have a steady and improving business. And our conventional same store net operating results are better than peer averages for the past one, three and five years. 
And our conventional same store operating margin actually improved during the great recession, it was better by 61%. And during all of this, our balance sheet got better. For example, recourse debt was largely eliminated, costs were lowered, near-term maturities were reduced, liquidity and capacity were increased. These were results are quite solid and reflect the hard work and the professionalism of the entire AIMCO team and they have my admiration and thanks. 
As we turn to the new year, we begin with cautious optimism. But also concerned about the pitfalls that may lie ahead. On balance, we expect a gradual and halting recovery in the U.S. economy. But could also continued high unemployment, so that consumers will be price-sensitive and cautious, labor costs will be subdued and the Federal Reserve will be motivated to keep interest rates low even at the risk of unwelcome inflation. 
We are concerned that capital markets remained vulnerable to shocks, such as we saw last year with the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. And as we may see this year, perhaps following the headlines in the Middle East or perhaps in response to the financial straits the state and federal government. 
So with that as backdrop, our first priority is to maximize revenues by maintaining high occupancy and working to increase rental rates. Now I've read the peer reports and the projections of data providers and some are more optimistic than I am. If they prove correct, and I hope they are, I expect AIMCO rent increases will track their projections. But we are not, at least not yet, projecting such large increases, and so we are making our plans assuming that the road remains a little bumpy. 
As a result, our second priority is continued strict cost control, both at our properties where we're managing costs quite carefully and off-site, where we continue to reduce costs, including G&A by deploying laborsaving technology and by simplifying our business. For example, liquidating non-core activities and reducing the number of partnerships and their related expenses. 
Notwithstanding our cost discipline, we plan to continue and even increase substantial repairs and maintenance spending and also to increase the number of revenue enhancing capital projects so that our properties are in a good position to attract whatever rent increases may be available. Along the same lines, we expect to ramp up our redevelopment activity with a handful of redevelopment starts later in the year. We expect to strengthen our balance sheet by avoiding recourse debt, reducing refunding risk by extending the duration of our debt, already 1/3 longer than the peer average, taking advantage of today's interest rates to lower our cost of leverage and reducing leverage overall by embracing the discipline and property debt amortization. 
We are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities in our target markets and regularly underwrite properties and make offers to buy them. But for the time being, we see more attractive investment opportunities within our existing portfolio. In tender and merger activities within our partnerships and in property upgrades and the redevelopment of properties we already own. In some, our theme is more steady as it goes than happy days are here again. As the economy does accelerate, as we all hope, we'll be ready and in a good position to participate fully. With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, AIMCO's Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

And third, I'll provide first quarter and full year 2011 guidance. As ope",1222,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I'll cover the following subjects. First, our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. Second, our balance sheet. And third, I'll provide first quarter and full year 2011 guidance. 
As operating results, fourth quarter and full year total portfolio NOI, total same-store NOI and conventional same store NOI were all positive year-over-year. Specifically, total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable same store was up 6.1% for the quarter and up 80 basis points for the year. The components of total same-store includes conventional and affordable properties. Conventional same store NOI was up 5% for the quarter and up 20 basis points for the year. Affordable same store NOI was up 15.3% for the quarter and up 4.8% for the year. 
For our conventional same store properties, rates on new leases during the quarter were on average, 90 basis points higher than expiring lease rates, making the fourth quarter the first time since the second quarter 2008 that new lease rates were positive on a lease-to-lease basis. 
Rates on renewal leases during the quarter were on average 1.6% higher than expiring lease. Conventional same store expenses were down 3.7% for the quarter, primarily due to adjustments of previously estimated real estate taxes after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter. Controllable operating expenses such as personnel costs, marketing and turnover where also lower than fourth quarter 2009, while we have continued to increase spending to upgrade our properties. 
For the year, conventional same store expenses were down 1%, primarily due to lower real estate taxes for controllable operating expenses essentially flat. Regarding January 2011, average daily occupancy for our conventional same store portfolio was 96.4% and new lease rates were up 1.4% from expiring lease rates while renewal rates were up 2.5% from expiring lease rates. 
Overall, year-over-year monthly revenue growth have been positive since August and January 2011 revenues up 2.1% from January last year. 
As FFO. Fourth quarter FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily as a result of property operating income $0.05 per share above expectations, including $0.04 for Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and property tax adjustments that were not contemplated in guidance. In $0.01 from affordable property operations due to higher average rates. These favorable results partially offset by the write-off of uncollectible fees which totaled $0.02 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. With our term debt fully repaid in July, our only recourse debt obligation is a revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit was undrawn at December 31 but available capacity was $260 million. We have no property debt maturities during the first quarter. 
For the full year, we have $105 million of property debt maturing. Of this amount, $79 million occurs from the second quarter, which we only lock in the third quarter of 2010 and will be refinanced this quarter. Loan is a seven-year, fixed-rate loan at a rate of 3.56%. The remaining $26 million of maturities represents four loans that were refinanced in the ordinary course during the year. 
We will continue our efforts to look for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2015 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risk and to take advantage of current interest rates, and we remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 billion per year over the next few years. 
During the fourth quarter, we issued 600,000 shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $24.50 per share generating $14 million in proceeds. This cash was used to complete two partnership merger transactions. And finally, we now somewhat that our Board of Directors declared a $0.12 per share quarterly dividend, which represents a 30% increase. 
Looking ahead to 2011 for the year, FFO was projected to range from $1.46 per share to $1.56 per share. Page 6 of our release includes a reconciliation of 2010 FFO to 2011 guidance at the midpoint, specifically $0.13 per share increase from operations due to higher rates, $0.09 per share in lower offset costs including G&A and $0.02 per share in lower preferred stock dividends. These positive variances and recurring line items are offset by the following negative variances which are non-recurring in nature: $0.12 per share from 2010 and 2011 property sales, $0.06 per share due to the impact of refinancing floating rate property debt to fixed rate during 2010 and 2011, $0.05 per share from lowering non-recurring revenue and $0.03 per share due to lower interest income due to reductions and receivables. 
A particular assumptions for the full year 2011 have been provided in our earnings release and includes the following for property operations. We expect total portfolio Net Operating Income, which includes our Conventional Same Store properties, Redevelopment Properties and our affordable properties have increased year-over-year 2% to 4%. We anticipate year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 2.5% to 4.5%, which includes revenue growth of 2% to 3% and 0.5% to 1% increase in expenses. Within our assumptions for revenue growth is the expectation that both new lease and renewable rental rates will increase 3.6% over expiring leases. Third-party data providers have forecasted in our markets that lease rates will be up somewhere between 3.1% and 6.2%. As Terry noted earlier, we remain cautious about the overall economy and stay projected that our new lease rates will be for the lower end of third-party estimates. However, our performance in 2010 is tracked by third parties, consistent with our own results and is at the high-end of performance amongst our apartment peers. The market turns out to be stronger than we are currently projecting, we are confident we will fully participate in this improvement as we did in 2010. 
Please refer to Page 5 of our earnings release for additional guidance assumptions, including projections for recurring and non-recurring Investment Management income, upside costs including G&A, capital expenditures, transaction activities and property debt activity. A comment about acquisition and refinancing activity. Our current guidance does not contemplate our completing acquisitions beyond our partnership transactions. However, we have included in guidance $2 million of pursuit cost as we continue to seek additional accretive acquisition opportunities. Regarding refinancing activity we are pursuing many opportunities to refund loans maturing in the upcoming years. It made the economy for us to incur prepayment penalties locked in today's lower interest rates and extent those maturities. 
Depending on the outcome of our new business effort and refinancing activities, pursued costs and prepayment penalties may be higher than currently contemplated in guidance. Lastly, for the first quarter of 2011, FFO is projected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Before we take questions, I would like to mention that we will again be hosting several property tours in 2011. The schedule for which is included on Page 6 of this morning's earnings release.

Tom Cumi held that title and one for the last year well, Tim Beaudin, held that title. In general, what I would say is that over the past few years, we've significantly streamlined and refocused AIMCO and we've done so for several reasons. But one benefit has been to substantially reduced offset cost including G&A. And that's good, not bad. And generally we filled our vacancies by promoting from within. Our senior management team averages eight to 10 years of AIMCO experience, so we're used to together. And it shows that amidst this turnover, we've not missed a beat. In fact, our results have improved, visibly our peers and our G&A has been reduced from 7% of revenue in 2008 to about 4.5% last year."

For us, the great thing was the merger and tender activities, we already know the assets that greatly reduced our underwriting risks. In addition these activities help us simplify our business, and we're able to reduce overhead as we eliminate added expenses from those partnerships like audits [ph] and things like that. Concerning the returns, looking strictly at the real estate, the returns will be similar to what we will be able to get in the marketplace acquiring assets but they get that extra benefit of knowing the assets better and also helping reduce our offset costs.

We're looking at the fact that we have for that tax for 2010, even going back further. We are hopeful that will settle favorably and that should help offset any increases that maybe coming there. So we think in those two big items, things are flattish from a utility perspective. We also think things will be pretty good. We've been walking lower utility costs for GAAP than we had in prior year and that's helping to offset increases we're seeing in water costs as well as in some electric. So the big three we're feeling pretty good. It there's going to be some increase in our expenses, in our midpoint we're expecting expenses to be up about 1%. And that increase will be driven by continuing work around repairs and maintenance, putting our properties in a condition they need to be, working on landscaping, things like that.

You'll see cap rates generally lower than the 9% that you saw in Q4 last year. Again we had a couple of special situations there. But some there's going to be some noise quarter-to-quarter. If we happen to sell a couple of small outlier properties, and that was always in the quarter, you may see higher cap rates than you would expect and you would extrapolate from the whole portfolio. But in general, as we look forward into 2011, you're going to see average cap rates and depending upon the mix from quarter to quarter that maybe high eights or low eights and we may be get every now and then."

We adjust exit cap rates for reduced revenue growth expectations after the forecast period. And we do that consistently whether we're looking at acquisitions or redevelopments or sales. So we can compare on an apples-to-apples basis. When we look at that, I would say our dispositions will tend to be higher at a white cap rates but lower free cash flow IRR for two important reasons. The first that rental rate growth in the secondary additionally market, as John mentioned, Michigan, for example, is expected to be lower than in the markets in which we're investing. And secondly, the capital replacement spending, which we project generally at about $1,200 a unit is a higher element of free cash flow when you're looking at net operating income, when you're looking at lower rent projects, which properties selling probably in the $600 to $800 range we're the properties for investing in our probably in the $1,000 to $1,300 range.

And then overtime, we would probably want to see that payout ratio increase. But still, being a low payout ratio. We wanted to be sure that the dividend is predictable going forward.

336458,117982706,99562,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO.

But before I turn the call over to hi",753,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO. We had a good fourth quarter and a very solid 2010. In a few minutes, Ernie will discuss operating and financial results and provide 2011 guidance. But before I turn the call over to him, I'd like to offer my perspective on where AIMCO has been and where we are going. As we all know, the last few years have been extremely difficult for the U.S. economy and it's not been an easy time for apartments either. But the Apartment business has fared far better than the overall economy. 
Looking back, here's how AIMCO did. Total same-store income was up 3.7% in 2008, it was down 3.3% in 2009 and it was up 80 basis points last year. In other words, same-store net operating income was positive for two of the last three years. And taken together, same-store net operating income over that same three-year period was up 1.1%. So the big picture is we have a steady and improving business, and our conventional same-store net operating results are better than peer averages for the past one, three and five years. And our conventional same-store operating margin actually improved during the great recession to better than 61%. And during all of this, our balance sheet got better. For example, recourse debt was largely eliminated, costs were lowered, near-term maturities were reduced, liquidity and capacity were increased. These results are quite solid and reflect the hard work and the professionalism of the entire AIMCO team, and they have my admiration and thanks. 
As we turn to the new year, we begin with cautious optimism but also concerned about the pitfalls that may lie ahead. On balance, we expect a gradual and halting recovery in the U.S. economy but also continued high unemployment, so that consumers will be price-sensitive and cautious. Labor costs will be subdued, and the Federal Reserve will be motivated to keep interest rates low even at the risk of unwelcome inflation. We are concerned that capital markets remain vulnerable to shocks, such as we saw last year with the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. And as we may see this year, perhaps following the headlines in the Middle East or perhaps in response to the financial strength in state and federal government. 
So with that as backdrop, our first priority is to maximize revenue by maintaining high occupancy and working to increase rental rates. Now I've read the peer reports and the projections of data providers and some are more optimistic than I am. If they prove correct, and I hope they are, I expect AIMCO rent increases will track their projections. But we are not, at least not yet, projecting such large increases, and so we are making our plans assuming that the road remains a little bumpy. 
As a result, our second priority is continued strict cost control, both at our properties where we're managing costs quite carefully and off-site where we continue to reduce costs, including G&A by deploying labor saving technology and by simplifying our business. For example, liquidating non-core activities and reducing the number of partnerships and their related expenses. 
Notwithstanding our cost discipline, we plan to continue and even increase substantial repairs and maintenance spending and also to increase the number of revenue enhancing capital projects so that our properties are in a good position to attract whatever rent increases may be available. Along the same lines, we expect to ramp up our redevelopment activity with a handful of redevelopment starts later in the year. We expect to strengthen our balance sheet by avoiding recourse debt, reducing refunding risk by extending the duration of our debt, already 1/3 longer than the peer average, taking advantage of today's interest rate to lower our cost of leverage and reducing leverage overall by embracing the discipline of property debt amortization. 
We are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities in our target markets and regularly underwrite properties and make offers to buy them. But for the time being, we see more attractive investment opportunities within our existing portfolio. In tender and merger activities within our partnerships and in property upgrades and the redevelopment of properties we already own. In sum, our theme is more steady as she goes than happy days are here again. As the economy does accelerate, as we all hope, we'll be ready and in a good position to participate fully. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, AIMCO's Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

On today's call, I'll cover the following subjects: first, our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010; second, our balance sheet; and third, I'll provide first quarter and full year 2011 guidance. 
As to operating results, fourth quarter and full year total portfolio NOI, total same-store NOI and Conventional Same-Store NOI were all positive year-over-year. Specifically, total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable Same Store was up 6.1% for the quarter and up 80 basis points for the year. The components of total same store include Conventional and Affordable properties. Conventional Same-Store NOI was up 5% for the quarter and up 20 basis points for the year. Affordable Same-Store NOI was up 15.3% for the quarter and up 4.8% for the year. 
For our Conventional Same-Store properties, rates on new leases during the quarter were on average 90 basis points higher than expiring lease rates, making the fourth quarter the first time since the second quarter 2008 that new lease rates were positive on a lease-to-lease basis. Rates on renewal leases during the quarter were on average 1.6% higher than expiring lease rates. 
Conventional Same-Store expenses were down 3.7% for the quarter, primarily due to adjustment of previously estimated real estate taxes after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter. Controllable operating expenses such as personnel costs, marketing and turnover were also lower than fourth quarter 2009, while we have continued to increase spending to upgrade our properties. 
For the year, Conventional Same-Store expenses were down 1%, primarily due to lower real estate taxes with controllable operating expenses essentially flat. Regarding January 2011, average daily occupancy for our Conventional Same-Store portfolio was 96.4% and new lease rates were up 1.4% from expiring lease rates, while renewal rates were up 2.5% from expiring lease rates. Overall, year-over-year monthly revenue growth has been positive since August of January 2011 revenues up 2.1% from January last year. 
As to FFO, fourth quarter pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily as a result of property operating income of $0.05 per share above expectations, including $0.04 for Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and property tax adjustments that were not contemplated in guidance and $0.01 from Affordable property operations due to higher average rates. These favorable results partially offset by the write-off of uncollectible fees, which totaled $0.02 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. With our term debt fully repaid in July, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit was undrawn at December 31 when its available capacity was $260 million. We have no property debt maturities during the first quarter. 
For the full year, we have $105 million of property debt maturing. Of this amount, $79 million occurs in the second quarter, which will only rate lock in the third quarter of 2010 and will be refinanced this quarter. The loan is a seven-year fixed-rate loan at a rate of 3.56%. The remaining $26 million of maturities represents four loans that were refinanced in the ordinary course during the year. 
We will continue our efforts to look for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2015 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risk and to take advantage of current interest rates. And we remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 billion per year over the next few years. 
During the fourth quarter, we issued 600,000 shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $24.50 per share, generating $14 million in proceeds. This cash was used to complete two partnership merger transactions. And finally, we announced someone that, that our Board of Directors has declared a $0.12 per share quarterly dividend, which represents a 20% increase. 
Looking ahead to 2011 for the year, FFO was projected to range from $1.46 per share to $1.56 per share. Page 6 of our release includes a reconciliation of 2010 FFO to 2011 guidance at the midpoint, specifically $0.13 per share increase from operations due to higher rates, $0.09 per share in lower offsite costs, including G&A and $0.02 per share in lower preferred stock dividends. These positive variances in recurring line items are offset by the following negative variances, which are non-recurring in nature: $0.12 per share from 2010 and 2011 property sales, $0.06 per share due to the impact of refinancing floating rate property debt to fixed rate during 2010 and 2011, $0.05 per share from lowering non-recurring revenue and $0.03 per share due to lower interest income due to reductions in receivables. 
A particular assumption for the full year 2011 have been provided in our earnings release and includes the following for property operations. We expect total portfolio net operating income, which includes our Conventional Same-Store properties, Conventional Redevelopment properties and our Affordable properties to increase year-over-year 2% to 4%. We anticipate year-over-year Conventional Same-Store NOI growth of 2.5% to 4.5%, which includes revenue growth of 2% to 3% and 0.5% to 1.5% increase in expenses. 
Within our assumption for revenue growth is the expectation that both new lease and renewal rental rates will increase 3.6% over expiring leases. Third-party data providers have forecasted in our markets that new lease rates will be up somewhere between 3.1% and 6.2%. As Terry noted earlier, we remain cautious about the overall economy and stay projected that our new lease rates will be towards the lower end of the range of third-party estimates. 
However, our performance in 2010 is tracked by third parties in consistent with our own results is at the high end of performance amongst our apartment REIT peers. The market turns out to be stronger than we are currently projecting, we are confident we will fully participate in this improvement as we did in 2010. Please refer to Page 5 of our earnings release for additional guidance assumptions, including projections for recurring and non-recurring Investment Management income; offsite costs including G&A; capital expenditures; transaction activities and property debt activity. 
A comment about acquisition and refinancing activity. Our current guidance does not contemplate us completing acquisitions beyond our partnership transactions. However, we have included in guidance $2 million of pursuit cost as we continue to seek additional accretive investment opportunities. Regarding refinancing activity, we are pursuing many opportunities to refund loans maturing in the upcoming years. It may be economic for us to incur prepayment penalties locked in today's lower interest rates and extend those maturities. Depending on the outcome of our new business effort and refinancing activities, pursuit costs and prepayment penalties may be higher than currently contemplated in guidance. 
Lastly, for the first quarter of 2011, FFO is projected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same-Store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. Before we take questions, I would like to mention that we will again be hosting several property tours in 2011. The schedule for which is included on Page 6 of this morning's earnings release.

In general, what I would say is that over the past few years, we've significantly streamlined and refocused AIMCO and we've done so for several reasons but one benefit has been to substantially reduce offsite costs, including G&A. And that's good, not bad, and generally we filled our vacancies by promoting from within. Our senior management team averages eight to 10 years of AIMCO experience, so we're used to working together and it shows that amidst this turnover, we've not missed a beat.

For us, we had a great thing with the merger and tender activities, we already know the assets that greatly reduces our underwriting risks. In addition, these activities help us sort of simplify our business, and we're able to reduce overhead as we eliminate added expenses from those partnerships, like audits, tax returns and things like that. Concerning the returns, looking strictly at the real estate, the returns are going to be very similar to what we will be able to get out in the marketplace acquiring assets, but we get that extra benefit of knowing the assets better and also helping to reduce our offsite costs.

Offsetting that is some of the activity in our other Conventional portfolio and we really don't have much in the Redevelopment portfolio today. So it's not really driven by that. And our other Conventional portfolio, which consists of our New York assets. We do have some revenue decreases. We have one large tenant, commercial tenant that we expect to have to spend some time trying to fill that spot during 2011.

The big food groups being personnel, being real estate taxes and being utilities for us. Personnel we think is going to be on the flattish side, and as Terry talked about, we have some opportunities with the technology initiatives and taking into account that we had merit increases in 2010. We think we can find ways to staff more efficiently across our portfolio to keep personnel costs relatively flat. Regarding real taxes for 2011, we're expecting a very slight increase less than 1%. We're looking at the fact that we have some appeals that are still in place for the tax for 2010, even going back further. We're hopeful that will settle favorably and that should help offset any increases that maybe coming there. So we think in those two big items, things are flattish. From the utilities perspective, we also think things will be pretty good. We've been locking lower utility costs for gas than we had in prior year and that's helping to offset increases we are seeing in water costs, as well as in some electric. So in the big three we're feeling pretty good. There's going to be some increases though on our expenses. At our midpoint, we're expecting expenses to go up about 1% and the increase will be driven by our continuing work around repairs and maintenance, putting our properties in a condition they need to be, working on landscaping, things like that. So net-net, with the big three, Andy, kind of be in the flattish range we feel pretty good that we can keep expenses under control in 2011."

So that's net operating income minus capital replacement spending. We extrapolated forward generally along the lines of the data providers. We adjust exit cap rates for reduced revenue growth expectations after the forecast period, and we do that consistently whether we're looking at acquisitions or redevelopments or sales. So we can compare on an apples-to-apples basis. When we look at that, I would say our dispositions will tend to be higher NOI cap rate, but lower free cash flow IRR for two important reasons. The first is that rental rate growth in the secondary and tertiary markets, as John mentioned, Michigan, for example, is expected to be lower than in the markets in which we're investing. And secondly, capital replacement spending, which we project generally at about $1,200 a unit is a higher element of free cash flow when you're looking at net operating income, when you're looking at lower rent projects, which in the properties we're selling are probably in the $600 to $800 range. Where the properties we're investing in are probably in the $1,000 to $1,300 range. So those are the two big things that will drive a positive spread even though the cap rates might be out of whack."

In looking at it, we were mindful that dividends are very important contributor to shareholder return. They're important to all of us in the room because we all own AIMCO common and appreciate those dividends. The thinking is that we want to be sure or cautious about setting new levels until it's exactly clear where the economy is going to go. So some of my own conservatism or caution about the economy, I think is reflected there. We look at last year where we paid out about 40% of AFFO, which was about half of the payout rate of the next lowest apartment REIT and felt we're a little bit miss of an outlier. And then over time, we would probably want to see that payout ratio increase, but still being at a low payout ratio. We wanted to be sure that the dividend is predictable going forward. And so it seem to the board that a 20% increase was a significant step in the direction of increasing our payout ratio and balance the use of proceeds versus a return to shareholders versus alternative uses within the company."

We had a good fourth quarter and a very solid 2010. In a few minutes, Ernie will discuss operating and financial results and provide 2011 guidance. But before I turn the call over to hi",759,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO. We had a good fourth quarter and a very solid 2010. In a few minutes, Ernie will discuss operating and financial results and provide 2011 guidance. But before I turn the call over to him, I'd like to offer my perspective on where AIMCO has been and where we are going. As we all know, the last few years have been extremely difficult for the U.S. economy and it's not been an easy time for apartments either. But the apartment business has fared far better than the overall economy. 
Looking back, here's how AIMCO did. Total Same Store income was up 3.7% in 2008, it was down 3.3% in 2009 and it was up 80 basis points last year. In other words, Same Store net operating income was positive for two of the last three years. And taken together, Same Store net operating income over that same three-year period was up 1.1%. So the big picture is we have a steady and improving business, and our conventional Same Store net operating results are better than peer averages for the past one, three and five years. And our conventional Same Store operating margin actually improved during the great recession to better than 61%. And during all of this, our balance sheet got better. For example, recourse debt was largely eliminated, costs were lowered, near-term maturities were reduced, liquidity and capacity were increased. These results are quite solid and reflect the hard work and the professionalism of the entire AIMCO team, and they have my admiration and thanks.
As we turn to the new year, we begin with cautious optimism but also concerned about the pitfalls that may lie ahead. On balance, we expect a gradual and halting recovery in the U.S. economy but could also continued high unemployment, so that consumers will be price-sensitive and cautious. Labor costs will be subdued, and the Federal Reserve will be motivated to keep interest rates low even at the risk of unwelcome inflation. We are concerned that capital markets remain vulnerable to shocks, such as we saw last year with the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and as we may see this year. Perhaps following the headlines in the Middle East or perhaps in response to the financial strait to state and federal government. 
So with that as backdrop, our first priority is to maximize revenue by maintaining high occupancy and working to increase rental rates. Now I've read the peer reports and the projections of data providers and some are more optimistic than I am. If they prove correct, and I hope they are, I expect AIMCO rent increases will track their projections. But we are not, at least not yet, projecting such large increases, and so we are making our plans assuming that the road remains a little bumpy. 
As a result, our second priority is continued strict cost control, both at our properties, where we're managing costs quite carefully, and off-site where we continue to reduce costs, including G&A by deploying labor saving technology and by simplifying our business. For example, liquidating non-core activities and reducing the number of partnerships and their related expenses. 
Notwithstanding our cost discipline, we plan to continue and even increase substantial repairs and maintenance spending and also to increase the number of revenue enhancing capital projects so that our properties are in a good position to attract whatever rent increases may be available. Along the same lines, we expect to ramp up our redevelopment activity with a handful of redevelopment starts later in the year. We expect to strengthen our balance sheet by avoiding recourse debt, reducing refunding risk by extending the duration of our debt, already 1/3 longer than the peer average, taking advantage of today's interest rate to lower our cost of leverage and reducing leverage overall by embracing the discipline of property debt amortization. 
We are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities in our target markets and regularly underwrite properties and make offers to buy them. But for the time being, we see more attractive investment opportunities within our existing portfolio. In tender and merger activities within our partnerships and in property upgrades and the redevelopment of properties we already own. In sum, our theme is more, steady as she goes, than happy days are here again. As the economy does accelerate, as we all hope, we'll be ready and in a good position to participate fully. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, AIMCO's Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

On today's call, I'll cover the following subjects: first, our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010; second, our balance sheet; and third, I'll provide first quarter and full year 2011 guidance. As to",1246,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I'll cover the following subjects: first, our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010; second, our balance sheet; and third, I'll provide first quarter and full year 2011 guidance. 
As to operating results, fourth quarter and full year total portfolio NOI, total Same Store NOI and Conventional Same Store NOI were all positive year-over-year. Specifically, total Same Store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable Same Store, was up 6.1% for the quarter and up 80 basis points for the year. The components of total Same Store include Conventional and Affordable properties. Conventional Same Store NOI was up 5% for the quarter and up 20 basis points for the year. Affordable Same Store NOI was up 15.3% for the quarter and up 4.8% for the year. 
For our Conventional Same Store properties, rates on new leases during the quarter were, on average, 90 basis points higher than expiring lease rates, making the fourth quarter the first time since the second quarter 2008 that new lease rates were positive on a lease-to-lease basis. Rates on renewal leases during the quarter were on average 1.6% higher than expiring lease rates.
Conventional Same Store expenses were down 3.7% for the quarter, primarily due to adjustment of previously estimated real estate taxes, after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter. Controllable operating expenses such as personnel costs, marketing and turnover were also lower than fourth quarter 2009, while we have continued to increase spending to upgrade our properties. 
For the year, Conventional Same Store expenses were down 1%, primarily due to lower real estate taxes with controllable operating expenses essentially flat. Regarding January 2011, average daily occupancy for our Conventional Same Store portfolio was 96.4% and new lease rates were up 1.4% from expiring lease rates, while renewal rates were up 2.5% from expiring lease rates. Overall, year-over-year monthly revenue growth has been positive since August. The January 2011 revenues up 2.1% from January last year. 
As to FFO, fourth quarter pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily as a result of property operating income of $0.05 per share above expectations, including $0.04 for Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and property tax adjustments that were not contemplated in guidance and $0.01 from Affordable property operations due to higher average rates. These favorable results partially offset by the write-off of uncollectible fees, which totaled $0.02 per share.
Turning to our balance sheet. With our term debt fully repaid in July, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit was undrawn at December 31 when its available capacity was $260 million. We have no property debt maturities during the first quarter. 
For the full year, we have $105 million of property debt maturing. Of this amount, $79 million occurs in the second quarter, which loan we rate locked in the third quarter of 2010 and will be refinanced this quarter. The loan is a seven-year fixed-rate loan at a rate of 3.56%. The remaining $26 million of maturities represents four loans that were refinanced in the ordinary course during the year. 
We will continue our efforts to look for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2015 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risk and to take advantage of current interest rates. And we remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 billion per year over the next few years. 
During the fourth quarter, we issued 600,000 shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $24.50 per share, generating $14 million in proceeds. This cash was used to complete two partnership merger transactions. And finally, we announced on Wednesday, that our Board of Directors has declared a $0.12 per share quarterly dividend, which represents a 20% increase. 
Looking ahead to 2011 for the year, FFO was projected to range from $1.46 per share to $1.56 per share. Page 6 of our release includes a reconciliation of 2010 FFO to 2011 guidance at the midpoint. Specifically $0.13 per share increase from operations due to higher rates; $0.09 per share in lower offsite costs, including G&A; and $0.02 per share in lower preferred stock dividends. These positive variances in recurring line items are offset by the following negative variances, which are non-recurring in nature: $0.12 per share from 2010 and 2011 property sales, $0.06 per share due to the impact of refinancing floating rate property debt to fixed rate during 2010 and 2011, $0.05 per share from lowering non-recurring revenue and $0.03 per share due to lower interest income due to reductions in receivables. 
Our particular assumptions for the full year 2011 have been provided in our earnings release and include the following for property operations. We expect total portfolio net operating income, which includes our Conventional Same Store properties, Conventional Redevelopment properties and our Affordable properties to increase year-over-year 2% to 4%. We anticipate year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 2.5% to 4.5%, which includes revenue growth of 2% to 3% and 0.5% to 1.5% increase in expenses.
Within our assumption for revenue growth is the expectation that both the new lease and renewal rental rates will increase 3.6% over expiring leases. Third-party data providers have forecasted in our markets that new lease rates will be up somewhere between 3.1% and 6.2%. As Terry noted earlier, we remain cautious about the overall economy and today projected that our new lease rates will be towards the lower end of the range of third-party estimates. 
However, our performance in 2010 is tracked by third parties, and consistent with our own results, is at the high end of performance amongst our apartment REIT peers. The market turns out to be stronger than we are currently projecting, we are confident we will fully participate in this improvement as we did in 2010. Please refer to Page 5 of our earnings release for additional guidance assumptions, including projections for recurring and non-recurring Investment Management income; offsite costs including G&A; capital expenditures; transaction activities and property debt activity. 
A comment about acquisition and refinancing activity. Our current guidance does not contemplate us completing acquisitions beyond our partnership transactions. However, we have included in guidance $2 million of pursuit cost as we continue to seek additional accretive investment opportunities. Regarding refinancing activity, we are pursuing many opportunities to refund loans maturing in the upcoming years. It may be economic for us to incur prepayment penalties to lock in today's lower interest rate and extend those maturities. Depending on the outcome of our new business effort and refinancing activities, pursuit costs and prepayment penalties may be higher than currently contemplated in guidance. 
Lastly, for the first quarter of 2011, FFO is projected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. Before we take questions, I would like to mention that we will again be hosting several property tours in 2011, the schedule for which is included on Page 6 of this morning's earnings release. If you are interesting in attending one of these events, please contact Elizabeth Coalson to sign up.

We had one for a couple of years, a decade ago and Tom Toomey held that title and one for the last year while Tim Beaudin held that title. In general, what I would say is that over the past few years, we've significantly streamlined and refocused AIMCO and we've done so for several reasons but one benefit has been to substantially reduce offsite costs, including G&A. And that's good, not bad, and generally filled our vacancies by promoting from within. Our senior management team averages eight to 10 years of AIMCO experience, so we're used to working together and it shows that amidst this turnover, we've not missed a beat. In fact, our results have improved vis-à-vis our peers and our G&A has been reduced from 7% of revenue in 2008 to about 4.5% last year."

For us, we had a great thing with the merger and tender activities, we already know the assets. It greatly reduces our underwriting risk. In addition, these activities help to serve to simplify our business, and we're able to reduce overhead as we eliminate added expenses from those partnerships, like audits, tax returns and things like that. Concerning the returns, looking strictly at the real estate, the returns are going to be very similar to what we will be able to get out in the marketplace acquiring assets, but we get that extra benefit of knowing the assets better and also helping to reduce our offsite costs. With that, I'll ask John to comment on cap rates from our sales activity in the fourth quarter."

Regarding real estate taxes for 2011, we're expecting a very slight increase less than 1%. We're looking at the fact that we have some appeals that are still in place for the tax year 2010, even going back further. We're hopeful that will settle favorably and that should help offset any increases that may be coming there. So we think in those two big items, things are flattish. From the utilities perspective, we also think things are going to be pretty good. We've been able to lock in lower utility costs for gas than we had prior year and that's helping to offset increases we are seeing in water costs, as well as in some electric. So in the big three we're feeling pretty good. There's going to be some increases though on our expenses. At our midpoint, we're expecting expenses to go up about 1% and the increase will be driven by our continuing work around repairs and maintenance, and putting our properties in the condition they need to be, working on landscaping, things like that.

So that's net operating income minus capital replacement spending. We extrapolated forward generally along the lines of the data providers. We adjust exit cap rates for reduced revenue growth expectations after the forecast period, and we do that consistently whether we're looking at acquisitions or redevelopments or sales. So that we can compare on an apples-to-apples basis. When we look at that, I would say our dispositions will tend to be higher NOI cap rate, but lower free cash flow IRR for two important reasons. The first is that rental rate growth in the secondary and tertiary markets, as John mentioned, Michigan, for example, is expected to be lower than in the markets in which we're investing. And secondly, capital replacement spending, which we project generally at about $1,200 a unit is a higher element of free cash flow when you're looking at net operating income, when you're looking at lower rent projects, which in the properties we're selling are probably in the $600 to $800 range. Where the properties we're investing in are probably in the $1,000 to $1,300 range.

In looking at it, we were mindful that dividends are very important contributor to shareholder return. They're important to all of us in the room because we all own AIMCO common and appreciate those dividends. The thinking is that we want to be sure or cautious about setting new levels until it's exactly clear where the economy is going to go. So some of my own conservatism or caution about the economy, I think is reflected there. We looked at last year where we paid out about 40% of AFFO, which was about half of the payout rate of the next lowest apartment REIT and felt we're a little bit of amiss of an outlier. And then over time, we would probably want to see that payout ratio increase, but still being at a low payout ratio. We want to be sure that the dividend is predictable going forward. And so it seemed to the board that a 20% increase was a significant step in the direction of increasing our payout ratio and balanced the use of proceeds versus a return to shareholders versus alternate uses within the company."

336458,117982706,114038,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2011",2011-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO. We had a good fourth quarter and a very solid 2010. In a few minutes, Ernie will discuss operating and financial results and provide 2011 guidance. But before I turn the call over to hi",758,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO. We had a good fourth quarter and a very solid 2010. In a few minutes, Ernie will discuss operating and financial results and provide 2011 guidance. But before I turn the call over to him, I'd like to offer my perspective on where AIMCO has been and where we are going. 
As we all know, the last few years have been extremely difficult for the U.S. economy and it's not been an easy time for apartments either. But the apartment business has fared far better than the overall economy. Looking back, here's how AIMCO did. 
Total Same Store income was up 3.7% in 2008, it was down 3.3% in 2009 and it was up 80 basis points last year. In other words, Same Store net operating income was positive for two of the last three years. And taken together, Same Store net operating income over that same three-year period was up 1.1%. So the big picture is we have a steady and improving business, and our conventional Same Store net operating results are better than peer averages for the past one, three and five years. And our conventional Same Store operating margin actually improved during the great recession to better than 61%. 
And during all of this, our balance sheet got better. For example, recourse debt was largely eliminated, costs were lowered, near-term maturities were reduced, liquidity and capacity were increased. These results are quite solid and reflect the hard work and the professionalism of the entire AIMCO team, and they have my admiration and thanks. 
As we turn to the new year, we begin with cautious optimism but also concerned about the pitfalls that may lie ahead. On balance, we expect a gradual and halting recovery in the U.S. economy, but also continued high unemployment, so that consumers will be price-sensitive and cautious, labor costs will be subdued and the Federal Reserve will be motivated to keep interest rates low even at the risk of unwelcome inflation. We are concerned that capital markets remain vulnerable to shocks, such as we saw last year with the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and as we may see this year, perhaps following the headlines in the Middle East or perhaps in response to the financial strait to state and federal governments. 
So with that as backdrop, our first priority is to maximize revenue by maintaining high occupancy and working to increase rental rates. Now I've read the peer reports and the projections of data providers and some are more optimistic than I am. If they prove correct, and I hope they are, I expect AIMCO rent increases will track their projections. But we are not, at least not yet, projecting such large increases, and so we are making our plans assuming that the road remains a little bumpy. 
As a result, our second priority is continued strict cost control, both at our properties, where we're managing costs quite carefully, and off-site where we continue to reduce costs, including G&A by deploying labor saving technology and by simplifying our business. For example, liquidating non-core activities and reducing the number of partnerships and their related expenses. 
Notwithstanding our cost discipline, we plan to continue and even increase substantial repairs and maintenance spending and also to increase the number of revenue enhancing capital projects so that our properties are in a good position to attract whatever rent increases may be available. Along the same lines, we expect to ramp up our redevelopment activity with a handful of redevelopment starts later in the year. 
We expect to strengthen our balance sheet by avoiding recourse debt, reducing refunding risk by extending the duration of our debt, already 1/3 longer than the peer average, taking advantage of today's interest rates to lower our cost of leverage and reducing leverage overall by embracing the discipline of property debt amortization. 
We are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities in our target markets and regularly underwrite properties and make offers to buy them. But for the time being, we see more attractive investment opportunities within our existing portfolio, in tender and merger activities within our partnerships and in property upgrades and the redevelopment of properties we already own. 
In sum, our theme is more, steady as she goes, than happy days are here again. As the economy does accelerate, as we all hope, we'll be ready and in a good position to participate fully. With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, AIMCO's Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: first, our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010; second, our balance sheet; and third, I'll provide first quarter and full year 2011 guidance. As t",1254,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: first, our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010; second, our balance sheet; and third, I'll provide first quarter and full year 2011 guidance. 
As to operating results, fourth quarter and full year total portfolio NOI, total Same Store NOI and Conventional Same Store NOI were all positive year-over-year. Specifically, total Same Store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable Same Store, was up 6.1% for the quarter and up 80 basis points for the year. 
The components of total Same Store include Conventional and Affordable properties. Conventional Same Store NOI was up 5% for the quarter and up 20 basis points for the year. Affordable Same Store NOI was up 15.3% for the quarter and up 4.8% for the year. For our Conventional Same Store properties, rates on new leases during the quarter were, on average, 90 basis points higher than expiring lease rates, making the fourth quarter the first time since the second quarter 2008 that new lease rates were positive on a lease-to-lease basis. Rates on renewal leases during the quarter were on average 1.6% higher than expiring lease rates. 
Conventional Same Store expenses were down 3.7% for the quarter, primarily due to adjustment of previously estimated real estate taxes, after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter. Controllable operating expenses such as personnel costs, marketing and turnover were also lower than fourth quarter 2009, while we have continued to increase spending to upgrade our properties. For the year, Conventional Same Store expenses were down 1%, primarily due to lower real estate taxes with controllable operating expenses essentially flat. 
Regarding January 2011, average daily occupancy for our Conventional Same Store portfolio was 96.4% and new lease rates were up 1.4% from expiring lease rates, while renewal rates were up 2.5% from expiring lease rates. Overall, year-over-year monthly revenue growth has been positive since August, with January 2011 revenues up 2.1% from January last year. 
As to FFO. Fourth quarter pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily as a result of property operating income of $0.05 per share above expectations, including $0.04 for Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and property tax adjustments that were not contemplated in guidance and $0.01 from Affordable property operations due to higher average rates. These favorable results were partially offset by the write-off of uncollectible fees, which totaled $0.02 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. With our term debt fully repaid in July, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit was undrawn at December 31 when its available capacity was $260 million. We have no property debt maturities during the first quarter. 
For the full year, we have $105 million of property debt maturing. Of this amount, $79 million occurs in the second quarter, which loan we rate locked in the third quarter of 2010 and will be refinanced this quarter. The loan is a seven-year fixed-rate loan at a rate of 3.56%. The remaining $26 million of maturities represents four loans that we will refinance in the ordinary course during the year. 
We will continue our efforts to look for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2015 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risk and to take advantage of current interest rates. And we remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 billion per year over the next few years. 
During the fourth quarter, we issued 600,000 shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $24.50 per share, generating $14 million in proceeds. This cash was used to complete two partnership merger transactions. And finally, we announced on Wednesday that our board of directors has declared a $0.12 per share quarterly dividend, which represents a 20% increase. 
Looking ahead to 2011 for the year, FFO was projected to range from $1.46 per share to $1.56 per share. Page 6 of our release includes a reconciliation of 2010 FFO to 2011 guidance at the midpoint. Specifically $0.13 per share increase from operations due to higher rates; $0.09 per share in lower offsite costs, including G&A; and $0.02 per share in lower preferred stock dividends. These positive variances in recurring line items are offset by the following negative variances, which are non-recurring in nature: $0.12 per share from 2010 and 2011 property sales, $0.06 per share due to the impact of refinancing floating rate property debt to fixed rate during 2010 and 2011, $0.05 per share from lowering non-recurring revenue and $0.03 per share due to lower interest income due to reductions in receivables. 
Our particular assumptions for the full year 2011 have been provided in our earnings release and include the following for property operations. We expect total portfolio net operating income, which includes our Conventional Same Store properties, Conventional Redevelopment properties and our Affordable properties to increase year-over-year 2% to 4%. We anticipate year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 2 1/2% to 4 1/2%, which includes revenue growth of 2% to 3% and a 1/2% to 1 1/2% increase in expenses. 
Within our assumption for revenue growth is the expectation that both the new lease and renewal rental rates will increase 3.6% over expiring leases. Third-party data providers have forecasted in our markets that new lease rates will be up somewhere between 3.1% and 6.2%. As Terry noted earlier, we remain cautious about the overall economy and today project that our new lease rates will be towards the lower end of the range of third-party estimates. However, our performance in 2010 is tracked by third parties, and consistent with our own results, is at the high end of performance amongst our apartment REIT peers. If the market turns out to be stronger than we are currently projecting, we are confident we will fully participate in this improvement as we did in 2010. 
Please refer to Page 5 of our earnings release for additional guidance assumptions, including projections for recurring and non-recurring Investment Management income; offsite costs including G&A; capital expenditures; transaction activities and property debt activity. A comment about acquisition and refinancing activity. Our current guidance does not contemplate us completing acquisitions beyond our partnership transactions. However, we have included in guidance $2 million of pursuit cost as we continue to seek additional accretive investment opportunities. Regarding refinancing activity, we are pursuing many opportunities to refund loans maturing in the upcoming years. It may be economic for us to incur prepayment penalties to lock in today's lower interest rate and extend those maturities. Depending on the outcome of our new business effort and refinancing activities, pursuit costs and prepayment penalties may be higher than currently contemplated in guidance. Lastly, for the first quarter of 2011, FFO is projected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. Before we take questions, I would like to mention that we will again be hosting several property tours in 2011, the schedule for which is included on Page 6 of this morning's earnings release.

He'll do a great job for Blackstone. We'll miss him here. We don't plan to fill that position. We'll just flatten the organization; historically AIMCO has not had a Chief Operating Officer. We had one for a couple of years, a decade ago and Tom Toomey held that title and one for the last year while Tim Beaudin held that title. In general, what I would say is that over the past few years, we've significantly streamlined and refocused AIMCO and we've done so for several reasons but one benefit has been to substantially reduce offsite costs, including G&A. And that's good, not bad, and generally filled our vacancies by promoting from within. Our senior management team averages eight to 10 years of AIMCO experience, so we're used to working together and it shows that amidst this turnover, we've not missed a beat. In fact, our results have improved vis-à-vis our peers and our G&A has been reduced from 7% of revenue in 2008 to about 4.5% last year."

We expect to finish most of our merger and tender activity within 2011, and we laid that out in our guidance, is what we think those expectations were in terms of the amount of assets. For us, we had a great thing with the merger and tender activities, we already know the assets. It greatly reduces our underwriting risk. In addition, these activities help to serve to simplify our business, and we're able to reduce overhead as we eliminate added expenses from those partnerships, like audits, tax returns and things like that. Concerning the returns, looking strictly at the real estate, the returns are going to be very similar to what we will be able to get out in the marketplace acquiring assets, but we get that extra benefit of knowing the assets better and also helping to reduce our offsite costs. With that, I'll ask John to comment on cap rates from our sales activity in the fourth quarter."

Offsetting that is some of the activity in our other Conventional portfolio and we really don't have much in the Redevelopment portfolio today. So it's not really driven by that. In our other Conventional portfolio, which consists of our New York assets, we do have some revenue decreases. We have one large tenant, commercial tenant that we expect to have to spend some time trying to fill that spot during 2011.

The big food groups being personnel, being real estate taxes and being utilities for us. Personnel we think is going to be on the flattish side, and as Terry talked about, we have some opportunities with the technology initiative and taking into account that we had merit increases in 2010. We think we can find ways to staff more efficiently across our portfolio to keep personnel costs relatively flat. Regarding real estate taxes for 2011, we're expecting a very slight increase less than 1%. We're looking at the fact that we have some appeals that are still in place for the tax year 2010, even going back further. We're hopeful that will settle favorably and that should help offset any increases that may be coming there. So we think in those two big items, things are flattish. From the utilities perspective, we also think things are going to be pretty good. We've been able to lock in lower utility costs for gas than we had prior year and that's helping to offset increases we are seeing in water costs, as well as in some electric. So in the big three we're feeling pretty good. There's going to be some increases though on our expenses. At our midpoint, we're expecting expenses to go up about 1% and the increase will be driven by our continuing work around repairs and maintenance, and putting our properties in the condition they need to be, working on landscaping, things like that. So net-net, with the big three, Andy, kind of be in the flattish range we feel pretty good that we can keep expenses under control in 2011."

So that's net operating income minus capital replacement spending. We extrapolated forward generally along the lines of the data providers. We adjust exit cap rates for reduced revenue growth expectations after the forecast period, and we do that consistently whether we're looking at acquisitions or redevelopments or sales. So that we can compare on an apples-to-apples basis. When we look at that, I would say our dispositions will tend to be higher NOI cap rate, but lower free cash flow IRR for two important reasons. The first is that rental rate growth in the secondary and tertiary markets, as John mentioned, Michigan, for example, is expected to be lower than in the markets in which we're investing. And secondly, capital replacement spending, which we project generally at about $1,200 a unit is a higher element of free cash flow when you're looking at net operating income, when you're looking at lower rent projects, which in the properties we're selling are probably in the $600 to $800 range. Where the properties we're investing in are probably in the $1,000 to $1,300 range.

In looking at it, we were mindful that dividends are very important contributor to shareholder return. They're important to all of us in the room because we all own AIMCO common and appreciate those dividends. The thinking is that we want to be sure or cautious about setting new levels until it's exactly clear where the economy is going to go. So some of my own conservatism or caution about the economy, I think is reflected there. We looked at last year where we paid out about 40% of AFFO, which was about half of the payout rate of the next lowest apartment REIT and felt we're a little bit of amiss of an outlier. And then over time, we would probably want to see that payout ratio increase, but still being at a low payout ratio. We want to be sure that the dividend is predictable going forward. And so it seemed to the board that a 20% increase was a significant step in the direction of increasing our payout ratio and balanced the use of proceeds versus a return to shareholders versus alternate uses within the company."

In a few minutes, Ernie will review the details but before he reports on the quarter, I'd like to touch on four longer-term issues. First, customer demand is good and we expect it to remain so. We enjoy high occupancies and rising rents. Our rent increases during the first quarter were lower than some of our peers but so too were our vacancy losses and term costs. We regularly review the trade-off between high rents and vacancy loss and term costs and we'll continue to look for the right balance. 
Second, we're focused on our operating cost structure. We do not expect to see cost drop year-over-year to the extent they did this quarter but we do expect to control any increase by regular review of what work is done where and by whom and with what tools. 
Third, we're equally focused on our offsite cost including G&A, where we see steady improvement as we continue to simplify the Aimco business. Fourth, we like our balance sheet for its long duration, limited recourse to Aimco credit at fixed rates. We see opportunities to improve it and expect to do so even if we incur current costs, for example in prepayment penalties, or in accepting higher fixed rates that are above our current floating rate. 
We had a solid first quarter and these excellent results were produced by my hard-working, professional and collaborative teammates and I want to be sure that all credit and my thanks is paid to them. Now, for the first quarter, Ernie?"
336458,129487159,119816,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects. First, our first quarter financial and operating results. Second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide second quarter guidance and update full year 2011 project",1176,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects. First, our first quarter financial and operating results. Second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide second quarter guidance and update full year 2011 projections. First, financial results. First quarter pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to better-than-expected property operating results. At the property operations, as shown on the table in Page 2 of our earnings release, total portfolio NOI was up 7.6% year-over-year. Revenues across our total portfolio were up 1.9% while expense decreased 5.8%. Total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 8.5% year-over-year, with Conventional Same Store up 7.2% and Affordable Same Store up 17.8%. I will speak to the performance of our Affordable Same Store portfolio in a moment, but first, I will run through the particulars on the Conventional Same Store portfolio. 
Conventional Same Store revenue was up 1.6% higher than first quarter 2010, with gains in both occupancy and rate. Year-over-year rate growth of 60 basis points reflects both the earning of leases executed during prior quarters and rate increases on leases expiring during the current quarter. Income Conventional Property rental rates by comparing on a lease-by-lease basis the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same unit. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease or a vacant unit leased to a new customer or a renewal of an existing lease. Under this methodology, rates on Aimco's new leases during the quarter averaged 1.9% higher than expiring lease rates. Results by month were January up 1.4%, February up 1.6% and March up 2.4%. April is coming in currently up 3.5%. Rates on renewal leases during the quarter averaged 3% above expiring lease rates. Results by month were January up 2.5%, February up 3.4% and March up 3.0%. April is coming currently up 3.3%. 
Turning to expenses, during the first quarter, Conventional Same Store expenses were down 6.6% or $5 million as a result of reductions in nearly every expense category. Specifically, on-site payroll was down $1.8 million or nearly 10%. Half of this result was achieved from productivity gains, while the other half was due to the timing of bonus accruals in 2010. Real estate taxes were down $1.7 million, also nearly 10% due to adjustments in previously estimated real estate taxes, mainly from prior years after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter. In utilities, we're down approximately $0.5 million or about 3.5%. On a combined basis, these 3 expense categories account for nearly 70% of Aimco's property operating expenses and they were down a combined $4 million or nearly 8%. Across the remaining expense categories, costs were down about $1 million or about 4%. While some portion of the expense savings achieved during the quarter are expected to be of a longer-term benefit, we do expect that the year-over-year increase in operating expenses during the balance of 2011, expected expenses for the full year will be about flat to last year. 
A couple of quick comments about affordable property revenue trends. As you will see on Page 2 of this morning's earnings release, first quarter Affordable Same Store revenue growth was 5.5% compared to the first quarter of 2010. This unusually high growth rate is primarily the result of favorable rent adjustments on a handful of our larger affordable properties. In some cases, the adjustments were retroactive to parts of the fourth quarter of 2010, so we recognized about $100,000 of primary revenue in the first quarter related to last year. The bigger drivers of revenue growth during the quarter were rent adjustments related to the current year, which drove Affordable Same Store revenue up 4.2% from prior year. We also saw gains from higher occupancies and lower bad debt, which increased revenue 0.8% from prior year. 
Looking forward to the remainder of 2011, we should expect to see revenue growth for the Affordable Same Store portfolio to normalize to about 4%. Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse debt obligation is a revolving line of credit, which other than to collateralized letters of credits, was undrawn at March 31 when its available capacity was $253 million. During the first quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our 2011 property debt maturity exposure by $90 million, leaving just $14 million of maturities during the balance of the year. We also reduced our 2012 property debt maturity exposure by $105 million or 25%. During the first quarter, before tendering sales activity, we reduced our share property debt by $30 million, with $20 million of scheduled amortization and $10 million from refinancing activity where all loans are replaced by new loans on a net basis at lower balances. You'll find the details of our refinancing activity on supplemental schedule 4 of our earnings release. 
We continue to look for opportunities to reduce refunding risks and to take advantage of current interest rates. To this end, we are considering potential transactions that allow us to extend maturities, lock in lower interest rates and possibly reduce debt balances. Some of these transactions, which may or may not close, are expected to include prepayment penalties that are not currently contemplated in FFO guidance. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, year-to-date, Aimco has issued 1.5 million shares under its ATM at a weighted average price of $24.69 per share, generating risk proceeds of $37 million. The proceeds from the ATM offering were used primarily to fund leveraging activities in partnership merger transactions. Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.49 to $1.59 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share at both ends of our range. We are also increasing full year guidance for Conventional Same Store NOI from a range of 2.5% to 4.5% to now a range of 3% to 5%, which is driven by a reduction in expense growth expectations based on first quarter results. We expect full year total portfolio NOI wide growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 4.5%, which reflects the 50 basis point increase in the Conventional Same Store NOI guidance. For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. We expect revenue growth to improve on a year-over-year basis from the first quarter while expenses will increase somewhat on a year-over-year basis as I described earlier. Before we take questions, I would like to remind folks that we will again be hosting several property tours in 2011, the schedule for which is included on Page 5 of this morning's press release. If you are interested in attending one of these events, please contact Elizabeth Coalson to sign up. With that, we will now open up the call for questions.

And then I take it back to as we rank and create those quartiles, if you will, internally for what we want to sell. We're really doing it in a free cash flow basis. We are primarily modeling off of free cash flow IRR. We report and schedule an NOI cap rates on these premium margin properties and free cash flow cap rates -- we calculate on these properties for less than half of what's recorded as an NOI cap rate. And so as we look at going forward and what we're looking at, yes you will periodically see a higher cap rate on an NOI basis as we continue to sell at the bottom of the portfolio. We want to sell our lower rent properties, our lower margin properties. These are outliers and if you will, we're weaving the garden and we'll continue to weave the garden as we progress through the year. And that's basically the story on the disposition side.

In real estate taxes, we saw savings of almost 10%. It was about $1.7 million. In on-site payroll, we saw savings of almost 10% as well, about $1.8 million. What I will tell you is in real estate taxes, most of that was in our success that we really started over the last many quarters on appealing assessments for 2009 and 2010. So and we hopefully still have some wood to chop there in terms of getting to the remainder of those in the field and we'll look very closely at what comes across in 2011 with regards to the new assessments. On the onsite payroll, about half of that was really through productivity initiatives, including our technology initiatives, which we at this point rollout. It's about a third of our portfolio in the conventional size. So upside ruled it out for the rest of the portfolio. The other half of the payroll savings come through is the timing of accrual with it for compensation for bonus in 2010. So that was really onetime benefit here in the first quarter that won't carry forward for us. Utilities, they jump around but we were able to lock in lower GAAP price of this year. We do see water prices going in the opposite directions. Those are going up but the consumption was down a little bit in the first quarter just because of what the weather was like in our portfolio. So it's hard to predict how that's going to be going forward. And we saw savings across many other areas, including places like marketing. And marketing for the last many quarters continues to show year-over-year variance in a positive way. We're probably running out of a little room there. That number's getting smaller and smaller in terms of how our spend is but it's much more efficient. But overall, we see the opportunity at the property level, Mike and continue to have good expense performance and the wild card going forward will be a little bit real estate taxes. That project will become more pressure point as we get later in the 2011 and into 2012. Overall, in G&A, we talked about the technology initiatives at the property technology initiatives here at corporate office and those are only about halfway through. We provide the guidance this year that we expect G&A to be about $60 million. Our run rate in the first quarter was under that. I do expect us to get more to a normalized run rate for the rest of this year. So we should have very good opportunities going into 2012 and 2013 as we kind of finish our technology initiatives. We continue to have more efficiencies in the organization and we talked about it in our earnings release, the fact that we were able to terminate some contracts for Asset Management. We lose a little bit of revenue from that going forward but we also lose excesses. So going forward. So I think we have a good story to tell on the G&A front, Mike, for really the next year or two. Things should continue to improve in terms of the numbers that we're reporting."

We have 2 big relationships or we had 2 big relationships. Now it's down to one. And what we did was we terminated some contracts with someone who were managing a large number of properties for us, property managing. In the first quarter, we recognized a little over $1 million from that termination. Over time, we were in take some of that management fees that were due to us but not all of those. And we were differing those or in effect reserving for those as part of our termination agreement, the folks we are dealing with agreed the past for us. So that's why we saw that onetime good guide $1.3 million in the first quarter. Going back to our guidance, Haendel from the beginning of the year, we had guided to $32 million of Asset Management as well as deferred tax credit amortization. And varied a little bit on our schedule. We expect that's $32 million, $27 million deferred tax credit amortization before taxes, leaving $5 million of what we would expect to have earned in 2011 on Asset Management fees. Within that $5 million, we did bake in the expectation of getting that $1 million that did hit in the first quarter from the termination of this contract. Kind of a long way of saying that run rate going forward and that $1 million a quarter in Asset Management fees. Now, that will definitely shrink over time as we continue to look for opportunities to get out of that business. But based on that number, it might be real material for us to have success there. And of course, we do have the ability to sell those properties and resign from the asset management contracts. Of course, the associated expense will go away from those as well."

To some degree, that was the result of what I would call a little bit of fire, maybe caution or weariness, as they got into the quarter. We saw with the interest rate hiccup back in December just a little bit of caution come in to the buyer universe. They've lower weighted assets that are typically highly leveraged are being sold to local and regional buyers. They generally have some operating experience, they're able to get assumptions from ready, so they can get Conventional financing. But they're a little more sensitive to interest rates and that is true. And as we got into kind of late February time frame, as due diligence period, we're running out on our Q1 deals. We had a few buyers that came in and expressed a little concern. We had some equity that's softened a little bit on that and wanted to retrain price. We felt like from where we were at in our that we would call a disciplined his position approach. We weren't willing to retrain. We were more than happy to hold onto those assets. We felt like the pricing was where it should be. But for those particular assets. So let's have deals fallout that we could have closed in the first quarter if we'd chosen to do so, we frankly chose not to. Since that time, we have seen a little more stability come back into the market where the buyers are again getting just a tad more what I would call aggressive, whether anxious to get a deal tied up a little less tendency to try to retrade.

During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2011 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today. Also we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website. 
Participants on today's call will be Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide opening remarks; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO, who will review first quarter results, our balance sheet and guidance. Also in the room today are John Bezzant, EVP of Transaction; Miles Cortez, Chief Administrative Officer; Keith Kimmel, who runs Property Operations; and Dan Matula, who runs Redevelopment and Construction Services.

We're off to a good start in 2011. In a few minutes, Ernie will review the details, but before he reports on the quarter, I'd like to touch on 4 longer-term issues. First",281,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you on this call for your interest in Aimco. We're off to a good start in 2011. In a few minutes, Ernie will review the details, but before he reports on the quarter, I'd like to touch on 4 longer-term issues. 
First, customer demand is good, and we expect it to remain so. We enjoy high occupancies and rising rents. Our rent increases during the first quarter were lower than some of our peers, but so too were our vacancy loss and term costs. We regularly review the trade-off between higher rents and vacancy loss and term costs. And we'll continue to look for the right balance. 
Second, we're focused on our operating cost structure. We do not expect to see cost drop year-over-year to the extent they did this quarter, but we do expect to control any increase by regular review of what work is done where and by whom and with what tools. 
Third, we're equally focused on our offsite cost, including G&A, where we see steady improvement as we continue to simplify the Aimco business. 
Fourth, we like our balance sheet for its long duration, limited recourse to Aimco credit and fixed rates. We see opportunities to improve it and expect to do so even if we incur current costs, for example in prepayment penalties, or in accepting higher fixed rates that are above our current floating rate. 
We had a solid first quarter. And these excellent results were produced by my hard working, professional and collaborative teammates, and I want to be sure that all credit and my thanks is paid to them. 
Now, for the first quarter. Ernie?"
336458,129487159,120002,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: first, our first quarter financial and operating results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide second quarter guidance and update full year 2011 project",1182,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: first, our first quarter financial and operating results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide second quarter guidance and update full year 2011 projections. 
First, financial results. First quarter pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to better-than-expected property operating results. At the property operations, as shown in the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total portfolio NOI was up 7.6% year-over-year. Revenues across our total portfolio were up 1.9%, while expenses decreased 5.8%. Total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 8.5% year-over-year, with Conventional Same Store up 7.2% and Affordable Same Store up 17.8%. I will speak to the performance of our Affordable Same Store portfolio in a moment, but first, I will run through the particulars on the Conventional Same Store portfolio. 
Conventional Same Store revenue was up 1.6% higher than first quarter 2010, with gains in both occupancy and rate. Year-over-year rate growth of 60 basis points reflects both the earning of leases executed during prior quarters and rate increases on leases expiring during the current quarter. 
Aimco measures changes in Conventional Property rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same unit. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease, where a vacant unit is leased to a new customer or a renewal of an existing lease. Under this methodology, rates on Aimco's new leases during the quarter averaged 1.9% higher than expiring lease rates. Results by month were: January, up 1.4%; February, up 1.6%; and March, up 2.4%. April is coming in currently, up 3.5%. Rates on renewal leases during the quarter averaged 3% above expiring lease rates. Results by month were: January, up 2.5%; February, up 3.4%; and March, up 3.0%. April is coming currently, up 3.3%. 
Turning to expenses, during the first quarter, Conventional Same Store expenses were down 6.6% or $5 million, as a result of reductions in nearly every expense category. Specifically, on-site payroll was down $1.8 million or nearly 10%. Half of this result was achieved from productivity gains, while the other half was due to the timing of bonus accruals in 2010. Real estate taxes were down $1.7 million, also nearly 10%, due to adjustment of previously estimated real estate taxes, mainly from prior years after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter. 
In utilities, we're down approximately $0.5 million or about 3.5%. On a combined basis, these 3 expense categories account for nearly 70% of Aimco's property operating expenses, and they were down a combined $4 million or nearly 8%. Across the remaining expense categories, costs were down about $1 million or about 4%. While some portion of the expense savings achieved during the quarter are expected to be of a longer term benefit, we do expect to see year-over-year increases in operating expenses during the balance of 2011. Expected expenses for the full year will be about flat to last year. 
A couple of quick comments about Affordable property revenue trends. As you will see on Page 2 of this morning's earnings release, first quarter Affordable Same Store revenue growth was 5.5% compared to the first quarter of 2010. This unusually high growth rate is primarily the result of favorable rent adjustments on a handful of our larger Affordable properties. In some cases, those adjustments were retroactive to parts of the fourth quarter of 2010, so we recognized about $100,000 of prior year revenue in the first quarter related to last year. The bigger drivers of revenue growth during the quarter were rent adjustments related to the current year, which drove Affordable Same Store revenue up 4.2% from prior year. We also saw gains from higher occupancies and lower bad debt, which increased the revenue 0.8% from prior year. 
Looking forward to the remainder of 2011, we should expect to see revenue growth for the Affordable Same Store portfolio to normalize to about 4%. Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse debt obligation is a revolving line of credit, which other than, to collateralize letters of credits, was undrawn at March 31 when its available capacity was $253 million. During the first quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our 2011 property debt maturity exposure by $90 million, leaving just $14 million of maturities during the balance of the year. We also reduced our 2012 property debt maturity exposure by $105 million or 25%. 
During the first quarter, before tender and sales activity, we reduced our share property debt by $30 million, with $20 million of scheduled amortization and $10 million from refinancing activity, where old loans are replaced with new loans on a net basis at lower balances. You'll find the details of our refinancing activity on Supplemental Schedule 4 of our earnings release. 
We continue to look for opportunities to reduce refunding risks and to take advantage of current interest rates. To this end, we are considering potential transactions that allow us to extend maturities, lock in lower interest rates and possibly reduce debt balances. Some of these transactions, which may or may not close, are expected to include prepayment penalties that are not currently contemplated in FFO guidance. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, year-to-date, Aimco has issued 1.5 million shares under its ATM at a weighted average price of $24.69 per share, generating risk proceeds of $37 million. The proceeds from the ATM offering were used primarily to fund deleveraging activities in partnership merger transactions. 
Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.49 to $1.59 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share at both ends of our range. We are also increasing full year guidance for Conventional Same Store NOI from a range of 2.5% to 4.5%, to now a range of 3% to 5%, which is driven by a reduction in expense growth expectations based on first quarter results. We expect full year total portfolio NOI growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 4.5%, which reflects the 50 basis point increase in Conventional Same Store NOI guidance. 
For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. We expect revenue growth to improve on a year-over-year basis from the first quarter while expenses will increase somewhat on a year-over-year basis as I described earlier. 
Before we take questions, I would like to remind folks that we will again be hosting several property tours in 2011. The schedule for which is included on Page 5 of this morning's earning's release. If you are interested in attending one of these events, please contact Elizabeth Coalson to sign up.

I then take you back to, as we rank and create those quartiles, if you will, internally for what we want to sell, we're really doing it on a free cash flow basis. We are primarily modeling off of a free cash flow, IRR. We report in Schedule 8, an NOI cap rates on these premium low margin properties. And free cash flow cap rates, in fact, free cash flow cap rate that we calculate on these properties is less than half of what's reported as an NOI cap rate. And so as we look at going forward and what we're looking at, yes you will periodically see a high cap rate on an NOI basis as we continue to sell off the bottom of the portfolio. We want to sell our lower rent properties, our lower margin properties. These are outliers, and if you will, we're weeding the garden. And we'll continue to weed the garden as we progress through the year. And that's basically the story on the disposition side.

And specifically, at the property level, we saw expense savings across almost all of our categories. In real estate taxes, we saw savings of almost 10%. It was at $1.7 million. In onsite payroll, we saw savings of almost 10% as well, about $1.8 million. What I'll tell you is that on real estate taxes, most of that was in our success that we've really started over the last many quarters on appealing assessments for 2009 and 2010. And we still hopefully -- we still have some wood chop -- to chop there, in terms of getting to the remainder of those appeals. And of course, we're going to look very closely at what comes across in 2011 with regards to the new assessments. On the onsite payroll, about half of that was really through productivity initiatives, including our technology initiative, which at this point, Mike, we've only rolled out to about a third of our portfolio on the Conventional side. So we still have some upside as we roll that out to the rest of our portfolio. The other half of the payroll savings did come through to the timing of accrual that hit for compensation for bonus in 2010. So that was really a onetime benefit here in the first quarter that won't carry forward for us. Utilities, they jump around, but we were able to lock in lower GAAP prices this year. We do see water and sewer prices going in the opposite direction. Those are going up, but consumption was down a little bit in the first quarter just because of what the weather was like in our portfolio. So that's obviously hard to predict how that's going to be going forward. And then we saw savings across many other areas, including places like marketing. Marketing, for the last many quarters, continues to show year-over-year variance in a positive way. We're probably running out of a little bit of room there. That number's getting smaller and smaller in terms of how our spend is because it's much more efficient. But overall, we see the opportunity at the property level, Mike, to continue to have good expense performance. And the wild card going forward will be a little bit real estate taxes. Because that will probably become more pressure point as we get into later 2011 and in 2012. Overall for G&A -- and we've talked about the technology initiatives at the property. But we also have technology initiatives here at the corporate office, and those are only about halfway through. So we provide the guidance this year that we expect G&A to be about $60 million. Our run rate in the first quarter was under that. I do expect us to get back more to a normalized run rate for the rest of this year. So we should have very good opportunities going into 2012 and 2013 as we finish our technology initiatives. We continue to have more efficiencies in the organization, and we talked about in our earnings release, the fact that, we were able to terminate some contracts for asset management. We'll lose a little bit of revenue from that going forward, but we also lose expenses associated with that going forward. So I think we're going to have a good story to tell on the G&A front, Mike, for really next year or two. Things should continue to improve in terms of the numbers that we're reporting."

We have 2 big relationships or we had 2 big relationships. Now it's down to one. And what we did was we terminated some contracts with someone who were asset managing a large number of properties for us, as well as property managing those. In the first quarter, we recognized a little over $1 million from that termination. Over time, we were beginning to take [indiscernible] on some of those asset management fees that were due to us, but not all of those. And we were differing those or, in effect, reserving for those. As part of our termination agreement, the folks we are dealing with agreed to pass put ups. So that's why you saw that onetime good guide $1.3 million in the first quarter. Going back to our guidance, Haendel, from the beginning of the year, we had guided to $32 million of asset management as well as deferred tax credit amortization, and varied a little bit. On our Schedule 3, you'll see that we expected about $32 million, $27 million relates to the deferred tax credit amortization before taxes, leaving $5 million of what we would expect to have earned in 2011 on asset management fees. Within that $5 million, we did bake in the expectation of getting that $1 million that did hit in the first quarter from the termination of those contracts. So kind of a long way of saying that our run rate going forward, Haendel, will be about $1 million a quarter in asset management fees. Now, that will definitely shrink over time as we continue to look for opportunities to get out of that business. But based on that number, it's not going to be a real material move for us as we continue to have success there. And of course, we do have the ability to sell those properties and resign from those asset management contracts. Of course, the associated expense will go away from those as well."

On the Affordable side of the business, that cap rate is going to bounce around. But it's going to consistently remain a couple of hundred basis points at minimum, above where you would see comparable Conventional assets trade. And that's primarily just due to structural issues. A lot of what we're trading out on the Affordable side is our low ownership portfolio. A lot of that is small product in very rural areas, a lot of it financed by real development loans, post mark-to-market transactions that have gone through a restructuring with HUD that has limited the cash distributions from the property. And so really, from a valuation standpoint, candidly on what we're selling in the Affordable portfolio and NOI is not the best way to look at value, but we report it to be consistent."

I would tell you looking backwards to the first quarter, we had a fairly quiet quarter, in terms of the number of closings that we had. We closed 2 conventional deals. To some degree, that was the result of, what I would call, a little bit of buyer, maybe caution or weariness as they got into the quarter. We saw with the interest rate hiccup back in December, just a little bit of caution come in to the buyer universe. The lower rate of assets that are typically highly leveraged are being sold to local and regional buyers. They generally have some operating experience, they're able to get assumptions from Fannie and Freddie, so they can get Conventional financing. But they're a little more sensitive with interest rates, and that is true. And as we got into kind of late February time frame, as due diligence period, we're running out on our Q1 deals. We had a few buyers that came in and expressed a little concern. Or we had some equity that softened up a little bit on them and backed out or wanted to retrade price. We felt like, from where we were at in our -- what we would call, a disciplined disposition approach, we weren't willing to retrain. We were more than happy to hold on to those assets. We felt like the pricing was where it should be for those particular assets. And so we let some deals fall out. That we could have closed in the first quarter if we'd chosen to do so, but frankly, chose not to. Since that time, we have seen a little more stability come back into the market where the buyers are again getting just a tad more, what I would call, aggressive, where they're anxious to get a deal tied up, a little less tendency to try to retrade. And we don't have any concerns about our ability to execute the pipeline throughout the remainder of the year."

In a few minutes, Ernie will review the details, but before he reports on the quarter, I'd like to touch on 4 longer-term issues. 
First, customer demand is good, and we expect it to remain so. We enjoy high occupancies and rising rents. Our rent increases during the first quarter were lower than some of our peers, but so too were our vacancy loss and term costs. We regularly review the trade-off between higher rents and vacancy loss and term costs. And we'll continue to look for the right balance. 
Second, we're focused on our operating cost structure. We do not expect to see costs drop year-over-year to the extent they did this quarter, but we do expect to control any increase by regular review of what work is done where and by whom and with what tools. 
Third, we're equally focused on our offsite costs, including G&A, where we see steady improvement as we continue to simplify the Aimco business. 
Fourth, we like our balance sheet for its long duration, limited recourse to Aimco credit and fixed rates. We see opportunities to improve it and expect to do so even if we incur current costs, for example in prepayment penalties, or in accepting higher fixed rates that are above our current floating rate. 
We had a solid first quarter. And these excellent results were produced by my hard working, professional and collaborative teammates, and I want to be sure that all credit and my thanks is paid to them. 
Now, for the first quarter. Ernie?"
336458,129487159,120212,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: first, our first quarter financial and operating results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide second quarter guidance and update full year 2011 project",1182,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: first, our first quarter financial and operating results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide second quarter guidance and update full year 2011 projections. 
First, financial results. First quarter pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to better-than-expected property operating results. At the property operations, as shown in the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total portfolio NOI was up 7.6% year-over-year. Revenues across our total portfolio were up 1.9%, while expenses decreased 5.8%. Total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 8.5% year-over-year, with Conventional Same Store up 7.2% and Affordable Same Store up 17.8%. I will speak to the performance of our Affordable Same Store portfolio in a moment, but first, I will run through the particulars on the Conventional Same Store portfolio. 
Conventional Same Store revenue was up 1.6% higher than first quarter 2010, with gains in both occupancy and rate. Year-over-year rate growth of 60 basis points reflects both the earning of leases executed during prior quarters and rate increases on leases expiring during the current quarter. 
Aimco measures changes in Conventional Property rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same unit. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease, where a vacant unit is leased to a new customer or a renewal of an existing lease. Under this methodology, rates on Aimco's new leases during the quarter averaged 1.9% higher than expiring lease rates. Results by month were: January, up 1.4%; February, up 1.6%; and March, up 2.4%. April is coming in currently, up 3.5%. Rates on renewal leases during the quarter averaged 3% above expiring lease rates. Results by month were: January, up 2.5%; February, up 3.4%; and March, up 3.0%. April is coming currently, up 3.3%. 
Turning to expenses, during the first quarter, Conventional Same Store expenses were down 6.6% or $5 million, as a result of reductions in nearly every expense category. Specifically, on-site payroll was down $1.8 million or nearly 10%. Half of this result was achieved from productivity gains, while the other half was due to the timing of bonus accruals in 2010. Real estate taxes were down $1.7 million, also nearly 10%, due to adjustment of previously estimated real estate taxes, mainly from prior years after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter. 
In utilities, we're down approximately $0.5 million or about 3.5%. On a combined basis, these 3 expense categories account for nearly 70% of Aimco's property operating expenses, and they were down a combined $4 million or nearly 8%. Across the remaining expense categories, costs were down about $1 million or about 4%. While some portion of the expense savings achieved during the quarter are expected to be of a longer term benefit, we do expect to see year-over-year increases in operating expenses during the balance of 2011. Expected expenses for the full year will be about flat to last year. 
A couple of quick comments about Affordable property revenue trends. As you will see on Page 2 of this morning's earnings release, first quarter Affordable Same Store revenue growth was 5.5% compared to the first quarter of 2010. This unusually high growth rate is primarily the result of favorable rent adjustments on a handful of our larger Affordable properties. In some cases, those adjustments were retroactive to parts of the fourth quarter of 2010, so we recognized about $100,000 of prior year revenue in the first quarter related to last year. The bigger drivers of revenue growth during the quarter were rent adjustments related to the current year, which drove Affordable Same Store revenue up 4.2% from prior year. We also saw gains from higher occupancies and lower bad debt, which increased the revenue 0.8% from prior year. 
Looking forward to the remainder of 2011, we should expect to see revenue growth for the Affordable Same Store portfolio to normalize to about 4%. Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which other than to collateralize letters of credits, was undrawn at March 31 when its available capacity was $253 million. During the first quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our 2011 property debt maturity exposure by $90 million, leaving just $14 million of maturities during the balance of the year. We also reduced our 2012 property debt maturity exposure by $105 million or 25%. 
During the first quarter, before tender and sales activity, we reduced our share property debt by $30 million, with $20 million of scheduled amortization and $10 million from refinancing activity, where old loans are replaced with new loans on a net basis at lower balances. You'll find the details of our refinancing activity on Supplemental Schedule 4 of our earnings release. 
We continue to look for opportunities to reduce refunding risks and to take advantage of current interest rates. To this end, we are considering potential transactions that allow us to extend maturities, lock in lower interest rates and possibly reduce debt balances. Some of these transactions, which may or may not close, are expected to include prepayment penalties that are not currently contemplated in FFO guidance. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, year-to-date, Aimco has issued 1.5 million shares under its ATM at a weighted average price of $24.69 per share, generating risk proceeds of $37 million. The proceeds from the ATM offering were used primarily to fund de-leveraging activities and partnership merger transactions. 
Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.49 to $1.59 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share at both ends of our range. We are also increasing full year guidance for Conventional Same Store NOI from a range of 2.5% to 4.5%, to now a range of 3% to 5%, which is driven by a reduction in expense growth expectations based on first quarter results. We expect full year total portfolio NOI growth to be in a range from 2.5% to 4.5%, which reflects the 50 basis point increase in Conventional Same Store NOI guidance. 
For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. We expect revenue growth to improve on a year-over-year basis from the first quarter while expenses will increase somewhat on a year-over-year basis as I described earlier. 
Before we take questions, I would like to remind folks that we will again be hosting several property tours in 2011. The schedule for which is included on Page 5 of this morning's earnings release. If you are interested in attending one of these events, please contact Elizabeth Coalson to sign up.

On our Conventional assets, we sold 2 at $462 average rent. I then take you back to, as we rank and create those quartiles, if you will, internally for what we want to sell, we're really doing it on a free cash flow basis. We are primarily modeling off of a free cash flow, IRR. We report in Schedule 8, an NOI cap rates on these premium low margin properties. And free cash flow cap rates, in fact, free cash flow cap rate that we calculate on these properties is less than half of what's reported as an NOI cap rate. And so as we look at going forward and what we're looking at, yes you will periodically see a high cap rate on an NOI basis as we continue to sell off the bottom of the portfolio. We want to sell our lower rent properties, our lower margin properties. These are outliers, and if you will, we're weeding the garden. And we'll continue to weed the garden as we progress through the year. And that's basically the story on the disposition side. It's a similar story on the Affordable side, a little more color in those deals, if you will, because of the structure and the nature of whatever the Affordable contracts may be are a nature of those properties.

And specifically, at the property level, we saw expense savings across almost all of our categories. In real estate taxes, we saw savings of almost 10%. It was at $1.7 million. In onsite payroll, we saw savings of almost 10% as well, about $1.8 million. What I'll tell you is that on real estate taxes, most of that was in our success that we've really started over the last many quarters on appealing assessments for 2009 and 2010. And we still hopefully -- we still have some wood chop [ph] -- to chop there, in terms of getting to the remainder of those appeals. And of course, we're going to look very closely at what comes across in 2011 with regards to the new assessments. On the onsite payroll, about half of that was really through productivity initiatives, including our technology initiative, which at this point, Mike, we've only rolled out to about a third of our portfolio on the Conventional side. So we still have some upside as we roll that out to the rest of our portfolio. The other half of the payroll savings did come through to the timing of accrual that hit for compensation for bonus in 2010. So that was really a onetime benefit here in the first quarter that won't carry forward for us. Utilities, they jump around, but we were able to lock in lower gas prices this year. We do see water and sewer prices going in the opposite direction. Those are going up, but consumption was down a little bit in the first quarter just because of what the weather was like in our portfolio. So that's obviously hard to predict how that's going to be going forward. And then we saw savings across many other areas, including places like marketing. Marketing, for the last many quarters, continues to show year-over-year variance in a positive way. We're probably running out of a little bit of room there. That number's getting smaller and smaller in terms of how our spend is because it's much more efficient. But overall, we see the opportunity at the property level, Mike, to continue to have good expense performance. And the wild card going forward will be a little bit real estate taxes. Because that will probably become more of a pressure point as we get into later 2011 and in 2012. Overall for G&A -- and we've talked about the technology initiatives at the property. But we also have technology initiatives here at the corporate office, and those are only about halfway through. So we provide the guidance this year that we expect G&A to be about $50 million. Our run rate in the first quarter was under that. I do expect us to get back more to a normalized run rate for the rest of this year. So we should have very good opportunities going into 2012 and 2013 as we finished our technology initiatives. We continue to have more efficiencies in the organization, and we talked about in our earnings release, the fact that we were able to terminate some contracts for asset management. We'll lose a little bit of revenue from that going forward, but we also lose expenses associated with that going forward. So I think we're going to have a good story to tell on the G&A front, Mike, for really the next year or two. Things should continue to improve in terms of the numbers that we're reporting."

We have 2 big relationships or we had 2 big relationships. Now it's down to one. And what we did was we terminated some contracts with someone who were asset managing a large number of properties for us, as well as property managing those. In the first quarter, we recognized a little over $1 million from that termination. Over time, we were getting paid current on some of those asset management fees that were due to us, but not all of those. And we were differing those or, in effect, reserving for those. As part of our termination agreement, the folks we were dealing with agreed to pay us put ups. So that's why you saw that onetime good guide $1.3 million in the first quarter. Going back to our guidance, Haendel, from the beginning of the year, we had guided to $32 million of asset management as well as deferred tax credit amortization, and it varied a little bit. On our Schedule 3, you'll see that we expected about $32 million, $27 million relates to the deferred tax credit amortization before taxes, leaving $5 million of what we would expect to have earned in 2011 on asset management fees. Within that $5 million, we did bake in the expectation of getting that $1 million that did hit in the first quarter from the termination of those contracts. So kind of a long way of saying that our run rate going forward, Haendel, will be about $1 million a quarter in asset management fees. Now, that will definitely shrink over time as we continue to look for opportunities to get out of that business. But based on that number, it's not going to be a real material move for us as we continue to have success there. And of course, we do have the ability to sell those properties and resign from those asset management contracts. Of course, the associated expense will go away from those as well."

On the Affordable side of the business, that cap rate is going to bounce around. But it's going to consistently remain a couple of hundred basis points at minimum, above where you would see comparable Conventional assets trade. And that's primarily just due to structural issues. A lot of what we're trading out on the Affordable side is our low ownership portfolio. A lot of that is small product in very rural areas, a lot of it financed by real development loans, post mark-to-market transactions that have gone through a restructuring with HUD that has limited the cash distributions from the property. And so really, from a valuation standpoint, candidly on what we're selling in the Affordable portfolio and NOI is not the best way to look at value, but we report it to be consistent."

I would tell you looking backwards to the first quarter, we had a fairly quiet quarter, in terms of the number of closings that we had. We closed 2 conventional deals. To some degree, that was the result of, what I would call, a little bit of buyer, maybe caution or weariness, as they got into the quarter. We saw with the interest rate hiccup back in December, just a little bit of caution come in to the buyer universe. The lower rate of assets that are typically highly leveraged are being sold to local and regional buyers. They generally have some operating experience, they're able to get assumptions from Fannie and Freddie, so they can get Conventional financing. But they're a little more sensitive with interest rates, and that is true. And as we got into kind of late February time frame, as due diligence period were running out on our Q1 deals. We had a few buyers that came in and expressed a little concern. Or we had some equity that softened up a little bit on them and backed out or wanted to retrade price. We felt like, from where we were at in our -- what we would call, a disciplined disposition approach, we weren't willing to retrade. We were more than happy to hold on to those assets. We felt like the pricing was where it should be for those particular assets. And so we let some deals fall out. That we could have closed in the first quarter if we'd chosen to do so, but frankly, chose not to. Since that time, we have seen a little more stability come back into the market where the buyers are again getting just a tad more, what I would call, aggressive, where they're anxious to get a deal tied up, a little less tendency to try to retrade. And we don't have any concerns about our ability to execute the pipeline throughout the remainder of the year."

My colleagues and I are pleased by Aimco's second quarter results. Before turning the call over to Ernie, who will discuss in detail these results, I'd like to offer some general observations.
Business is good, and better than I would assume last fall when making plans this year. current revenue reflects caution last year, but this year, run rates have been improving and the rate of increase has been accelerating each of the past 6 months, and this trends continue in July. And higher rates earning, revenues are expected to increase accordingly. 
Keith Kimmel and his team my thanks for this improvement in rental rates. They're also doing a solid job of cost control. Year-to-date, property operating costs are now more than $5 million with savings in every category. And as you could see from guidance, we don't expect the same rate of year-over-year savings in the second half, but our efficiency in technology initiatives are paying off and we expect the cost reduction to be sustainable. We have continued to invest in property maintenance, and property upgrades. 
Ernie and Patti Fielding have done a good job in lengthening our property debt maturities, lowering our cost of leverage, and somewhat lowering our overall leverage. Our off-site cost continue to fall as we simplify and focus our business. These costs are down $8 million or 14% year-over-year with more to come. As we look forward we'd expect further reductions in off-site cost. 
We are pleased with our start of the year and we are optimistic as we turn to the second half and prepare for 2012. We are making plans to ramp up redevelopment spending. In addition to the redevelopment of Lincoln Place and Treetops, we are actively planning for a dozen or so projects, or $100 million to $200 million of spending in 2012, with returns greater than those available today on property acquisitions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, Aimco's Chief Financial Officer, to review second quarter results. Ernie?"

First, second quarter results. Second quarter pro forma FFO was $0.27 per share after a one-time charge of $0.15 per share related to a refinancing of securitization transaction with Freddie Mac that closes during the quarter. At $0.27 per share, pro forma FFO exceeded the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 per share, primarily due to better than expected property operating results. As shown on the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total portfolio NOI was up 5.3% year-over-year. Revenues across our entire portfolio were up 2.6%, while expenses decreased 1.5%. 
Total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 5.1% year-over-year with Conventional Same Store up 4.6% and Affordable Same Store up 8.4%. Total sales to our revenue was up 2.6% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store up 2.4%, and Affordable Same Store up 3.7%.
Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 1.7%, and an increase in average daily occupancy of 0.2%. 
Conventional Same Store new lease rates during the quarter averaged 5.1% higher than expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.8%; May up 4.7%; in June, up 6.6%. July is coming in currently, up 7.2%. 
Rates on renewal leases during the quarter averaged to 3.6% above expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.2%; May, up 3.4%; and June, up 4.1%. July is coming in currently, up 4.4%.
On the expense side, second quarter Conventional Same Store expenses were down $900,000, or 1.3%. As a result of reductions virtually across the board. Specifically, on-site payroll was down $400,000, or more than 2%, primarily as a result of continued productivity gains. In marketing and turnover cost were down the combined $500,000, with greater efficiency of marketing spend and higher customer retention.
Real estate taxes were up $800,000 due to second quarter 2010 adjustment of previously estimated amounts, after successful settlement of appeals during that quarter. However this increase in real estate taxes were entirely offset by lower insurance costs.
Affordable Same Store expenses were down 2.3%, with trends similar to those of our Conventional Same Store properties including lower payroll expenses and higher real estate taxes offset by lower insurance costs. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse set obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term capital needs, and to collateralized letters of credit. As of June 30, the outstanding balance on the line of credit was $21 million and collateralized letters of credit total to $27 million. Leaving us with an available capacity on our line of $252 million. Year-to-date, we had further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $95 million, which includes that refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan pay downs and $51 million of note Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization transact that hold only Aimco property loans.
We continue to make progress in extending our property that maturity in today's low interest rates. As of June 30, $884 million is scheduled to mature during the balance of 2011 through the end of 2014. We're about 6% of our outstanding property debt balance each year. 
We have REIT loss total of $151 million of REIT maturities, which is 17% of our property debt coming due in the next 3.5 years. The weighted average interest rate on the committed loans is 4.37%, or 113 basis points lower below that of the existing loans.
We now July 25th closing the new issuance of perpetual preferred equity, our Class B stock. We issued 800,000 shares with a coupon rate of 7% at $24.25 per share, which equates to an effective yield of 7.216%, or gross proceeds to Aimco of about $19 million and net proceeds of approximately $18.5 million.
Our goal in this new equity issuance was to establish a class of preferred equity at a cost that better reflects today's pricing, and we intend to use these proceeds from the issuance to partially redeem higher costs preferred securities.
Aimco has 4 other classes of preferred equity outstanding with coupon rates of between 7 3/4% and 8%, which generally trades at or near par. These other classes of preferred equity are currently callable which limits the premium in which the shares might trade in light of today's lower cost of preferred equity. We'll continue to monitor the market to see if there's an opportunity to further reduce our preferred equity cost. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet since April 1st, Aimco has issued 1.7 million shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $25.52 per share, generating gross proceeds of $43 million.
The proceeds were used primarily to match fund investment activities and to fund prepayment penalties associated with refinancing activities. Year-to-date, we have issued a total of 2.8 million shares at a weighted average price of $24.59 per share, generating gross proceeds of $71 million.
Finally, looking ahead, we are increasing full-year pro forma FFO guidance made $0.09 per share at the midpoint to a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share. As a reminder, our guidance range includes $0.15 per share of prepayment penalties incurred in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction. 
Our projections for property operations are as follows: For Conventional Same Store, narrowing the range of revenue growth expectations from a range of 2% to 3% to a range of 2.5% to 3%. A decrease in expense growth expectations from essentially flat to a range of down 1% to down 1.5%, which results in NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, compared to our previous growth expectations of 3% of 5%. 
We expect Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 10% to 11% over last year and total same-store NOI growth of 5% to 6%. and across our entire portfolio, we expect for full-year NOI growth to be in the range of 4% to 5%.
Finally, for the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.38 to $0.42 per share with year-over-year total same-store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions  to 2 per time in the queue. Jaimie, I'll turn it over to you for the first questions please."

The second is that homes, even foreclosed homes and rental homes, are not really competitive with professionally managed department. They serve different market segments where customers of different interests and preferences. So what drives demand for our product is unmarried, professional people between the ages of 25 and 35. And that market segment is: one, growing with the baby boom echo, despite the unemployment numbers in the overall economy, the employment rate in that age cohort is actually quite high. I think unemployment stand around 4% for that group. And so we feel pretty good about the demand for product. What I would say is that our B price point we feel somewhat insulated from the volatility of the weak economy, and with the damage of redevelopment versus development, we can always fine tune it or adjust to what we actually find."

The answer to your first question, Eric, around the guidance is simply we had one large one-time item that hit in the second quarter now it's the $0.15 for the prepayment penalties which also included some deferred loan cost in total to the $0.15. I think I saw on your note this morning, you had it the right way. so that's $0.15 to the range to get you to what our numbers would be. And then your second question about why do we exclude some items, we try to the consistent with how we look at it, and in this world there's always it's kind of a gray area it's a one-time item or not. So we've a definition around pro forma FFO that we use for quite some time. We just make it, it's crazy to include operating impairments and not include gains and so we always take those out. And then we just leave anything with the preferred redemption cost to preferred equity cost also very transactional based. We try to do is make it clear on our release though that if there are other material items that are a large come out for folks so that they understand it. what I didn't want to do is rebalanced definition of pro forma FFO with such a large prepayment penalty. This one time around we want to keep some consistency for folks out there so they can have a little more clarity into the numbers."

And so that extra $0.01 or $0.02 should be coming from revenues getting a little better and price on our numbers, we do have an expectation that revenue growth will now be between 2.5% and 3% versus 2% to 30%.

And so whatever we trigger a vacancy, we trigger a certain amount of cost for cleaning the apartment, or refurbishing the apartment in vacancy and marketing costs, so we try to balance it. So some of that lower revenue is offset by lower costs. What you can see in our new lease activity, which as Keith mentioned for this month has a 7 handle, is that customers like our properties and are prepared to pay higher rents.

My colleagues and I are pleased by Aimco's second quarter results. Before turning the call over to Ernie, who will discuss in detail these results, I'd like to offer some general observations.
Business is good and better than I had assumed last fall when making plans for this year. Current revenue reflects caution last year. But this year, run rates have been improving, and the rate of increase has been accelerating during each of the past 6 months. And these trends continue in July. And as these higher rates earn in, revenue is expected to increase accordingly. 
Keith Kimmel and his team in the field have my thanks for this improvement in rental rates. They're also doing a solid job of cost control. Year-to-date, property operating costs are down more than $5 million with savings in every category. And as you can see from guidance, we don't expect the same rate of year-over-year savings in the second half, but our efficiency in technology initiatives are paying off, and we expect the cost reductions to be sustainable. We have continued to invest in property maintenance, and property upgrades. 
Ernie and Patti Fielding have done a good job in lengthening our property debt maturities, lowering our cost of leverage and somewhat lowering our overall leverage. Our off-site costs continue to fall as we simplify and focus our business. These costs are down $8 million, or 14% year-over-year, with more to come. As we look forward, we'd expect further reductions in off-site costs. 
We're pleased with our start to the year, and we are optimistic as we turn to the second half and prepare for 2012. We are making plans to ramp up redevelopment spending. In addition to the redevelopment of Lincoln Place and Treetops, we are actively planning for a dozen or so projects, or $100 million to $200 million of spending in 2012, with returns greater than those available today on property acquisitions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, Aimco's Chief Financial Officer, to review second quarter results. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects. First, our second quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide third quarter guidance and update full year 2011 projections.
First, second quarter results. Second quarter pro forma FFO was $0.27 per share after a one-time charge of $0.15 per share related to a refinancing and securitization transaction with Freddie Mac that closed during the quarter. At $0.27 per share, pro forma FFO exceeded the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 per share, primarily due to better-than-expected property operating results. 
As shown on the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total portfolio NOI was up 5.3% year-over-year. Revenues across our entire portfolio were up 2.6%, while expenses decreased 1.5%. 
Total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 5.1% year-over-year with Conventional Same Store up 4.6% and Affordable Same Store up 8.4%. Total Same store revenue was up 2.6% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store up 2.4%, and Affordable Same Store up 3.7%.
Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 1.7% and an increase in average daily occupancy of 0.2%. Conventional Same Store new lease rates during the quarter averaged 5.1% higher than expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.8%; May, up 4.7%; and June, up 6.6%. July is coming in currently, up 7.2%. 
Rates on renewal leases during the quarter averaged to 3.6% above expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.2%; May, up 3.4%; and June, up 4.1%. July is coming in currently, up 4.4%.
On the expense side, second quarter Conventional Same Store expenses were down $900,000 or 1.3% as a result of reductions virtually across the board. Specifically, on-site payroll was down $400,000, or more than 2%, primarily as a result of continued productivity gains. And marketing and turnover costs were down a combined $500,000, with greater efficiency of marketing spends and higher customer retention.
Real estate taxes were up $800,000 due to a second quarter 2010 adjustment of previously estimated amounts after successful settlement of appeals during that quarter. However, this increase in real estate taxes was entirely offset by lower insurance costs. 
Affordable Same Store expenses were down 2.3%, with trends similar to those of our Conventional Same Store properties including lower payroll expenses and higher real estate taxes offset by lower insurance costs. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse set obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term working capital needs and to collateralized letters of credit. As of June 30, the outstanding balance on the line of credit was $21 million, and collateralized letters of credit total to $27 million, leaving us with an available capacity on our line of $252 million. 
Year-to-date, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $95 million, which includes net refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan pay downs and $51 million of notes Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization trust that holds only Aimco property loans.
We continue to make progress on extending our property debt maturities and locking in today's low interest rates. As of June 30, $884 million is scheduled to mature during the balance of 2011 through the end of 2014.  We're about 6% of our outstanding property debt balance each year. 
We have rate locked a total of $151 million of these maturities, which is 17% of our property debt coming due in the next 3.5 years. The weighted average interest rate on the committed loans is 4.37% or 113 basis points lower below that of the existing loans.
We announced on July 25 the closing of a new issuance of perpetual preferred equity, or Class Z stock. We issued 800,000 shares with a coupon rate of 7% at $24.25 per share, which equates to an effective yield of 7.216%, or gross proceeds to Aimco of about $19 million and net proceeds of approximately $18.5 million.
Our goal in this new equity issuance was to establish a class of preferred equity at a cost that better reflects today's pricing, and we intend to use the proceeds from the issuance to partially redeem higher cost preferred securities.
Aimco has 4 other classes of preferred equity outstanding with coupon rates between 7.75% and 8%, which generally trade at or near par. These other classes of preferred equity are currently callable, which limits the premium at which the shares might trade in light of today's lower cost of preferred equity. We'll continue to monitor the market to see if there's an opportunity to further reduce our preferred equity costs. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, since April 1st, Aimco has issued 1.7 million shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $25.52 per share, generating gross proceeds of $43 million. The proceeds were used primarily to match fund investment activities and to fund prepayment penalties associated with refinancing activities. Year-to-date, we had issued a total of 2.8 million shares at a weighted average price of $24.59 per share, generating gross proceeds of $71 million.
Finally, looking ahead, we are increasing full-year pro forma FFO guidance by $0.09 per share at the midpoint to a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share. As a reminder, our guidance range includes $0.15 per share of prepayment penalties incurred in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction. 
Our projections for property operations are as follows. For Conventional Same Store, narrowing the range of revenue growth expectations from a range of 2% to 3% to a range of 2.5% to 3%. A decrease in expense growth expectations from essentially flat to a range of down 1% to down 1.5%, which results in NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5% compared to our previous growth expectations of 3% of 5%. We expect Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 10% to 11% over last year and total Same Store NOI growth of 5% to 6%. And across our entire portfolio, we expect full year NOI growth to be in a range from 4% to 5%.
Finally, for the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.38 to $0.42 per share with a year-over-year total Same Store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call to questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Jamie, I'll turn it over to you for the first question please."

And obviously, there are lot of variable factors that are considered. But let me just try and pick through the ones you raised. The first, about multi-family starts, is not much over the replacement rate as a number of units are demolished in that magnitude during the year. The second is that homes, even foreclosed homes and rental homes, are not really competitive with professionally managed departments. They serve different market segments where customers have different interests and preferences. So what drives demand for our product is unmarried, professional people between the ages of 25 and 35. And that market segment is one, growing with the baby boom echo. Despite the unemployment numbers in the overall economy, the employment rate in that age cohort is actually quite high. I think unemployment is down around 4% for that group. And so we feel pretty good about the demand for product. What I would say is that at our B price point, we feel somewhat insulated from the volatility of the weak economy. And with the advantage of redevelopment versus development, we can only fine tune it or adjust it to what we actually find."

I mean, are you thinking that you're actually going to get, say, 6% to 8% or 5% to 7% in the back half of the year?"

We earned in $0.07 of our $0.09 increase with regards to our change in our FFO per share guidance from the second quarter and when you look to the midpoint, which means we think the second half of the year is going to be about $0.02 better. It basically held my expense guidance consistent with the second half of the year from where it was in the first half of the year from the last time I gave you guidance. And so that extra $0.01 or $0.02 should be coming from revenues getting a little better and it's used to price on our numbers. We do have an expectation that revenue growth will now be between 2.5% and 3% versus 2% to 3%. Do keep in mind, it's great that this -- this acceleration that Keith is getting. There's an earning to that. And so as excited as we are where the numbers are today, we don't want to get partial credit for that in 2011.

Looking forward, we're doing that same kind of balancing activity, wanting to raise rents were we can but looking at it not just in isolation, but as Keith mentioned, in terms of its contribution. And so whenever we trigger a vacancy, we trigger a certain amount of cost for cleaning the apartment or refurbishing the apartment in vacancy and marketing costs. And so we've tried to balance it. So some of that lower revenue base is offset by lower cost. What you can see in our new lease activity, which as Keith mentioned for this month has a 7 handle, is that customers like our properties, and they are prepared to pay higher rents.

My colleagues and I are pleased by Aimco's second quarter results. Before turning the call over to Ernie, who will discuss in detail these results, I'd like to offer some general observations.
Business is good and better than I had assumed last fall when making plans for this year. Current revenue reflects caution last year. But this year, run rates have been improving, and the rate of increase has been accelerating during each of the past 6 months. And these trends continue in July. And as these higher rates earn in, revenue is expected to increase accordingly. 
Keith Kimmel and his team in the field have my thanks for this improvement in rental rates. They're also doing a solid job of cost control. Year-to-date, property operating costs are down more than $5 million with savings in every category. And as you can see from guidance, we don't expect the same rate of year-over-year savings in the second half, but our efficiency in technology initiatives are paying off and we expect the cost reductions to be sustainable. We have continued to invest in property maintenance and property upgrades. 
Ernie and Patti Fielding have done a good job in lengthening our property debt maturities, lowering our cost of leverage and somewhat lowering our overall leverage. Our off-site costs continue to fall as we simplify and focus our business. These costs are down $8 million, or 14% year-over-year, with more to come. As we look forward, we'd expect further reductions in off-site costs. 
We're pleased with our start to the year, and we are optimistic as we turn to the second half and prepare for 2012. We are making plans to ramp up redevelopment spending. In addition to the redevelopment of Lincoln Place and Treetops, we are actively planning for a dozen or so projects, or $100 million to $200 million of spending in 2012, with returns greater than those available today on property acquisitions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, Aimco's Chief Financial Officer, to review second quarter results. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects. First, our second quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide third quarter guidance and update full year 2011 projections.
First, second quarter results. Second quarter pro forma FFO was $0.27 per share after a one-time charge of $0.15 per share related to a refinancing and securitization transaction with Freddie Mac that closed during the quarter. At $0.27 per share, pro forma FFO exceeded the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 per share, primarily due to better-than-expected property operating results. 
As shown on the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total portfolio NOI was up 5.3% year-over-year. Revenues across our entire portfolio were up 2.6%, while expenses decreased 1.5%. 
Total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 5.1% year-over-year with Conventional Same Store up 4.6% and Affordable Same Store up 8.4%. Total Same Store revenue was up 2.6% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store up 2.4%, and Affordable Same Store up 3.7%.
Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 1.7% and an increase in average daily occupancy of 0.2%. Conventional Same Store new lease rates during the quarter averaged 5.1% higher than expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.8%; May, up 4.7%; and June, up 6.6%. July is coming in currently, up 7.2%. 
Rates on renewal leases during the quarter averaged to 3.6% above expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.2%; May, up 3.4%; and June, up 4.1%. July is coming in currently, up 4.4%.
On the expense side, second quarter Conventional Same Store expenses were down $900,000 or 1.3% as a result of reductions virtually across the board. Specifically, on-site payroll was down $400,000, or more than 2%, primarily as a result of continued productivity gains. And marketing and turnover costs were down a combined $500,000, with greater efficiency of marketing spends and higher customer retention.
Real estate taxes were up $800,000 due to a second quarter 2010 adjustment of previously estimated amounts after successful settlement of appeals during that quarter. However, this increase in real estate taxes was entirely offset by lower insurance costs. 
Affordable Same Store expenses were down 2.3%, with trends similar to those of our Conventional Same Store properties including lower payroll expenses and higher real estate taxes offset by lower insurance costs. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse set obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term working capital needs and to collateralized letters of credit. As of June 30, the outstanding balance on the line of credit was $21 million, and collateralized letters of credit total to $27 million, leaving us with an available capacity on our line of $252 million. 
Year-to-date, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $95 million, which includes net refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan pay downs and $51 million of notes Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization trust that holds only Aimco property loans.
We continue to make progress on extending our property debt maturities and locking in today's low interest rates. As of June 30, $884 million is scheduled to mature during the balance of 2011 through the end of 2014.  We're about 6% of our outstanding property debt balance each year. 
We have rate locked a total of $151 million of these maturities, which is 17% of our property debt coming due in the next 3.5 years. The weighted average interest rate on the committed loans is 4.37% or 113 basis points lower below that of the existing loans.
We announced on July 25 the closing of a new issuance of perpetual preferred equity, or Class Z stock. We issued 800,000 shares with a coupon rate of 7% at $24.25 per share, which equates to an effective yield of 7.216%, or gross proceeds to Aimco of about $19 million and net proceeds of approximately $18.5 million.
Our goal in this new equity issuance was to establish a class of preferred equity at a cost that better reflects today's pricing, and we intend to use the proceeds from the issuance to partially redeem higher cost preferred securities.
Aimco has 4 other classes of preferred equity outstanding with coupon rates between 7.75% and 8%, which generally trade at or near par. These other classes of preferred equity are currently callable, which limits the premium at which the shares might trade in light of today's lower cost of preferred equity. We'll continue to monitor the market to see if there's an opportunity to further reduce our preferred equity costs. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, since April 1st, Aimco has issued 1.7 million shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $25.52 per share, generating gross proceeds of $43 million. The proceeds were used primarily to match fund investment activities and to fund prepayment penalties associated with refinancing activities. Year-to-date, we had issued a total of 2.8 million shares at a weighted average price of $24.59 per share, generating gross proceeds of $71 million.
Finally, looking ahead, we are increasing full-year pro forma FFO guidance by $0.09 per share at the midpoint to a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share. As a reminder, our guidance range includes $0.15 per share of prepayment penalties incurred in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction. 
Our projections for property operations are as follows. For Conventional Same Store, narrowing the range of revenue growth expectations from a range of 2% to 3% to a range of 2.5% to 3%. A decrease in expense growth expectations from essentially flat to a range of down 1% to down 1.5%, which results in NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5% compared to our previous growth expectations of 3% of 5%. We expect Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 10% to 11% over last year and total Same Store NOI growth of 5% to 6%. And across our entire portfolio, we expect full year NOI growth to be in a range from 4% to 5%.

Then we have 2 million homes that are in the foreclosure process that, in some form or another, may present a competition. So you're getting above 200,000 units, call it 250,000 when you kind up aggregate it all up. Then you're hanging your demand hat kind of the homeownership rate continuing to go down.

And obviously, there are lot of variable factors that are considered. But let me just try and pick through the ones you raised. The first, about multi-family starts, is not much over the replacement rate as a number of units are demolished in that magnitude during the year. The second is that homes, even foreclosed homes and rental homes, are not really competitive with professionally managed departments. They serve different market segments where customers have different interests and preferences. So what drives demand for our product is unmarried, professional people between the ages of 25 and 35. And that market segment is one, growing with the baby boom echo. Despite the unemployment numbers in the overall economy, the employment rate in that age cohort is actually quite high. I think unemployment is down around 4% for that group. And so we feel pretty good about the demand for product. What I would say is that at our B price point, we feel somewhat insulated from the volatility of the weak economy. And with the advantage of redevelopment versus development, we can always fine tune it or adjust it to what we actually find."

In new lease rates specifically, just to refresh back to the prepared remarks by Ernie, April came in at 3.8, May at 4.7, June at 6.6. And in fact, we've been tracking a club that we have established at the 10% club. In June, we had 55 communities that actually achieved 10% new lease growth. And so with that being said, we're quite excited about where it's going July. We believe we'll finish in the 7.2 range."

We earned in $0.07 of our $0.09 increase with regards to our change in our FFO per share guidance from the second quarter and when you look to the midpoint, which means we think the second half of the year is going to be about $0.02 better. It basically held my expense guidance consistent with the second half of the year from where it was in the first half of the year from the last time I gave you guidance. And so that extra $0.01 or $0.02 should be coming from revenues getting a little better and it's used to price on our numbers. We do have an expectation that revenue growth will now be between 2.5% and 3% versus 2% to 3%. Do keep in mind, it's great that this -- this acceleration that Keith is getting. There's an earning to that. And so as excited as we are where the numbers are today, we don't want to get partial credit for that in 2011. But it's going to make 2012 take off for us if we can maintain these types of numbers, and that's what we're pushing to do."

Looking forward, we're doing that same kind of balancing activity, wanting to raise rents were we can but looking at it not just in isolation, but as Keith mentioned, in terms of its contribution. And so whenever we trigger a vacancy, we trigger a certain amount of cost for cleaning the apartment or refurbishing the apartment in vacancy and marketing costs. And so we've tried to balance it. So some of that lower revenue base is offset by lower cost. What you can see in our new lease activity, which as Keith mentioned for this month has a 7 handle, is that customers like our properties, and they are prepared to pay higher rents. And as that happens, and as Ernie points as that earns in, our revenue next year will be considerably higher."

My colleagues and I are pleased by Aimco's second quarter results. Before turning the call over to Ernie, who will discuss in detail these results, I'd like to offer some general observations.
Business is good and better than I had assumed last fall when making plans for this year. Current revenue reflects caution last year. But this year, run rates have been improving, and the rate of increase has been accelerating during each of the past 6 months. And these trends continue in July. And as these higher rates earn in, revenue is expected to increase accordingly. 
Keith Kimmel and his team in the field have my thanks for this improvement in rental rates. They're also doing a solid job of cost control. Year-to-date, property operating costs are down more than $5 million with savings in every category. And as you can see from guidance, we don't expect the same rate of year-over-year savings in the second half, but our efficiency in technology initiatives are paying off and we expect the cost reductions to be sustainable. We have continued to invest in property maintenance and property upgrades. 
Ernie and Patti Fielding have done a good job in lengthening our property debt maturities, lowering our cost of leverage and somewhat lowering our overall leverage. Our off-site costs continue to fall as we simplify and focus our business. These costs are down $8 million, or 14% year-over-year, with more to come. As we look forward, we'd expect further reductions in off-site costs. 
We're pleased with our start to the year, and we are optimistic as we turn to the second half and prepare for 2012. We are making plans to ramp up redevelopment spending. In addition to the redevelopment of Lincoln Place and Treetops, we are actively planning for a dozen or so projects, or $100 million to $200 million of spending in 2012, with returns greater than those available today on property acquisitions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, Aimco's Chief Financial Officer, to review second quarter results. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects. First, our second quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide third quarter guidance and update full year 2011 projections.
First, second quarter results. Second quarter pro forma FFO was $0.27 per share after a one-time charge of $0.15 per share related to a refinancing and securitization transaction with Freddie Mac that closed during the quarter. At $0.27 per share, pro forma FFO exceeded the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 per share, primarily due to better-than-expected property operating results. 
As shown on the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total portfolio NOI was up 5.3% year-over-year. Revenues across our entire portfolio were up 2.6%, while expenses decreased 1.5%. 
Total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 5.1% year-over-year with Conventional Same Store up 4.6% and Affordable Same Store up 8.4%. Total Same Store revenue was up 2.6% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store up 2.4%, and Affordable Same Store up 3.7%.
Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 1.7% and an increase in average daily occupancy of 0.2%. Conventional Same Store new lease rates during the quarter averaged 5.1% higher than expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.8%; May, up 4.7%; and June, up 6.6%. July is coming in currently, up 7.2%. 
Rates on renewal leases during the quarter averaged to 3.6% above expiring lease rates. Results by month were: April, up 3.2%; May, up 3.4%; and June, up 4.1%. July is coming in currently, up 4.4%.
On the expense side, second quarter Conventional Same Store expenses were down $900,000 or 1.3% as a result of reductions virtually across the board. Specifically, on-site payroll was down $400,000, or more than 2%, primarily as a result of continued productivity gains. And marketing and turnover costs were down a combined $500,000, with greater efficiency of marketing spends and higher customer retention.
Real estate taxes were up $800,000 due to a second quarter 2010 adjustment of previously estimated amounts after successful settlement of appeals during that quarter. However, this increase in real estate taxes was entirely offset by lower insurance costs. 
Affordable Same Store expenses were down 2.3%, with trends similar to those of our Conventional Same Store properties including lower payroll expenses and higher real estate taxes offset by lower insurance costs. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse set obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term working capital needs and to collateralized letters of credit. As of June 30, the outstanding balance on the line of credit was $21 million, and collateralized letters of credit total to $27 million, leaving us with an available capacity on our line of $252 million. 
Year-to-date, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $95 million, which includes net refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan pay downs and $51 million of notes Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization trust that holds only Aimco property loans.
We continue to make progress on extending our property debt maturities and locking in today's low interest rates. As of June 30, $884 million is scheduled to mature during the balance of 2011 through the end of 2014.  We're about 6% of our outstanding property debt balance each year. 
We have rate locked a total of $151 million of these maturities, which is 17% of our property debt coming due in the next 3.5 years. The weighted average interest rate on the committed loans is 4.37% or 113 basis points lower below that of the existing loans.
We announced on July 25 the closing of a new issuance of perpetual preferred equity, or Class Z stock. We issued 800,000 shares with a coupon rate of 7% at $24.25 per share, which equates to an effective yield of 7.216%, or gross proceeds to Aimco of about $19 million and net proceeds of approximately $18.5 million.
Our goal in this new equity issuance was to establish a class of preferred equity at a cost that better reflects today's pricing, and we intend to use the proceeds from the issuance to partially redeem higher cost preferred securities.
Aimco has 4 other classes of preferred equity outstanding with coupon rates between 7.75% and 8%, which generally trade at or near par. These other classes of preferred equity are currently callable, which limits the premium at which the shares might trade in light of today's lower cost of preferred equity. We'll continue to monitor the market to see if there's an opportunity to further reduce our preferred equity costs. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, since April 1st, Aimco has issued 1.7 million shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of $25.52 per share, generating gross proceeds of $43 million. The proceeds were used primarily to match fund investment activities and to fund prepayment penalties associated with refinancing activities. Year-to-date, we had issued a total of 2.8 million shares at a weighted average price of $24.59 per share, generating gross proceeds of $71 million.
Finally, looking ahead, we are increasing full-year pro forma FFO guidance by $0.09 per share at the midpoint to a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share. As a reminder, our guidance range includes $0.15 per share of prepayment penalties incurred in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction. 
Our projections for property operations are as follows. For Conventional Same Store, narrowing the range of revenue growth expectations from a range of 2% to 3% to a range of 2.5% to 3%. A decrease in expense growth expectations from essentially flat to a range of down 1% to down 1.5%, which results in NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5% compared to our previous growth expectations of 3% of 5%. We expect Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 10% to 11% over last year and total Same Store NOI growth of 5% to 6%. And across our entire portfolio, we expect full year NOI growth to be in a range from 4% to 5%.
Finally, for the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.38 to $0.42 per share with a year-over-year total Same Store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call to questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Jamie, I'll turn it over to you for the first question please."

Then we have 2 million homes that are in the foreclosure process that, in some form or another, may present a competition. So you're getting above 200,000 units, call it 250,000 when you kind up aggregate it all up. Then you're hanging your demand hat kind of the homeownership rate continuing to go down.

And obviously, there are lot of variable factors that are considered. But let me just try and pick through the ones you raised. The first, about multi-family starts, is not much over the replacement rate as a number of units are demolished in that magnitude during the year. The second is that homes, even foreclosed homes and rental homes, are not really competitive with professionally managed departments. They serve different market segments where customers have different interests and preferences. So what drives demand for our product is unmarried, professional people between the ages of 25 and 35. And that market segment is one, growing with the baby boom echo. Despite the unemployment numbers in the overall economy, the employment rate in that age cohort is actually quite high. I think unemployment is down around 4% for that group. And so we feel pretty good about the demand for product. What I would say is that at our B price point, we feel somewhat insulated from the volatility of the weak economy. And with the advantage of redevelopment versus development, we can always fine tune it or adjust it to what we actually find."

And so that extra $0.01 or $0.02 should be coming from revenues getting a little better and it's used to price on our numbers. We do have an expectation that revenue growth will now be between 2.5% and 3% versus 2% to 3%. Do keep in mind, it's great that this -- this acceleration that Keith is getting. There's an earning to that. And so as excited as we are where the numbers are today, we don't want to get partial credit for that in 2011. But it's going to make 2012 take off for us if we can maintain these types of numbers, and that's what we're pushing to do."

Looking forward, we're doing that same kind of balancing activity, wanting to raise rents were we can but looking at it not just in isolation, but as Keith mentioned, in terms of its contribution. And so whenever we trigger a vacancy, we trigger a certain amount of cost for cleaning the apartment or refurbishing the apartment in vacancy and marketing costs. And so we've tried to balance it. So some of that lower revenue base is offset by lower cost. What you can see in our new lease activity, which as Keith mentioned for this month has a 7 handle, is that customers like our properties, and they are prepared to pay higher rents. And as that happens, and as Ernie points as that earns in, our revenue next year will be considerably higher."

It remains a good time to be in the apartment business. And we are on track to meet our 2011 plans. Rental rate growth increased during the quarter, increasing revenue and raising our prospects for 2012 as our $14 million lost to lease earns in. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued rental rate growth, with the change in mix with renewal rates increasing by more than new lease rents. Our portfolio of transformation continues with the sale of lower rent, lower growth properties and reinvestment of sales proceeds in higher rent, higher growth acquisitions and in funding our $400 million redevelopment pipeline. There, we expect returns comfortably in excess of those available on new acquisitions. 
The balance sheet is in good shape. Of interest, the markets for property bids remains open, with numerous lenders competing for our business and offering historical attractive interest rates. We expect Aimco debt leverage, as measured by debt to EBITDA, to decline to 8:1 over the next 12 to 18 months through a combination of property sales, property amortization and property net operating income growth. Our plans to simplify Aimco by increasing our ownership and partnerships that own conventional properties, liquidating sizable number of partnerships where Aimco has a low ownership in affordable properties and liquidating our legacy asset management business and by simplifying our offsite business process. All these are progressing and contribute to lower offsite costs, including G&A. As we work to finish 2011, we enjoy higher rents, wider margins and improved portfolio, stronger balance sheet, more offsite costs and embedded growth prospects for next year. We have prospects reflect contributions from the entire Aimco team and I offer them my thanks. It's my real pleasure to work with them. Now, I'd like to turn the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman. Ernie?"

Second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide fourth quarter guidance. The third quarter results at $0.41 per share, third quarter performing FFO was $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. Operating results, you will see in the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable properties, was up 3.8% year-over-year, with conventional Same Store up 3% and Affordable Same Store up 8.6%. Total same-store revenue was up 3.5% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store up 3.5% and Affordable Same Store up 3.6%. Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 3.1%, which was offset somewhat by an 80 basis point decline in occupancy. Conventional Same Store leases during the quarter were up 5.8% from the corresponding expiring lease. On an overall basis, these increases were up 6.1% in July and August and 5.2% in September. We continue to have about 2 renewal leases for each new lease and the rates of increase for each are as follows: Rates on renewal leases strengthened during the quarter and averaged 5.6% above expiring lease rates, compared to a second quarter average of 3.6%. Results by month were July were up 4.9%, August up 5.7% and September up 6.2%. New lease rates during the quarter averaged 6.1% higher than expiring lease rates compared to 5.1% in the second quarter. Results by month were July up 7.2%, August up 6.7% and September up 4%. The numbers for July and August have changed from what we reported in the press release in September due to our changed same-store population due to property sales that were completed, as well as the addition of some property results from properties that changed to our new property management system during these months. October rates are currently coming in at approximately 5% above expiring lease, with renewal rates at 6% and new lease rates at closer to 3%. Starting in mid-August, we saw a drop in demand that has since persisted. October 2011 visits are down 20% over the same period last year. We continue to be successful in increasing rental rates on expiring leases and we expect the rate of increase for renewals around 5% and new leases to remain in the 3% to 4% range for the remainder of 2011. 
On the expense side, total same-store expenses were up 3.1% over last year, primarily due to the timing of real estate tax appeals. Year-to-date, total same-store expenses are 2% lower than the same period last year. Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term working capital needs and to collateralize letters of credit. As of September 30, outstanding balance on the line was $26 million, and collateralized letters of credit also totaled $26 million, leaving us with available capacity on the line of $248 million. To date, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $113 million, which includes net refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan paydowns and $51 million of note Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization trust that holds only Aimco property loans. 
We continue to make progress on extending our property debt maturities and locking in today's low interest rates. During the third quarter, we refinanced at current balances $105 million of property debt coming due in 2011 through 2014. Weighted average interest rate on the new loans was 4.14%, 53 basis points below that of the loans that were refinanced. All of these loans have a term of 7 years. Non-GSP lenders accounted for about 75% of third quarter refinancing activity, with just $6 million of maturities coming up in the fourth quarter and no maturities in the first quarter of 2012. As of September 30, $256 million was scheduled to mature through the end of 2012 or about 5% of our outstanding property debt balance. The rate locked $56 million of third quarter 2012 maturities at an interest rate of 4.52%, just 230 basis points below that of the existing loans. During various stages of the application and negotiation processes for the remainder of our 2012 maturities, as well as for additional maturities beyond 2012. 
During the third quarter, we completed the initial offering of a new issuance of  perpetual preferred equity, our Class Z stock with a coupon rate of 7% and a par value of $25 per share. 
In closing, we issued 800,000 shares at an effective yield of 7.2%. Gross proceeds to Aimco was about $19 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem 862,500 shares, or 25% of the amount outstanding of our Class Z preferred stock, with a coupon rate of 8% and generally trade at par. 
During the third quarter, we also issued 23,800 shares under our Class Z at market program at an effective yield of 7.2%, gross proceeds of approximately $575,000. We intend to accumulate the proceeds from further Class Z issuances and use them to redeem higher cost preferred equity outstanding to reduce our overall cost of leverage. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, during the third quarter, we issued about 113,000 shares under our common stock ATM program to weighted average price of $26.33 per share, earning gross proceeds of about $3 million. Year-to-date, we have issued a total of 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.27 per share, entering gross proceeds of $74 million, which were used to match fund investment activity, including partnership transactions, acquisitions and redevelopment and other capital expenditures. 
Looking ahead, we are narrowing full year pro forma FFO guidance from a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share to a range of $1.46 to $1.50 per share. The midpoint of $1.48 per share is unchanged from our last quarterly update and includes a deduction of $0.15 per share for prepayment penalties included in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction. Excluding onetime items, full year 2011 pro forma FFO is projected to be $1.63 per share, at the midpoint of our guidance or about 10% higher than full year 2010 pro forma FFO. Projections for full year 2011 property operating results are in line with the ranges we provided last quarter and are as follows: total same-store NOI growth of 5.5%, Conventional Same Store NOI growth of approximately 5%, which is unchanged from the midpoint of our prior guidance and is based on revenue growth of approximately 2.7% and a decrease in expenses of approximately 1%, which is at the low end of our prior guidance range. We project Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 11% over last year and across our entire portfolio, we expect full year NOI growth to be approximately 4.5%. Finally, for the fourth quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.39 to $0.43 per share, with a year-over-year total same-store NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please."

It remains a good time to be in the apartment business. And we are on track to meet our 2011 plans. 
Rental rate growth increased during the quarter, increasing revenue and raising our prospects for 2012 as our $14-plus million loss to lease earns in.  As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued rental rate growth, but with the change in mix with renewal rates increasing by more than new lease rents. 
Our portfolio of transformation continues with the sale of lower rent, lower growth properties and reinvestment of sales proceeds in higher rent, higher growth acquisitions and in funding our $400 million redevelopment pipeline. There, we expect returns comfortably in excess of those available on new acquisitions. 
Our balance sheet is in good shape. Of interest, the markets for property debt remains open, with numerous lenders competing for our business and offering historically attractive interest rates. We expect Aimco debt leverage, as measured by debt to EBITDA, to decline to, say, 8:1 over the next 12 to 18 months through a combination of property sales, property debt amortization and property net operating income growth. 
Our plan is to simplify Aimco by increasing our ownership and partnerships that owned conventional properties, by liquidating a sizable number of partnerships where Aimco has a low ownership in affordable properties, by liquidating our legacy asset management business and by simplifying our offsite business process. All these are progressing and contribute to lower offsite costs, including G&A. 
As we work to finish 2011, we enjoy higher rents, wider margins and improved portfolio, a stronger balance sheet, lower offsite costs and embedded growth prospects for next year. These happy prospects reflect contributions from the entire Aimco team, and I offer them my thanks. It's my real pleasure to work with them. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First,  our third quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide fourth quarter guidance. As to third quarter results at $0.41 per share, third q",1232,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First,  our third quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide fourth quarter guidance. As to third quarter results at $0.41 per share, third quarter performing FFO was $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. 
As to operating results, you will see in table on Page -- in the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable properties, was up 3.8% year-over-year, with Conventional Same Store, up 3%; and Affordable Same Store, up 8.6%. Total same-store revenue was up 3.5% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store, up 3.5%; and Affordable Same Store, up 3.6%. 
Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 3.1%, which was offset somewhat by an 80 basis point decline in occupancy. Conventional Same Store leases during the quarter were up 5.8% from the corresponding expiring lease. On an overall basis, these increases were up 6.1% in July and August and 5.2% in September. We continue to have about 2 renewal leases for each new lease, and the rates of increase for each are as follows. Rates on renewal leases strengthened during the quarter and averaged 5.6% above expiring lease rates compared to a second quarter average of 3.6%. Results by month were: July, up 4.9%; August, up 5.7%; and September, up 6.2%. New lease rates during the quarter averaged 6.1% higher than expiring lease rates compared to 5.1% in the second quarter. Results by month were: July, up 7.2%; August, up 6.7%; and September, up 4%. 
Our numbers for July and August have changed from what we reported in the press release in September due to our changed same-store population due to property sales that were completed, as well as the addition of some property results from properties that changed to our new property management system during these months. 
October rates are currently coming in at approximately 5% above expiring lease, with renewal rates at 6% and new lease rates at closer to 3%. Starting in mid-August, we saw a drop in demand that has since persisted. October 2011 visits are down 20% over the same period last year. We continue to be successful in increasing rental rates on expiring leases, but we expect the rate of increase for renewals around 5% and new leases to remain in the 3% to 4% range for the remainder of 2011. 
On the expense side, total same-store expenses were up 3.1% over last year, primarily due to the timing of real estate tax appeals. Year-to-date, total same-store expenses are 2% lower than the same period last year. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term working capital needs and to collateralize letters of credit. As of September 30, the outstanding balance on the line was $26 million, and collateralized letters of credit also totaled $26 million, leaving us with available capacity on the line of $248 million. 
Year-to-date, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $113 million, which includes net refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan paydowns and $51 million of notes Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization trust that holds only Aimco property loans. 
We continue to make progress on extending our property debt maturities and locking in today's low interest rates. During the third quarter, we refinanced that current balances $105 million of property debt coming due in 2011 through 2014. The weighted average interest rate on the new loans was 4.14%, 53 basis points below that of the loans that were refinanced. All of these loans have a term of 7 years. 
Non-GSE lenders accounted for about 75% of third quarter refinancing activity. We have just $6 million of maturities coming up in the fourth quarter and no maturities in the first quarter of 2012. As of September 30, $256 million was scheduled to mature through the end of 2012 or about 5% of our outstanding property debt balance. We have rate locked $56 million of third quarter 2012 maturities at an interest rate of 4.52%, which is 230 basis points below that of the existing loans during various stages of the application and negotiation processes for the remainder of our 2012 maturities, as well as for additional maturities beyond 2012. 
During the third quarter, we completed the initial offering of a new issuance of  perpetual preferred equity, our Class Z stock with a coupon rate of 7% and a par value of $25 per share. 
At closing, we issued 800,000 shares at an effective yield of 7.2%, gross proceeds to Aimco of about $19 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem 862,500 shares or 25% of the amount outstanding of our Class Z preferred stock, which has a coupon rate of 8% and generally trades at par. 
During the third quarter, we also issued 23,800 shares under our Class Z at the market program at an effective yield of 7.2%, for gross proceeds of approximately $575,000. We intend to accumulate the proceeds from further Class Z ATM issuances and use them to redeem higher cost preferred equity outstanding and reduce our overall cost of leverage. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, during the third quarter, we issued about 113,000 shares under our common stock ATM program at a weighted average price of $26.33 per share, generating gross proceeds of about $3 million. Year-to-date, we have issued a total of 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.27 per share, generating gross proceeds of $74 million, which were used to match fund investment activity, including partnership transactions, acquisitions and redevelopment and other capital expenditures. 
Looking ahead, we are narrowing full year pro forma FFO guidance from a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share to a range of $1.46 to $1.50 per share. The midpoint of $1.48 per share is unchanged from our last quarterly update and includes a deduction of $0.15 per share for prepayment penalties included in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction.  Excluding onetime items, full year 2011 pro forma FFO is projected to be $1.63 per share, at the midpoint of our guidance or about 10% higher than full year 2010 pro forma FFO. 
Our projections for full year 2011 property operating results are in line with the ranges we provided last quarter and are as follows: total same-store NOI growth of 5.5%; Conventional Same Store NOI growth of approximately 5%, which is unchanged from the midpoint of our prior guidance and is based on revenue growth of approximately 2.7%; and a decrease in expenses of approximately 1%, which is at the low end of our prior guidance range. We project Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 11% over last year. And across our entire portfolio, we expect full year NOI growth to be approximately 4.5%. 
Finally, for the fourth quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.39 to $0.43 per share, with a year-over-year total same-store NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please."

Rental rate growth increa",339,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you on the call for your interest in Aimco. Our report today is upbeat, business is good. It remains a good time to be in the apartment business. And we are on track to meet our 2011 plans. 
Rental rate growth increased during the quarter, increasing revenue and raising our prospects for 2012 as our $14-plus million loss to lease earns in.  As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued rental rate growth, but with the change in mix with renewal rates increasing by more than new lease rents. 
Our portfolio of transformation continues with the sale of lower rent, lower growth properties and reinvestment of sales proceeds in higher rent, higher growth acquisitions and in funding our $400 million redevelopment pipeline. There, we expect returns comfortably in excess of those available on new acquisitions. 
Our balance sheet is in good shape. Of interest, the market for property debt remains open, with numerous lenders competing for our business and offering historically attractive interest rates. We expect Aimco debt leverage, as measured by debt to EBITDA, to decline to, say, 8:1 over the next 12 to 18 months through a combination of property sales, property debt amortization and property net operating income growth. 
Our plan is to simplify Aimco by increasing our ownership and partnerships that owned conventional properties, by liquidating a sizable number of partnerships where Aimco has a low ownership in affordable properties, by liquidating our legacy asset management business and by simplifying our offsite business process. All these are progressing and contribute to lower offsite costs, including G&A. 
As we work to finish 2011, we enjoy higher rents, wider margins and improved portfolio, a stronger balance sheet, lower offsite costs and embedded growth prospects for next year. These happy prospects reflect contributions from the entire Aimco team, and I offer them my thanks. It's my real pleasure to work with them. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First,  our third quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide fourth quarter guidance. As to third quarter results at $0.41 per share, third q",1232,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First,  our third quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide fourth quarter guidance. As to third quarter results at $0.41 per share, third quarter performing FFO was $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. 
As to operating results, you will see in table on Page -- in the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable properties, was up 3.8% year-over-year, with Conventional Same Store, up 3%; and Affordable Same Store, up 8.6%. Total same-store revenue was up 3.5% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store, up 3.5%; and Affordable Same Store, up 3.6%. 
Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 3.1%, which was offset somewhat by an 80 basis point decline in occupancy. Conventional Same Store leases during the quarter were up 5.8% from the corresponding expiring lease. On an overall basis, these increases were up 6.1% in July and August and 5.2% in September. We continue to have about 2 renewal leases for each new lease, and the rates of increase for each are as follows. Rates on renewal leases strengthened during the quarter and averaged 5.6% above expiring lease rates compared to a second quarter average of 3.6%. Results by month were: July, up 4.9%; August, up 5.7%; and September, up 6.2%. New lease rates during the quarter averaged 6.1% higher than expiring lease rates compared to 5.1% in the second quarter. Results by month were: July, up 7.2%; August, up 6.7%; and September, up 4%. 
Our numbers for July and August have changed from what we reported in the press release in September due to our changed same-store population due to property sales that were completed, as well as the addition of some property results from properties that changed to our new property management system during these months. 
October rates are currently coming in at approximately 5% above expiring lease, with renewal rates at 6% and new lease rates at closer to 3%. Starting in mid-August, we saw a drop in demand that has since persisted. October 2011 visits are down 20% over the same period last year. We continue to be successful in increasing rental rates on expiring leases, but we expect the rate of increase for renewals around 5% and new leases to remain in the 3% to 4% range for the remainder of 2011. 
On the expense side, total same-store expenses were up 3.1% over last year, primarily due to the timing of real estate tax appeals. Year-to-date, total same-store expenses are 2% lower than the same period last year. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term working capital needs and to collateralize letters of credit. As of September 30, the outstanding balance on the line was $26 million, and collateralized letters of credit also totaled $26 million, leaving us with available capacity on the line of $248 million. 
Year-to-date, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $113 million, which includes net refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan paydowns and $51 million of notes Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization trust that holds only Aimco property loans. 
We continue to make progress on extending our property debt maturities and locking in today's low interest rates. During the third quarter, we refinanced that current balances $105 million of property debt coming due in 2011 through 2014. The weighted average interest rate on the new loans was 4.14%, 53 basis points below that of the loans that were refinanced. All of these loans have a term of 7 years. 
Non-GSE lenders accounted for about 75% of third quarter refinancing activity. We have just $6 million of maturities coming up in the fourth quarter and no maturities in the first quarter of 2012. As of September 30, $256 million was scheduled to mature through the end of 2012 or about 5% of our outstanding property debt balance. We have rate locked $56 million of third quarter 2012 maturities at an interest rate of 4.52%, which is 230 basis points below that of the existing loans. We are in various stages of the application and negotiation processes for the remainder of our 2012 maturities, as well as for additional maturities beyond 2012. 
During the third quarter, we completed the initial offering of a new issuance of  perpetual preferred equity, our Class Z stock with a coupon rate of 7% and a par value of $25 per share. 
At closing, we issued 800,000 shares at an effective yield of 7.2%, gross proceeds to Aimco of about $19 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem 862,500 shares or 25% of the amount outstanding of our Class Z preferred stock, which has a coupon rate of 8% and generally trades par. 
During the third quarter, we also issued 23,800 shares under our Class Z at the market program at an effective yield of 7.2%, for gross proceeds of approximately $575,000. We intend to accumulate the proceeds from further Class Z ATM issuances and use them to redeem higher cost preferred equity outstanding and reduce our overall cost of leverage. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, during third quarter, we issued about 113,000 shares under our common stock ATM program at a weighted average price of $26.33 per share, generating gross proceeds of about $3 million. Year-to-date, we have issued a total of 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.27 per share, generating gross proceeds of $74 million, which were used to match fund investment activity, including partnership transactions, acquisitions and redevelopment and other capital expenditures. 
Looking ahead, we are narrowing full year pro forma FFO guidance from a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share to a range of $1.46 to $1.50 per share. The midpoint of $1.48 per share is unchanged from our last quarterly update and includes a deduction of $0.15 per share for prepayment penalties included in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction.  Excluding onetime items, full year 2011 pro forma FFO is projected to be $1.63 per share, at the midpoint of our guidance or about 10% higher than full year 2010 pro forma FFO. 
Our projections for full year 2011 property operating results are in line with the ranges we provided last quarter and are as follows: total same-store NOI growth of 5.5%; Conventional Same Store NOI growth of approximately 5%, which is unchanged from the midpoint of our prior guidance and is based on revenue growth of approximately 2.7%; and a decrease in expenses of approximately 1%, which is at the low end of our prior guidance range. We project Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 11% over last year. And across our entire portfolio, we expect full year NOI growth to be approximately 4.5%. 
Finally, for the fourth quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.39 to $0.43 per share, with a year-over-year total same-store NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please."

It remains a good time to be in the apartment business. And we are on track to meet our 2011 plans. 
Rental rate growth increased during the quarter, increasing revenue and raising our prospects for 2012 as our $14-plus million loss to lease earns in.  As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued rental rate growth, but with the change in mix with renewal rates increasing by more than new lease rents. 
Our portfolio of transformation continues with the sale of lower rent, lower growth properties and reinvestment of sales proceeds in higher rent, higher growth acquisitions and in funding our $400 million redevelopment pipeline. There, we expect returns comfortably in excess of those available on new acquisitions. 
Our balance sheet is in good shape. Of interest, the market for property debt remains open, with numerous lenders competing for our business and offering historically attractive interest rates. We expect Aimco debt leverage, as measured by debt to EBITDA, to decline to, say, 8:1 over the next 12 to 18 months through a combination of property sales, property debt amortization and property net operating income growth. 
Our plan is to simplify Aimco by increasing our ownership and partnerships that owned conventional properties, by liquidating a sizable number of partnerships where Aimco has a low ownership in affordable properties, by liquidating our legacy asset management business and by simplifying our offsite business process. All these are progressing and contribute to lower offsite costs, including G&A. 
As we work to finish 2011, we enjoy higher rents, wider margins and improved portfolio, a stronger balance sheet, lower offsite costs and embedded growth prospects for next year. These happy prospects reflect contributions from the entire Aimco team, and I offer them my thanks. It's my real pleasure to work with them. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman. Ernie?"
336458,141283955,181543,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First,  our third quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide fourth quarter guidance. As to third quarter results at $0.41 per share, third q",1232,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First,  our third quarter results; second, our recent balance sheet activities; and third, I will provide fourth quarter guidance. As to third quarter results at $0.41 per share, third quarter performing FFO was $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. 
As to operating results, you will see in table on Page -- in the table on Page 2 of our earnings release, total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable properties, was up 3.8% year-over-year, with Conventional Same Store, up 3%; and Affordable Same Store, up 8.6%. Total same-store revenue was up 3.5% for the quarter, with Conventional Same Store, up 3.5%; and Affordable Same Store, up 3.6%. 
Conventional Same Store revenue growth was driven by an increase in average rents of 3.1%, which was offset somewhat by an 80 basis point decline in occupancy. Conventional Same Store leases during the quarter were up 5.8% from the corresponding expiring lease. On an overall basis, these increases were up 6.1% in July and August and 5.2% in September. We continue to have about 2 renewal leases for each new lease, and the rates of increase for each are as follows. Rates on renewal leases strengthened during the quarter and averaged 5.6% above expiring lease rates compared to a second quarter average of 3.6%. Results by month were: July, up 4.9%; August, up 5.7%; and September, up 6.2%. New lease rates during the quarter averaged 6.1% higher than expiring lease rates compared to 5.1% in the second quarter. Results by month were: July, up 7.2%; August, up 6.7%; and September, up 4%. 
Our numbers for July and August have changed from what we reported in the press release in September due to our changed same-store population due to property sales that were completed, as well as the addition of some property results from properties that changed to our new property management system during these months. 
October rates are currently coming in at approximately 5% above expiring lease, with renewal rates at 6% and new lease rates at closer to 3%. Starting in mid-August, we saw a drop in demand that has since persisted. October 2011 visits are down 20% over the same period last year. We continue to be successful in increasing rental rates on expiring leases, but we expect the rate of increase for renewals around 5% and new leases to remain in the 3% to 4% range for the remainder of 2011. 
On the expense side, total same-store expenses were up 3.1% over last year, primarily due to the timing of real estate tax appeals. Year-to-date, total same-store expenses are 2% lower than the same period last year. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which is used for short-term working capital needs and to collateralize letters of credit. As of September 30, the outstanding balance on the line was $26 million, and collateralized letters of credit also totaled $26 million, leaving us with available capacity on the line of $248 million. 
Year-to-date, we have further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our net leverage by $113 million, which includes net refinancing activity, regularly scheduled property debt amortization, loan paydowns and $51 million of notes Aimco purchased from the Freddie Mac securitization trust that holds only Aimco property loans. 
We continue to make progress on extending our property debt maturities and locking in today's low interest rates. During the third quarter, we refinanced that current balances $105 million of property debt coming due in 2011 through 2014. The weighted average interest rate on the new loans was 4.14%, 53 basis points below that of the loans that were refinanced. All of these loans have a term of 7 years. 
Non-GSE lenders accounted for about 75% of third quarter refinancing activity. We have just $6 million of maturities coming up in the fourth quarter and no maturities in the first quarter of 2012. As of September 30, $256 million was scheduled to mature through the end of 2012 or about 5% of our outstanding property debt balance. We have rate locked $56 million of third quarter 2012 maturities at an interest rate of 4.52%, which is 230 basis points below that of the existing loans. We are in various stages of the application and negotiation processes for the remainder of our 2012 maturities, as well as for additional maturities beyond 2012. 
During the third quarter, we completed the initial offering of a new issuance of  perpetual preferred equity, our Class Z stock with a coupon rate of 7% and a par value of $25 per share. 
At closing, we issued 800,000 shares at an effective yield of 7.2%, gross proceeds to Aimco of about $19 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem 862,500 shares or 25% of the amount outstanding of our Class Z preferred stock, which has a coupon rate of 8% and generally trades par. 
During the third quarter, we also issued 23,800 shares under our Class Z at the market program at an effective yield of 7.2%, for gross proceeds of approximately $575,000. We intend to accumulate the proceeds from further Class Z ATM issuances and use them to redeem higher cost preferred equity outstanding and reduce our overall cost of leverage. 
Lastly, on the balance sheet, during third quarter, we issued about 113,000 shares under our common stock ATM program at a weighted average price of $26.33 per share, generating gross proceeds of about $3 million. Year-to-date, we have issued a total of 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.27 per share, generating gross proceeds of $74 million, which were used to match fund investment activity, including partnership transactions, acquisitions and redevelopment and other capital expenditures. 
Looking ahead, we are narrowing full year pro forma FFO guidance from a range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share to a range of $1.46 to $1.50 per share. The midpoint of $1.48 per share is unchanged from our last quarterly update and includes a deduction of $0.15 per share for prepayment penalties included in the second quarter related to the Freddie Mac refinancing and securitization transaction.  Excluding onetime items, full year 2011 pro forma FFO is projected to be $1.63 per share, at the midpoint of our guidance or about 10% higher than full year 2010 pro forma FFO. 
Our projections for full year 2011 property operating results are in line with the ranges we provided last quarter and are as follows: total same-store NOI growth of 5.5%; Conventional Same Store NOI growth of approximately 5%, which is unchanged from the midpoint of our prior guidance and is based on revenue growth of approximately 2.7%; and a decrease in expenses of approximately 1%, which is at the low end of our prior guidance range. We project Affordable Same Store NOI growth of approximately 11% over last year. And across our entire portfolio, we expect full year NOI growth to be approximately 4.5%. 
Finally, for the fourth quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.39 to $0.43 per share, with a year-over-year total same-store NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please."
