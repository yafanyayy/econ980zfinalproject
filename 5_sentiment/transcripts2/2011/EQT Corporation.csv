As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2010 earnings of $1.57 per diluted share compared to $1.19 per diluted share in 2009. Operating cash flow in 2010 also increased by $215 million, or abou",1592,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2010 earnings of $1.57 per diluted share compared to $1.19 per diluted share in 2009. Operating cash flow in 2010 also increased by $215 million, or about 50% after normalizing for changes in tax refunds.
Those results were driven by another outstanding operational year at each of EQT's business units. Leading the way on the annual operating performance was a 34.5% increase in sales that produced natural gas at EQT production, which represented our highest (inaudible) ever.
Gathered volumes at EQT Midstream also increased by 21%, trending up with the higher volumes in EQT production. Somewhat tamping down the impact of higher volumes, the EQT average well head sales price was $5.62 per Mcf in 2010 or about $0.18 lower than last year. The realized price drop resulted from having fewer hedges in place as compared to 2009, as well as a slightly lower average hedge price, although much of the hedging impact was offset by higher NYMEX and natural gas liquids prices.
Liquids price impact is not trivial at EQT, as approximately 8% excluding [FN] of our total production within the form of liquids. For segment reporting purposes of that $5.62 per Mcf, $3.93 per Mcf was allocated to EQT production, with the remaining $1.69 per Mcf allocated to EQT Midstream. Now, that split represents quite a change from our historic allocation, so I will take a moment here to explain.
As you know by now, earlier this month, we announced that we are selling our Kentucky processing assets to MarkWest and entering an agreement with MarkWest to process our liquids-rich Huron gas. That agreement reflects EQT paying a processing fee to MarkWest and retaining a majority of the frac spread.
Historically, we have reported that frac spread associated with EQT productions natural gas liquids in the processing line of EQT Midstream's results. Now that EQT Midstream is exiting the processing business, we have eliminated the processing line item from the Midstream segment page and going forward, the revenues from liquids produced from EQT productions wells will be recognized in the realized price per Mcf at EQT production.
Frac spreads associated with third party gas have been left in the Midstream segment and are reported under the storage, marketing, and other line of the recast Midstream report. Do note that processing fees paid to EQT Midstream through the close of the sale, in other words, while EQT is still in the processing business, have and will continue to show up in Midstream results in that line.
We reported full-year 2010 and the recently completed quarter in the new format. To help you compare historic results, we have posted reconciliations to the previous presentation format on our website.
A final comment on the new presentation format, beginning next quarter or the first quarter 2011 in the price reconciliation table including in our earnings report, the revenues to EQT Midstream deduction will no longer include processing charges associated with EQT's production, lowering that deduction by approximately $0.8 per Mcfe.
However, MarkWest processing fees will show up in the third party gathering, processing and transportation deduction in the table and reduce the average well head sales price to EQT by approximately $0.15 per Mcfe.
Now, back to the 2010 results, overall absolute costs increased as expected, giving our outstanding growth rate, but on a unit basis, the total cost of produced, gathered, process and transport EQT's produced natural gas and NGLs was down by about 4%. We'll go into a bit more detail on that as I briefly discuss the annual results by business unit. I would want to point out the fourth quarter results basically mirrored the full year, so I do not intend to discuss those, the quarter results in detail.
However, as some of you have noticed, our interest expense in the fourth quarter was down, despite the fact that our outstanding debt has not changed much. Interest expense decreased because we have begun to capitalize interest related to Marcellus drilling, mainly because pad drilling causes Marcellus wells to be under construction for a longer period than our traditional vertical wells.
In the fourth quarter 2010, we capitalized $7.6 million. That was the capitalized interest costs for all of 2010, and so it represents about $2 million of capitalized interest per quarter. That's probably a reasonable assumption up for quarter for 2011.
Moving on to the business unit results starting with EQT production, as has been the case for two years now, the big story in the quarter at production was the growth in sales that produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was nearly 35% for the year, and was slightly north of 40% for the quarter, which, by the way, was the fourth straight quarter of more than 30% growth. Those growth rates were achieved organically and were driven by sales from our Marcellus and Huron horizontal shale wells, which together contributed 48% of the volumes in 2010.
Contribution from the Marcellus play alone is growing rapidly and represented nearly 19% of our volume this year, up from just 3% in 2009. The average sales of produced natural gas totaled just under 440 million per day at year end, about 41% higher than year end 2009 exit rates.
Moving on to expenses, total operating expenses at EQT production were $79 million higher year-over-year. Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE, and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth. DD&A represented about $66 million of the $79 million increase. SG&A was also about $21 million higher for the year, although, that is somewhat distorted by the fact that we had an $8.6 million litigation reserve reversal in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $4.5 million in charges related to the water treatment facility mentioned in previous calls during 2010.
Absolute LOE was a bit higher year-over-year. However, volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute expenses and as you would expect, unit LOE was lower in 2010, in this case by about 20% compared to 2009. Somewhat offsetting the absolute cost increases, exploration expense was $12.5 million lower in 2010, as we reduced the size of our seismic program compared to last year.
Our norm recently has been to provide a breakdown of our Marcellus wells that are in various stages of completion. Based on your feedback, there information is in format of so I will go ahead and give a quick update on our current status.
EQT has spud a total of 143 horizontal wells in the Marcellus play to date, of which 67 are currently online. Of the 76 wells not yet online, 8 are either currently drilling or have been top holed. 48 are drilled and awaiting a frac job, and 20 have been fracked and are awaiting pipeline hook-ups. Another way we look at our progress internally is by frac stages online or in a system for our Marcellus wells. As of the end of the year, 788 frac stages are online, 276 more are completed, but not yet online, 654 are planned for wells that have been drilled to total depth, but not yet fracked, and 108 are planned for wells that have been spud, but not yet drilled the total depth or fracked.
Moving on quickly to the Midstream results, operating income here was up 16%, consistent with the 21% growth in gathered volumes, mainly from gathering EQT production's growing sales volumes, and combined with higher rates resulted in a 28% increase in gathering net operating revenues.
Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 10% year-over-year, as a result of added Equitrans capacity and throughput. On the other hand, as we suggested in previous conference calls, the line item titled storage, marketing, and other net income was down about $17 million in the fourth quarter and about $7 million for the full year. This part of the Midstream business relies on seasonal volatility and spreads in the forward curve and those trended down in 2010 versus 2009.
Also, third party marketing margins and volumes for reselling unused pipeline capacity have been under pressure, resulting in a smaller premium for marketing services. The increase in third party frac spreads during the first three quarters of 2010 partially offset those declines in the full-year results for that line item.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were about $22 million higher year-over-year, consistent with the significant organic growth, higher O&M and DD&A expenses represented the majority of the increase in expenses, running about $21 million combined higher year-over-year. Increased electricity, materials, and property taxes accounted for the majority of the increase in O&M.
And then finally, our standard liquidity update, we closed the year with only approximately $54 million in net short-term debt. As detailed in the press release earlier this month, our 2011 CapEx estimate is $970 million, and we expect to fund that with estimated operating cash flow of approximately $750 million to $800 million, plus approximately $230 million in proceeds from the recently announced and eminent sale of Kentucky processing assets.
Based on the current cash flow forecast and expected proceeds from the asset sale, we do not anticipate requiring any meaningful incremental capital to fund the announced 2011 CapEx forecast. We did also renew our $1.5 billion credit facility during the fourth quarter, and that facility now expires in 2014. So, we remain in an excellent liquidity position for 2011.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.

269924,118060276,96097,"EQT Corporation, 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phil. 2010 was a record year for EQT in that operating cash flow, sales volumes, Midstream throughput and natural gas reserves were all higher than ever before. At EQT production, in the fourth quarter we posted our fourth consecutive quarter o",1999,"Thank you, Phil. 2010 was a record year for EQT in that operating cash flow, sales volumes, Midstream throughput and natural gas reserves were all higher than ever before. At EQT production, in the fourth quarter we posted our fourth consecutive quarter of over 30% year-on-year growth in sales of produced natural gas and our first ever quarter over 40%.
The Marcellus continues to be our fastest growing and most important play, as well as our most profitable one. Marcellus production accounted for 27% of our sales of produced natural gas in the fourth quarter. Our success in the Marcellus in 2010 also drove the 28% increase improved reserves and a 70% increase in improved probable and possible, that is 3P reserves.
Marcellus proved reserves increased 270% to nearly 2.9 Tcfe. However, as we said throughout most of 2010, we do not have enough capital available to us to pursue all of our above hurdle rate investment opportunities. This has necessitated tougher capital allocation decisions than we have faced in the past, including a 2011 plan that scales back our development in the Huron and CBM plays. These decisions flowed through to our year end proved reserves, with a fair number of reclassifications from PUD to probable in those two plays. While our West Huron development still makes a competitive return at current prices, especially for wells drilled near existing pipe, building significant additional take away capacity for Huron drilling does not seem prudent in the current pricing environment, even though the returns are above our calculated cost of capital. This is why we reduced our Huron PUDs, shifting those reserves into the probable category.
The story's a little different in CBM, as drilling economics there are marginal at current prices, so we took the proved undeveloped estimates for CBM to zero. Before moving on from our reserve report, let me share a couple of statistics that you may find interesting. As you know, proved reserve bookings are limited to reserves that are anticipated to be developed over the next five years. Since our actual five-year development will be dependent upon the availability of capital, we have conservatively assumed that drilling capital for the next five years will be essentially flat with 2011, representing a total drilling investment of $2.5 billion. This is a reduction of 14% from the five-year capital estimate used to prepare our 2009 reserve reports.
Obviously, increased production should lead to higher cash flows over the period, but the 2011 plan is based on using operating cash flows, plus proceeds from sales to fund investments, and it seemed prudent to use a five-year plan funded with no use of the revolver, no more asset sale proceeds, a return to lower spot prices, and also to leave room for capital for other purposes, for instance Midstream and tactical leasing.
So that the admittedly conservative result would simply be to multiply 2011 development drilling by 5. Also, the EURs per well used in the 2010 proved undeveloped reserved report were calculated on a state specific basis for the Marcellus. So in Pennsylvania, it assumes 265 wells, averaging 6.3 Bcf with an average length of 4067 feet.
In West Virginia, 201 wells, averaging 4.7 Bcf with an average length of 3700 feet. The Huron EUR assumption is 1.3 Bcf, for 311 wells. Increased recovery per foot in the Marcellus play and longer lateral projections in both plays drove the increase from the EUR per well booked before 2009, which assumed 2.5 Bcf for Marcellus well and 0.7 Bcf for Huron well.
Extended laterals, of course, have become our standard operating procedure. Our published decline curve was updated earlier this month to reflect the projected EUR increase from our projected increase in average lateral length. The economics were also updated to reflect oilfield inflation, mainly for higher completion costs, lower Midstream cost estimates for Marcellus Midstream, which by the way are now $0.98 per Mcf, down from the previous estimate of $1.29, and also to reflect the frac spread associated with the wet gas production expected from much of our West Virginia acreage.
In West Virginia, drilling has been concentrated in our core area of Doddridge County, where there is existing pipeline infrastructure. Production volumes have increased by 80% from 20 million cubic feet per day to 36 million cubic feet equivalent per day since the startup of the [Saturn] compressor station in early December.
EQT currently has a frac inventory of 32 wells, representing 374 stages, which will begin to be turned in line during the first quarter, filling the remaining capacity. Total capacity in Doddridge is about 61 million cubic feet per day.
Well recoveries in Doddridge County have been averaging 1150 Mcf per foot, with an average lateral length of 3270 feet, for an EUR of 3.75 Bcf. Based on our recent Doddridge results, and preliminary data from wells in Wetzel, Taylor, Lewis, and Upshure counties, EQT expects recoveries from the entire West Virginia play to average 1300 Mcf per foot.
The average lateral length in West Virginia is expected to be approximately 5300 feet for an EUR of 6.9 Bcf. The IPs in West Virginia are not as high as in Pennsylvania, but more of our West Virginia wells are high in liquids content and the decline curve is a little flatter. In general, the economics of our West Virginia Marcellus wells are expected as a result to be similar to the economics of the average PA Marcellus well.
We announced the results of two prolific Marcellus wells in Pennsylvania this morning. The Greene County well had a 30-day production rate of 23 million cubic feet equivalent per day and was completed using the new frac geometry, which we discussed last quarter. We still consider this frac geometry as experimental, having only completed seven wells so far. It is looking like the IPs per foot of lateral are higher, but we will need to monitor the decline curves before the new geometry becomes our standard. The fracking costs per well using this geometry is higher than it is for our current standard geometry, so we need to make sure that the costs are lower on a per unit volume basis. That is we need to determine if we are producing more natural gas or simply accelerating production of the same volume. We do not have enough data to be confident in the answer yet.
However, as our long-term investors already know, it is part of our culture to embrace this type of experiment, try to run it properly, and then apply the lessons. Consistent with that, right now we plan to complete about 25% of our 2011 Marcellus wells with the new design. That number of wells and time will tell the tale.
The Clearfield County well, which had a 24-hour flow rate of 8 million cubic feet per day, is shut in due to capacity constraints in that area. As we alluded to in our press release regarding this well, its primary purpose was to help us engineer and size the build out of Midstream assets in this area. This impressive well result is additional evidence of the quality of our overall Marcellus acreage. While most of our 2011 drilling is intended to produce and sell natural gas, approximately 15% of our Marcellus wells will be outside of our core development areas.
Obviously selling the produced gas is our priority, and that is why we signed up for processing capacity to capture the valuable liquids using a MarkWest plant being built in Patterson County, West Virginia, and expected to be online in the second quarter 2012.
Now, moving on to Midstream, in 2010, our Midstream Group completed the Ingram gathering system and added compression in Greene County, Pennsylvania, adding 105 million cubic feet per day of takeaway capacity. In West Virginia, we added 65 million cubic feet of takeaway capacity, mostly in ridge County.
Finally, upgrades to various segments on the existing Equitrans transmission system, along with modifications to compression at the Pratt Station were completed in 2010, providing about 100 million cubic feet per day. The $15 million project provides capacity to Equitrans' five interstate pipeline connections.
Midstream has done a great job of coordinating its capacity additions in support of productions development plans. Once again, we achieved the best cost structure when we can develop in a way that constraints volume at a handful of pads in order to allow us to build fewer larger Midstream systems.
In 2011, Midstream plans to add 130 million cubic feet per day of gathering capacity in Pennsylvania to productions Marcellus drilling. To ensure that the Marcellus gas gets the market, Equitrans will be expanded over the next two years to add 550 million cubic feet per day, including a pipeline expansion from the discharge of MarkWest's processing plant.
Moving on to some bigger picture topics, the reserve report is a snapshot of the EQT reality, of which most of you are familiar. First, the company has extensive profitable investment opportunities. 21 Tcf of 3P reserves, and an RP, reserve to production ratio of 150 years. Second, we have demonstrated that we are superior operators in the Marcellus and Huron shales, as evidenced by a 70% increase in 3P reserves since last year, mostly driven by improved well performance and an industry leading cost structure.
However, and finally, we have an insufficient capital to pursue all of our attractive investment opportunities. Our capital budget is consistent with this, as we established a 2011 capital in line with our expected cash flow from operations, plus proceeds from the sale of our Kentucky processing plant to MarkWest. We have already received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale and MarkWest had a successful offering to raise the proceeds to purchase the plants.
The sale is expected to close in the first quarter and could close as early as February 1. The sale would generate $230 million of gross proceeds and result in an $18 million annual reduction in our Midstream cash flow. While this is a good price for us, the deal also makes sense for MarkWest. MarkWest is a much more extensive liquids business and greater processing expertise than we do, but first we only operate one processing facility. Presumably their expertise into fit this asset has with their other assets means MarkWest will earn more from the plant than we would have.
At EQT, we are willing and able to live within cash flow, and as we continue to work our improved Marcellus results through our model, we believe we can do this and achieve a five-year production growth sales CAGR exceeding 20% significantly higher than our expected growth rate as of October of last year. The growth rate in 2011 will be significantly higher than that, estimated at about 30%.
Continue to look for opportunities to monetize some of our assets so that we can redeploy the proceeds into more of these higher return projects. Our focus continues to be on assets that earn lower returns or are perhaps worth more to others, such as Midstream assets in low growth areas or that are fully contracted, like our Big Sandy pipeline or acreage that would not be drilled in a timely manner. Obviously the sale of that Kentucky plant fit into that category.
We remain open to the possibility of monetizations that are only attractive because of our reinvestment economics, but will prioritize situations that are attractive on a standalone basis, and do not require such reinvestment logic to look appealing.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetizations of our reserves. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Pat.

So, certainly I can imagine that I will tell you that where we sit now, it would seem more likely that the eventual route would look more like the Questar approach than the sale approach, but that's because of tax basis issues and stuff like that. And frankly for us, there's more complications than even, from what we could see from the outside, that what Questar had in terms of the fact that our debt is all at the parent company level and things like that.
But we continue to look at everything we can to enhance shareholder value. Honestly, the top priority for us, though, is trying to figure out ways to continue to shift more capital into the high return projects, and it's not clear to me that that separation is way up on the list as far as things that generate, generate additional capital. Still, anything that's in the best interest of the shareholder is something that we are open to and that we do spend time working through.
So that's not as higher priority as the monetization stuff is the only message I want to you take away, but absolutely we understand the logic. We understand why people ask, and we do take a look at it. It's just that the sale, going way back, I think, we used to say when we looked at the possibility of a straight sale, the tax complications were problematical for us and I think we've also been saying for a while, ever since we heard about the Questar thing, that that's intriguing. Those two facts continue to be the case.

If we ran that type of standalone economics and it looks attractive to us, that that type of deal is more attractive.
Practically, we may well wind up in a situation where there's transactions, potential transactions whereby it doesn't look terribly attractive on that kind of text book basis, but we still find the transaction appealing because of the reinvestment economics. That is to say we don't really think we can get the capital at the calculated rates right now, and as you know, we're not willing to go to the equity markets any time in the foreseeable future. So and we're not willing to sacrifice our investment grade rating in the foreseeable future.
So, given those constraints that I guess to some extent we've put on ourselves that makes some transactions conceivably attractive only because of reinvestments. And I think that's realistically that's when you hear banter amongst companies like ourselves taking different positions on Marcellus ventures, I think that's what you're hearing going on, everybody knows they are very attractive opportunities, but you have to give up an attractive opportunity to get the money. And you need to weigh how interesting that is. The Midstream, it's more likely that there are players out there that are very different from us, that are in a Midstream business in a way that we aren't, that might have lower costs of capital, et cetera, and therefore can make offers that are interesting to us on the standalone basis.
So that's, that's why to some extent we've prioritized some of the Midstream stuff et cetera ahead of some of the upstream. But that's the overall philosophical issue. If we've got a dollar bill and somebody thinks it's worth $1.10, we're interested in selling. If they think it's only worth $0.90, but we think, gee, whiz, we can turn the $0.90 into $1.10, that's a different kind of transactions. So we prioritize the first type, but we might wind up doing some of the second type as well.

The only reason we ever look at stuff outside the Appalachian Basin frankly is it helps us understand what people are doing in other shales and maybe ideas that we can apply in our home base.

On acreage, I would really differentiate between big strategic pieces, which it's where there would be a really high hurdle, and some of the tactical ones. I mean, as much as we would rather not spend our limited capital on acreage, one of the things we didn't talk about even with some of those PUDs, in some of those cases, we might drill a different well if we could fill in spaces with acreage. So, it could wind up but the overall economics even of the locations we've identified improved dramatically, if we could get, if we could kind of fill in the so called doughnut holes. That's the way I refer. I don't think there's any circumstance where it really is a doughnut hole, but that's the way I tend to think about it. It's kind of a jigsaw puzzle. If there are pieces we could fit in, then, we're actively looking at whether there's mini ventures or swaps or acreage leasing activities that would allow us to improve the overall economics.

And obviously that could still take, there's still an inventory in 2011. If we permitted a well at 4000 feet and we think we could go 6000, we do have to make a judgment, do we want to go through the process of re-permitting or just drill it, so, you do wind up with some lag in applying all of the best practices. But if you look forward over a longer period of time, then you obviously assume that whatever we've determined will be, is best practice, will get applied to those wells.

We are finding our way up that learning curve and that showing up in the results, but it will obviously play out more fully in the future.

Three items cumulatively added $40 millio",1731,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.82 per diluted share, a $0.26 increase over EPS in the first quarter of 2010. Three items cumulatively added $40 million to our pre-tax income, or about $017 after tax earnings per share.
The sale of the Kentucky processing complex resulted in a book gain of $22.8 million. There was also an adjustment for non-income tax matters that added about $13 million, and we recognized a $4 million gain on the sales some available for sale securities.
Adjusting for those three items, EPS was flat with last year’s quarter, despite the fact that gas prices were considerably lower in the first quarter of 2011. Operating cash flow, which excludes the impact of gains on sales of the Langley processing complex and the available for sale securities increased by 22% to just short of $250 million for the quarter.
Increase in cash flow comes as a result of another outstanding operational quarter across all three of EQT’s business units, including record produced natural gas sales, and continued low per unit development and operating costs for production, which were already among the best in the industry, another record and gathering in transmission volumes, lower per unit cost in our midstream business, and solid operating income at equitable gas.
The operating results of this quarter were pretty straightforward. And I’ll just talk to them fairly briefly starting with EQT production, where the story in the quarter continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. The growth rate was a little over 43% in the recently completed quarter over the first quarter of 2010, and sequentially a little over 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. That growth rate was all again - was driven by sales from our Marcellus Shale play which contributed over 37% of the volumes in the quarter, up from only 13% in the quarter a year ago. As I mentioned, gas prices were lower in the quarter, the realized price at EQT production was just under $4, compared to about $4.74 last year. At the corporate level, EQT received $5.43 per Mcf equivalent, or almost 20% less than the $6.45 per Mcfe received last year.
Produced liquids mainly from our Huron and West Virginia Marcellus play accounts for 7% of the volumes, and 20% of the un-hedged revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in our liquids count as ethane is currently sold mostly as natural gas. But just FYI ethane also accounts for about 7% of the total well head stream. Total operating expenses at EQT production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A and SG&A although unit cash operating costs were significantly lower consistent with the significant production growth. Production taxes were down a fair amount in the quarter especially on a unit basis where we reported $0.19 per Mcf equivalent versus $0.28 last year.
Since that large of a decrease maybe not be intuitive remember that Pennsylvania does not currently impose production taxes and a big chunk of our growth came from the Marcellus play in Pennsylvania in the quarter. Per unit LOE excluding production taxes was also down by 28% to $0.18. That decrease was as a result of our higher throughput while maintaining the cost structure that again is among the best in the industry. There is some to month-to-month variability in our LOE activities but we do expect to average about $0.20 per Mcfe for the year.
A couple of notes on the Marcellus well status so far this year we have spud 23 wells with an average length of 4,775 feet nearly 15% longer than our forecasted average length. We continue with implementation of our new frac geometry design experiment. So far we have completed 13 Marcellus wells with the new frac geometry eight of the 13 wells are producing, four wells are shut in leading on pipeline construction and one well should be turned in line later this week.
We continue to see higher IPs per foot treated of lateral with this new design however we are still gathering more long-term production data before making this design our standard. We do plan to complete 19 Marcellus wells using the new geometry in 2011. In other well result news we drilled two wells in Jefferson County during in the quarter both wells had 24 hour flow rates of about 10 million per day these results will be used to mid-size the Midstream build in that new area. This month we spud our first well in Tioga County where we intend spud 10 wells this year and we will have more in flow on that as the year goes on.
Our norm has been to provide a breakdown of our Marcellus wells that are in various stages of completion. So as of the end of the quarter EQT has spud a total of 167 horizontal Marcellus wells of which 82 are currently online. Of the 85 wells not yet online 29 have been fracked and awaiting pipeline hook ups, 39 are drilled and awaiting a frac job, 16 are either currently drilling or have been top flow and one well is not successfully completed and will be plugged. We also track our progress internally by frac stages online we’re in the system for our Marcellus wells and on that metric as of the end of the quarter 1,032 frac stages are online, 418 more are completed, but not yet online, 600 are planned for wells that have been drilled to total depth, but not yet fracked and 261 are planned for wells that have been spud, but again, not fracked.
Finally, we would like to update the expected returns from our Marcellus play taking into account the continued oil field inflation. While we have our frac services contracted through 2011, there are variable costs that are passed through the EQT, and we expect to see more oil fueled inflation next year.
We now estimate that a typical 5,300 foot well will cost above $6 million. Partially offsetting this inflationary pressure is a lower expected cost to gather and transport the Marcellus gas. With all of that considered our all-in after tax IRR estimate is now 64% at $5 NYMEX or 136% pre-tax at the well head again at $5 NYMEX.
Moving on to Midstream results. Operating income there was up 26% consistent with growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Gathering net revenue increased by a little over $10 million as gathering volumes increased by 31%, while the average gathering rate declined by 8%, and that decline was driven by the Marcellus mix and a 20% decrease in per unit operating cost.
One change we have made to better reflect the relative economics of the respective plays is that instead of charging a blended rate for gathering the Midstream group now charges EQT production $0.66 per Mcf for Marcellus gathering, and $1.25 per Mcf for gathering everywhere else. As Marcellus production continues to grow as a percentage of our total, the average gathering rate should continue to decline.
Transmission net revenues also increased by 22% to $26.4 million driven by the additional capacity turned online in the fourth quarter of 2010. Keep in mind that approximately 90% of transition net revenues are from capacity charges, so as we expand and execute contracts on our system, net revenues will continue to grow accordingly.
Storage, marketing, and other net operating income was down about $10 million in the first quarter. These results included a $2.5 million reduction in processing fees as we only own the Langley processing complex for one month of the first quarter of 2011, versus owning it for the full quarter of the first quarter of 2010. The storage and marketing part of the Midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have trended down for the last couple of years.
Also, third-party marketing volumes and rates for reselling unused pipeline capacity continue to be under pressure. Given current market conditions, we estimate that full year 2011 net revenues in storage, marketing, and other, will be approximately $25 million lower than last year related to storage and marketing activities, and about $15 million lower from processing fee revenues collected in 2010 for our Langley processing services that now will be paid to MarkWest.
Having said that, we expect to grow - we expect the growth in gathered and transported volumes to more than offset this reduction in net revenue in the Midstream business. Net operating expenses at Midstream were about $1.3 million higher quarter over quarter, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned tax adjustments. Per unit gathering and compression expense excluding the property tax adjustment was down 20% to $0.30 per Mcf as a result of higher throughput while maintaining our cost structure.
Just a quick note on distribution, our operating income was up 6%, excluding the tax adjustments, mainly from lower bad debt and (inaudible) lower 2.5% than last year.
2011 guidance - today, you saw we increased our production sales forecast for the full year 2011 to 180 Bcf. Our forecasts are intended to represent a realistic projection, factoring in some negative impacts from inevitable unplanned delays or disruptions, such as delays in midstream projects, permit delays, weather impacts like freeze-offs, etcetera, and our cautious approach to pad drilling.
Our current practice is to not turn wells in line, where there is drilling or fracing of other wells on that same pad. If we do not experience any unplanned disruptions, we will realize higher sales volumes than our published forecast.
As a result of the higher volume forecast, we are also increasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2011 to between 800 and $850 million. As you know, we raised approximately $225 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of the Langley complex in the first quarter.
As a result of that sale as well as our growing operating cash flow, we closed the quarter with approximately $139 million in cash on hand, no short-term debt and virtually full availability under our $1.5-billion credit facility. So we remain in a great liquidity position for 2011.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Dave Porges.

We are off to a good start this year, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to realize our potential from a shareholder value perspective. And we are determined to do so.
Phil spoke about some of the operational results from the first quarter. And we are happy to answer additional questions you may have about our operations during Q&A, but we believe that this quarter’s results make it clear that we know how to execute. So I’d like to direct my comments to some more strategic issues for ourselves and the industry.
During the past year or so, we have talked quite a bit about addressing our greatest strategic challenge - applying capital to our best investment opportunities. Last year, I committed to you that we would live within cash flow plus proceeds from asset sales.
Our longer-term goal is to achieve organic volume metric and cash flow growth north of 30% per annum in production and associated cash flow growth in the midstream, while living within operating cash flow - that is, without proceeds from asset sales.
We estimate that we can achieve this goal by 2014, provided we outspend cash flow by about 300 to $400 million per year for the three years between now and then. In total, this means a little more than the $1 billion in external capital from 2011 through 2013.
Now, I wanted to discuss why we are very confident we can meet this target without tapping the equity market. First, of course, we funded the forecasted excess spending in 2011 by selling our Kentucky processing complex. Most of the remainder of our funding need could be achieved by the sale of our Big Sandy pipeline plus utilizing the additional debt capacity that our rapid growth in earnings and cash flow are creating.
Without getting into too many specifics about particular assets, I do wish to share what we think we have learned from our examination into the market value of all of our assets and investment opportunities and then comment on debt capacity.
The sale of the Kentucky processing complex and other of our efforts along these lines have sharpened our view that at least some of our midstream assets, especially, are more valuable to others than they are to us - at least, when the value to us is measured by inferring what the equity market is giving us credit for in our stock price.
It seems this value gap is most pronounced for long-lived assets, when most of the investment in the asset has already been made with contracts in place to increase the stability of the cash flows, yet there remains attractive incremental investment opportunities that create visible cash flow growth prospects. It is our observation that this combination of long-lived, stable cash flows and visible growth prospects is of a greater value to others than the roughly eight times current year EBITDA valuation that appears to be assumed in our stock price. Hence, the shorthand that we have previously used, assets that are worth more to others than to us.
While this value disconnect existed for the Kentucky facility and seems likely to exist for Big Sandy, we believe that we own several other assets, our CBM assets, various gathering assets, mature slow declining PDPs, et cetera, that quite possibly fit this description. In contrast, some of our most attractive organic investment opportunities, such as both Upstream and Midstream Marcellus are ones about which our knowledge of our own asset base and confidence in our ability to execute against these opportunities translates into a value proposition that is at least as compelling us to as it seems to be to others.
Now, back to debt capacity for a moment. Operationally, we have been exceeding our growth expectations. This is increasing our projections for internally generated cash flow. This in turn leads to additional debt capacity. The asset sales, when the funds are redeployed into our higher earning opportunities, create incremental cash flow and debt capacity even above the current projections. Incidentally, by additional debt capacity I mean the ability to wear debt without comprising our credit rating. So given our extensive list of potential asset sales, combining proceeds from asset sales with our more optimistic cash flow generation potential is, we believe, more than enough to fund this billion dollars or so for the accelerated development of our reserves.
The other topic I wanted to touch on for a moment is the need to develop these opportunities in a safe and environmentally sound manner. There has certainly been a lot of chatter about the pros and cons of shale gas development over the past few months. Much of this is probably due to the relative newness of this activity in the northeastern portion of the U.S. Our assessment of the situation is that the industry, as a whole, has been taking these issues seriously, especially recently, and that while the speed of the ramp-up has caused some issue for some of our peers, the industry is generally very committed to improving and sharing best practices, and working cooperatively with regulators to make sure that we achieve the promise of this great economic development opportunity.
You know that EQT was among the first companies to recycle most of its produced water, and also one of the first to post frac fluid composition on our website. We were also one of numerous companies that have participated in a project to post frac fluid composition on a well-by-well basis on a common website called FracFocus.org, a project coordinated by the Ground Water Protection Council. We continue to look for ways both internally and based on what we see other companies doing to improve our practices and our disclosure. Separately, we also realize that the long-term best interests of our communities is probably best served by heading towards fewer pads with more wells per pad, so that we cut down on the overall percentage of land that is affected by our drilling operations, and the associated roads, pipes, compressor stations, et cetera.
Our industry has a tiny physical footprint as a personal of acreage drained once wells are in operation, but the tinier the better from the perspective of our communities. This multi-well pad approach will probably mean that we will typically have a relatively sizable inventory of wells that have been spud, TDed, or even completed but are not yet flowing. But we think that this is the best long term approach to minimize our surface impact.
A variety of companies have short term issues in moving towards this approach because of lease related commitments, and sometime this local pooling rules are less than helpful, but we believe that there is a growing consensus that this smaller footprint approach is part of the long-term answer.
It is certainly possible that there will be some short-term economic costs from an environmentally sensitive approach. Better and more meters, more between CapEx and flowing production etcetera, but these are typically modest costs. Often they actual result in a better cost structure, as in the case of pad drilling, and will, in any event, lead to the best long term answer for all of us.
Finally, it is our observation that Pennsylvania is probably moving towards some sort of impact fee that will compensate local communities for direct and some indirect cost associated with the burgeoning natural gas business in this state.
Provided if such a fee is set at a reasonable level, it is dedicated to addressing actual impacts, and perhaps, as we would prefer, funding some economic development initiatives to encourage local use of more natural gas, and provided it is also accompanied by other regulations that clarify some of the rules governing the industry.
We believe that the consensus in the industry is to support such a compressive approach as being in the long term best interest of natural gas companies. Therefore, as is the case for many of our peers, EQT will continue to present all of its economics as if such is a fee structure exists, even though the actual results, as you descend from this quarter’s numbers, will obviously reflect the current reality.
In summary, EQT remains committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves, but doing so in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. We continue to be focused on doing what it takes to get the most economic value out of our assets and investment opportunities even when that means selling them. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and appreciate your continued support.
And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Pat.

`
So while we are clearly seeing higher production rates initially, it’s very important that we get a little longer production history so we can accurately calculate the return we are getting for that extra million dollars.
I can say we have about five wells so far that have more than 100 days of production with the new technique and they’re averaging a little more than 60% higher production over that time period than their offsets would be standard technique. So results are very encouraging, but it’s going to be closer to the end of the year before we talk in more detail about it.

I think we are absolutely convinced that longer laterals are better, at least up to 9,000 feet, which is as far as we’ve drilled to-date. We do plan a few laterals this year, even longer than that, but at least up to 9,000 feet, we are absolutely convinced, based on what we’ve done, that longer is better from an economic standpoint. We think what you may be hearing from others when they’re looking at their all-in economics, is they’re factor in these lease obligations, so the drilling obligations related to leases.
But if you factor in an assumption that you would lose leases because of failing to meet the drilling obligations, and then you might say that you would assume that you would have to pay market rate to get those leases back and you factored those into the economics. It is probably true that shorter laterals make more sense because what you want to do in that circumstance is touch as many of those leases as possible.
Remembering that these initial lease terms, that the norm has been a five-year lease term, and some folks did, especially ones who moved to the Marcellus earlier than us, would be nearing the end of some of those initial terms. So from an all-in economics perspective for those companies, it probably does in fact make the most sense, until they’re - you know, until they’ve got the volumes flowing and they’ve honored the obligations, and then they’ll move into whatever seems to be most economic at that point. And it may also be the different parts of the state have different - there are slightly different geologies in different parts of the state.

And just this week, we started turning in line a 7-well pad in Doddridge County, six of those wells are - have been in line for 24 hours or more, as I speak. I can tell you the average 24-hour rate from those six wells is 9.2 million cubic feet a day. These were relatively short lateral wells due to the nature of the lease, the average lateral length was 2,970 feet and we had average of just under 11 stages per well.

One of the benefits of the Marcellus, just so you are aware, is the higher pressure wells, and so we do take advantage of some of those higher pressures, so as we stage in the larger diameter pipe, the longer lead items such as compression that we can stage in as the wells are brought in line, and so that’s how we look at it, is that we put the Bates infrastructure in and then we bring in the compression as the wells come on.
With respect to our Equitrans asset, as we previously announced in line, we turned on line in excess of a hundred million a day of capacity this year, we have an additional 400 million a day that we are through the certificate process that will be coming on in 2012. And again we’ve at EQT in terms of the commercial we’ve always been proactive on the downstream capacity commitments on the interstate pipelines.
We have a large position on Columbian transmission to move our HERON gas. We’ve been - we have a contract as you’re aware of with the Tennessee gas pipeline for 350 million a day that moves our product even further downstream into a northeastern market. And also with segmentation provides the flexibility to move an additional 300 into the south market. So again, that’s how we look at it, we work closely together. We built out the infrastructure and we have - I think an excellent track record of being out in front and doing just that.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.58 per diluted share, 190% increase over EPS in the second quarter of 2010. Three items cumulatively added $17.7 milli",1369,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.58 per diluted share, 190% increase over EPS in the second quarter of 2010. Three items cumulatively added $17.7 million to our pre-tax income or about $0.07 per share to EPS.
The purchase of the outstanding interest in ANPI and our balance sheet structure setup to fund the acquisition from Statoil in 2000 resulted in a book gain. As we consider potentially more complex financing alternatives to fund our significant growth opportunities we have look for ways to clean up and simplify our already relatively simple structure, and the buyback of ANPI is an example of that. There was also an adjustment for non-income tax matters and again on the sale of some available for sale securities.
Even after adjusting for those three items, the EPS in the second quarter of 2011 increased 2.5 times over the second quarter of 2011. Operating cash flow, which for the most part excludes the impact of the three items I just discussed increased by 66% to $189 million for the quarter. The increase in cash flow comes as a result of another outstanding operational quarter across all three of EQT’s business units, including record production and midstream volumes, and continued low operating - unit operating costs, which are already among the best in the industry as well as solid operating income at equitable gas.
The operating results in this quarter are fairly straight forward and I will start with EQT production where sales volumes continue to grow at a record pace. The organic growth rate in the recently completed quarter you saw was over the 43% over the first quarter of 2010, even excluding 1.4 Bcfe volumes from the ANPI transaction. That growth rate was driven by sales from our Marcellus shale play, which contributed approximately 39% of the volumes in the quarter, up from only 16% in the quarter a year ago.
Gas prices were also higher. The realized price at EQT Production was $4.16 per Mcfe, compared to about $3.66 last year. At the corporate level, EQT received $5.60 per Mcfe, compared to $5.33 last year. NYMEX gas prices basis on liquids revenues were all higher in the quarter while the impact from hedges was consequently somewhat lower.
Produced liquids, mainly from our liquids-rich Huron and West Virginia Marcellus plays, accounted for 7% of the volumes and about 20% of the un-hedged revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation as it is currently sold mostly as methane. If we included ethane, the percentage of liquids produced would approximately double.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE and production taxes. However, unit cash operating costs were significantly lower; consistent with the volume growth.
Per unit LOE excluding production taxes was down by 15% to $0.22 per Mcf equivalent. That decrease was a result of producing higher volume while maintaining a cost structure that is again already among the best in the industry.
Production taxes were also lower on a unit basis at $0.20 per Mcfe in the current quarter versus about $0.25 per Mcfe last year. This time due to an increasing amount of production sales volumes from Pennsylvania. And you remember that Pennsylvania does not currently impose production taxes and an increasing percentage of our growth came from the Marcellus play in Pennsylvania.
Moving on to Midstream results in the second quarter. Operating income here was up 25%, consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by a little over $10 million, as gathering volumes increased by 32%, somewhat offset by the average gathering rate, which declined by 9% due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes.
Last quarter, we mentioned that the Midstream group now charges EQT Production $0.66 per Mcf for Marcellus gathering and $1.25 per Mcf for gathering everywhere else. As Marcellus Production continues to grow as a percentage of our total production mix, the average gathering rate paid by EQT Production will continue to decline.
At the same time, the increase in Marcellus volumes where we experienced significant midstream economies of scale drove a 33% decrease in midstream’s unit gathering and transmission cost. So EQT midstream margins will continue to be strong as the per unit operating expenses from Marcellus production is lower than our current average. Transmission net revenues also increased by 36%, driven by the additional capacity turned online in the fourth quarter 2010.
Storage, marketing and other net operating income was down about $12 million in the second quarter. These results include a $4.1 million reduction in processing fees, as we did not own the Langley processing complex during the second quarter of 2011, while we owned it for the full quarter in the second quarter of 2010. That has been mentioned before, the storage and marketing part of the midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have continued to deteriorate.
Given current market conditions and the sale of the Langely plant, we now estimate that full year 2011 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $50 million. The good news is that even with the asset sales and deteriorating seasonal spreads on midstream operating continues to grow significantly.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were flat quarter-over-quarter excluding impact of the processing complex and the impact of the previously mentioned tax adjustments. As I mentioned per unit gathering expense was down more than 30% as a result of the higher Marcellus throughput while maintaining our cost structure at midstream.
A moment on the Big Sandy Pipeline sale. You would have seen during the second quarter we announced the sale of our regulated Big Sandy Pipeline. The sale closed on July 1st so there was no financial impact on second quarter results. We expect to record a gain of approximately $175 million in the third quarter. This sale is expected to reduce second half EBITDA by about $14 million and reduce our annualized transmission EBITDA run rate to approximately $15 million per year.
We plan to invest $230 million over two years to add 560 million cubic feet per day of capacity to our Marcellus transmission system, Equitrans. As a result of those investments, we expect transmission operating income to be about $70 million in 2012 and about $100 million in 2013. Beyond that when needed we can expand capacity by another 570 million cubic feet per day for an incremental investment of approximately $50 million, which could ultimately add an additional $30 million to $50 million of EBITDA.
Big Sandy sale will impact our per unit revenue realization. So to help you calibrate your models we forecast transportation and processing revenue to EQT midstream to go down by $0.14 per Mcf while third-party gathering, processing and transportation will increase by $0.14 per Mcf for the second half of 2011. We also expect the average gathering rate charge to EQT production to be approximately $1.12 per Mcf for the second half of 2011 and between $1 and $1.05 in 2012 and then between $0.90 and $0.95 in 2013.
Just a quick note on guidance, today increased our production sales forecast for the full-year 2011 to be between 190 Bcf and 195 Bcf equivalent or approximately 43% higher than in 2010. We expect that 2012 volume will exceed 250 Bcf equivalent. We will have more clarity on the 2012 guidance after we establish our capital budget in December.
As a result of the higher volume forecast, we are increasing our operating cash flow estimates for 2011 to be approximately $850 million. As you know we have raised approximately $620 million in pre-tax proceeds from the sales of Langley and Big Sandy. As a result of these sales as well as our growing operating cash flow, we closed the quarter with approximately $79 million in cash on hand and full availability under our $1.5 billion credit facility, so we remain in a great liquidity position.
With that I will turn the call over to David Porges.

The two topics to which I’d like to devote most of my time this morning are the positioning of",1705,"Thanks, Bill. This was yet another strong operating quarter as we continue all efforts to maximize shareholder value creation from our core strategic assets. The two topics to which I’d like to devote most of my time this morning are the positioning of our midstream business within the strategic framework of the company, and separately, some comments on legislative and regulatory issues on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania where we’ve just completed work on the Governor’s Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission.
First, to set the stage for my midstream thoughts. During the past year or so, we had talked quite a bit about addressing our greatest strategic challenge, applying capital to our best investment opportunities. Last year, we committed that we would live within cash flow plus proceeds from asset sales. Last quarter, we communicated a longer-term goal to achieve organic volume metric and cash for growth north of 30% per annum in production and associated cash flow growth in the midstream while living within operating cash flow that is without proceeds from asset sales.
The estimates that we can achieve this goal by 2014 was predicated on the assumption that we can outspend cash flow by about $300 million to $400 million per year for the three years between now and then or a little more than $1 billion in external capital from 2011 through 2013 without tapping the equity market. We have made significant progress towards making that assumption a reality.
First, of course we sold the Kentucky Processing Complex in a transaction that was announced and closed in the first quarter this year. Next, we sold the Big Sandy pipeline at a transaction that was announced in the second quarter and closed at the very beginning of the third quarter. Those two transactions raised about $600 million. For the remainder, we believe that we can utilize the additional debt capacity that our rapid growth and earnings and cash flow are creating. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to consider additional assets sales which could provide additional capital to reinvest into Marcellus development.
Not only did these midstream asset sales build our funding GAAP but also established a marker as to the value of our remaining midstream assets and organic growth opportunities. These two assets were sold at about 13 to 14 times operating cash flow. And yes, we did note that both buyers accessed lower cost capital from the NLP market. As we look at our retained Marcellus midstream assets, we project operating cash flow growth of nearly 20% per year assuming only EQT production volumes and an ROTC in the mid teens making EQT one of the faster growing and more profitable midstream companies in the country. This growth and market comps indicate a valuation for our midstream business in excess of $4 billion.
Of course an additional value of this business is that our control of the location, capacity and pace of the Marcellus midstream build out increases our comfort that we can transport EQT’s produced gas from the well head to the market, which increases our confident that EQT production will achieve its growth objectives.
In our 2011, CapEx forecast, we included $90 million for gathering pipes and compression to add a 170 million cubic feet per day of Pennsylvania Marcellus gathering capacity. But our folks do more than that in working to support our growth and equity production.
Most of the specific activities are not headline material but they are invaluable, they include having larger more sophisticated meters. Adding interconnects to interstate systems, adding interconnects between our own systems to route gas around bottlenecks, leveraging the high-pressure of the Marcellus production to route around compressor stations that are already at capacity and blending wet high moisture gas with dry gas to meet interstate pipeline moisture specs.
This may be more detail than you need, but the point is that these activities are projected to increase the capacity of our existing Pennsylvania Marcellus gathering system by nearly 140 milling cubic feet per day by the end of 2011 at a cost of $6 million. We now calculate the IOR of that $6 million investment but it quarterly exceeds our hurdle rates.
Our culture encourages innovation and I'm proud of this remarkable achievement. These specifics support our view but our midstream business is very valuable, but we realized that some strategic decisions need to be made regarding the amount of investment that should be made in that business perspectively. One option is to continue with the current model but we built our needed midstream system and occasionally sell off some of the seasoned assets most likely to MLPs. This is one way to access the value of low MLP cost of capital.
Our second option is to basically outsource our midstream. Our concern with that approach in addition to the opportunity cost before growing organic growth prospects is the loss of control that we value momentarily especially during this period of rapid build out, but we do recognize that mostly E&P companies successfully utilize this model.
A third option is to create our own MLP, given our forecasted growth profile this option could make sense even if the only customer is EQT Production but a probable becomes necessary due to capital requirements if we decide to pursue a third-party business model.
We realize that there were significant interests from our investors in learning which option we will choose.
At this point given our current level of study of this issue, the only interim conclusion we’ve reached is of pursuing a third-party growth model on our own over the partner probably means an MLP while we are unlikely to build that route if we limit our focus to moving EQT Production.
We appreciate your patience and we’ll keep you informed as we make decisions affecting our future. From my perspective, this is a high-class problem, choosing among several, viable alternatives that all create shareholder value.
Shifting gears, let's spend a moment discussing the status of regulatory and legislative issues in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission, on which I served as a member, forwarded its report to Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Corbett on July 22. The 30-member commission equally shared by Lieutenant Governor Cawley, comprised state regulators, producers, local government representatives and environmental organizations.
We have made 96 recommendations related to Marcellus Development in Pennsylvania, including enactment of an impact fee with revenues return to localities affected by development, enactment of approving statue, adoption of legislation and regulations to ensure environmentally responsible development and economic-development initiatives such as encouraging the adoption of natural gas as a fuel for buses.
EQT as long believe that each industry needs an appropriate level of state regulation and each industry should pay for its own penalties. We are heartened that the commission's recommendations are allied with those perspectives and that there was much more agreement among the various constituencies than this agreement.
This is an important first step in developing comprehensive legislation regulation and public policy that will promote safe and responsible development of the Marcellus shale and ensure that all Pennsylvanians have an opportunity to economically benefit from this abundant natural resource.
At EQT, we are committed to the standard of safe and responsible development even without governmental mandates. Along those lines, we are taking steps to reduce the air emissions of our drilling processes. Air quality is long been a particular problem in this region and the fact that diesel is the prominent fuel used to power drilling rig equipment in our industry does not help. We are piloting the replacement of this diesel equipment with natural gas powered equipment.
Replacing this equipment it has three primary drivers. First of all, the emissions of natural gas powered equipment compared to the Diesel equipment operating at present. We will achieve NOx and total hydrocarbon emissions reductions of 46% and a reduction in particular matter of 78%.
Second, since natural gas is cheaper than diesel fuel, we expect reductions on fuel cost of up to 50%. And finally, in a small way, this change will increase the adoption of more natural gas powered equipment and contribute to advancing the new natural gas economy.
Another small step on this path was our opening last week of the first natural gas fueling station in the city of Pittsburgh that is open to both fleet vehicles and to the public at large. This is part of a small but growing network of such stations in this region built by various companies to facilitate the conversion of fleets to nat gas. The largest customer at our station is Equitable Gas Company, which has recently converted dozens of vehicles to CMG. Most of the other stations being built around here are similarly anchored by the station’s sponsors owned fleet, but we all work cooperatively and trust with this bootstrapping if you will, leads to broader adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel.
My concluding remark today intended as a Segway into Q&A pertains to production. We completed our first well using the new frac geometry that we have been discussing, in October 2010, since then we have turned in line 68 Marcellus wells of which 13 were completed using that new frac geometry.
We expect to have a total of 27 of the new design wells online by year-end. We continue to see greater than 60% higher than IPs per foot of treated lateral with this new design compared to offsetting wells, and are getting more confident that we will achieve higher EURs, those wells are costing more than we previously estimated about $1.6 million more per well with 5,300 feet of completed lateral.
We want to gather more production data before making this design our standard, but hope to decide by the end of the year, so we can factor the decision into our 2012 capital budget. In fact, we are now far enough along in this process that we have decided to tweak our normal earnings call Q&A format. I'm going to ask the first question.
Pat, you can give the instructions to others in a moment. My question goes to Steve. Steve, can you please explain some of the specifics of this new completions design.

As you know last fall, we began testing a new frac design, which we hope both accelerated production and increased reserve recovery from our horizontal Marcellus wells.

As you know last fall, we began testing a new frac design, which we hope both accelerated production and increased reserve recovery from our horizontal Marcellus wells. We call this design our 30-foot cluster spacing test and the design basically involves using 150 foot frac stages with 30 feet between perforation clusters versus our standard design of 300 foot per stage, 300 feet per stage was 60 feet between perf clusters.
With this design, we pumped a same amount of water and sand per foot, as we do in the standard design, but we achieved double the injection rate per foot versus the standard. The theory behind this design is to focus the hydraulic energy into a smaller volume of rock thereby creating a more dense in this fractured network, and increasing the recovery factor for that volume of rock.
Additionally, we did expect to see accelerated production in addition to the increased recovery. As we noted on the last earnings call, and Dave just mentioned, we are seeing around 60% higher early time production rates from wells that used 30-foot cluster spacing design. But it will take a significant amount of time to accurately quantify the levels increased reserve recovery we’re seeing. That is still true and we don’t expect to be discussing levels of recovery or projected economics until the end of this year to earliest.
Today we’re posting two slide on our website which provide a little more. The first is a schematic showing the stage and cluster spacing for our standard and 30 foot cluster test wells. The second is the micro seismic survey we conducted on two parallel wells one with the standard frac design and one with the 30 foot cluster spacing. This survey was designed so that we have a third listening well located directly between the two test wells, which provided excellent data quality in the survey.
As you will see on the slide, the well with the 30 foot clusters achieved similar frac have lengths and total stimulated volume but had more than three times micro seismic events than the standard design. Well this is only circumstantial evidence, we’re encouraged that this supports the theory of creating a more dense fracture network. Much additional analysis is required before drawing economic conclusions about this design, but we continue to be encouraged by the results, we have seen and will continue to provide additional details as we continue the test.

I mean, we laid out a viable plan for a certain level of developments but that doesn't necessarily mean that that’s the optimum plan. So we certainly recognize an issue we're going to be dealing with is, if we wanted to ramp up development more we need to move further down that road.
So basically, though, we have gotten ourselves comfort that whether we had an independent midstream business or a midstream business that's associated with, we stay at the ceratin Sea Corp, an MLP is really a better way to raise the money for the midstream business.

So but we did reach the point where I think for competitive reasons, enough information was leaking out most of our competitors were fairly aware of what our design was, it was really no advantage to trying to keep it a secret any more. So that's why we decided to talk more about the specifics, I think we set our long, we won't be drawing conclusions for quite some time yet.
Regarding the cost, that’s a mixture of things, some is we’ve been experimenting with the dissent hasn't completely static the whole time, so we have been tweaking it some in the latest version and is a little bit more expensive than where we started. That combined with oil field inflation that we have seen since we started doing this contributed. And some of it’s just around because its involves a lot more activity on site in terms of setting plugs, and there is a lot of down time, honestly early on it was hard to estimate what the cost would be since a lot of service providers didn't really know how to price it. So now I think we have done enough, they know how they are going to price if we know what it’s going to cost, I think our cost metric is more sound now. So it is coming really right there first point go back. The reason we were providing details about this previously is for competitive reasons we really didn't have a great interest in sharing that with our competitors. We become aware and we know that that information eventually leaks out, but we thought why help the cost and we become aware over the last couple of months or so that through service providers et cetera that the information has gotten out to the point where frankly it’s probably only the investor community and analyst community that wasn't aware of what we were doing. So we figured that we should levelize the knowledge planning fields.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.19 per diluted share. Adjusting for the gain on the sale of the Big Sandy Pipeline which closed as expected on July 1st",1154,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.19 per diluted share. Adjusting for the gain on the sale of the Big Sandy Pipeline which closed as expected on July 1st EPS was $0.45 or an 88% increase over EPS in the third quarter of 2010.
The Big Sandy transaction resulted in a $111 million after tax gain. Operating cash flow, excluding the impact of the Big Sandy Pipeline sale, increased to a $190 million for the 2011 quarter, or by 44% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase in cash flow comes as the result of another outstanding operational quarter including record production and midstream volumes and continued low per unit operating cost. As a result of the Big Sandy gain, the gain on the sale of our Langley natural gas processing complex earlier in the year and our growth in volumes and organic operating income, we have become subject to the alternative minimum tax or AMT in 2011 and because of that we have started to pay some cash taxes again in 2011, about $36 million through the first three quarters.
Next year, assuming no additional transactions, we would expect to be back to be following the vast majority of our book income taxes. Other than that, the operating results this quarter are pretty straight forward and therefore my comments would be relatively brief.
EQT production operating results. At EQT production, sales volumes continue to grow at a record pace, the growth rate in the recently completed quarter was 51% over the third quarter of 2010. That growth rate was driven by sales from our Marcellus play, which contributed approximately 44% of the volumes in the quarter, up from only 19% in the quarter a year ago.
Gas prices were lower in the quarter consistent with lower NYMEX prices. At the corporate level, EQT received $5.25 per Mcfe compared $5.52 per Mcfe received last year. However, the realized price that EQT production was $4.02 per Mcfe compared to $3.81 per Mcfe last year. EQT productions realized price was higher in an overall lower price environment, due to the increase in the production mix from the Marcellus.
As we have discussed on recent calls, apart from the gathering rate midstream charges from Marcellus production is approximately half of the gathering rate for year on. That lower rate reflects the significantly lower cost to gather Marcellus gas.
Produce liquid mainly from our liquid-rich Huron accounted for 6% of the volumes and about 21% of the unhedged revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation, as it is currently mostly sold as methane.
Total operating expenses at production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE, and production taxes. However, unit LOE was flat with last year and unit production taxes were slightly higher as a result of recent property tax increases in the state of Virginia. We have also seen an increase in service costs as we finalize our contracts for next year. As a result we are increasing our cost for Marcellus well estimate from $6 million per well to $6.7 million per well. This cost for well, assumes 5300 foot of lateral pay and a standard frac design.
Moving on to the midstream results in the third quarter, operating income at midstream was up 16%, even with the loss of income from the Big Sandy sale. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges on Equitrans.
Gathering net revenues increased by $9.3 million as gathering volumes increased by 35%, while the average gathering rate declined by 13% again due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes. The average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percent of our total production mix. Specifically, the increase in Marcellus volumes where we experienced significant midstream economical scale drove over 26% decrease in midstream unit gathering and transmissions cost this quarter.
Transmission net revenues total $18.3 million. Equitrans, Marcellus expansion revenues were $7.3 million higher, nearly offsetting the $8.5 million in quarter on Big Sandy Pipeline revenues.
Storage, marketing, and other net revenues were down $6.6 million in the third quarter. Those results include a $4.4 million reduction in processing fees as we did not own the Langley natural gas complex during the third quarter of 2011, while we owned it for the full third quarter last year. As have been mentioned before, the storage, marketing, and marketing part of the midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those will continue to deteriorate year-over-year. Given current market conditions, we continue to estimate that full year 2011 net revenues in storage, marketing, and other will total approximately $50 million.
Operating expenses at midstream were $4.3 million lower quarter-over-quarter at $52.3 million, excluding the impacts of the sales of the Langley processing complex and the Big Sandy Pipeline operating expenses were up by $5.2 million consistent with our growth in the midstream business.
Just a quick note on the Big Sandy Pipeline sale, as previously discussed, in July we closed the $390 million sale of our (inaudible) Big Sandy Pipeline, we did record a pre-tax gain of approximately $180 million in the third quarter. The Big Sandy Pipeline sale did also impact our unit revenue realization. Transportation and processing revenue to EQT midstream went down by $0.14 per Mcfe, while third-party gathering, processing, and transportation expense increased by $0.14 per Mcfe in the third quarter.
And then finally, just a bit of guidance. Today we reiterated our production sales volume forecast for full year 2011 to be clean 190 and 195 Bcfe and we are likely be in the high-end of that range. We still expect that 2012 volumes will exceed 250 Bcfe and we will have more clarity on the 2012 volume guidance after we establish our capital budget in December.
As a result of the higher volume forecast, we are increasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2011 to approximately $875 million. As you know we also have raised approximately $620 million in pre-tax proceeds from the sale of Langley and Big Sandy were approximately $572 million after 2011 estimated cash tax payments.
So as a result, we have funded nearly all of our year-to-date CapEx with the presence from the sales and operating cash flow. We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion credit facility. So along with the 2011 cash flow forecast, which by the way is more than 75% higher than in 2009, the last time we issued debt. We remain in a great position from both the balance sheet and a liquidity standpoint.
And with that I will turn the call over to Dave Porges.

My congratulations to our production team, our midstream team, and our commercial team for producing these volumes, gettin",1524,"Thank you Phil. Our team put up another great quarter. 50% growth in sales of produced natural gas versus last year is quite a feat. My congratulations to our production team, our midstream team, and our commercial team for producing these volumes, getting them to market, and selling them. These growth rates, we have experienced slightly, also played strengths on various of our functional group, everything from procurement, human resources, IT, in the front-end, to accounting, land administration and yes, legal as we move through the process of getting this gas to market and selling it. They are performing admirably and I am proud to be associated with this company as we execute against this growth strategy.
Since Phil reviewed the quarter, I will dive right into an update on our midstream structure review, the only topic of my prepared remarks.
Last quarter, I laid out a framework for our midstream strategy, in which we discussed three main options. The first was to sell our midstream assets and outsource our midstream needs. The second was to stay with the current model of building needed midstream systems and occasionally selling seasoned assets, most like to MLPs. We call this build, fill, sell and it did work this year.
Our third option was to create our own MLP, with or without a partner.
Since the last call we have been more clearly defining the midstream growth opportunity built around our extensive gathering and transmission assets in the Marcellus region. As a result of this and further study of our alternatives, we are currently focusing most of our efforts on two alternatives. We have concluded that the operational benefits of controlling the timing location and size of incremental gathering and Equitrans expansions provide value to EQT Corporation beyond the direct returns made from these investments. Therefore, we do not currently plan to exit the midstream business. There is a price for anything, still it must be clear from listening to the commentary from all of us who are large Marcellus producers. These growth rates put a lot of stress on infrastructure.
Well it is not possible to eliminate these bottlenecks given such growth, we are convinced that the best way for us to mitigate the risks includes maintaining capabilities and at least a certain amount of control in building our infrastructure. Of course even with these capabilities, one needs commercial skills, involved and dealing with long line pipes and then marketing. And this is the reason that we have been securing firm transport as one example for future pipeline projects.
However, we believe, we also benefit from maintaining our ability to design, construct, and operate pipelines in compressor stations. Our midstream and upstream teams work closely together to assure that the take away capacity matches the pace of development and we would like to maintain that strength. As our development activities bring us into areas of these place, in which acreage is more fragmented, we will be clearly be contracting with other midstream firms to gather and compress some of our produced volumes. So, we are not saying must control all of our own midstream, rather we are saying that we want the ability to build out our own infrastructure to be one of the alternatives available to us.
This reality tends to push an outright sale down our list at least during the near to medium term. Now the primary reason for not pursuing one of the midstream strategies that involves more control and coordination would be the availability of capital. We cannot have a midstream, a medium-term plan that diverts material amounts of capital from reserve development to infrastructure. In short, we still need other people’s money for this strategy to work. So, we examine the other alternatives to see how well they meet those needs.
As we work through the implications of our build, fill, sell approach, which does provide for control and coordination during the critical build out phase and does utilize other people’s money, once individual projects are built. We have also concluded that this approach is not likely to be ideal for development in the Marcellus region. It may work for certain systems, but there appears to be too many circumstances in which somewhat discrete gathering systems interact with each other to a sufficient extent, but it would problematical to have separate owners. This is clearly a judgment call. But, as we see things now it seems less than ideal to in the words of one of our advisors, Swiss cheese, our midstream business in this place.
Realistically, we wish to keep our future structural alternatives open and this also does less well on that score. So build, fill, sell may well be employed again on occasion but it is not currently our preferred approach for Marcellus midstream. At this point you must be wondering how we have two options since we started with three and I have downgraded likelihood of two of them. It is the new math.
More seriously, since the last call we have devoted more time to the third alternative which described as an MLP and/or partner. We have realized that this was really tactical alternative and the strategic issue is that we are sufficiently persuaded as to the benefit of some control and as to the economic proposition of midstream investment in this region that we should see how we can pursue it, even though that must mean, using some form of other people’s money.
MLPs and JVs are both forms of OPM and of course JVs themselves can take many forms. So our current efforts are focused on working through the various separate entity alternatives to see which best meets our needs. We still wish to reach a conclusion around year end, but the real timing driver is to implement something in 2012, so that we can pursue some of these midstream opportunities without diverting capital from upstream development.  
It may be helpful for you to understand our thought process a bit as, we continue this analysis. One issue that has led us in this direction is a desire for flexibility and timing monetization of assets. This flexibility is beneficial from both the cash flow perspective and in tax management and it seems easier to accomplish, if we use a related but separate entity rather than being solely dependent upon the asset sale market as with build, fill, sell.
Our second issue relates to the interconnectivity of these Marcellus area systems. Monetizing multiple assets using a single related entity helps levy concerns about this. Eventually related assets would end up in the same entity, so there may be a transition period when some part of an asset has been monetized but the other parts have not. This is also difficult to achieve in build, fill, sell without sacrificing value or operational efficiency.
Our third issue is that one other concerns with committing to a separate entity is their need for visible growth opportunities. However, as we look at our existing assets and the assets necessary to support the rate of development that we expect, there seem to be visible growth opportunities for quite some time.
Now increasingly these opportunities will involve new systems that are not solely or perhaps even largely dependent upon EQT produced volumes, given the fragmented nature of the acreage positions. However, that will nearly be one of the realities that we will need to factor into our decision on which tactic to employ. We don’t wish to overstate how much we know about the tactics we wish to employ. We have certainly started the process of getting smarter about MLPs and we have had some discussions with potentially credible JV partners.
Still there is more for us to learn about the various alternatives and we are doing what we can to better to find the benefits and the risks of those alternatives. Obviously, some of the most significant tradeoffs involve cost of capital versus certainty of capital and control over the issues that matter most to us versus the ability to augment our skill set to best pursue the available opportunities. Accordingly, we are doing our best to work through the pros and cons of the various factors.
Earlier this year, we communicated a longer term goal to achieve organic volumetric and cash flow growth north of 30% per annum in production over the five-year period from 2011 through 2015 and associated cash flow growth in the midstream by investing a little more than a $1 billion in external capital from 2011 through 2013 without taping the equity market.
Our asset sales to date in use of our available debt capacity should allow us to meet that goal rather comfortably. Still these growth rates and funding needs are based on the assumption of building the needed midstream using EQT capital. When we calibrate the proceeds of alternative financing for midstream we expect to be in a position to increase these growth forecasts to reflect the acceleration of our Marcellus development.
Thank you in advance for your patience and continued support and with that I will turn the call back over Pat.

Our current thinking is it's likely that we are going to find areas where the new technique is clearly beneficial from an economic standpoint, I think we're going to find some areas where it just doesn't meet our economic thresholds, certainly at current prices and obviously that threshold moves as gas prices move.

So, we wait until a pad has got the bulk of its wells ready to go before we move a rig. So that dictates a little bit and we also strongly prefer to drill where we are going to move the gas immediately.
So, targeting our rigs to go to the areas where the capacity is ready to go is probably the primary dictator where we put our rigs. And that changes over time. So, if you take a snapshot at any given time, we might have a lot of rigs in Tier-1 or we might have most of our rigs in Tiers 2 or 3. It’s what’s going to get us the most - the best return for our investment in any given time.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.19 per diluted share. Adjusting for the gain on the sale of the Big Sandy Pipeline, which closed as expected on July 1,",1148,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.19 per diluted share. Adjusting for the gain on the sale of the Big Sandy Pipeline, which closed as expected on July 1, EPS was $0.45 or an 88% increase over EPS in the third quarter of 2010.
The Big Sandy transaction resulted in a $111 million after-tax gain. Operating cash flow, excluding the impact of the Big Sandy Pipeline sale, increased to $190 million for the 2011 quarter or by 44% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase in cash flow comes as a result of another outstanding operational quarter, including record production and midstream volumes and continued low per-unit operating cost. As a result of the Big Sandy gain, the gain on the sale of our Langley natural gas processing complex earlier in the year and our growth in volumes and organic operating income, we have become subject to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, in 2011, and because of that, we have started to pay some cash taxes again in 2011, about $36 million through the first 3 quarters.
Next year, assuming no additional transactions, we would expect to be back to deferring the vast majority of our book income taxes. Other than that, the operating results this quarter are pretty straightforward, and therefore, my comments will be relatively brief.
EQT Production operating results. At EQT Production, sales volumes continue to grow at a record pace. The growth rate in the recently completed quarter was 51% over the third quarter of 2010. That growth rate was driven by sales from our Marcellus play, which contributed approximately 44% of the volumes in the quarter, up from only 19% in the quarter a year ago.
Gas prices were lower in the quarter, consistent with lower NYMEX prices. At the corporate level, EQT received $5.25 per Mcfe compared to $5.52 per Mcfe received last year. However, the realized price at EQT Production was $4.02 per Mcfe compared to $3.81 per Mcfe last year. EQT Production's realized price was higher in an overall lower price environment due to the increase in the production mix from the Marcellus.
As we have discussed on recent calls, apart from the gathering rate, midstream charges from Marcellus production is approximately half of the gathering rate for Huron. That lower rate reflects the significantly lower cost to gather Marcellus gas.
Produced liquid mainly from our liquid-rich Huron accounted for 6% of the volumes and about 21% of the unhedged revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation as it is currently mostly sold as methane.
Total operating expenses at Production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE and production taxes. However, unit LOE was flat with last year, and unit production taxes were slightly higher as a result of recent property tax increases in the state of Virginia. We've also seen an increase in service costs as we finalize our contracts for next year. As a result, we are increasing our cost for Marcellus well estimate from $6 million per well to $6.7 million per well. This cost per well assumes 5,300 foot of lateral pay and a standard frac design.
Moving on to the Midstream results in the third quarter, operating income at Midstream was up 16%, even with the loss of income from the Big Sandy sale. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges on Equitrans.
Gathering net revenues increased by $9.3 million as gathering volumes increased by 35%, while the average gathering rate declined by 13%, again due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes. The average gathering rate paid by EQT Production will continue to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percent of our total production mix. Specifically, the increase in Marcellus volumes where we experienced significant midstream economies of scale drove a 26% decrease in Midstream's unit gathering and transmissions cost this quarter.
Transmission net revenues total $18.3 million. Equitrans, Marcellus expansion revenues were $7.3 million higher, nearly offsetting the $8.5 million in the quarter on Big Sandy Pipeline revenues.
Storage, marketing, and other net revenues were down $6.6 million in the third quarter. Those results include a $4.4 million reduction in processing fees as we did not own the Langley natural gas complex during the third quarter of 2011, while we owned it for the full third quarter last year. As have been mentioned before, the storage, marketing -- and marketing part of the Midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve, and those have continued to deteriorate year-over-year. Given current market conditions, we continue to estimate that full year 2011 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $50 million.
Operating expenses at Midstream were $4.3 million lower quarter-over-quarter at $52.3 million. Excluding the impacts of the sales of the Langley processing complex and the Big Sandy Pipeline, operating expenses were up by $5.2 million, consistent with our growth in the Midstream business.
Just a quick note on the Big Sandy Pipeline sale, as previously discussed, in July, we closed the $390 million sale of our [indiscernible] Big Sandy Pipeline. We did record a pretax gain of approximately $180 million in the third quarter. The Big Sandy Pipeline sale did also impact our unit revenue realization. Transportation and processing revenue to EQT Midstream went down by $0.14 per Mcfe, while third-party gathering, processing and transportation expense increased by $0.14 per Mcfe in the third quarter.
And then finally, just a bit of guidance, today, we reiterated our production sales volume forecast for full year 2011 to between 190 and 195 Bcfe, and we are likely be in the high end of that range. We still expect that 2012 volumes will exceed 250 Bcfe, and we'll have more clarity on the 2012 volume guidance after we establish our capital budget in December.
As a result of the higher volume forecast, we are increasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2011 to approximately $875 million. As you know, we also have raised approximately $620 million in pretax proceeds from the sale of Langley and Big Sandy or approximately $572 million after 2011 estimated cash tax payments. So as a result, we have funded nearly all of our year-to-date CapEx with the proceeds from those sales and operating cash flow. 
We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion credit facility. So along with the 2011 cash flow forecast, which, by the way, is more than 75% higher than in 2009, the last time we issued debt, we remain in a great position from both a balance sheet and a liquidity standpoint.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."

Our team put up another great quarter. 50% growth in sales of produced natural gas versus last year is quite a feat. My congratulations to our Production team, our Midstream team and our Commercial team for producing these volumes, getting them to market and selling them. These growth rates we've experienced lately also place strains on various of our functional groups, everything from procurement, human resources and IT in the front-end, to accounting, land administration and yes, legal as we move through the process of getting this gas to market and selling it. They are performing admirably, and I'm proud to be associated with this company as we execute against this growth strategy.
Since Phil reviewed the quarter, I will dive right into an update on our Midstream structure review, the only topic of my prepared remarks.
Last quarter, I laid out a framework for our Midstream strategy, in which we discussed 3 main options. The first was to sell our Midstream assets and outsource our Midstream needs. The second was to stay with the current model of building needed Midstream systems and occasionally selling seasoned assets, most likely to MLPs. We call this build, fill, sell, and it did work this year. Our third option was to create our own MLP with or without a partner.
Since the last call, we have been more clearly defining the Midstream growth opportunity built around our extensive gathering and transmission assets in the Marcellus region. As a result of this and further study of our alternatives, we are currently focusing most of our efforts on 2 alternatives. We have concluded that the operational benefits of controlling the timing, location and size of incremental gathering and Equitrans expansions provide value to EQT Corporation beyond the direct returns made from these investments. Therefore, we do not currently plan to exit the Midstream business. There is a price for anything. Still, as must be clear from listening to the commentary from all of us who are large Marcellus producers, these growth rates put a lot of stress on infrastructure.
While it is not possible to eliminate these bottlenecks given such growth, we are convinced that the best way for us to mitigate the risks includes maintaining capabilities and at least a certain amount of control in building our infrastructure. Of course, even with these capabilities, one needs commercial skills involved and dealing with long line pipes and in marketing. And this is the reason that we have been securing firm transport as one example for future pipeline projects.
However, we believe we also benefit from maintaining our ability to design, construct and operate pipelines and compressor stations. Our midstream and upstream teams work closely together to assure that the takeaway capacity matches the pace of development, and we would like to maintain that strength. As our development activities bring us into areas of these plays in which acreage is more fragmented, we will clearly be contracting with other midstream firms to gather and compress some of our produced volumes. So we are not saying that we must control all of our own midstream, rather, we are saying that we want the ability to build out our own infrastructure to be one of the alternatives available to us.
This reality tends to push an outright sale down our list at least during the near to medium term. Now the primary reason for not pursuing one of the midstream strategies that involves more control and coordination would be the availability of capital. We cannot have a midstream -- a medium-term plan that diverts material amounts of capital from reserved development to infrastructure. In short, we still need other people’s money for this strategy to work. So we examined the other alternatives to see how well they meet those needs.
As we worked through the implications of our build, fill, sell approach, which does provide for control and coordination during the critical build-out phase and does utilize other people’s money once individual projects are built, we have also concluded that this approach is not likely to be ideal for development in the Marcellus region. It may work for certain systems, but there appears to be too many circumstances in which somewhat discrete gathering systems interact with each other to a sufficient extent, but it would be problematical to have separate owners. This is clearly a judgment call, but as we see things now, it seems less than ideal to, in the words of one of our advisors, Swiss cheese our midstream business in these plays.
Realistically, we wish to keep our future structural alternatives open, and this also does less well on that score. So build, fill, sell may well be employed again on occasion, but it is not currently our preferred approach for Marcellus midstream. At this point, you must be wondering how we have 2 options since we started with 3 and have downgraded likelihood of 2 of them. It's the new math.
More seriously, since the last call, we have devoted more time to the third alternative, which we described as an MLP and/or partner. We've realized that this was really a tactical alternative, and the strategic issue is that we are sufficiently persuaded as to the benefit of some control and as to the economic proposition of midstream investment in this region that we should see how we can pursue it, even though that must mean using some form of other people’s money.
MLPs and JVs are both forms of OPM, and of course, JVs themselves can take many forms. So our current efforts are focused on working through the various separate entity alternatives to see which best meets our needs. We still wish to reach a conclusion around year end, but the real timing driver is to implement something in 2012 so that we can pursue some of these midstream opportunities without diverting capital from upstream development.  
It may be helpful for you to understand our thought process a bit as we continue this analysis. One issue that has led us in this direction is a desire for flexibility and timing monetization of assets. This flexibility is beneficial from both a cash flow perspective and in tax management, and it seems easier to accomplish if we use a related but separate entity rather than being solely dependent upon the asset sale market as with build, fill, sell.
Our second issue relates to the interconnectivity of these Marcellus area systems. Monetizing multiple assets using a single related entity helps alleviate concerns about this. Eventually, related assets would end up in the same entity, so there may be a transition period when some part of an asset has been monetized but other parts have not. This is also difficult to achieve in build, fill, sell without sacrificing value or operational efficiency.
Our third issue is that one of the concerns with committing to a separate entity is their need for visible growth opportunities. However, as we look at our existing assets and the assets necessary to support the rate of development that we expect, there seem to be visible growth opportunities for quite some time.
Now increasingly, these opportunities will involve new systems that are not solely or perhaps even largely dependent upon EQT's produced volumes, given the fragmented nature of the acreage positions. However, that will nearly be one of the realities that we will need to factor into our decision on which tactic to employ. We do not wish to overstate how much we know about the tactics we wish to employ. We have certainly started the process of getting smarter about MLPs, and we've had some discussions with potentially credible JV partners.
Still, there is more for us to learn about the various alternatives, and we are doing what we can to better define the benefits and the risks of those alternatives. Obviously, some of the most significant tradeoffs involve cost of capital versus certainty of capital and control over the issues that matter most to us versus the ability to augment our skill set to best pursue the available opportunities. Accordingly, we are doing our best to work through the pros and cons of the various factors.
Earlier this year, we communicated a longer-term goal to achieve organic volumetric and cash flow growth north of 30% per annum in Production over the 5-year period from 2011 through 2015 and associated cash flow growth in the Midstream by investing a little more than $1 billion in external capital from 2011 through 2013 without tapping the equity market.
Our asset sales to date and use of our available debt capacity should allow us to meet that goal rather comfortably. Still, these growth rates and funding needs are based on the assumption of building the needed midstream using EQT capital. When we calibrate the proceeds of alternative financing for midstream, we expect to be in a position to increase these growth forecast to reflect the acceleration of our Marcellus development.
Thank you in advance for your patience and continued support, and with that, I'll turn the call back over Pat."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.19 per diluted share. Adjusting for the gain on the sale of the Big Sandy Pipeline, which closed as expected on July 1,",1148,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.19 per diluted share. Adjusting for the gain on the sale of the Big Sandy Pipeline, which closed as expected on July 1, EPS was $0.45 or an 88% increase over EPS in the third quarter of 2010.
The Big Sandy transaction resulted in a $111 million after-tax gain. Operating cash flow, excluding the impact of the Big Sandy Pipeline sale, increased to $190 million for the 2011 quarter or by 44% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase in cash flow comes as a result of another outstanding operational quarter, including record production and midstream volumes and continued low per-unit operating cost. As a result of the Big Sandy gain, the gain on the sale of our Langley natural gas processing complex earlier in the year and our growth in volumes and organic operating income, we have become subject to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, in 2011, and because of that, we have started to pay some cash taxes again in 2011, about $36 million through the first 3 quarters.
Next year, assuming no additional transactions, we would expect to be back to deferring the vast majority of our book income taxes. Other than that, the operating results this quarter are pretty straightforward, and therefore, my comments will be relatively brief.
EQT Production operating results. At EQT Production, sales volumes continue to grow at a record pace. The growth rate in the recently completed quarter was 51% over the third quarter of 2010. That growth rate was driven by sales from our Marcellus play, which contributed approximately 44% of the volumes in the quarter, up from only 19% in the quarter a year ago.
Gas prices were lower in the quarter, consistent with lower NYMEX prices. At the corporate level, EQT received $5.25 per Mcfe compared to $5.52 per Mcfe received last year. However, the realized price at EQT Production was $4.02 per Mcfe compared to $3.81 per Mcfe last year. EQT Production's realized price was higher in an overall lower price environment due to the increase in the production mix from the Marcellus.
As we have discussed on recent calls, apart from the gathering rate, midstream charges from Marcellus production is approximately half of the gathering rate for Huron. That lower rate reflects the significantly lower cost to gather Marcellus gas.
Produced liquid mainly from our liquid-rich Huron accounted for 6% of the volumes and about 21% of the unhedged revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation as it is currently mostly sold as methane.
Total operating expenses at Production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE and production taxes. However, unit LOE was flat with last year, and unit production taxes were slightly higher as a result of recent property tax increases in the state of Virginia. We've also seen an increase in service costs as we finalize our contracts for next year. As a result, we are increasing our cost for Marcellus well estimate from $6 million per well to $6.7 million per well. This cost per well assumes 5,300 foot of lateral pay and a standard frac design.
Moving on to the Midstream results in the third quarter, operating income at Midstream was up 16%, even with the loss of income from the Big Sandy sale. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges on Equitrans.
Gathering net revenues increased by $9.3 million as gathering volumes increased by 35%, while the average gathering rate declined by 13%, again due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes. The average gathering rate paid by EQT Production will continue to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percent of our total production mix. Specifically, the increase in Marcellus volumes where we experienced significant midstream economies of scale drove a 26% decrease in Midstream's unit gathering and transmissions cost this quarter.
Transmission net revenues total $18.3 million. Equitrans, Marcellus expansion revenues were $7.3 million higher, nearly offsetting the $8.5 million in the quarter on Big Sandy Pipeline revenues.
Storage, marketing, and other net revenues were down $6.6 million in the third quarter. Those results include a $4.4 million reduction in processing fees as we did not own the Langley natural gas complex during the third quarter of 2011, while we owned it for the full third quarter last year. As have been mentioned before, the storage, marketing -- and marketing part of the Midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve, and those have continued to deteriorate year-over-year. Given current market conditions, we continue to estimate that full year 2011 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $50 million.
Operating expenses at Midstream were $4.3 million lower quarter-over-quarter at $52.3 million. Excluding the impacts of the sales of the Langley processing complex and the Big Sandy Pipeline, operating expenses were up by $5.2 million, consistent with our growth in the Midstream business.
Just a quick note on the Big Sandy Pipeline sale, as previously discussed, in July, we closed the $390 million sale of our [indiscernible] Big Sandy Pipeline. We did record a pretax gain of approximately $180 million in the third quarter. The Big Sandy Pipeline sale did also impact our unit revenue realization. Transportation and processing revenue to EQT Midstream went down by $0.14 per Mcfe, while third-party gathering, processing and transportation expense increased by $0.14 per Mcfe in the third quarter.
And then finally, just a bit of guidance, today, we reiterated our production sales volume forecast for full year 2011 to between 190 and 195 Bcfe, and we are likely be in the high end of that range. We still expect that 2012 volumes will exceed 250 Bcfe, and we'll have more clarity on the 2012 volume guidance after we establish our capital budget in December.
As a result of the higher volume forecast, we are increasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2011 to approximately $875 million. As you know, we also have raised approximately $620 million in pretax proceeds from the sale of Langley and Big Sandy or approximately $572 million after 2011 estimated cash tax payments. So as a result, we have funded nearly all of our year-to-date CapEx with the proceeds from those sales and operating cash flow. 
We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion credit facility. So along with the 2011 cash flow forecast, which, by the way, is more than 75% higher than in 2009, the last time we issued debt, we remain in a great position from both a balance sheet and a liquidity standpoint.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."

Our team put up another great quarter. 50% growth in sales of produced natural gas versus last year is quite a feat. My congratulations to our Production team, our Midstream team and our Commercial team for producing these volumes, getting them to market and selling them. These growth rates we've experienced lately also place strains on various of our functional groups, everything from procurement, human resources and IT in the front-end, to accounting, land administration and yes, legal as we move through the process of getting this gas to market and selling it. They are performing admirably, and I'm proud to be associated with this company as we execute against this growth strategy.
Since Phil reviewed the quarter, I will dive right into an update on our Midstream structure review, the only topic of my prepared remarks.
Last quarter, I laid out a framework for our Midstream strategy, in which we discussed 3 main options. The first was to sell our Midstream assets and outsource our Midstream needs. The second was to stay with the current model of building needed Midstream systems and occasionally selling seasoned assets, most likely to MLPs. We call this build, fill, sell, and it did work this year. Our third option was to create our own MLP with or without a partner.
Since the last call, we have been more clearly defining the Midstream growth opportunity built around our extensive gathering and transmission assets in the Marcellus region. As a result of this and further study of our alternatives, we are currently focusing most of our efforts on 2 alternatives. We have concluded that the operational benefits of controlling the timing, location and size of incremental gathering and Equitrans expansions provide value to EQT Corporation beyond the direct returns made from these investments. Therefore, we do not currently plan to exit the Midstream business. There is a price for anything. Still, as must be clear from listening to the commentary from all of us who are large Marcellus producers, these growth rates put a lot of stress on infrastructure.
While it is not possible to eliminate these bottlenecks given such growth, we are convinced that the best way for us to mitigate the risks includes maintaining capabilities and at least a certain amount of control in building our infrastructure. Of course, even with these capabilities, one needs commercial skills involved and dealing with long line pipes and in marketing. And this is the reason that we have been securing firm transport as one example for future pipeline projects.
However, we believe we also benefit from maintaining our ability to design, construct and operate pipelines and compressor stations. Our midstream and upstream teams work closely together to assure that the takeaway capacity matches the pace of development, and we would like to maintain that strength. As our development activities bring us into areas of these plays in which acreage is more fragmented, we will clearly be contracting with other midstream firms to gather and compress some of our produced volumes. So we are not saying that we must control all of our own midstream, rather, we are saying that we want the ability to build out our own infrastructure to be one of the alternatives available to us.
This reality tends to push an outright sale down our list at least during the near to medium term. Now the primary reason for not pursuing one of the midstream strategies that involves more control and coordination would be the availability of capital. We cannot have a midstream -- a medium-term plan that diverts material amounts of capital from reserved development to infrastructure. In short, we still need other people’s money for this strategy to work. So we examined the other alternatives to see how well they meet those needs.
As we worked through the implications of our build, fill, sell approach, which does provide for control and coordination during the critical build-out phase and does utilize other people’s money once individual projects are built, we have also concluded that this approach is not likely to be ideal for development in the Marcellus region. It may work for certain systems, but there appears to be too many circumstances in which somewhat discrete gathering systems interact with each other to a sufficient extent, but it would be problematical to have separate owners. This is clearly a judgment call, but as we see things now, it seems less than ideal to, in the words of one of our advisors, Swiss cheese our midstream business in these plays.
Realistically, we wish to keep our future structural alternatives open, and this also does less well on that score. So build, fill, sell may well be employed again on occasion, but it is not currently our preferred approach for Marcellus midstream. At this point, you must be wondering how we have 2 options since we started with 3 and have downgraded likelihood of 2 of them. It's the new math.
More seriously, since the last call, we have devoted more time to the third alternative, which we described as an MLP and/or partner. We've realized that this was really a tactical alternative, and the strategic issue is that we are sufficiently persuaded as to the benefit of some control and as to the economic proposition of midstream investment in this region that we should see how we can pursue it, even though that must mean using some form of other people’s money.
MLPs and JVs are both forms of OPM, and of course, JVs themselves can take many forms. So our current efforts are focused on working through the various separate entity alternatives to see which best meets our needs. We still wish to reach a conclusion around year end, but the real timing driver is to implement something in 2012 so that we can pursue some of these midstream opportunities without diverting capital from upstream development.  
It may be helpful for you to understand our thought process a bit as we continue this analysis. One issue that has led us in this direction is a desire for flexibility and timing monetization of assets. This flexibility is beneficial from both a cash flow perspective and in tax management, and it seems easier to accomplish if we use a related but separate entity rather than being solely dependent upon the asset sale market as with build, fill, sell.
Our second issue relates to the interconnectivity of these Marcellus area systems. Monetizing multiple assets using a single related entity helps alleviate concerns about this. Eventually, related assets would end up in the same entity, so there may be a transition period when some part of an asset has been monetized but other parts have not. This is also difficult to achieve in build, fill, sell without sacrificing value or operational efficiency.
Our third issue is that one of the concerns with committing to a separate entity is their need for visible growth opportunities. However, as we look at our existing assets and the assets necessary to support the rate of development that we expect, there seem to be visible growth opportunities for quite some time.
Now increasingly, these opportunities will involve new systems that are not solely or perhaps even largely dependent upon EQT's produced volumes, given the fragmented nature of the acreage positions. However, that will nearly be one of the realities that we will need to factor into our decision on which tactic to employ. We do not wish to overstate how much we know about the tactics we wish to employ. We have certainly started the process of getting smarter about MLPs, and we've had some discussions with potentially credible JV partners.
Still, there is more for us to learn about the various alternatives, and we are doing what we can to better define the benefits and the risks of those alternatives. Obviously, some of the most significant tradeoffs involve cost of capital versus certainty of capital and control over the issues that matter most to us versus the ability to augment our skill set to best pursue the available opportunities. Accordingly, we are doing our best to work through the pros and cons of the various factors.
Earlier this year, we communicated a longer-term goal to achieve organic volumetric and cash flow growth north of 30% per annum in Production over the 5-year period from 2011 through 2015 and associated cash flow growth in the Midstream by investing a little more than $1 billion in external capital from 2011 through 2013 without tapping the equity market.
Our asset sales to date and use of our available debt capacity should allow us to meet that goal rather comfortably. Still, these growth rates and funding needs are based on the assumption of building the needed midstream using EQT capital. When we calibrate the proceeds of alternative financing for midstream, we expect to be in a position to increase these growth forecast to reflect the acceleration of our Marcellus development.
Thank you in advance for your patience and continued support, and with that, I'll turn the call back over Pat."

I think as we mentioned before, we generally are seeing higher initial rates. The decline curves we've seen so far for the most part are encouraging and along the lines of what we expected to see. Maybe the one bit of color I can provide at this point is, and it's still even preliminary for this, but our current thinking is it's likely that we're going to find areas where the new technique is clearly beneficial from an economic standpoint. I think we're going to find some areas where it just doesn't meet our economic thresholds, certainly at current prices, and obviously, that threshold moves as gas prices move. And then I think there's going to be some areas where it's going to take quite a bit more time for us to really define where it falls on the economic spectrum. So that's sort of our current thinking on that, but I really can't give you any more data right now."
