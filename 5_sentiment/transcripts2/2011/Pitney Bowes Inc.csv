Please note that we have provided slides related to the guidance discussion as part of the webcast found in the Investor Relations section of the Pitney Bowes website. After the presentation, we will take your questions. 
As we anticipated, 2010 was a year in which we had stronger performance in the second half of the year as we saw some initial signs of stabilization in various sectors and geographies. During the year, we continued to execute our strategic transformation program in order to lay the foundation for sustained growth and value creation for customers and shareholders alike.
Our transformation initiatives are giving us a more variable cost structure, improved customer processes and infrastructure, as well as greater financial flexibility to continue investing in our future. 
Our fourth quarter performance reflects our overall journey to transform the business for enhanced growth. During the quarter, against the backdrop of an uneven global business climate, we continued to make investments in new technologies, enhance the customer experience and streamline our operations. The benefits from our ongoing actions also helps position us for future growth in our Small and Medium Business and our Enterprise Business Solutions groups.
One key milestone in improving the trends for the core business during the quarter was year-over-year improvement in equipment sales. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year equipment sales growth in our global SMB operations and on a consolidated basis. Growth in equipment sales in the second half of the year was paced by customer retention gains and new product placements led by our Connect+ web-based communication system. In fact, Connect+ placements represented about 20% of U.S. Mailing equipment sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to roll out Connect+ throughout Europe and Canada in 2011.
Another positive indicator for our SMB group was the continued moderation in the decline of financial revenue, resulting in its lowest rate of decline in overall revenue in eight quarters. 
During the quarter, enterprise business solutions group had positive year-over-year revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, driven by good performance and production mail, Software and Mail Services.
In our Software business, it is a testament to the growing demand for analytics and customer communication management Software that we are able to grow revenue while continuing to build our recurring revenue streams through more multi-year licensing agreement. The majority of our larger Software sales were at multi-year agreement, which will benefit stream revenues in future periods. Software revenue would have grown at double-digit pace if these variables have been sold as one-time licenses. Our investments in digital and cloud-based solutions like Connect+ and our recently introduced Volly, secured digital mail system are helping us lay the foundation for sustained growth and value to customers and shareholders. 
Throughout the coming year, we will continue to deliver more new solutions, which will help SMB and enterprise customers manage their physical and digital communications with their customers. 
We continued to have excellent free cash flow for the quarter of $289 million and $961 million for the year. We are pleased to note that our Board has taken to actions which will result in enhanced results for our shareholders. For the 29th consecutive year, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. The dividend will increase to $0.37 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The Board also approved an increase of $100 million to our share repurchase authorization of $50 million for a total of $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full-year financial results. Mike?"

Our revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, a 3% decline on both the reported and a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we provided. Revenue was $1.4 billion for the quarter, a decline of about 1% when compared with the prior year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 2%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
I also want to note that we had a reclass between two revenue lines during the quarter. We reclassified $4 million in revenue from rentals to financing. The revenue was associated with the bundling of fees from our meter customer to access our purchase power product. The reclassification was related to revenue in both 2009 and 2010.
Excluding this reclassification, financing revenue would have declined 5%, a moderation from previous declines, and rentals revenue would have declined 7% in line with our recent experience.
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, our EBIT for the quarter was $258 million, which was about 1% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 40 basis points better than last year. We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives both in the cost of revenue lines and in our selling, general and administrative costs or SG&A. In particular, SG&A costs will reduce significantly this quarter. 
SG&A in the quarter declined by about $23 million when compared with the prior year. And for the first time this year, SG&A improved as a percentage of revenue, a decline of 110 basis points to 31.8% when compared to the prior year. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen throughout the year. For the year, SG&A cost declined by $36 million on a reported basis and $57 million on an organic basis.
EBIT margins improved year-over-year in four of our seven business segments for the quarter and five of our seven business segments for the year. These improvements are the result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our business segments.
Strategic transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. Plus, we are putting in new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth. 
When we had back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $330 million or $1.62 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $51 million, an increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.23%, about 22 basis points higher than the prior year due to lower commercial paper balances. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.0%. This was higher than the tax rate and adjusted earnings last year which was 32.1%. The higher tax rate in the quarter was the result of the mix of business between the U.S. and international operations. The average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.2%. 
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 39.5%, and the tax rate for the year was 38.5%. Right on deferred tax assets associated with stock compensation are included in these rates. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.66, which was $0.02 higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 for the same period last year. 
Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter. 
For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23, which exceeded our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.22. Current exchange rates increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.02 for the year. 
GAAP earnings per share included pretax, restructuring and asset impairment charges that totaled $79 million in the quarter and $182 million for the year. This represented $0.27 per share in the quarter and $0.59 per share for the year.
GAAP EPS also included $0.83 tax charge for out of money stock option that expired during the quarter. For the year, there was a $0.13 tax charge related primarily to out of the money stock options that expired during the year and to healthcare legislation that was enacted at the beginning of the year. Additionally, GAAP EPS included the $0.05 and a $0.09 per share losses from discontinued operations in the quarter and the year respectively.
Free cash flow was $289 million for the quarter and $961 million for the year, which exceeded our annual guidance of $700 million to $800 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from improved working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
During the quarter, we returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and $320 million for the year. As noted in the press release, the Board of Directors approved an expansion of $100 million to the company's share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $50 million to $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the third quarter by about $82 million to a balance of $50 million. About 85% of our total debt is fixed rate and 15% is floating rate. 
Let me now highlight a few points about our strategic transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we continued to accelerate the implementation of initiatives, identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that will be implemented throughout 2011. 
During the fourth quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $79 million included $24 million for pension and retiree medical curtailment related charges. The remaining pretax restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 340 positions across the company.
We are achieving greater net savings than was originally anticipated from our Strategic Transformation program, the result of identifying incremental opportunities and disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved benefits of approximately $120 million for the full year net of system and related investments. And now, we expect total benefits from the program to be about $100 million more than originally targeted. We are now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and expect the full annualized run rate of benefit in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now murray will discuss our guidance. Murray?"

In 2011, we expect a business economic environment characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and by geography. While businesses are still more cautious with spending, especially on the SMB solutions group, our experience in the second half of the year shows they have become more willing to invest in solutions that help them grow their business and enhance their efficiency. It is against this backdrop that we project a return to revenue growth in 2011 due in part to a number of initiatives designed to stabilize our base business and to drive new growth opportunities.
Let's turn to the first Slide. We expect 2011 revenue excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of flat to 3% growth as compared to 2010's 3% decline. I noted our two consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in equipment sales earlier. We anticipate continued improvement in equipment sales during 2011 driven in part by the positive outlook for sales of new solutions like the Connect+ communication system and continued positive growth in production mail.
We also expect growth in several other areas in 2011. These include growth in Software revenue due to the increasing demand for term-based licenses of CCM Software solutions; expansion in mail services; and new CCM solutions across our enterprise business portfolio. 
As we have previously discussed, lower equipment sales during previous years will continue to affect financing, rental and supplies revenue streams. However, we expect moderating declines in these recurring revenue streams, related to our SMB solutions group as equipment sales continue to improve. 
The next Slide illustrates how we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 to compare to 2010. In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations growth, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. Lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior period are expected to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The resulting comparative earnings for the year are in the range of $2.25 to $2.40 per share, which compares to $2.23 of adjusted earnings for 2010. 
We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly, a secure Digital mail system, which I will discuss shortly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. 
Slide 3 shows our expected 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.80 to $2.10 as compared with $1.50 for the prior year. GAAP earnings include the expected impact of restructuring charges of $0.25 to $0.35 per share in 2011, which is associated with our strategic transformation program.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 free cash flow and our expected 2011 expected free cash flow range of $750 million to $850 million. We expect slightly lower free cash flow in 2011 because of anticipated increased investment in finance receivables as equipment sales grow and higher capital expenditures associated with investments in business growth.
On Slide 5, the next Slide, you will see that we are now projecting $100 million increase in the expected net benefits from the strategic transformation program. As Mike discussed, in 2010, we achieved net benefits of $120 million, which was substantially in excess of our original target. Our original target for 2010 was to achieve benefits net of investments in the business of at least $50 million. In 2011, the total cost for the program are expected to remain within the original range that we provided although, we have narrowed the range by $50 million. We are now estimating cost for this Strategic Transformation program in the range of $300 million to $350 million.
While notably, the total pretax benefits for the program are projected to increase by $100 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million. This anticipated increase in benefits is expected to come from further process automation, channel alignment and reduced infrastructure costs, as well as a continuation of our efforts to streamline product development. I want to end today's presentation with a few words about how we are investing some of anticipated increased benefits from strategic transformation in 2011.
Slide 6 notes a few highlights about Volly, our recently announced secure digital delivery service that we launched last month. As businesses worldwide look to grow their relationships with existing customers and attract new customers, their communications become even more important. We are focused on helping businesses of all sizes manage their critical communications with existing customers and prospects. That is why we believe that investing in the market development of Volly is a foundational investment in CCM, Customer Communication Management, as a long-term growth opportunity for Pitney Bowes. We know that today's communication landscape is increasingly a mix of physical and digital communications. Volly is a prime example on how we can integrate physical and digital communications to provide secure, online management and information and offers. With Volly, mailers can have mail with physical addresses, delivered digitally to customers who opt in. Consumers will be able to receive and pay bills, browse and purchase from catalogs as well as find and download relevant coupons and discount offers, all online in one convenient site.
We have begun partnering with premier mailers, who will use Volly to provide their customers with a choice in how they receive communications. When it launches later this year to consumers, consumers will be able to manage all of these activities from almost anywhere using their computers, their smartphones and their tablets.
2010 was a year in which we continued to make progress and laid the foundation for a continued growth. We are excited about continuing to reap even greater benefits from our actions in 2011, and leveraging our streamlined organization and improved processes to invest in and to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we see ahead.

When we talk about strategic transformation, we talk about it in terms of net benefits. In other words, we achieve even greater benefits. But reinvesting a good portion of that into process improvement into process systems and processes and even in product development types of things. We've highlighted this Volly investment really because it's development of a new market and really creating a long-term opportunity, as Murray mentioned, for the company. So it is a different type of investment that we have traditionally been making against the net benefits in strategic transformation. One of the other things we tried to highlight is obviously, the impact of the recurring revenue streams in our SMB business, which have been improving on a relative basis over really the last quarters, and we expect that to continue to improved but to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis. What I would note though is that as we get this far along in the transformation of our business, we've been able to maintain very strong overall margins in the business while really shifting our dependence on different revenue streams. So we've seen a significant growth in Software that is highly recurring. And we've seen rentals and supplies becoming a smaller part of our overall revenue mix. So we think in total, we are getting good growth in earnings out of the net benefits. At the same time, we are transforming the business and ending this transformation with still very strong margins."

First of all, as we stated, as we talked to billers, we are already involved with over 70% of the transaction billers in the marketplace, and those builders have both digital and physical delivery. The digital delivery is in the 10% to 12% of all transaction mail. What that does is provide opportunity as billers look to have a different cost alternative. And our business model will be such that it will be lower cost than physical. But since it is a secure environment which aggregates for the consumer, it will have a cost to it. And that is where the revenue stream will come from. At the same time, we'll be offering coupons which will have a revenue stream from and will have catalogs, which will have a revenue stream as well. So those are sort of the three streams, Shannon. As we look to launching this later in the year to the consumer side, the launch that we had earlier this year was to billers, because we need to bring the content on first before we go to consumers as we move into the second half of the year and begin the roll out of consumers, that's when we'll start to see the first pieces of revenue, and then it will build. I would anticipate that it depends on what the curve of adoption is as to how we choose to invest. That's why you put flexibility in the range, and we'll be able to answer your question more specifically as we get later in the year and we see how quickly customers, consumers are willing to adapt to this model. And if they do, we would either see it taking off without a lot of support or it will require more support. So I think we'll have to answer that around midyear to third quarter as we see the first results as to how steep the curve of adoption could be or whether it has a longer tail before the high-rise in adoption."

So we still are not seeing a big change in what we've been calling a very not positive growth position. We aren't seeing those businesses spend. However, as we move up to the mid level and higher the small business, which are really the areas were Connect+ addresses, that business segment is now looking to reach out to create more business. So the Connect+, as we launched that is not only processes the mail, but it gives a vehicle of advertising on the front of the envelope creating an open ability. And that customer group is seeing that advantage, and that's why we're seeing the Connect+ sales accelerate. And as I mentioned, we saw 20% of our sales in the quarter being in the Connect+, which considering it's segment size is very significant, and we see that continuing. On the enterprise side, we are continuing to see the positives of enterprise spending more. It does vary by geography around the world. We see a little more hesitancy in Europe than we do in America at the moment. So it sort of fluctuates as you can see from the announcement of different things that are happening around the world. But overall, let's say the enterprise segment is moving back to positive acquisition. The midsize is looking not so much for efficiency but revenue growth opportunity. So products and services that leverage that are seen as positive and the very small business segment is still not, we're not seeing any positive growth in that segment."

Basically, the three key revenue streams from a recurring nature that are around our core business are the supplies business, the rental business and the financing business or revenue streams. Those revenue streams are really in many ways linked to both the installed base as well as the leased asset base that we have on the books. And over the last few years, as we've highlighted, we had a contraction in the equipment sales during the economic downturn. What that did is allowed certain finance receivables to run off, and we weren't replacing them at the same rate. And when you have that contraction in the base, you lose some of the rental revenue associated with that or if a customer down trades and gets a smaller meter. The financing revenue is tied to the earnings off of that asset base. So if it has come down, that finance revenue's going to be somewhat less. And obviously, supplies are tied to usage and we saw some mail volume contraction. So those things have, I'll say, a lag effect relative to when you see the decline in sales activity. And so since the typical lease period is four years, we have some lag effect that runs off. And I think we identified at the Analyst Day that we thought there was a 12 to 18 month lag effect or thereabouts to the recurring revenue stream after sales begin to turn positive. And since we've seen sales turn positive in the latter half of 2011, we assume they continue to be flat to positive in 2011 as we have in our guidance then we should see that lag effect continue to diminish. What we wanted to do is call it out clearly and separated from the underlying strength in the business and the growth in the business and the contribution of Strategic Transformation. So that it will be something that you could clearly see from those line items. And quite honestly, I think if you look back over to the last several quarters and look ahead, as we go announce earnings, the expectation is that we will see improving trend in those lines."

As we anticipated, 2010 was a year in which we had stronger performance in the second half of the year as we saw some initial signs of stabilization in various sectors and geographies. During the year, we continued to execute our Strategic Transformation program in order to lay the foundation for sustained growth and value creation for customers and shareholders alike. Our transformation initiatives are giving us a more variable cost structure, improved customer processes and infrastructure, as well as greater financial flexibility to continue investing in our future. 
Our fourth quarter performance reflects our overall journey to transform the business for enhanced growth. During the quarter, against the backdrop of an uneven global business climate, we continued to make investments in new technologies, enhance the customer experience and streamline our operations. The benefits from our ongoing actions also helps position us for future growth in our Small & Medium Business and our Enterprise Business Solutions groups.
One key milestone in improving the trends for the core business during the quarter was year-over-year improvement in equipment sales. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year equipment sales growth in our global SMB operations and on a consolidated basis. Growth in equipment sales in the second half of the year was paced by customer retention gains and new product placements, led by our Connect+ web-based communication system. In fact, Connect+ placements represented about 20% of U.S. Mailing equipment sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to roll out Connect+ throughout Europe and Canada in 2011. Another positive indicator for our SMB group was the continued moderation in the decline of financing revenue, resulting in its lowest rate of decline in overall revenue in eight quarters. 
During the quarter, Enterprise Business Solutions group had positive year-over-year revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, driven by good performance in Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. In our Software business, it is a testament to the growing demand for analytics and customer communication management software that we are able to grow revenue while continuing to build our recurring revenue streams through more multi-year licensing agreement. The majority of our larger software sales were in multi-year agreements, which will benefit stream revenues in future periods. Software revenue would have grown at double-digit pace if these deals had been sold as one-time licenses. Our investments in digital and cloud-based solutions like Connect+ and our recently introduced Volly, secured digital mail system, are helping us lay the foundation for sustained growth and value to customers and shareholders. Throughout the coming year, we will continue to deliver more new solutions which will help SMB and Enterprise customers manage their physical and digital communications with their customers. 
We continued to have excellent free cash flow for the quarter of $289 million and $961 million for the year. We are pleased to note that our Board has taken two actions which will result in enhanced returns to our shareholders. For the 29th consecutive year, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. The dividend will increase to $0.37 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The Board also approved an increase of $100 million to our share repurchase authorization of $50 million for a total of $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full year financial results. Mike?"

Our revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, a 3% decline on both a reported and a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we provided. Revenue was $1.4 billion for the quarter, a decline of about 1% when compared with the prior year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 2%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
I also want to note that we had a reclass between two revenue lines during the quarter. We reclassified $4 million in revenue from rentals to financing. The revenue was associated with the bundling of fees from our meter customers to access our Purchase Power product. The reclassification was related to revenue in both 2009 and 2010. Excluding this reclassification, financing revenue would have declined 5%, a moderation from previous declines, and rentals revenue would have declined 7% in line with our recent experience. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $258 million, which was about 1% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 40 basis points better than last year. 
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives both in the cost of revenue lines and in our selling, general and administrative costs or SG&A. In particular, SG&A costs were reduced significantly this quarter. SG&A in the quarter declined by about $23 million when compared with the prior year. And for the first time this year, SG&A improved as a percentage of revenue, a decline of 110 basis points to 31.8% when compared to the prior year. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen throughout the year. For the year, SG&A cost declined by $36 million on a reported basis and $57 million on an organic basis.
EBIT margins improved year-over-year in four of our seven business segments for the quarter and five of our seven business segments for the year. These improvements are the result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our business segments.
Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. Plus, we are putting in new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $330 million or $1.62 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $51 million, an increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.23%, about 22 basis points higher than the prior year due to lower commercial paper balances. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.0%. This was higher than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 32.1%. The higher tax rate in the quarter was the result of the mix of business between the U.S. and international operations. The average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.2%. 
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 39.5%, and the tax rate for the year was 38.5%. Write-offs of deferred tax assets associated with stock compensation are included in these rates. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.66, which was $0.02 higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter. For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23, which exceeded our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.22. Current exchange rates increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.02 for the year. 
GAAP earnings per share included pretax, restructuring and asset impairment charges that totaled $79 million in the quarter and $182 million for the year. This represented $0.27 per share in the quarter and $0.59 per share for the year. GAAP EPS also included a $0.03 tax charge for out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the quarter. For the year, there was a $0.13 tax charge related primarily to out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the year and to healthcare legislation that was enacted at the beginning of the year. Additionally, GAAP EPS included a $0.05 and a $0.09 per share losses from discontinued operations in the quarter and the year, respectively.
Free cash flow was $289 million for the quarter and $961 million for the year, which exceeded our annual guidance of $700 million to $800 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from improved working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
During the quarter, we returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and $320 million for the year. As noted in the press release, the Board of Directors approved an expansion of $100 million to the company's share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $50 million to $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the third quarter by about $82 million to a balance of $50 million. About 85% of our total debt is fixed rate and 15% is floating rate. 
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we continued to accelerate the implementation of initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that we'll implement throughout 2011. 
During the fourth quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $79 million included $24 million for pension and retiree medical curtailment related charges. The remaining pretax restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 340 positions across the company.
We are achieving greater net savings than was originally anticipated from our Strategic Transformation program as a result of identifying incremental opportunities and disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved benefits of approximately $120 million for the full year, net of system and related investments. And now we expect total benefits from the program to be about $100 million more than originally targeted. We are now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance. Murray?"

In 2011, we expect a business economic environment characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and by geography. While businesses are still more cautious with spending, especially on the SMB solutions group, our experience in the second half of the year shows they have become more willing to invest in solutions that help them grow their business and enhance their efficiency. It is against this backdrop that we project a return to revenue growth in 2011 due in part to a number of initiatives designed to stabilize our base business and to drive new growth opportunities.
Let's turn to the first slide. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth as compared to 2010's 3% decline. I noted our two consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in equipment sales earlier. We anticipate continued improvement in equipment sales during 2011, driven in part by the positive outlook for sales of new solutions like the Connect+ communication system and continued positive growth in Production Mail.
We also expect growth in several other areas in 2011. These include growth in Software revenue due to the increasing demand for term-based licenses of CCM [customer communications management] software solutions; expansion in Mail Services; and new CCM solutions across our Enterprise Business portfolio. 
As we have previously discussed, lower equipment sales during previous years will continue to affect financing, rental and supplies revenue streams. However, we expect moderating declines in these recurring revenue streams, related to our SMB Solutions group as equipment sales continue to improve. 
The next slide illustrates how we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 to compare to 2010. In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations growth, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. Lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods are expected to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The resulting comparative earnings for the year are in the range of $2.25 to $2.40 per share, which compares to $2.23 per share of adjusted earnings for 2010. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly, a secure digital mail system, which I will discuss shortly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. 
Slide 3 shows our expected 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.80 to $2.10 as compared with $1.50 for the prior year. GAAP earnings include the expected impact of restructuring charges of $0.25 to $0.35 per share in 2011, which is associated with our Strategic Transformation program.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 free cash flow and our 2011 expected free cash flow range of $750 million to $850 million. We expect slightly lower free cash flow in 2011 because of anticipated increased investment in finance receivables as equipment sales grow and higher capital expenditures associated with investments in business growth.
On Slide 5, the next slide, you will see that we are now projecting $100 million increase in the expected net benefits from the Strategic Transformation program. As Mike discussed, in 2010, we achieved net benefits of $120 million, which was substantially in excess of our original target. Our original target for 2010 was to achieve benefits net of investments in the business of at least $50 million. In 2011, the total costs for the program are expected to remain within the original range that we provided, although we have narrowed the range by $50 million. We are now estimating costs for the Strategic Transformation program in the range of $300 million to $350 million, while notably the total pretax benefits for the program are projected to increase by $100 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million. This anticipated increase in benefits is expected to come from further process automation, channel alignment and reduced infrastructure costs, as well as a continuation of our efforts to streamline product development. 
I want to end today's presentation with a few words about how we are investing some of the anticipated increased benefits from Strategic Transformation in 2011. Slide 6 notes a few highlights about Volly, our recently announced secure digital delivery service that we launched last month. 
As businesses worldwide look to grow their relationships with existing customers and attract new customers, their communications become even more important. We are focused on helping businesses of all sizes manage their critical communications with existing customers and prospects. That is why we believe that investing in the market development of Volly is a foundational investment in CCM, customer communication management, as a long-term growth opportunity for Pitney Bowes. 
We know that today's communication landscape is increasingly a mix of physical and digital communications. Volly is a prime example on how we can integrate physical and digital communications to provide secure, online management of information and offers. With Volly, mailers can have mail with physical addresses, delivered digitally to customers who opt in. Consumers will be able to receive and pay bills, browse and purchase from catalogs, as well as find and download relevant coupons and discount offers, all online in one convenient site.
We have begun partnering with premier mailers, who will use Volly to provide their customers with a choice in how they receive communications. When it launches later this year to consumers, consumers will be able to manage all of these activities from almost anywhere using their computers, their smartphones and their tablets.
2010 was a year in which we continued to make progress and lay the foundation for continued growth. We are excited about continuing to reap even greater benefits from our actions in 2011 and leveraging our streamlined organization and improved processes to invest in and to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we see ahead.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

When we talk about Strategic Transformation, we talk about it in terms of net benefits. In other words, we're achieving even greater benefits but reinvesting a good portion of that into process improvement in the systems that we need to automate processes and even in product development types of things. We've highlighted this Volly investment really because it's the development of a new market and really creating a long-term opportunity, as Murray mentioned, for the company. So it is a different type of investment than we have traditionally been making against the net benefits in Strategic Transformation. One of the other things we tried to highlight is, obviously, the impact of the recurring revenue streams in our SMB business, which have been improving on a relative basis over, really, the last several quarters. And we expect that to continue and improve, but to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis. What I would note though is that as we get this far along in the transformation of our business, we've been able to maintain very strong overall margins in the business while really shifting our dependence on different revenue streams. So we've seen a significant growth in Software that is highly recurring, and we've seen rentals and supplies becoming a smaller part of our overall revenue mix. So we think, in total, we're getting good growth in earnings out of the net benefits. At the same time, we're transforming the business and ending this transformation with still very strong margins."

First of all, as we stated, as we talk to billers, we are already involved with over 70% of the transaction billers in the marketplace, and those billers have both digital and physical delivery. The digital delivery is in the 10% to 12% of all transaction mail. What that does is provide opportunity as billers look to have a different cost alternative. And our business model will be such that it will be a lower cost than physical. But since it is a secure environment which aggregates for the consumer, it will have a cost to it, and that is where the revenue stream will come from. At the same time, we'll be offering coupons, which will have a revenue stream, and we'll have catalogs, which will have a revenue stream as well. So those are sort of the three streams, Shannon. As we look to launching this later in the year to the consumer side -- the launch that we had earlier in this year was to billers because we needed to bring the content on first before we go to consumers. As we move into the second half of the year and begin the rollout of consumers, that's when we'll start to see the first pieces of revenue, and then it will build. I would anticipate that it depends on what the curve of adoption is as to how we choose to invest. That's why we put flexibility in the range, and we'll be able to answer your question more specifically as we get later in the year and we see how quickly consumers are willing to adapt to this model. And if they do, we would either see it taking off without a lot of support or it will require more support. So I think we'll have to answer that around midyear to third quarter as we see the first results as to how steep the curve of adoption could be or whether it has a longer tail before the high rise in adoption."

And it's been declining between 20% and 35% per year over the last number of years, and we expect that to continue. So that negative will continue to shrink as we go forward."

As we look and I guess, if we take small business and sort of look at it in two segments, the very small business and then the small to mid-size business, we are seeing some differences there. The very small business segment, which is still a large piece of that small business customer base, has actually still remained fairly stagnant as to its ability to buy. So we still are not seeing a big change in what we've been calling a very not positive growth position. We aren't seeing those businesses spend. However, as we move up to the mid level and higher of the small business, which are really the areas where Connect+ addresses, that business segment is now looking to reach out to create more business. So the Connect+, as we launched that, not only processes the mail, but it gives a vehicle of advertising on the front of the envelope creating open ability. And that customer group is seeing that advantage, and that's why we're seeing the Connect+ sales accelerate. And as I mentioned, we saw 20% of our sales in the quarter being in the Connect+, which considering its segment size is very significant, and we see that continuing. On the Enterprise side, we're continuing to see the positives of Enterprise spending more. It does vary by geography around the world. We see a little more hesitancy in Europe than we do in America at the moment. So it sort of fluctuates as you can see from the announcement of different things that are happening around the world. But overall, I'd say the Enterprise segment is moving back to positive acquisition. The mid-size is looking not so much for efficiency but revenue growth opportunity, so products and services that leverage that are seen as positive. And the very small business segment is still not -- we're not seeing any positive growth in that segment."

We really did a good job of managing the capital, but we know we have investments to make to achieve that extra $100 million of Strategic Transformation benefit. So that's factored into our guidance as well. And there was some small one-offs in 2009. So we think 2011 is reflective of the underlying strength of the business. If we have strong sales growth in terms of leased assets beyond 2011, then that may bring that number down a bit. But that would be only a very positive thing because of the long-term benefits of the streams that, that would produce."

Basically, the three key revenue streams from a recurring nature that are around our core business are the supplies business, the rental business and the financing business or revenue streams. Those revenue streams are really, in many ways, linked to both the installed base as well as the leased asset base that we have on the books. And over the last few years, as we've highlighted, we had a contraction in equipment sales through the economic downturn. What that did is allowed certain finance receivables to run off, and we weren't replacing them at the same rate. And when you have that contraction in the base, you lose some of the rental revenue associated with that or if a customer down trades and gets a smaller meter. The financing revenue is tied to the earnings off of that asset base. So if it's come down, that finance revenue is going to be somewhat less. And obviously, supplies are tied to usage, and we saw some mail volume contraction. So those things have, I'll say, a lag effect relative to when you see the decline in sales activity. And so since the typical lease period is four years, we have some lag effect that runs off. And I think we identified at the Analyst Day that we thought there was a 12- to 18-month lag effect or thereabouts to the recurring revenue streams after sales begin to turn positive. And since we've seen sales turn positive in the latter half of 2011, we assume they continue to be flat to positive in 2011 as we have in our guidance. Then, we should see that lag effect continue to diminish. What we wanted to do is call it out clearly and separate it from the underlying strength in the business and the growth in the business and the contribution of Strategic Transformation, so that it was something that you could clearly see from those line items. And quite honestly, I think if you look back over the last several quarters and look ahead, as we go announce earnings, the expectation is that we will see an improving trend in those lines."

So I would say, as we have previously stated, that it depends on what opportunities are available or not available, and we take all of that into consideration in deciding of what to do with that cash. So it will continue to be a balanced approach as we look at things from what we do with, as we're doing here, organic investment in the business to grow some very exciting future revenue streams, as well as adding capabilities that will continue to grow the business. As Mike noted, we've had a very significant shift in our business this quarter. The Enterprise segment went over 50% of the business. We have been able to maintain, even with that shift, the very significant margins and being able to hold our EBIT margins in the same range as we've transitioned the business.

We achieved $120 million in net benefits, which is up significantly from where our target had been. Our adjusted earnings per share for the year was $2.23, which was in excess of our guidance. We had excellent free cash flow supporting the enhanced returns to our shareholders, giving us the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases.

Please note that we have provided slides related to the guidance discussion as part of the webcast found in the Investor Relations section of the Pitney Bowes website. After the presentation, we will take your questions. 
As we anticipated, 2010 was a year in which we had stronger performance in the second half of the year as we saw some initial signs of stabilization in various sectors and geographies. During the year, we continued to execute our Strategic Transformation program in order to lay the foundation for sustained growth and value creation for customers and shareholders alike. Our transformation initiatives are giving us a more variable cost structure, improved customer processes and infrastructure, as well as greater financial flexibility to continue investing in our future. 
Our fourth quarter performance reflects our overall journey to transform the business for enhanced growth. During the quarter, against the backdrop of an uneven global business climate, we continue to make investments in new technologies, enhance the customer experience and streamline our operations. The benefits from our ongoing actions also helps position us for future growth in our Small & Medium Business and our Enterprise Business Solutions groups.
One key milestone in improving the trends for the core business during the quarter was year-over-year improvement in equipment sales. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year equipment sales growth in our global SMB operations and on a consolidated basis. Growth in equipment sales in the second half of the year was paced by customer retention gains and new product placements, led by our Connect+ web-based communication system. In fact, Connect+ placements represented about 20% of U.S. Mailing equipment sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to roll out Connect+ throughout Europe and Canada in 2011. Another positive indicator for our SMB group was the continued moderation in the decline of financing revenue, resulting in its lowest rate of decline in overall revenue in eight quarters. 
During the quarter, Enterprise Business Solutions group had positive year-over-year revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, driven by good performance in Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. In our Software business, it is a testament to the growing demand for analytics and customer communication management software that we are able to grow revenue while continuing to build our recurring revenue streams through more multi-year licensing agreement. The majority of our larger software sales were in multi-year agreements, which will benefit stream revenues in future periods. Software revenue would have grown at double-digit pace if these deals had been sold as one-time licenses. Our investments in digital and cloud-based solutions like Connect+ and our recently introduced Volly, secured digital mail system, are helping us lay the foundation for sustained growth and value to customers and shareholders. Throughout the coming year, we will continue to deliver more new solutions which will help SMB and Enterprise customers manage their physical and digital communications with their customers. 
We continued to have excellent free cash flow for the quarter of $289 million and $961 million for the year. We are pleased to note that our Board has taken two actions which will result in enhanced returns to our shareholders. For the 29th consecutive year, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. The dividend will increase to $0.37 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The Board also approved an increase of $100 million to our share repurchase authorization of $50 million for a total of $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full year financial results. Mike?"

Our revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, a 3% decline on both a reported and a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we provided. Revenue was $1.4 billion for the quarter, a decline of about 1% when compared with the prior year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 2%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
I also want to note that we had a reclass between two revenue lines during the quarter. We reclassified $4 million in revenue from rentals to financing. The revenue was associated with the bundling of fees from our meter customers to access our Purchase Power product. The reclassification was related to revenue in both 2009 and 2010. Excluding this reclassification, financing revenue would have declined 5%, a moderation from previous declines, and rentals revenue would have declined 7% in line with our recent experience. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $258 million, which was about 1% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 40 basis points better than last year. 
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives both in the cost of revenue lines and in our selling, general and administrative costs, or SG&A. In particular, SG&A costs were reduced significantly this quarter. SG&A in the quarter declined by about $23 million when compared with the prior year. And for the first time this year, SG&A improved as a percentage of revenue, a decline of 110 basis points to 31.8% when compared to the prior year. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen throughout the year. For the year, SG&A cost declined by $36 million on a reported basis and $57 million on an organic basis.
EBIT margins improved year-over-year in four of our seven business segments for the quarter and five of our seven business segments for the year. These improvements are the result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our business segments.
Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. Plus, we are putting in new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $330 million or $1.62 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $51 million, an increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.23%, about 22 basis points higher than the prior year due to lower commercial paper balances. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.0%. This was higher than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 32.1%. The higher tax rate in the quarter was the result of the mix of business between the U.S. and international operations. The average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.2%. 
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 39.5%, and the tax rate for the year was 38.5%. Write-offs of deferred tax assets associated with stock compensation are included in these rates. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.66, which was $0.02 higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter. For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23, which exceeded our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.22. Currency exchange rates increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.02 for the year. 
GAAP earnings per share included pretax, restructuring and asset impairment charges that totaled $79 million in the quarter and $182 million for the year. This represented $0.27 per share in the quarter and $0.59 per share for the year. GAAP EPS also included a $0.03 tax charge for out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the quarter. For the year, there was a $0.13 tax charge related primarily to out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the year and to healthcare legislation that was enacted at the beginning of the year. Additionally, GAAP EPS included a $0.05 and a $0.09 per share losses from discontinued operations in the quarter and the year, respectively.
Free cash flow was $289 million for the quarter and $961 million for the year, which exceeded our annual guidance of $700 million to $800 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from improved working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
During the quarter, we returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and $320 million for the year. As noted in the press release, the Board of Directors approved an expansion of $100 million to the company's share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $50 million to $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the third quarter by about $82 million to a balance of $50 million. About 85% of our total debt is fixed rate and 15% is floating rate. 
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we continued to accelerate the implementation of initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that we'll implement throughout 2011. 
During the fourth quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $79 million included $24 million for pension and retiree medical curtailment related charges. The remaining pretax restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 340 positions across the company.
We are achieving greater net savings than was originally anticipated from our Strategic Transformation program as a result of identifying incremental opportunities and disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved benefits of approximately $120 million for the full year, net of system and related investments, and now expect total benefits from the program to be about $100 million more than originally targeted. We are now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance. Murray?"

In 2011, we expect a business economic environment characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and by geography. While businesses are still more cautious with spending, especially on the SMB solutions group, our experience in the second half of the year shows they have become more willing to invest in solutions that help them grow their business and enhance their efficiency. It is against this backdrop that we project a return to revenue growth in 2011 due in part to a number of initiatives designed to stabilize our base business and to drive new growth opportunities.
Let's turn to the first slide. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth as compared to 2010's 3% decline. I noted our two consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in equipment sales earlier. We anticipate continued improvement in equipment sales during 2011, driven in part by the positive outlook for sales of new solutions like the Connect+ communication system and continued positive growth in Production Mail.
We also expect growth in several other areas in 2011. These include growth in Software revenue due to the increasing demand for term-based licenses of CCM [customer communications management] software solutions; expansion in Mail Services; and new CCM solutions across our Enterprise Business portfolio. 
As we have previously discussed, lower equipment sales during previous years will continue to affect financing, rental and supplies revenue streams. However, we expect moderating declines in these recurring revenue streams, related to our SMB Solutions group as equipment sales continue to improve. 
The next slide illustrates how we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 to compare to 2010. In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations growth, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. Lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods are expected to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The resulting comparative earnings for the year are in the range of $2.25 to $2.40 per share, which compares to $2.23 per share of adjusted earnings for 2010. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly, a secure digital mail system, which I will discuss shortly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. 
Slide 3 shows our expected 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.80 to $2.10 as compared with $1.50 for the prior year. GAAP earnings include the expected impact of restructuring charges of $0.25 to $0.35 per share in 2011, which is associated with our Strategic Transformation program.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 free cash flow and our 2011 expected free cash flow range of $750 million to $850 million. We expect slightly lower free cash flow in 2011 because of anticipated increased investment in finance receivables as equipment sales grow and higher capital expenditures associated with investments in business grow.
On Slide 5, the next slide, you will see that we are now projecting $100 million increase in the expected net benefits from the Strategic Transformation program. As Mike discussed, in 2010, we achieved net benefits of $120 million, which was substantially in excess of our original target. Our original target for 2010 was to achieve benefits net of investments in the business of at least $50 million. In 2011, the total costs for the program are expected to remain within the original range that we provided, although we have narrowed the range by $50 million. We are now estimating costs for the Strategic Transformation program in the range of $300 million to $350 million, while notably the total pretax benefits for the program are projected to increase by $100 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million. This anticipated increase in benefits is expected to come from further process automation, channel alignment and reduced infrastructure costs, as well as a continuation of our efforts to streamline product development. 
I want to end today's presentation with a few words about how we are investing some of the anticipated increased benefits from Strategic Transformation in 2011. Slide 6 notes a few highlights about Volly, our recently announced secure digital delivery service that we launched last month. 
As businesses worldwide look to grow their relationships with existing customers and attract new customers, their communications become even more important. We are focused on helping businesses of all sizes manage their critical communications with existing customers and prospects. That is why we believe that investing in the market development of Volly is a foundational investment in CCM, customer communication management, as a long-term growth opportunity for Pitney Bowes. 
We know that today's communication landscape is increasingly a mix of physical and digital communications. Volly is a prime example of how we can integrate physical and digital communications to provide secure, online management of information and offers. With Volly, mailers can have mail with physical addresses, delivered digitally to customers who opt in. Consumers will be able to receive and pay bills, browse and purchase from catalogs, as well as find and download relevant coupons and discount offers, all online in one convenient site.
We have begun partnering with premier mailers, who will use Volly to provide their customers with a choice in how they receive communications. When it launches later this year to consumers, consumers will be able to manage all of these activities from almost anywhere using their computers, their smartphones and their tablets.
2010 was a year in which we continued to make progress and lay the foundation for continued growth. We are excited about continuing to reap even greater benefits from our actions in 2011 and leveraging our streamlined organization and improved processes to invest in and to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we see ahead.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

When we talk about Strategic Transformation, we talk about it in terms of net benefits. In other words, we're achieving even greater benefits but reinvesting a good portion of that into process improvement in the systems that we need to automate processes and even in product development-types of things. We've highlighted this Volly investment really because it's the development of a new market and really creating a long-term opportunity, as Murray mentioned, for the company. So it is a different type of investment than we have traditionally been making against the net benefits in Strategic Transformation. One of the other things we tried to highlight is, obviously, the impact of the recurring revenue streams in our SMB business, which have been improving on a relative basis over, really, the last several quarters. And we expect that to continue and improve, but to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis. What I would note, though, is that as we get this far along in the transformation of our business, we've been able to maintain very strong overall margins in the business while really shifting our dependence on different revenue streams. So we've seen a significant growth in Software that is highly recurring, and we've seen rentals and supplies becoming a smaller part of our overall revenue mix. So we think, in total, we're getting good growth in earnings out of the net benefits. At the same time, we're transforming the business and ending this transformation with still very strong margins."

First of all, as we stated, as we talk to billers, we are already involved with over 70% of the transaction billers in the marketplace, and those billers have both digital and physical delivery. The digital delivery is in the 10% to 12% of all transaction mail. What that does is provide opportunity as billers look to have a different cost alternative. And our business model will be such that it will be lower cost than physical. But since it is a secure environment which aggregates for the consumer, it will have a cost to it, and that is where the revenue stream will come from. At the same time, we'll be offering coupons, which will have a revenue stream from, and we'll have catalogs, which will have a revenue stream as well. So those are sort of the three streams, Shannon. As we look to launching this later in the year to the consumer side -- the launch that we had earlier in this year was to billers because we need to bring the content on first before we go to consumers. As we move into the second half of the year and begin the rollout of consumers, that's when we'll start to see the first pieces of revenue, and then it will build. I would anticipate that it depends on what the curve of adoption is as to how we choose to invest. That's why we put flexibility in the range, and we'll be able to answer your question more specifically as we get later in the year and we see how quickly consumers are willing to adapt to this model. And as they do, we would either see it taking off without a lot of support or it will require more support. So I think we'll have to answer that around midyear to third quarter as we see the first results as to how steep the curve of adoption could be, or whether it has a longer tail before the high rise in adoption."

The very small business segment, which is still a large piece of that small business customer base, has actually still remained fairly stagnant as to its ability to buy. So we still are not seeing a big change in what we've been calling a very not positive growth position. We aren't seeing those businesses spend. However, as we move up to the mid-level and higher of the small business, which are really the areas where Connect+ addresses, that business segment is now looking to reach out to create more business. So the Connect+, as we launch that, not only processes the mail, but it gives a vehicle of advertising on the front of the envelope creating open ability. And that customer group is seeing that advantage, and that's why we're seeing the Connect+ sales accelerate. And as I mentioned, we saw 20% of our sales in the quarter being in the Connect+, which, considering its segment size is very significant, and we see that continuing. On the Enterprise side, we're continuing to see the positives of Enterprise spending more. It does vary by geography around the world. We see a little more hesitancy in Europe than we do in America at the moment. So it sort of fluctuates as you can see from the announcement of different things that are happening around the world. But overall, I'd say the Enterprise segment is moving back to positive acquisition. The mid-size is looking not so much for efficiency but revenue growth opportunity, so products and services that leverage that are seen as positive. And the very small business segment is still not -- we're not seeing any positive growth in that segment."

And that assumed that finance receivables would be relatively flat. The guidance you see in 2011, I think, is reflective of strong performance in managing working capital, capital expenditures, actually a little bit higher than 2010 assumption. We really did a good job of managing the capital, but we know we have investments to make to achieve that extra $100 million of Strategic Transformation benefit. So that's factored into our guidance as well. And there was some small one-offs in 2009. So we think 2011 is reflective of the underlying strength of the business. If we have strong sales growth in terms of leased assets beyond 2011, then that may bring that number down a bit. But that would be only a very positive thing because of the long-term benefits of the streams that, that would produce."

So I think it's a skill set that we built into the organization, and we look to continue to be efficient and effective and focus on variable cost as we go forward."

But when everyone within an organization sees what's happening in the world, it is much easier to bring everyone rallying around what needs to be done and let's just get it done and not drag out getting things done. So we've been able, as Mike said, to bring some programs forward and add incremental programs and have the whole organization aligned around doing this quickly and effectively, particularly when they see us investing back in the business to make this sustainable. It's an easier thing to take things out than to ensure they stay out and that you put in the processes and the capabilities to ensure sustainability.

Basically, the three key revenue streams from a recurring nature that are around our core business are the supplies business, the rental business and the financing business or revenue streams. Those revenue streams are really, in many ways, linked to both the installed base as well as the leased asset base that we have on the books. And over the last few years, as we've highlighted, we had a contraction in equipment sales through the economic downturn. What that did is allowed certain finance receivables to run off, and we weren't replacing them at the same rate. And when you have that contraction in the base, you lose some of the rental revenue associated with that or if a customer down trades and gets a smaller meter. The financing revenue is tied to the earnings off of that asset base. So if it's come down, that finance revenue is going to be somewhat less. And obviously, supplies are tied to usage, and we saw some mail volume contraction. So those things have, I'll say, a lag effect relative to when you see the decline in sales activity. And so since the typical lease period is four years, we have some lag effect that runs off. And I think we identified at the Analyst Day that we thought there was a 12- to 18-month lag effect or thereabouts to the recurring revenue streams after sales begin to turn positive. And since we've seen sales turn positive in the latter half of 2011, we assume they continue to be flat-to-positive in 2011 as we have in our guidance. Then, we should see that lag effect continue to diminish. What we wanted to do is call it out clearly and separate it from the underlying strength in the business and the growth in the business and the contribution of Strategic Transformation, so that it was something that you could clearly see from those line items. And quite honestly, I think if you look back over the last several quarters and look ahead, as we go announce earnings, the expectation is that we will see an improving trend in those lines."

So I would say, as we have previously stated, that it depends on what opportunities are available or not available, and we take all of that into consideration in deciding what to do with that cash. So it will continue to be a balanced approach as we look at things from what we do with, as we're doing here, organic investment in the business to grow some very exciting future revenue streams, as well as adding capabilities that will continue to grow the business. As Mike noted, we've had a very significant shift in our business this quarter. The Enterprise segment went over 50% of the business. We have been able to maintain, even with that shift, the very significant margins and being able to hold our EBIT margins in the same range as we've transitioned the business.

And as Mike discussed, that's very important to us on our looking forward. In the enterprise space, we've had two consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year revenue growth, led by Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. 
We achieved $120 million in net benefits, which is up significantly from where our target had been. Our adjusted earnings per share for the year was $2.23, which was in excess of our guidance. We had excellent free cash flow supporting the enhanced returns to our shareholders, giving us the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our share repurchase authorization was increased to a total of $150 million. 
And then as we look in 2011, we're looking at a return to revenue growth moderating declines in that SMB revenue stream that we've talked about. And then looking at projected net benefits growing to $250 million to $300 million from transformation, which is up $100 million. 
Planned investments in Volly, which is a very exciting market development. And I'd encourage you to go to volly.com and see what the product and solution is and how it migrates over time. And then, continued very strong free cash flow as we go into 2011.

Please note that we have provided slides related to the guidance discussion as part of the webcast found in the Investor Relations section of the Pitney Bowes website. After the presentation, we will take your questions. 
As we anticipated, 2010 was a year in which we had stronger performance in the second half of the year as we saw some initial signs of stabilization in various sectors and geographies. During the year, we continued to execute our Strategic Transformation program in order to lay the foundation for sustained growth and value creation for customers and shareholders alike. Our transformation initiatives are giving us a more variable cost structure, improved customer processes and infrastructure, as well as greater financial flexibility to continue investing in our future. 
Our fourth quarter performance reflects our overall journey to transform the business for enhanced growth. During the quarter, against the backdrop of an uneven global business climate, we continue to make investments in new technologies, enhance the customer experience and streamline our operations. The benefits from our ongoing actions also helps position us for future growth in our Small & Medium Business and our Enterprise Business Solutions groups.
One key milestone in improving the trends for the core business during the quarter was year-over-year improvement in equipment sales. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year equipment sales growth in our global SMB operations and on a consolidated basis. Growth in equipment sales in the second half of the year was paced by customer retention gains and new product placements, led by our Connect+ web-based communication system. In fact, Connect+ placements represented about 20% of U.S. Mailing equipment sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to roll out Connect+ throughout Europe and Canada in 2011. Another positive indicator for our SMB group was the continued moderation in the decline of financing revenue, resulting in its lowest rate of decline in overall revenue in eight quarters. 
During the quarter, Enterprise Business Solutions group had positive year-over-year revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, driven by good performance in Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. In our Software business, it is a testament to the growing demand for analytics and customer communication management software that we are able to grow revenue while continuing to build our recurring revenue streams through more multi-year licensing agreement. The majority of our larger software sales were in multi-year agreements, which will benefit stream revenues in future periods. Software revenue would have grown at double-digit pace if these deals had been sold as one-time licenses. Our investments in digital and cloud-based solutions like Connect+ and our recently introduced Volly, secured digital mail system, are helping us lay the foundation for sustained growth and value to customers and shareholders. Throughout the coming year, we will continue to deliver more new solutions which will help SMB and Enterprise customers manage their physical and digital communications with their customers. 
We continued to have excellent free cash flow for the quarter of $289 million and $961 million for the year. We are pleased to note that our Board has taken two actions which will result in enhanced returns to our shareholders. For the 29th consecutive year, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. The dividend will increase to $0.37 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The Board also approved an increase of $100 million to our share repurchase authorization of $50 million for a total of $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full year financial results. Mike?"

Our revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, a 3% decline on both a reported and a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we provided. Revenue was $1.4 billion for the quarter, a decline of about 1% when compared with the prior year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 2%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
I also want to note that we had a reclass between two revenue lines during the quarter. We reclassified $4 million in revenue from rentals to financing. The revenue was associated with the bundling of fees from our meter customers to access our Purchase Power product. The reclassification was related to revenue in both 2009 and 2010. Excluding this reclassification, financing revenue would have declined 5%, a moderation from previous declines, and rentals revenue would have declined 7% in line with our recent experience. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $258 million, which was about 1% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 40 basis points better than last year. 
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives both in the cost of revenue lines and in our selling, general and administrative costs, or SG&A. In particular, SG&A costs were reduced significantly this quarter. SG&A in the quarter declined by about $23 million when compared with the prior year. And for the first time this year, SG&A improved as a percentage of revenue, a decline of 110 basis points to 31.8% when compared to the prior year. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen throughout the year. For the year, SG&A cost declined by $36 million on a reported basis and $57 million on an organic basis.
EBIT margins improved year-over-year in four of our seven business segments for the quarter and five of our seven business segments for the year. These improvements are the result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our business segments.
Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. Plus, we are putting in new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $330 million or $1.62 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $51 million, an increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.23%, about 22 basis points higher than the prior year due to lower commercial paper balances. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.0%. This was higher than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 32.1%. The higher tax rate in the quarter was the result of the mix of business between the U.S. and international operations. The average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.2%. 
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 39.5%, and the tax rate for the year was 38.5%. Write-offs of deferred tax assets associated with stock compensation are included in these rates. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.66, which was $0.02 higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter. For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23, which exceeded our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.22. Currency exchange rates increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.02 for the year. 
GAAP earnings per share included pretax, restructuring and asset impairment charges that totaled $79 million in the quarter and $182 million for the year. This represented $0.27 per share in the quarter and $0.59 per share for the year. GAAP EPS also included a $0.03 tax charge for out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the quarter. For the year, there was a $0.13 tax charge related primarily to out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the year and to healthcare legislation that was enacted at the beginning of the year. Additionally, GAAP EPS included a $0.05 and a $0.09 per share losses from discontinued operations in the quarter and the year, respectively.
Free cash flow was $289 million for the quarter and $961 million for the year, which exceeded our annual guidance of $700 million to $800 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from improved working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
During the quarter, we returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and $320 million for the year. As noted in the press release, the Board of Directors approved an expansion of $100 million to the company's share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $50 million to $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the third quarter by about $82 million to a balance of $50 million. About 85% of our total debt is fixed rate and 15% is floating rate. 
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we continued to accelerate the implementation of initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that we'll implement throughout 2011. 
During the fourth quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $79 million included $24 million for pension and retiree medical curtailment related charges. The remaining pretax restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 340 positions across the company.
We are achieving greater net savings than was originally anticipated from our Strategic Transformation program as a result of identifying incremental opportunities and disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved benefits of approximately $120 million for the full year, net of system and related investments, and now expect total benefits from the program to be about $100 million more than originally targeted. We are now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance. Murray?"

In 2011, we expect a business economic environment characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and by geography. While businesses are still more cautious with spending, especially on the SMB solutions group, our experience in the second half of the year shows they have become more willing to invest in solutions that help them grow their business and enhance their efficiency. It is against this backdrop that we project a return to revenue growth in 2011 due in part to a number of initiatives designed to stabilize our base business and to drive new growth opportunities.
Let's turn to the first slide. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth as compared to 2010's 3% decline. I noted our two consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in equipment sales earlier. We anticipate continued improvement in equipment sales during 2011, driven in part by the positive outlook for sales of new solutions like the Connect+ communication system and continued positive growth in Production Mail.
We also expect growth in several other areas in 2011. These include growth in Software revenue due to the increasing demand for term-based licenses of CCM [customer communications management] software solutions; expansion in Mail Services; and new CCM solutions across our Enterprise Business portfolio. 
As we have previously discussed, lower equipment sales during previous years will continue to affect financing, rental and supplies revenue streams. However, we expect moderating declines in these recurring revenue streams, related to our SMB Solutions group as equipment sales continue to improve. 
The next slide illustrates how we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 to compare to 2010. In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations growth, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. Lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods are expected to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The resulting comparative earnings for the year are in the range of $2.25 to $2.40 per share, which compares to $2.23 per share of adjusted earnings for 2010. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly, a secure digital mail system, which I will discuss shortly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. 
Slide 3 shows our expected 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.80 to $2.10 as compared with $1.50 for the prior year. GAAP earnings include the expected impact of restructuring charges of $0.25 to $0.35 per share in 2011, which is associated with our Strategic Transformation program.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 free cash flow and our 2011 expected free cash flow range of $750 million to $850 million. We expect slightly lower free cash flow in 2011 because of anticipated increased investment in finance receivables as equipment sales grow and higher capital expenditures associated with investments in business grow.
On Slide 5, the next slide, you will see that we are now projecting $100 million increase in the expected net benefits from the Strategic Transformation program. As Mike discussed, in 2010, we achieved net benefits of $120 million, which was substantially in excess of our original target. Our original target for 2010 was to achieve benefits net of investments in the business of at least $50 million. In 2011, the total costs for the program are expected to remain within the original range that we provided, although we have narrowed the range by $50 million. We are now estimating costs for the Strategic Transformation program in the range of $300 million to $350 million, while notably the total pretax benefits for the program are projected to increase by $100 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million. This anticipated increase in benefits is expected to come from further process automation, channel alignment and reduced infrastructure costs, as well as a continuation of our efforts to streamline product development. 
I want to end today's presentation with a few words about how we are investing some of the anticipated increased benefits from Strategic Transformation in 2011. Slide 6 notes a few highlights about Volly, our recently announced secure digital delivery service that we launched last month. 
As businesses worldwide look to grow their relationships with existing customers and attract new customers, their communications become even more important. We are focused on helping businesses of all sizes manage their critical communications with existing customers and prospects. That is why we believe that investing in the market development of Volly is a foundational investment in CCM, customer communication management, as a long-term growth opportunity for Pitney Bowes. 
We know that today's communication landscape is increasingly a mix of physical and digital communications. Volly is a prime example of how we can integrate physical and digital communications to provide secure, online management of information and offers. With Volly, mailers can have mail with physical addresses, delivered digitally to customers who opt in. Consumers will be able to receive and pay bills, browse and purchase from catalogs, as well as find and download relevant coupons and discount offers, all online in one convenient site.
We have begun partnering with premier mailers, who will use Volly to provide their customers with a choice in how they receive communications. When it launches later this year to consumers, consumers will be able to manage all of these activities from almost anywhere using their computers, their smartphones and their tablets.
2010 was a year in which we continued to make progress and lay the foundation for continued growth. We are excited about continuing to reap even greater benefits from our actions in 2011 and leveraging our streamlined organization and improved processes to invest in and to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we see ahead.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

But particularly given the, I guess, the revenue growth guidance of flat of 3%, it seems like a lot of that's getting -- well, it's going to get offset, I guess, by incremental investments given what your EPS guidance is. So could you just go back over that and maybe talk about how we should think about the balance in the investment in 2011? And then I guess, just sort of to dovetail off of that, is this type of investing something that we should expect going into 2012 as well?"

When we talk about Strategic Transformation, we talk about it in terms of net benefits. In other words, we're achieving even greater benefits but reinvesting a good portion of that into process improvement in the systems that we need to automate processes and even in product development-types of things. We've highlighted this Volly investment really because it's the development of a new market and really creating a long-term opportunity, as Murray mentioned, for the company. So it is a different type of investment than we have traditionally been making against the net benefits in Strategic Transformation. One of the other things we tried to highlight is, obviously, the impact of the recurring revenue streams in our SMB business, which have been improving on a relative basis over, really, the last several quarters. And we expect that to continue and improve, but to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis. What I would note, though, is that as we get this far along in the transformation of our business, we've been able to maintain very strong overall margins in the business while really shifting our dependence on different revenue streams. So we've seen a significant growth in Software that is highly recurring, and we've seen rentals and supplies becoming a smaller part of our overall revenue mix. So we think, in total, we're getting good growth in earnings out of the net benefits. At the same time, we're transforming the business and ending this transformation with still very strong margins."

First of all, as we stated, as we talk to billers, we are already involved with over 70% of the transaction billers in the marketplace, and those billers have both digital and physical delivery. The digital delivery is in the 10% to 12% of all transaction mail. What that does is provide opportunity as billers look to have a different cost alternative. And our business model will be such that it will be lower cost than physical. But since it is a secure environment which aggregates for the consumer, it will have a cost to it, and that is where the revenue stream will come from. At the same time, we'll be offering coupons, which will have a revenue stream from, and we'll have catalogs, which will have a revenue stream as well. So those are sort of the three streams, Shannon. As we look to launching this later in the year to the consumer side -- the launch that we had earlier in this year was to billers because we need to bring the content on first before we go to consumers. As we move into the second half of the year and begin the rollout of consumers, that's when we'll start to see the first pieces of revenue, and then it will build. I would anticipate that it depends on what the curve of adoption is as to how we choose to invest. That's why we put flexibility in the range, and we'll be able to answer your question more specifically as we get later in the year and we see how quickly consumers are willing to adapt to this model. And as they do, we would either see it taking off without a lot of support or it will require more support. So I think we'll have to answer that around midyear to third quarter as we see the first results as to how steep the curve of adoption could be, or whether it has a longer tail before the high rise in adoption."

The very small business segment, which is still a large piece of that small business customer base, has actually still remained fairly stagnant as to its ability to buy. So we still are not seeing a big change in what we've been calling a very not positive growth position. We aren't seeing those businesses spend. However, as we move up to the mid-level and higher of the small business, which are really the areas where Connect+ addresses, that business segment is now looking to reach out to create more business. So the Connect+, as we launch that, not only processes the mail, but it gives a vehicle of advertising on the front of the envelope creating open ability. And that customer group is seeing that advantage, and that's why we're seeing the Connect+ sales accelerate. And as I mentioned, we saw 20% of our sales in the quarter being in the Connect+, which, considering its segment size is very significant, and we see that continuing. On the Enterprise side, we're continuing to see the positives of Enterprise spending more. It does vary by geography around the world. We see a little more hesitancy in Europe than we do in America at the moment. So it sort of fluctuates as you can see from the announcement of different things that are happening around the world. But overall, I'd say the Enterprise segment is moving back to positive acquisition. The mid-size is looking not so much for efficiency but revenue growth opportunity, so products and services that leverage that are seen as positive. And the very small business segment is still not -- we're not seeing any positive growth in that segment."

So we've been able, as Mike said, to bring some programs forward and add incremental programs and have the whole organization aligned around doing this quickly and effectively, particularly when they see us investing back in the business to make this sustainable. It's an easier thing to take things out than to ensure they stay out and that you put in the processes and the capabilities to ensure sustainability. And as the organization sees that happening and sees the capabilities going forward, an enthusiasm does build that allows you to accelerate, and we have experienced that."

Basically, the three key revenue streams from a recurring nature that are around our core business are the supplies business, the rental business and the financing business or revenue streams. Those revenue streams are really, in many ways, linked to both the installed base as well as the leased asset base that we have on the books. And over the last few years, as we've highlighted, we had a contraction in equipment sales through the economic downturn. What that did is allowed certain finance receivables to run off, and we weren't replacing them at the same rate. And when you have that contraction in the base, you lose some of the rental revenue associated with that or if a customer down trades and gets a smaller meter. The financing revenue is tied to the earnings off of that asset base. So if it's come down, that finance revenue is going to be somewhat less. And obviously, supplies are tied to usage, and we saw some mail volume contraction. So those things have, I'll say, a lag effect relative to when you see the decline in sales activity. And so since the typical lease period is four years, we have some lag effect that runs off. And I think we identified at the Analyst Day that we thought there was a 12- to 18-month lag effect or thereabouts to the recurring revenue streams after sales begin to turn positive. And since we've seen sales turn positive in the latter half of 2011, we assume they continue to be flat-to-positive in 2011 as we have in our guidance. Then, we should see that lag effect continue to diminish. What we wanted to do is call it out clearly and separate it from the underlying strength in the business and the growth in the business and the contribution of Strategic Transformation, so that it was something that you could clearly see from those line items. And quite honestly, I think if you look back over the last several quarters and look ahead, as we go announce earnings, the expectation is that we will see an improving trend in those lines."

We did acquire Portrait last year, which is proving to be an excellent addition to our portfolio, supplying us with great products and growth. So I would say, as we have previously stated, that it depends on what opportunities are available or not available, and we take all of that into consideration in deciding what to do with that cash. So it will continue to be a balanced approach as we look at things from what we do with, as we're doing here, organic investment in the business to grow some very exciting future revenue streams, as well as adding capabilities that will continue to grow the business. As Mike noted, we've had a very significant shift in our business this quarter. The Enterprise segment went over 50% of the business. We have been able to maintain, even with that shift, the very significant margins and being able to hold our EBIT margins in the same range as we've transitioned the business. So I think we've had a very effective move that we had planned in the business. It's continuing to execute, and we'll continue to utilize the same strategies of share repurchase, dividends and investments in the business and new opportunities."

And as Mike discussed, that's very important to us on our looking forward. In the enterprise space, we've had two consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year revenue growth, led by Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. 
We achieved $120 million in net benefits, which is up significantly from where our target had been. Our adjusted earnings per share for the year was $2.23, which was in excess of our guidance. We had excellent free cash flow supporting the enhanced returns to our shareholders, giving us the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our share repurchase authorization was increased to a total of $150 million. 
And then as we look in 2011, we're looking at a return to revenue growth moderating declines in that SMB revenue stream that we've talked about. And then looking at projected net benefits growing to $250 million to $300 million from transformation, which is up $100 million. 
Planned investments in Volly, which is a very exciting market development. And I'd encourage you to go to volly.com and see what the product and solution is and how it migrates over time. And then, continued very strong free cash flow as we go into 2011.

Please note that we have provided slides related to the guidance discussion as part of the webcast found in the Investor Relations section of the Pitney Bowes website. After the presentation, we will take your questions. 
As we anticipated, 2010 was a year in which we had stronger performance in the second half of the year as we saw some initial signs of stabilization in various sectors and geographies. During the year, we continued to execute our Strategic Transformation program in order to lay the foundation for sustained growth and value creation for customers and shareholders alike. Our transformation initiatives are giving us a more variable cost structure, improved customer processes and infrastructure, as well as greater financial flexibility to continue investing in our future. 
Our fourth quarter performance reflects our overall journey to transform the business for enhanced growth. During the quarter, against the backdrop of an uneven global business climate, we continue to make investments in new technologies, enhance the customer experience and streamline our operations. The benefits from our ongoing actions also helps position us for future growth in our Small & Medium Business and our Enterprise Business Solutions groups.
One key milestone in improving the trends for the core business during the quarter was year-over-year improvement in equipment sales. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year equipment sales growth in our global SMB operations and on a consolidated basis. Growth in equipment sales in the second half of the year was paced by customer retention gains and new product placements, led by our Connect+ web-based communication system. In fact, Connect+ placements represented about 20% of U.S. Mailing equipment sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to roll out Connect+ throughout Europe and Canada in 2011. Another positive indicator for our SMB group was the continued moderation in the decline of financing revenue, resulting in its lowest rate of decline in overall revenue in eight quarters. 
During the quarter, Enterprise Business Solutions group had positive year-over-year revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, driven by good performance in Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. In our Software business, it is a testament to the growing demand for analytics and customer communication management software that we are able to grow revenue while continuing to build our recurring revenue streams through more multi-year licensing agreement. The majority of our larger software sales were in multi-year agreements, which will benefit stream revenues in future periods. Software revenue would have grown at double-digit pace if these deals had been sold as one-time licenses. Our investments in digital and cloud-based solutions like Connect+ and our recently introduced Volly, secured digital mail system, are helping us lay the foundation for sustained growth and value to customers and shareholders. Throughout the coming year, we will continue to deliver more new solutions which will help SMB and Enterprise customers manage their physical and digital communications with their customers. 
We continued to have excellent free cash flow for the quarter of $289 million and $961 million for the year. We are pleased to note that our Board has taken two actions which will result in enhanced returns to our shareholders. For the 29th consecutive year, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. The dividend will increase to $0.37 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The Board also approved an increase of $100 million to our share repurchase authorization of $50 million for a total of $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full year financial results. Mike?"

Our revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, a 3% decline on both a reported and a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we provided. Revenue was $1.4 billion for the quarter, a decline of about 1% when compared with the prior year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 2%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
I also want to note that we had a reclass between two revenue lines during the quarter. We reclassified $4 million in revenue from rentals to financing. The revenue was associated with the bundling of fees from our meter customers to access our Purchase Power product. The reclassification was related to revenue in both 2009 and 2010. Excluding this reclassification, financing revenue would have declined 5%, a moderation from previous declines, and rentals revenue would have declined 7% in line with our recent experience. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $258 million, which was about 1% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 40 basis points better than last year. 
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives both in the cost of revenue lines and in our selling, general and administrative costs, or SG&A. In particular, SG&A costs were reduced significantly this quarter. SG&A in the quarter declined by about $23 million when compared with the prior year. And for the first time this year, SG&A improved as a percentage of revenue, a decline of 110 basis points to 31.8% when compared to the prior year. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen throughout the year. For the year, SG&A cost declined by $36 million on a reported basis and $57 million on an organic basis.
EBIT margins improved year-over-year in four of our seven business segments for the quarter and five of our seven business segments for the year. These improvements are the result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our business segments.
Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. Plus, we are putting in new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $330 million or $1.62 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $51 million, an increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.23%, about 22 basis points higher than the prior year due to lower commercial paper balances. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.0%. This was higher than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 32.1%. The higher tax rate in the quarter was the result of the mix of business between the U.S. and international operations. The average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.2%. 
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 39.5%, and the tax rate for the year was 38.5%. Write-offs of deferred tax assets associated with stock compensation are included in these rates. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.66, which was $0.02 higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter. For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23, which exceeded our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.22. Currency exchange rates increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.02 for the year. 
GAAP earnings per share included pretax, restructuring and asset impairment charges that totaled $79 million in the quarter and $182 million for the year. This represented $0.27 per share in the quarter and $0.59 per share for the year. GAAP EPS also included a $0.03 tax charge for out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the quarter. For the year, there was a $0.13 tax charge related primarily to out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the year and to healthcare legislation that was enacted at the beginning of the year. Additionally, GAAP EPS included a $0.05 and a $0.09 per share losses from discontinued operations in the quarter and the year, respectively.
Free cash flow was $289 million for the quarter and $961 million for the year, which exceeded our annual guidance of $700 million to $800 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from improved working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
During the quarter, we returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and $320 million for the year. As noted in the press release, the Board of Directors approved an expansion of $100 million to the company's share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $50 million to $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the third quarter by about $82 million to a balance of $50 million. About 85% of our total debt is fixed rate and 15% is floating rate. 
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we continued to accelerate the implementation of initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that we'll implement throughout 2011. 
During the fourth quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $79 million included $24 million for pension and retiree medical curtailment related charges. The remaining pretax restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 340 positions across the company.
We are achieving greater net savings than was originally anticipated from our Strategic Transformation program as a result of identifying incremental opportunities and disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved benefits of approximately $120 million for the full year, net of system and related investments, and now expect total benefits from the program to be about $100 million more than originally targeted. We are now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance. Murray?"

In 2011, we expect a business economic environment characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and by geography. While businesses are still more cautious with spending, especially on the SMB solutions group, our experience in the second half of the year shows they have become more willing to invest in solutions that help them grow their business and enhance their efficiency. It is against this backdrop that we project a return to revenue growth in 2011 due in part to a number of initiatives designed to stabilize our base business and to drive new growth opportunities.
Let's turn to the first slide. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth as compared to 2010's 3% decline. I noted our two consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in equipment sales earlier. We anticipate continued improvement in equipment sales during 2011, driven in part by the positive outlook for sales of new solutions like the Connect+ communication system and continued positive growth in Production Mail.
We also expect growth in several other areas in 2011. These include growth in Software revenue due to the increasing demand for term-based licenses of CCM [customer communications management] software solutions; expansion in Mail Services; and new CCM solutions across our Enterprise Business portfolio. 
As we have previously discussed, lower equipment sales during previous years will continue to affect financing, rental and supplies revenue streams. However, we expect moderating declines in these recurring revenue streams, related to our SMB Solutions group as equipment sales continue to improve. 
The next slide illustrates how we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 to compare to 2010. In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations growth, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. Lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods are expected to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The resulting comparative earnings for the year are in the range of $2.25 to $2.40 per share, which compares to $2.23 per share of adjusted earnings for 2010. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly, a secure digital mail system, which I will discuss shortly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. 
Slide 3 shows our expected 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.80 to $2.10 as compared with $1.50 for the prior year. GAAP earnings include the expected impact of restructuring charges of $0.25 to $0.35 per share in 2011, which is associated with our Strategic Transformation program.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 free cash flow and our 2011 expected free cash flow range of $750 million to $850 million. We expect slightly lower free cash flow in 2011 because of anticipated increased investment in finance receivables as equipment sales grow and higher capital expenditures associated with investments in business grow.
On Slide 5, the next slide, you will see that we are now projecting $100 million increase in the expected net benefits from the Strategic Transformation program. As Mike discussed, in 2010, we achieved net benefits of $120 million, which was substantially in excess of our original target. Our original target for 2010 was to achieve benefits net of investments in the business of at least $50 million. In 2011, the total costs for the program are expected to remain within the original range that we provided, although we have narrowed the range by $50 million. We are now estimating costs for the Strategic Transformation program in the range of $300 million to $350 million, while notably the total pretax benefits for the program are projected to increase by $100 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million. This anticipated increase in benefits is expected to come from further process automation, channel alignment and reduced infrastructure costs, as well as a continuation of our efforts to streamline product development. 
I want to end today's presentation with a few words about how we are investing some of the anticipated increased benefits from Strategic Transformation in 2011. Slide 6 notes a few highlights about Volly, our recently announced secure digital delivery service that we launched last month. 
As businesses worldwide look to grow their relationships with existing customers and attract new customers, their communications become even more important. We are focused on helping businesses of all sizes manage their critical communications with existing customers and prospects. That is why we believe that investing in the market development of Volly is a foundational investment in CCM, customer communication management, as a long-term growth opportunity for Pitney Bowes. 
We know that today's communication landscape is increasingly a mix of physical and digital communications. Volly is a prime example of how we can integrate physical and digital communications to provide secure, online management of information and offers. With Volly, mailers can have mail with physical addresses, delivered digitally to customers who opt in. Consumers will be able to receive and pay bills, browse and purchase from catalogs, as well as find and download relevant coupons and discount offers, all online in one convenient site.
We have begun partnering with premier mailers, who will use Volly to provide their customers with a choice in how they receive communications. When it launches later this year to consumers, consumers will be able to manage all of these activities from almost anywhere using their computers, their smartphones and their tablets.
2010 was a year in which we continued to make progress and lay the foundation for continued growth. We are excited about continuing to reap even greater benefits from our actions in 2011 and leveraging our streamlined organization and improved processes to invest in and to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we see ahead.

But particularly given the, I guess, the revenue growth guidance of flat of 3%, it seems like a lot of that's getting -- well, it's going to get offset, I guess, by incremental investments given what your EPS guidance is. So could you just go back over that and maybe talk about how we should think about the balance in the investment in 2011? And then I guess, just sort of to dovetail off of that, is this type of investing something that we should expect going into 2012 as well?"

When we talk about Strategic Transformation, we talk about it in terms of net benefits. In other words, we're achieving even greater benefits but reinvesting a good portion of that into process improvement in the systems that we need to automate processes and even in product development-types of things. We've highlighted this Volly investment really because it's the development of a new market and really creating a long-term opportunity, as Murray mentioned, for the company. So it is a different type of investment than we have traditionally been making against the net benefits in Strategic Transformation. One of the other things we tried to highlight is, obviously, the impact of the recurring revenue streams in our SMB business, which have been improving on a relative basis over, really, the last several quarters. And we expect that to continue and improve, but to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis. What I would note, though, is that as we get this far along in the transformation of our business, we've been able to maintain very strong overall margins in the business while really shifting our dependence on different revenue streams. So we've seen a significant growth in Software that is highly recurring, and we've seen rentals and supplies becoming a smaller part of our overall revenue mix. So we think, in total, we're getting good growth in earnings out of the net benefits. At the same time, we're transforming the business and ending this transformation with still very strong margins."

First of all, as we stated, as we talk to billers, we are already involved with over 70% of the transaction billers in the marketplace, and those billers have both digital and physical delivery. The digital delivery is in the 10% to 12% of all transaction mail. What that does is provide opportunity as billers look to have a different cost alternative. And our business model will be such that it will be lower cost than physical. But since it is a secure environment which aggregates for the consumer, it will have a cost to it, and that is where the revenue stream will come from. At the same time, we'll be offering coupons, which will have a revenue stream from, and we'll have catalogs, which will have a revenue stream as well. So those are sort of the three streams, Shannon. As we look to launching this later in the year to the consumer side -- the launch that we had earlier in this year was to billers because we need to bring the content on first before we go to consumers. As we move into the second half of the year and begin the rollout of consumers, that's when we'll start to see the first pieces of revenue, and then it will build. I would anticipate that it depends on what the curve of adoption is as to how we choose to invest. That's why we put flexibility in the range, and we'll be able to answer your question more specifically as we get later in the year and we see how quickly consumers are willing to adapt to this model. And as they do, we would either see it taking off without a lot of support or it will require more support. So I think we'll have to answer that around midyear to third quarter as we see the first results as to how steep the curve of adoption could be, or whether it has a longer tail before the high rise in adoption."

As we look and I guess, if we take small business and sort of look at it in two segments, the very small business and then the small- to mid-size business, we are seeing some differences there. The very small business segment, which is still a large piece of that small business customer base, has actually still remained fairly stagnant as to its ability to buy. So we still are not seeing a big change in what we've been calling a very not positive growth position. We aren't seeing those businesses spend. However, as we move up to the mid-level and higher of the small business, which are really the areas where Connect+ addresses, that business segment is now looking to reach out to create more business. So the Connect+, as we launch that, not only processes the mail, but it gives a vehicle of advertising on the front of the envelope creating open ability. And that customer group is seeing that advantage, and that's why we're seeing the Connect+ sales accelerate. And as I mentioned, we saw 20% of our sales in the quarter being in the Connect+, which, considering its segment size is very significant, and we see that continuing. On the Enterprise side, we're continuing to see the positives of Enterprise spending more. It does vary by geography around the world. We see a little more hesitancy in Europe than we do in America at the moment. So it sort of fluctuates as you can see from the announcement of different things that are happening around the world. But overall, I'd say the Enterprise segment is moving back to positive acquisition. The mid-size is looking not so much for efficiency but revenue growth opportunity, so products and services that leverage that are seen as positive. And the very small business segment is still not -- we're not seeing any positive growth in that segment."

We really did a good job of managing the capital, but we know we have investments to make to achieve that extra $100 million of Strategic Transformation benefit. So that's factored into our guidance as well. And there was some small one-offs in 2009. So we think 2011 is reflective of the underlying strength of the business. If we have strong sales growth in terms of leased assets beyond 2011, then that may bring that number down a bit.

Basically, the three key revenue streams from a recurring nature that are around our core business are the supplies business, the rental business and the financing business or revenue streams. Those revenue streams are really, in many ways, linked to both the installed base as well as the leased asset base that we have on the books. And over the last few years, as we've highlighted, we had a contraction in equipment sales through the economic downturn. What that did is allowed certain finance receivables to run off, and we weren't replacing them at the same rate. And when you have that contraction in the base, you lose some of the rental revenue associated with that or if a customer down trades and gets a smaller meter. The financing revenue is tied to the earnings off of that asset base. So if it's come down, that finance revenue is going to be somewhat less. And obviously, supplies are tied to usage, and we saw some mail volume contraction. So those things have, I'll say, a lag effect relative to when you see the decline in sales activity. And so since the typical lease period is four years, we have some lag effect that runs off. And I think we identified at the Analyst Day that we thought there was a 12- to 18-month lag effect or thereabouts to the recurring revenue streams after sales begin to turn positive. And since we've seen sales turn positive in the latter half of 2011, we assume they continue to be flat-to-positive in 2011 as we have in our guidance. Then, we should see that lag effect continue to diminish. What we wanted to do is call it out clearly and separate it from the underlying strength in the business and the growth in the business and the contribution of Strategic Transformation, so that it was something that you could clearly see from those line items. And quite honestly, I think if you look back over the last several quarters and look ahead, as we go announce earnings, the expectation is that we will see an improving trend in those lines."

We did acquire Portrait last year, which is proving to be an excellent addition to our portfolio, supplying us with great products and growth. So I would say, as we have previously stated, that it depends on what opportunities are available or not available, and we take all of that into consideration in deciding what to do with that cash. So it will continue to be a balanced approach as we look at things from what we do with, as we're doing here, organic investment in the business to grow some very exciting future revenue streams, as well as adding capabilities that will continue to grow the business. As Mike noted, we've had a very significant shift in our business this quarter. The Enterprise segment went over 50% of the business. We have been able to maintain, even with that shift, the very significant margins and being able to hold our EBIT margins in the same range as we've transitioned the business. So I think we've had a very effective move that we had planned in the business. It's continuing to execute, and we'll continue to utilize the same strategies of share repurchase, dividends and investments in the business and new opportunities."

Just a little summary, as you heard in 2010, we saw improving trends across our business. In the small business group, we've had two consecutive quarters of growth in equipment sales, led by Connect+ and Production Mail. And as Mike discussed, that's very important to us on our looking forward. In the enterprise space, we've had two consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year revenue growth, led by Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. 
We achieved $120 million in net benefits, which is up significantly from where our target had been. Our adjusted earnings per share for the year was $2.23, which was in excess of our guidance. We had excellent free cash flow supporting the enhanced returns to our shareholders, giving us the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our share repurchase authorization was increased to a total of $150 million. 
And then as we look in 2011, we're looking at a return to revenue growth moderating declines in that SMB revenue stream that we've talked about. And then looking at projected net benefits growing to $250 million to $300 million from transformation, which is up $100 million. 
Planned investments in Volly, which is a very exciting market development. And I'd encourage you to go to volly.com and see what the product and solution is and how it migrates over time. And then, continued very strong free cash flow as we go into 2011.
So overall, I think it was a great end to 2010, positions us for 2011, setting a great foundation for us to build off of as we move 2011 and beyond. So thank you, all, and look forward to speaking with all of you in the future."

Please note that we have provided slides related to the guidance discussion as part of the webcast found in the Investor Relations section of the Pitney Bowes website. After the presentation, we will take your questions. 
As we anticipated, 2010 was a year in which we had stronger performance in the second half of the year as we saw some initial signs of stabilization in various sectors and geographies. During the year, we continued to execute our Strategic Transformation program in order to lay the foundation for sustained growth and value creation for customers and shareholders alike. Our transformation initiatives are giving us a more variable cost structure, improved customer processes and infrastructure, as well as greater financial flexibility to continue investing in our future. 
Our fourth quarter performance reflects our overall journey to transform the business for enhanced growth. During the quarter, against the backdrop of an uneven global business climate, we continue to make investments in new technologies, enhance the customer experience and streamline our operations. The benefits from our ongoing actions also helps position us for future growth in our Small & Medium Business and our Enterprise Business Solutions groups.
One key milestone in improving the trends for the core business during the quarter was year-over-year improvement in equipment sales. This was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year equipment sales growth in our global SMB operations and on a consolidated basis. Growth in equipment sales in the second half of the year was paced by customer retention gains and new product placements, led by our Connect+ web-based communication system. In fact, Connect+ placements represented about 20% of U.S. Mailing equipment sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to roll out Connect+ throughout Europe and Canada in 2011. Another positive indicator for our SMB group was the continued moderation in the decline of financing revenue, resulting in its lowest rate of decline in overall revenue in eight quarters. 
During the quarter, Enterprise Business Solutions group had positive year-over-year revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, driven by good performance in Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. In our Software business, it is a testament to the growing demand for analytics and customer communication management software that we are able to grow revenue while continuing to build our recurring revenue streams through more multi-year licensing agreement. The majority of our larger software sales were in multi-year agreements, which will benefit stream revenues in future periods. Software revenue would have grown at double-digit pace if these deals had been sold as one-time licenses. Our investments in digital and cloud-based solutions like Connect+ and our recently introduced Volly, secured digital mail system, are helping us lay the foundation for sustained growth and value to customers and shareholders. Throughout the coming year, we will continue to deliver more new solutions which will help SMB and Enterprise customers manage their physical and digital communications with their customers. 
We continued to have excellent free cash flow for the quarter of $289 million and $961 million for the year. We are pleased to note that our Board has taken two actions which will result in enhanced returns to our shareholders. For the 29th consecutive year, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. The dividend will increase to $0.37 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The Board also approved an increase of $100 million to our share repurchase authorization of $50 million for a total of $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full year financial results. Mike?"

Our revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, a 3% decline on both a reported and a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we provided. Revenue was $1.4 billion for the quarter, a decline of about 1% when compared with the prior year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 2%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
I also want to note that we had a reclass between two revenue lines during the quarter. We reclassified $4 million in revenue from rentals to financing. The revenue was associated with the bundling of fees from our meter customers to access our Purchase Power product. The reclassification was related to revenue in both 2009 and 2010. Excluding this reclassification, financing revenue would have declined 5%, a moderation from previous declines, and rentals revenue would have declined 7% in line with our recent experience. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $258 million, which was about 1% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 40 basis points better than last year. 
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives both in the cost of revenue lines and in our selling, general and administrative costs, or SG&A. In particular, SG&A costs were reduced significantly this quarter. SG&A in the quarter declined by about $23 million when compared with the prior year. And for the first time this year, SG&A improved as a percentage of revenue, a decline of 110 basis points to 31.8% when compared to the prior year. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen throughout the year. For the year, SG&A cost declined by $36 million on a reported basis and $57 million on an organic basis.
EBIT margins improved year-over-year in four of our seven business segments for the quarter and five of our seven business segments for the year. These improvements are the result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our business segments.
Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. Plus, we are putting in new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $330 million or $1.62 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $51 million, an increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.23%, about 22 basis points higher than the prior year due to lower commercial paper balances. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.0%. This was higher than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 32.1%. The higher tax rate in the quarter was the result of the mix of business between the U.S. and international operations. The average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.2%. 
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 39.5%, and the tax rate for the year was 38.5%. Write-offs of deferred tax assets associated with stock compensation are included in these rates. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.66, which was $0.02 higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter. For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23, which exceeded our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.22. Currency exchange rates increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.02 for the year. 
GAAP earnings per share included pretax, restructuring and asset impairment charges that totaled $79 million in the quarter and $182 million for the year. This represented $0.27 per share in the quarter and $0.59 per share for the year. GAAP EPS also included a $0.03 tax charge for out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the quarter. For the year, there was a $0.13 tax charge related primarily to out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the year and to healthcare legislation that was enacted at the beginning of the year. Additionally, GAAP EPS included a $0.05 and a $0.09 per share losses from discontinued operations in the quarter and the year, respectively.
Free cash flow was $289 million for the quarter and $961 million for the year, which exceeded our annual guidance of $700 million to $800 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from improved working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
During the quarter, we returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and $320 million for the year. As noted in the press release, the Board of Directors approved an expansion of $100 million to the company's share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $50 million to $150 million, which we plan to utilize over the next 12 to 18 months. 
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the third quarter by about $82 million to a balance of $50 million. About 85% of our total debt is fixed rate and 15% is floating rate. 
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we continued to accelerate the implementation of initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that we'll implement throughout 2011. 
During the fourth quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $79 million included $24 million for pension and retiree medical curtailment related charges. The remaining pretax restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 340 positions across the company.
We are achieving greater net savings than was originally anticipated from our Strategic Transformation program as a result of identifying incremental opportunities and disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved benefits of approximately $120 million for the full year, net of system and related investments, and now expect total benefits from the program to be about $100 million more than originally targeted. We are now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance. Murray?"

In 2011, we expect a business economic environment characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and by geography. While businesses are still more cautious with spending, especially on the SMB solutions group, our experience in the second half of the year shows they have become more willing to invest in solutions that help them grow their business and enhance their efficiency. It is against this backdrop that we project a return to revenue growth in 2011 due in part to a number of initiatives designed to stabilize our base business and to drive new growth opportunities.
Let's turn to the first slide. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth as compared to 2010's 3% decline. I noted our two consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in equipment sales earlier. We anticipate continued improvement in equipment sales during 2011, driven in part by the positive outlook for sales of new solutions like the Connect+ communication system and continued positive growth in Production Mail.
We also expect growth in several other areas in 2011. These include growth in Software revenue due to the increasing demand for term-based licenses of CCM [customer communications management] software solutions; expansion in Mail Services; and new CCM solutions across our Enterprise Business portfolio. 
As we have previously discussed, lower equipment sales during previous years will continue to affect financing, rental and supplies revenue streams. However, we expect moderating declines in these recurring revenue streams, related to our SMB Solutions group as equipment sales continue to improve. 
The next slide illustrates how we expect our earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 to compare to 2010. In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations growth, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. Lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods are expected to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The resulting comparative earnings for the year are in the range of $2.25 to $2.40 per share, which compares to $2.23 per share of adjusted earnings for 2010. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly, a secure digital mail system, which I will discuss shortly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. 
Slide 3 shows our expected 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.80 to $2.10 as compared with $1.50 for the prior year. GAAP earnings include the expected impact of restructuring charges of $0.25 to $0.35 per share in 2011, which is associated with our Strategic Transformation program.
On Slide 4, we show our 2010 free cash flow and our 2011 expected free cash flow range of $750 million to $850 million. We expect slightly lower free cash flow in 2011 because of anticipated increased investment in finance receivables as equipment sales grow and higher capital expenditures associated with investments in business grow.
On Slide 5, the next slide, you will see that we are now projecting $100 million increase in the expected net benefits from the Strategic Transformation program. As Mike discussed, in 2010, we achieved net benefits of $120 million, which was substantially in excess of our original target. Our original target for 2010 was to achieve benefits net of investments in the business of at least $50 million. In 2011, the total costs for the program are expected to remain within the original range that we provided, although we have narrowed the range by $50 million. We are now estimating costs for the Strategic Transformation program in the range of $300 million to $350 million, while notably the total pretax benefits for the program are projected to increase by $100 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million. This anticipated increase in benefits is expected to come from further process automation, channel alignment and reduced infrastructure costs, as well as a continuation of our efforts to streamline product development. 
I want to end today's presentation with a few words about how we are investing some of the anticipated increased benefits from Strategic Transformation in 2011. Slide 6 notes a few highlights about Volly, our recently announced secure digital delivery service that we launched last month. 
As businesses worldwide look to grow their relationships with existing customers and attract new customers, their communications become even more important. We are focused on helping businesses of all sizes manage their critical communications with existing customers and prospects. That is why we believe that investing in the market development of Volly is a foundational investment in CCM, customer communication management, as a long-term growth opportunity for Pitney Bowes. 
We know that today's communication landscape is increasingly a mix of physical and digital communications. Volly is a prime example of how we can integrate physical and digital communications to provide secure, online management of information and offers. With Volly, mailers can have mail with physical addresses, delivered digitally to customers who opt in. Consumers will be able to receive and pay bills, browse and purchase from catalogs, as well as find and download relevant coupons and discount offers, all online in one convenient site.
We have begun partnering with premier mailers, who will use Volly to provide their customers with a choice in how they receive communications. When it launches later this year to consumers, consumers will be able to manage all of these activities from almost anywhere using their computers, their smartphones and their tablets.
2010 was a year in which we continued to make progress and lay the foundation for continued growth. We are excited about continuing to reap even greater benefits from our actions in 2011 and leveraging our streamlined organization and improved processes to invest in and to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we see ahead.

When we talk about Strategic Transformation, we talk about it in terms of net benefits. In other words, we're achieving even greater benefits but reinvesting a good portion of that into process improvement in the systems that we need to automate processes and even in product development-types of things. We've highlighted this Volly investment really because it's the development of a new market and really creating a long-term opportunity, as Murray mentioned, for the company. So it is a different type of investment than we have traditionally been making against the net benefits in Strategic Transformation. One of the other things we tried to highlight is, obviously, the impact of the recurring revenue streams in our SMB business, which have been improving on a relative basis over, really, the last several quarters. And we expect that to continue and improve, but to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis. What I would note, though, is that as we get this far along in the transformation of our business, we've been able to maintain very strong overall margins in the business while really shifting our dependence on different revenue streams. So we've seen a significant growth in Software that is highly recurring, and we've seen rentals and supplies becoming a smaller part of our overall revenue mix. So we think, in total, we're getting good growth in earnings out of the net benefits. At the same time, we're transforming the business and ending this transformation with still very strong margins."

First of all, as we stated, as we talk to billers, we are already involved with over 70% of the transaction billers in the marketplace, and those billers have both digital and physical delivery. The digital delivery is in the 10% to 12% of all transaction mail. What that does is provide opportunity as billers look to have a different cost alternative. And our business model will be such that it will be lower cost than physical. But since it is a secure environment which aggregates for the consumer, it will have a cost to it, and that is where the revenue stream will come from. At the same time, we'll be offering coupons, which will have a revenue stream from, and we'll have catalogs, which will have a revenue stream as well. So those are sort of the three streams, Shannon. As we look to launching this later in the year to the consumer side -- the launch that we had earlier in this year was to billers because we need to bring the content on first before we go to consumers. As we move into the second half of the year and begin the rollout of consumers, that's when we'll start to see the first pieces of revenue, and then it will build. I would anticipate that it depends on what the curve of adoption is as to how we choose to invest. That's why we put flexibility in the range, and we'll be able to answer your question more specifically as we get later in the year and we see how quickly consumers are willing to adapt to this model. And as they do, we would either see it taking off without a lot of support or it will require more support. So I think we'll have to answer that around midyear to third quarter as we see the first results as to how steep the curve of adoption could be, or whether it has a longer tail before the high rise in adoption."

As we look and I guess, if we take small business and sort of look at it in two segments, the very small business and then the small- to mid-size business, we are seeing some differences there. The very small business segment, which is still a large piece of that small business customer base, has actually still remained fairly stagnant as to its ability to buy. So we still are not seeing a big change in what we've been calling a very not positive growth position. We aren't seeing those businesses spend. However, as we move up to the mid-level and higher of the small business, which are really the areas where Connect+ addresses, that business segment is now looking to reach out to create more business. So the Connect+, as we launch that, not only processes the mail, but it gives a vehicle of advertising on the front of the envelope creating open ability. And that customer group is seeing that advantage, and that's why we're seeing the Connect+ sales accelerate. And as I mentioned, we saw 20% of our sales in the quarter being in the Connect+, which, considering its segment size is very significant, and we see that continuing. On the Enterprise side, we're continuing to see the positives of Enterprise spending more. It does vary by geography around the world. We see a little more hesitancy in Europe than we do in America at the moment. So it sort of fluctuates as you can see from the announcement of different things that are happening around the world. But overall, I'd say the Enterprise segment is moving back to positive acquisition. The mid-size is looking not so much for efficiency but revenue growth opportunity, so products and services that leverage that are seen as positive. And the very small business segment is still not -- we're not seeing any positive growth in that segment."

We really did a good job of managing the capital, but we know we have investments to make to achieve that extra $100 million of Strategic Transformation benefit. So that's factored into our guidance as well. And there was some small one-offs in 2009. So we think 2011 is reflective of the underlying strength of the business.

Basically, the three key revenue streams from a recurring nature that are around our core business are the supplies business, the rental business and the financing business or revenue streams. Those revenue streams are really, in many ways, linked to both the installed base as well as the leased asset base that we have on the books. And over the last few years, as we've highlighted, we had a contraction in equipment sales through the economic downturn. What that did is allowed certain finance receivables to run off, and we weren't replacing them at the same rate. And when you have that contraction in the base, you lose some of the rental revenue associated with that or if a customer down trades and gets a smaller meter. The financing revenue is tied to the earnings off of that asset base. So if it's come down, that finance revenue is going to be somewhat less. And obviously, supplies are tied to usage, and we saw some mail volume contraction. So those things have, I'll say, a lag effect relative to when you see the decline in sales activity. And so since the typical lease period is four years, we have some lag effect that runs off. And I think we identified at the Analyst Day that we thought there was a 12- to 18-month lag effect or thereabouts to the recurring revenue streams after sales begin to turn positive. And since we've seen sales turn positive in the latter half of 2011, we assume they continue to be flat-to-positive in 2011 as we have in our guidance. Then, we should see that lag effect continue to diminish. What we wanted to do is call it out clearly and separate it from the underlying strength in the business and the growth in the business and the contribution of Strategic Transformation, so that it was something that you could clearly see from those line items. And quite honestly, I think if you look back over the last several quarters and look ahead, as we go announce earnings, the expectation is that we will see an improving trend in those lines."

Certainly, we are generating and expect to generate continued strong cash flow, which, as we've said, would be utilized for dividends, for each share repurchased and for expansion in the business. We have really held back on external expansion in the business. We did acquire Portrait last year, which is proving to be an excellent addition to our portfolio, supplying us with great products and growth. So I would say, as we have previously stated, that it depends on what opportunities are available or not available, and we take all of that into consideration in deciding what to do with that cash. So it will continue to be a balanced approach as we look at things from what we do with, as we're doing here, organic investment in the business to grow some very exciting future revenue streams, as well as adding capabilities that will continue to grow the business. As Mike noted, we've had a very significant shift in our business this quarter. The Enterprise segment went over 50% of the business. We have been able to maintain, even with that shift, the very significant margins and being able to hold our EBIT margins in the same range as we've transitioned the business. So I think we've had a very effective move that we had planned in the business. It's continuing to execute, and we'll continue to utilize the same strategies of share repurchase, dividends and investments in the business and new opportunities."

Just a little summary, as you heard in 2010, we saw improving trends across our business. In the small business group, we've had two consecutive quarters of growth in equipment sales, led by Connect+ and Production Mail. And as Mike discussed, that's very important to us on our looking forward. In the enterprise space, we've had two consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year revenue growth, led by Production Mail, Software and Mail Services. 
We achieved $120 million in net benefits, which is up significantly from where our target had been. Our adjusted earnings per share for the year was $2.23, which was in excess of our guidance. We had excellent free cash flow supporting the enhanced returns to our shareholders, giving us the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our share repurchase authorization was increased to a total of $150 million. 
And then as we look in 2011, we're looking at a return to revenue growth moderating declines in that SMB revenue stream that we've talked about. And then looking at projected net benefits growing to $250 million to $300 million from transformation, which is up $100 million. 
Planned investments in Volly, which is a very exciting market development. And I'd encourage you to go to volly.com and see what the product and solution is and how it migrates over time. And then, continued very strong free cash flow as we go into 2011.
So overall, I think it was a great end to 2010, positions us for 2011, setting a great foundation for us to build off of as we move 2011 and beyond. So thank you, all, and look forward to speaking with all of you in the future."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance and Mike will follow with the details on our first quarter results, and then I'll discuss the rest of the year. Afterwards will take your questions. 
During the quarter, we continued to gain momentum and our clients for long-term growth as we made progress against several initiatives that we discussed at year end.
For the third consecutive quarter, both equipment sales and Software revenues grew. The continued improvement in equipment sales was led by increasing demand from high-volume mailers to update their hardware and software production platforms. 
Our growth in Software was fueled by global demand for data analytics and location intelligence solutions. The increase in Software revenue was also supported by the growing recurring revenue stream related to the increasing number of multiyear licensing agreements.
When revenues for the quarter benefited from these increases and equipment sales and software, it was offset by the expected lower recurring revenue streams related to our SMB solutions group. We have previously explained that lower SMB equipment sales in past years created a headwind that reduces our supplies, rentals and financing revenue streams. We anticipate that these headwinds will continue to diminish as equipment sales improve.
As expected, the declines in the SMB recurring revenue streams did moderate in this quarter. During the quarter, we continued to reap substantial benefits from our ongoing Strategic Transformation program. The program is delivering improvements in customer processes and infrastructure, cost savings, as well as an enhanced ability to deliver new products and services. The savings and investments made possible by Strategic Transformation will enable us to continue to introduce a number of new customer communications management solutions for SMB and enterprise customers this year.
Earlier in the quarter, we announced Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. We continue to get positive impact from all stakeholders and make progress with partners. We introduced additional CCM solutions for enterprise customers, including the expansion of our Intellijet production print line and Portrait Miner 6.0 software for predicting customer behavior. We are providing SMB customers with the industry's only family of cloud-based solutions, including pbSmartPostage and PbSmart Connections, an email and marketing communications platform.
In addition earlier this week, we announced SendSuite Live, a new platform that strengthens our market leadership in the transportation management services shipping marketplace. 
We also continued our progress in the stabilization of our base business in the quarter. Positive trends including in customer retention and ongoing placements of new products such as our Connect+ web-based communication system.
Connect+ has already been launched in Canada, U.K. and Australia, and it's global rollout will continue throughout 2011.
Overall, SMB equipment sales declined however, in part, due to the phase movement of the select group of customers to alternate sales channels. These channels will best serve their needs as we continue to offer more products and services online.
Consistent with prior shifts, we saw improving sales productivity throughout the quarter. We expect our channel transition initiatives to drive longer-term growth through greater engagement of small business customers with our new web-enabled solutions. These moves are also helping to create a more efficient cost structure, as we align the value of the sales with the cost of the delivery channel. These are all important contributing factors to our projected stabilization in this business in 2011.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion from our first quarter financial results."
297018,129364226,119582,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of about 2% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year, and a decline of about 3%  when you exclude the impact of currency.Breaking down our revenue for the quarter be",1239,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of about 2% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year, and a decline of about 3%  when you exclude the impact of currency.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 5%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased, 4% versus the prior year, excluding the impact of currency revenue outside the U.S. increased 1%.
Non-U.S. operations represented 32% of total revenue.
At this point, I'd like to note 2 unusual events that occurred this quarter. First, on February 7, there was a fire at our processing facility in Dallas, Texas. While all employees are safe, the site was completely destroyed. We estimate lost revenue and EBIT of about $7 million each in the first quarter.
We expect continued adverse impact in both revenue and EBIT in the second and third quarters until the new facility is fully operational. For the full year, we expect total revenue for the company to be impacted by about 1.5%.
It's expected that the earnings associated with the lost revenue and the cost related to outfitting a new facility to be fully covered by insurance proceeds in future periods. To date, we have $50 million advance from the insurance companies. However, the accounting rules such as this advance and future insurance proceeds cannot be recognized in earnings until the final settlement of the insurance claim. If the insurance claim is not settled in the current year, we estimate 2011 adjusted earnings could be reduced by $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share.
The company's response to the fire was impressive on many levels. While the loss of the facility impacted our ability to qualify customer's mails at the highest level of discount, our national network enabled us to quickly reroute mail and convert other capacity to process first-class mail, and has resulted in retention of virtually all of our customers. The facility's permanent replacement is expected to be operational in the second quarter and at previous productivity levels by the end of the third quarter.
The rest of our network continues to process increasing volumes of both first-class and standard-class mail from new and existing customers. Excluding the impact of the Dallas fire, presort-related revenue for the quarter grew and the EBIT margin continued to improve. 
Second, of course, is the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Our condolences go out to all those have been impacted.
With respect to our business, about 1%  of our total revenue is from Japan, so the impact on revenue and earnings in the quarter was minimal. We had no products supply issue the first quarter and based on current conditions, do not expect any disruption on our supply chain in the second quarter. We're actively working with our supply chain partners and have a number of strategies in place to mitigate potential disruption in the second half of the year.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $211 million, which was about 8% lower than last year. EBIT margin was about 16% . EBIT margin was affected this quarter by of the cost associated with the Dallas fire and by our planned investment in Volly, our secure digital mail service.
Excluding these impacts, EBIT margin would have been 16.7%.
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives in our selling, general and administrative cost or SG&A. SG&A in the quarter declined by more than $13 million when compared with the prior year. And for the second consecutive quarter, SG&A improved a year-over-year as a percentage of revenue and declined 40 basis points this quarter to 32.5%. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen continuing to improve. EBIT margin improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments in the quarter, including both our SMB business segments.
These improvements are the result of our continued focus on increasing our operational efficiency across all of our business segments. We are reaping the benefits of the Strategic Transformation action we have taken since the fourth quarter of 2009 and we continue to implement additional actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continued to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $280 million, or $1.37 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $51 million, a modest increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year.
The average interest rate for the quarter was 4.81%, 53 basis points higher than the prior year due to changes in our debt portfolio mix. The attractive tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 29.9%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was primarily the result of a tax benefit arising from the favorable conclusion of a non-U.S. tax examination. We continue to expect the average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 33% to 35% .
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30.9%.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.53, which compares with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Our earnings per share of $0.53 this quarter was reduced by $0.04 per share as the result of more than $0.02 per share per estimated cost related to the Dallas fire, and by more than $0.01 per share for our investment in v1.
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included restructuring charges that totaled $0.08 per share in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.01 per share noncash tax charge or out of the out-of-the money stock options that expired during the quarter and a $0.01 per share loss from discontinued operations.
Free cash flow was $286 million for the quarter. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from lower tax payments, tax refund and a reduction in our finance receivables, partially offset by higher capital expenditures as we invested in business.
During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the fourth quarter by about $8 million for a balance of $2 million. About 86% of our total debt is fixed rate, and 14% is floating rate.
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the first quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the first quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $26 million were primarily for severance costs related to the elimination of about 800 positions across the company. 
As noted, when we gave guidance last year, we're now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and we are on track to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits by 2011.
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per diluted share, GAAP earnings per diluted share and free cash flow. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth.
Our projected return to revenue growth for the year is due in part to the initiatives I outlined at the beginning of this call, all designed to drive new growth opportunities and to stabilize our base business. 
In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.34 per share from operations growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.
As noted previously, we expect lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. This will result in comparative earnings for year of $2.25 to $2 40 per share. 
Additionally, we plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop market for Volly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.15 to $2.35.
On a GAAP basis, we expect 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.80 to $2.10. This includes the expected impact of $0.25 to $0.35 per share for restructuring charges associated with Strategic Transformation. Guidance excludes any financial impact due to the fire at our presort facility as outlined in Mike's discussion.
We expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $750 million to $850 million. We anticipate lower free cash flow in 2011 as compared to the prior year because of increased investment in finance receivables during the year. Higher investments in finance receivables is expected in relation to higher levels of equipment sales and higher levels of capital expenditures associated with investments in business growth.
Conditions in the first quarter underscored our belief that the business and economic environment will be characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and geography. However, we remain focused on investing in solutions, which enable businesses to manage both physical and digital communications channels with our customers while continuing to streamline and enhance our operations and processes.
I'd just like to make one correction. I said $0.32 to $0.34, and as far as our incremental growth, and that was actually $0.32 to $0.42 per share for operations growth and productivity excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.

This creates a short-term disruption as we shift the accounts and reestablish those connections. So that created a negative in January. We saw it start moving back in February and March, and this is what normally has happened as we have had these types of shifts and the past. So we expect an initial reduction and then the curve to come back. And we're pleased to see it returning back to where we expect it to be.

Secondly, we have the leading integrity products in the marketplace. That is moving forward. Also we are seeing customers how we do more transformational work in these areas. So particularly, when you look at services and insurance, they are the areas that have been accelerating back. Now that also coincides with the switch back to growth in total mail volume. So if you recall in '09, mail was down 15%. It was about 9% last year. And in the last quarter, it was up 1.3%. So we're starting to see the follow-on benefits from that transition and the need for people to accelerate the quality of what they're delivering in mails. So that's sort of from the global hardware side. On the software side, the continuing expansion we have in data analytics and location intelligence is providing us with some very positive and unique offerings to customers that are very exciting for them. So they're adopting those. And we have our multiyear contracts, which have been a negative for a couple of years, but now that stream revenue is coming in. And we're continuing to see the acceleration of those multiyear contracts. And then finally, as I have mentioned, we introduced the new Portrait analytics software. The combination of the Portrait tools with our existing tools provided a much richer relationship in our customers. So we're seeing that as a continuing positive trend as we offer a much broader range of services to our customers."

We do plan some pension contributions this year for both our U.S. and international plans on the neighborhood of about $145 million.

But we have seen the enterprise side of the business continue to remain strong in written business. It does vary globally as different markets, particularly in Europe where the credit items that occur. It does have some bearing effect. But in general, the enterprise segment has continued to show positive signs. The SMB area is much slower. We aren't seeing the same type of positive reaction in the SMB space as far as opening up from a spending point of view. So that remains something that we have basically put into our plans that it will remain sort of where it is. On the positive side though, we do is see markets like Asia as being very strong. And it is not that big of a component of the business, but it is very positive and very helpful as we see the market grow and expansion they're. I'd just like to go back to Chris's question that I left unanswered. On the installed base of meters, this is all meters globally. In the U.S., last year, the meter population declined 7%. And if you look at it at this current quarter, it was down in the 6% range. So we're starting to see a decline in the U.S. Globally, it is positive in a number of countries and generally less than 6% . So the U.S. is just over half of the global market of install base. So it would say that the decline is moderating around the world, and it would be somewhere down in the under 6%. If I were to pull a guess, it would be in the 3% to 4%  range. And then the other component of that is the majority of that reduction as has been in the very low end of the meter line, which is the lowest revenue side of the product line. Now that's why as you noticed, we introduced Smart Postage. Smart Postage goes directly to let that low end both below our existing meters and up to the meter, and then adds a shifting component. It is a complementary product we'll be adding to our existing meter customers and expanding. So we see that as an offset in the low end. Certainly, at the high end, the Connect+ product is gaining in placements in that space. So we're seeing the high end is more stable and the low end, as we've had the economic issues around the world for small business, has been a negative. We see that decline slowing. And then the Smart Postage, our cloud-based offering will actually begin to address that as we go through this year."

We're saying this is a broad-based communication tool. We're leveraging our expertise and capabilities and across it. And as we go forward, we'll see much more -- if you look at Connect+, it starts with the ability to put promotions on the outside of the envelope. Smart Postage does the same. You have Smart Connections, which brings Digital Communications in. You have Volly, which starts connecting physical and digital together and creating those communications. You have all of our software tools which enhance those communications. And then, the addition of the analytics because you can do all those things and wonder whether it's succeeding or not and that's where the whole data analytics comes in, which ties it back to, again, how do I communicate to my customers. I think of it as everyone of our customers is looking to retain their customer base, expand their offerings to their customer base and find new customers. And that's what the mail has traditionally done, and that's what we're doing as we expand in a hybrid world of both physical and digital."

That will probably in September. So that will give you a better view of all that new goods and services. But as you think about it, the way we look at it, the number of messages between customers and their customers is not declining. It really is a matter of how it's delivered in either physical or digital form. We are now launching into a hybrid mode where we will help our customers deliver those messages in whichever form their customers choose to receive it, and we believe the business model is such that we will be able to have the same or more from the digital than we had from the physical. So regardless of speed in transition, as we're now moving in the digital side of communication, we believe that declines will be offset and taken up on the digital side. So it's hard to predict what that long-term mix shift is, but what we're doing is positioning the company so that we're attacking the total delivery channel and not just one side and that will give us the ability to both offset any shifts and to create growth as we expand the offerings."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and Mike will follow with the details on our first quarter results, and then I'll discuss the rest of the year. Afterwards, we'll take your questions. 
During the quarter, we continued to gain momentum in our clients for long-term growth as we made progress against several initiatives that we discussed at year end.  For the third consecutive quarter, both Equipment Sales and Software revenues grew. The continued improvement in Equipment Sales was led by increasing demand from high-volume mailers to update their Hardware and Software production platforms.  Our growth in Software was fueled by global demand for Data Analytics and Location Intelligence Solutions. The increase in Software revenue was also supported by the growing recurring revenue stream related to the increasing number of multiyear licensing agreements.  While revenues for the quarter benefited from these increases in Equipment Sales and Software, it was offset by the expected lower recurring revenue streams related to our SMB Solutions Group. We have previously explained that lower SMB Equipment Sales in past years created a headwind that reduces our supplies, rentals and financing revenue streams. We anticipate that these headwinds will continue to diminish as equipment sales improve.
As expected, the declines in the SMB recurring revenue streams did moderate in this quarter. During the quarter, we continued to reap substantial benefits from our ongoing Strategic Transformation program. The program is delivering improvements in customer processes and infrastructure, cost savings, as well as an enhanced ability to deliver new products and services. The savings and the investments made possible by Strategic Transformation will enable us to continue to introduce a number of new Customer Communications Management solutions for SMB and Enterprise customers this year.
Earlier in the quarter, we announced Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. We have continued to get positive feedback from all stakeholders, and make progress with partners. We introduced additional CCM [Customer Communications Management] solutions for Enterprise customers, including the expansion of our Intellijet production print line and Portrait Miner 6.0 software for predicting customer behavior. We are providing SMB customers with the industry's only family of cloud-based solutions, including pbSmartPostage and PbSmart Connections, an email marketing and communications platform.  In addition, earlier this week, we announced SendSuite Live, a new web-based shipping platform that strengthens our market leadership in the Transportation Management Services shipping marketplace. 
We also continued our progress in the stabilization of our base business in the quarter. Positive trends, including continued gains in customer retention, and ongoing placements of new products such as our Connect+ web-based communications system.  Connect+ has already been launched in Canada, U.K. and Australia, and it's global rollout will continue throughout 2011.
Overall, SMB equipment sales declined, however, in part, due to the phase movement of the select group of customers to alternate sales channels. These channels will best serve their needs, as we continue to offer more products and services online.  Consistent with prior shifts, we saw improving sales productivity throughout the quarter. We expect our channel transition initiatives to drive longer-term growth through greater engagement of small business customers with our new web-enabled solutions. These moves are also helping to create a more efficient cost structure, as we align the value of the sales with the cost of the delivery channel. These are all important contributing factors to our projected stabilization in this business in 2011.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion from our first quarter financial results."

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of about 2% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year, and a decline of about 3%  when you exclude the impact of currency.  Breaking down our revenue for the quarter be",1244,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of about 2% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year, and a decline of about 3%  when you exclude the impact of currency.  Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 5%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 4% versus the prior year, excluding the impact of currency revenue outside the U.S., increased 1%.  Non-U.S. operations represented 32% of total revenue.
At this point, I'd like to note 2 unusual events that occurred this quarter. First, on February 7, there was a fire at our presort processing facility in Dallas, Texas. While all employees are safe, the site was completely destroyed, and we estimate lost revenue and EBIT of about $7 million each in the first quarter.  We expect continued adverse impacts to both revenue and EBIT in the second and third quarters until the new facility is fully operational. For the full year, we expect total revenue for the company to be impacted by about 1.5%.  It's expected that the earnings associated with the lost revenue and the cost related to outfitting a new facility will be fully covered by insurance proceeds in future periods. To date, we have received a $15 million advance from the insurance companies. However, the accounting rules are such that this advance and future insurance proceeds cannot be recognized in earnings until the final settlement of the insurance claim. If the insurance claim is not settled in the current year, we estimate 2011 adjusted earnings could be reduced by $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share.
The company's response to the fire was impressive on many levels. While the loss of the facility impacted our ability to qualify customer's mail at the highest level of discount, our national network enabled us to quickly reroute mail and convert other capacity to process first-class mail, and has resulted in retention of virtually all of our customers. The facility's permanent replacement is expected to be operational in the second quarter and at previous productivity levels by the end of the third quarter.  The rest of our network continues to process increasing volumes of both first-class and standard-class mail from new and existing customers. Excluding the impact of the Dallas fire, presort-related revenue for the quarter grew and the EBIT margin continued to improve. 
Second, of course, is the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Our condolences go out to all those have been impacted.  With respect to our business, about 1% of our total revenue is from Japan, so the impact on revenue and earnings in the quarter was minimal. We had no products supply issues in the first quarter and based on current conditions, do not expect any disruptions in our supply chain in the second quarter. We are actively working with our supply chain partners, and have a number of strategies in place to mitigate potential disruption in the second half of the year.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $211 million, which was about 8% lower than last year. EBIT margin was about 16% . EBIT margin was affected this quarter by of the cost associated with the Dallas fire and by our planned investment in Volly, our secure digital mail service.  Excluding these impacts, EBIT margin would have been 16.7%.
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives in our selling, general and administrative cost or SG&A. SG&A in the quarter declined by more than $13 million when compared with the prior year. And for the second consecutive quarter, SG&A improved year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, and declined 40 basis points this quarter to 32.5%. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives, but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen continued to improve. EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments for the quarter, including both our SMB business segments.
These improvements are a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments. We are reaping the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions that we have taken since the fourth quarter of 2009, and we continue to implement additional actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers, and develop new products. We continued to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $280 million or $1.37 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $51 million, a modest increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year.  The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.81%, 53 basis points higher than the prior year due to changes in our debt portfolio mix. The attractive tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 29.9%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was primarily the result of a tax benefit arising from a favorable conclusion of a non-U.S. tax examination. We continue to expect the average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 33% to 35% .  The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30.9%.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.53, which compares with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Our earnings per share of $0.53 this quarter was reduced by $0.04 per share, as a result of more than $0.02 per share per estimated cost related to the Dallas fire, and by more than $0.01 per share for our investment in Volly.
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included restructuring charges that totaled $0.08 per share in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.01 per share non-cash tax charge or out-of-the money stock options that expired during the quarter, and a $0.01 per share loss from discontinued operations.  Free cash flow was $286 million for the quarter. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from lower tax payments, tax refund and a reduction in our finance receivables, partly offset by higher capital expenditures as we invested in the business.
During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the fourth quarter by about $8 million to a balance of $42 million. About 86% of our total debt is fixed rate, and 14% is floating rate.
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the first quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the first quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $26 million were primarily for severance costs related to the elimination of about 800 positions across the company.  As noted, when we gave guidance last year, we're now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and we are on track to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits by 2011.
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We are reaffirming our full-year guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per diluted share, GAAP earnings per diluted share and free cash flow. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth.  Our projected return to revenue growth for the year is due in part to the initiatives I outlined at the beginning of this call, all designed to drive new growth opportunities, and to stabilize our base business.  In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.34 per share from operations growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.
As noted previously, we expect lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. This will result in comparative earnings for year of $2.25 to $2 40 per share.  Additionally, we plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.15 to $2.35.
On a GAAP basis, we expect 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.80 to $2.10. This includes the expected impact of $0.25 to $0.35 per share for restructuring charges associated with Strategic Transformation. Guidance excludes any financial impact due to the fire at our presort facility as outlined in Mike's discussion.
We expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $750 million to $850 million. We anticipate lower free cash flow in 2011 as compared to the prior year because of increased investment in finance receivables during the year. Higher investment in finance receivables is expected in relation to higher levels of equipment sales, and higher levels of capital expenditures associated with investments in business growth.
Conditions in the first quarter underscored our belief that the business and economic environment will be characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and geography. However, we remain focused on investing in solutions, which enabled businesses to manage both physical and digital communication channels with their customers, while continuing to streamline and enhance our operations and processes.  I'd just like to make one correction. I said $0.32 to $0.34, and as far as our incremental growth, and that was actually $0.32 to $0.42 per share for operations growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.

As we look at the SMB market and how the customers prefer to be served, whether it is by direct sales or by inside sales, we determined at the beginning of the year to shift a fair number of accounts into inside account management rather than direct account management. This creates a short-term disruption as we shift the accounts and reestablish those connections. So that created a negative in January. We saw it started moving back in February and March, and this is what normally has happened as we have had these types of shifts in the past. So we expect an initial reduction and then the curve to come back. And we're pleased to see it returning back to where we expect it to be.

As we look at the high-volume segments, if you recall a number of years ago, there was a hold back batch in procurement there. So that has been coming back. Secondly, we have the leading integrity products in the marketplace. That is moving forward. Also, we're seeing customers looking at how to do more transpromotional work in these areas. So particularly, when you look at financial services and insurance, they are the areas that have been accelerating back. Now that also coincides with the switch back to growth in total mail volume. So if you recall, in '09, mail was down 15%. It was down 9% last year. And in the last quarter, it was up 1.3%. So we're starting to see the follow-on benefits from that transition and the need for people to accelerate the quality of what they're delivering in mails. So that's sort of from the global Hardware side. On the Software side, the continuing expansion we have in data analytics and location intelligence is providing us with some very positive and unique offerings to customers that are very exciting for them. So they're adopting those. And then we have our multi-year contracts, which have been a negative for a couple of years, but now that stream revenue is coming in. And we're continuing to see the acceleration of those multi-year contracts. And then finally, as I mentioned, we introduced the new Portrait Analytics software. The combination of the Portrait tools with our existing tools provided a much richer relationship in our customers.

We really have a question of the timing of when we can recognize those insurance proceeds versus the impact in the business, but we are well on our way to having the new facility in place. We'll be up and running in the second quarter, and it takes several months to kind of iron out the process and to get it to full productivity.

But we have seen the Enterprise side of the business continue to remain strong in written business. It does vary globally as different markets, particularly in Eu",453,"I think as you put it, until everybody knows for sure, it's pretty hard to make predictions. But we have seen the Enterprise side of the business continue to remain strong in written business. It does vary globally as different markets, particularly in Europe, with the credit items that occur. It does have some bearing effect. But in general, the Enterprise segment has continued to show positive signs. The SMB area is much slower. We aren't seeing the same type of positive reaction in the SMB space as far as opening up from a spending point of view. So that remains something that we have basically put into our plans that it will remain sort of where it is. On the positive side though, we do see markets like Asia as being very strong. And it is not that big of component of our business, but it's is very positive and very helpful as we see the market growth and the expansion there.  I'd just like to go back to Chris's question that I left unanswered. On the installed base of meters, this is all meters globally. In the U.S., last year, the meter population declined 7%. And as you look at it at this current quarter, it was down in the 6% range. So we're starting to see a decline in the U.S. Globally, it is positive in a number of countries, and generally less than 6%. So the U.S. is about just over half of the global market of installed base. So it would say the decline is moderating around the world, and it would be somewhere down in the under 6%. If I was to pull a guess, it would be in the 3% to 4% range. And then the other component of that is the majority of that reduction as has been in the very low end of the meter line, which is the lowest revenue side of the product line. Now that's why as you noticed, we introduced SmartPostage [pbSmartPostage]. SmartPostage goes directly into that low end both below our existing meters and up to the meter, and then adds a shifting component. So it is a complementary product we'll be adding to our existing meter customers and expanding. So we see that as an offset in the low end. Certainly, at the high end, the Connect+ product is gaining in placements in that space. So we're seeing the high end is more stable, and the low end, as we've had the economic issues around the world for Small Business, has been a negative. We see that decline slowing. And then the SmartPostage, our cloud-based offering, will actually begin to address that as we go through this year."

We're continuing to develop those relationships, and build the tools with them to create the ability to place the mail into Volly. We are still expecting to go to the consumer market sometime late in the third quarter. We will launch it earlier as an internal trial, with PB employees, and then look out to go to market in the same quarter. At the same time, we did bring in a president of that business, who comes from the digital marketplace, and he is also continuing to look at the offering as we are planning to launch it, and making any appropriate adjustments that would enhance it from a digital acceptance. So the traffic and volume around it, and people wanting to participate continues to grow from both the mailer and consumer side. But we do need to build the connectors for the mail producers before it will have value to consumers. So we are still on the track we have planned. We still see it as an exciting product, and we'll look to see how we begin the adoption curve later in the year."

What we announced late last year is our commitment to the Customer Communications Management space, and all of our new products and services are tailored around that. Our products, historically, have been involved in connecting our customers to their customers. We are taking that connection and expanding it with our Software tools, new Hardware tools and our cloud-based tools, to enhance that communication in both physical and digital form. So you'll see all of our offerings coming out based around Customer Communication Management, helping our customers more effectively communicate with their customers to enhance and build their relationships in both physical and digital form, and the ability to have that in multiple digital forms. We're saying this is a broad-based communication tool. We're leveraging our expertise and capabilities across it. And as we go forward, we'll see much more -- you look at Connect+, it starts with the ability to put promotions on the outside of the envelope. SmartPostage does the same. You have Smart Connections [pbSmart Connections], which brings Digital Communications in. You have Volly, which starts connecting physical and digital together and creating those communications. You have all of our software tools, which enhance those communications. And then, the addition of the analytics because you can do all those things and wonder whether it's succeeding or not, and that's where the whole data analytics comes in, which ties it back to, again, how do I communicate to my customers. So I think about it as everyone of our customers is looking to retain their customer base, expand their offerings to their customer base, and find new customers. And that's what the mail has traditionally done, and that's what we're doing as we expand into a hybrid world of both physical and digital."

It is really a matter of how it's delivered in either physical or digital form. We're now launching into a hybrid mode, where we will help our customers deliver those messages in whichever form their customers choose to receive it, and we believe the business model is such that we will be able to have the same or more from the digital than we had from the physical. So regardless of speed of transition, as we're now moving into the digital side of the communication, we believe that declines will be offset, and taken up on the digital side. So it's hard to predict what that long-term mix shift is, but what we're doing is positioning the company, so that we're attacking the total delivery channel, and not just one side, and that will give us the ability to both offset any shifts, and to create growth as we expand the offerings."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and Mike will follow with the details on our first quarter results, and then I'll discuss the rest of the year. Afterwards, we'll take your questions. 
During the quarter, we continued to gain momentum in our plans for long-term growth as we made progress against several initiatives that we discussed at year end.  For the third consecutive quarter, both Equipment Sales and Software revenues grew. The continued improvement in Equipment Sales was led by increasing demand from high-volume mailers to update their hardware and software production platforms.  Our growth in Software was fueled by global demand for Data Analytics and Location Intelligence Solutions. The increase in Software revenue was also supported by the growing recurring revenue stream related to the increasing number of multiyear licensing agreements.  While revenues for the quarter benefited from these increases in Equipment Sales and Software, it was offset by the expected lower recurring revenue streams related to our SMB Solutions Group. We have previously explained that lower SMB Equipment Sales in past years created a headwind that reduces our supplies, rentals and financing revenue streams. We anticipate that these headwinds will continue to diminish as equipment sales improve.
As expected, the declines in the SMB recurring revenue streams did moderate in this quarter. During the quarter, we continued to reap substantial benefits from our ongoing Strategic Transformation program. The program is delivering improvements in customer processes and infrastructure, cost savings, as well as an enhanced ability to deliver new products and services. The savings and the investments made possible by Strategic Transformation will enable us to continue to introduce a number of new Customer Communications Management solutions for SMB and enterprise customers this year.
Earlier in the quarter, we announced Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. We have continued to get positive feedback from all stakeholders, and make progress with partners. We introduced additional CCM [Customer Communications Management] solutions for enterprise customers, including the expansion of our Intellijet production print line and Portrait Miner 6.0 software for predicting customer behavior. We are providing SMB customers with the industry's only family of cloud-based solutions, including pbSmartPostage and PbSmart Connections, an email marketing and communications platform.  In addition, earlier this week, we announced SendSuite Live, a new web-based shipping platform that strengthens our market leadership in the transportation management services shipping marketplace. 
We also continued our progress in the stabilization of our base business in the quarter. Positive trends, including continued gains in customer retention and ongoing placements of new products such as our Connect+ web-based communications system.  Connect+ has already been launched in Canada, U.K. and Australia, and its global rollout will continue throughout 2011.
Overall, SMB equipment sales declined, however, in part, due to the phased movement of a select group of customers to alternate sales channels. These channels will best serve their needs as we continue to offer more products and services online.  Consistent with prior shifts, we saw improving sales productivity throughout the quarter. We expect our channel transition initiatives to drive longer-term growth through greater engagement of small business customers with our new web-enabled solutions. These moves are also helping to create a more efficient cost structure, as we align the value of the sales with the cost of the delivery channel. These are all important contributing factors to our projected stabilization in this business in 2011.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion from our first quarter financial results."
297018,129364226,119837,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray.

Breaking down our revenue for the quarter be",1245,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of about 2% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year, and a decline of about 3%  when you exclude the impact of currency.  Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 5%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 4% versus the prior year.  Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 1%.  Non-U.S. operations represented 32% of total revenue.
At this point, I'd like to note 2 unusual events that occurred this quarter. First, on February 7, there was a fire at our presort processing facility in Dallas, Texas. While all employees are safe, the site was completely destroyed, and we estimate lost revenue and EBIT of about $7 million each in the first quarter.  We expect continued adverse impacts to both revenue and EBIT in the second and third quarters until the new facility is fully operational. For the full year, we expect total revenue for the company to be impacted by about 0.5%.  It's expected that the earnings associated with the lost revenue and the costs related to outfitting a new facility will be fully covered by insurance proceeds in future periods. To date, we have received a $15 million advance from the insurance companies. However, the accounting rules are such that this advance and future insurance proceeds cannot be recognized in earnings until the final settlement of the insurance claim. If the insurance claim is not settled in the current year, we estimate 2011 adjusted earnings could be reduced by $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share.
The company's response to the fire was impressive on many levels. While the loss of the facility impacted our ability to qualify customers' mail at the highest level of discount, our national network enabled us to quickly reroute mail and convert other capacity to process first-class mail, and has resulted in retention of virtually all of our customers. The facility's permanent replacement is expected to be operational in the second quarter and at previous productivity levels by the end of the third quarter.  The rest of our network continues to process increasing volumes of both first-class and standard-class mail from new and existing customers. Excluding the impact of the Dallas fire, presort-related revenue for the quarter grew and the EBIT margin continued to improve. 
Second, of course, is the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Our condolences go out to all those who have been impacted.  With respect to our business, about 1% of our total revenue is from Japan, so the impact on revenue and earnings in the quarter was minimal. We had no product supply issues in the first quarter, and based on current conditions, do not expect any disruptions in our supply chain in the second quarter. We are actively working with our supply chain partners, and have a number of strategies in place to mitigate potential disruption in the second half of the year.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $211 million, which was about 8% lower than last year. EBIT margin was about 16%. EBIT margin was affected this quarter by of the costs associated with the Dallas fire and by our planned investment in Volly, our secure digital mail service.  Excluding these impacts, EBIT margin would have been 16.7%.
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives in our selling, general and administrative costs or SG&A. SG&A in the quarter declined by more than $13 million when compared with the prior year. And for the second consecutive quarter, SG&A improved year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, and declined 40 basis points this quarter to 32.5%. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen continue to improve. EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments for the quarter, including both our SMB business segments.
These improvements are a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments. We are reaping the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions that we have taken since the fourth quarter of 2009, and we continue to implement additional actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $280 million or $1.37 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $51 million, a modest increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year.  The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.81%, 53 basis points higher than the prior year due to changes in our debt portfolio mix. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 29.9%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was primarily the result of a tax benefit arising from a favorable conclusion of a non-U.S. tax examination. We continue to expect the average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 33% to 35%.  The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30.9%.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.53, which compares with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Our earnings per share of $0.53 this quarter was reduced by $0.04 per share as a result of more than $0.02 per share for estimated costs related to the Dallas fire and by more than $0.01 per share for our investment in Volly.
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included restructuring charges that totaled $0.08 per share in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.01 per share noncash tax charge or out-of-the money stock option that expired during the quarter, and a $0.01 per share loss from discontinued operations.  Free cash flow was $286 million for the quarter. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from lower tax payments, a tax refund and a reduction in our finance receivables, partly offset by higher capital expenditures as we invested in the business.
During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the fourth quarter by about $8 million to a balance of $42 million. About 86% of our total debt is fixed rate, and 14% is floating rate.
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the first quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the first quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $26 million were primarily for severance costs related to the elimination of about 800 positions across the company.  As noted, when we gave guidance last year, we're now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and we are on track to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits by 2011.
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per diluted share, GAAP earnings per diluted share and free cash flow. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth.  Our projected return to revenue growth for the year is due in part to the initiatives I outlined at the beginning of this call, all designed to drive new growth opportunities and to stabilize our base business.  In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.34 per share from operations growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.
As noted previously, we expect lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. This will result in comparative earnings for the year of $2.25 to $2.40 per share.  Additionally, we plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.15 to $2.35.
On a GAAP basis, we expect 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.80 to $2.10. This includes the expected impact of $0.25 to $0.35 per share for restructuring charges associated with Strategic Transformation. Guidance excludes any financial impact due to the fire at our presort facility as outlined in Mike's discussion.
We expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $750 million to $850 million. We anticipate lower free cash flow in 2011 as compared to the prior year because of increased investment in finance receivables during the year. Higher investment in finance receivables is expected in relation to higher levels of equipment sales and higher levels of capital expenditures associated with investments in business growth.
Conditions in the first quarter underscored our belief that the business and economic environment will be characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and geography. However, we remain focused on investing in solutions which enable businesses to manage both physical and digital communication channels with their customers, while continuing to streamline and enhance our operations and processes. 
 
I'd just like to make one correction. I said $0.32 to $0.34 in -- as far as our incremental growth, and that was actually $0.32 to $0.42 per share for operations growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.

As we look at the SMB market and how the customers prefer to be served, whether it is by direct sales or by inside sales, we determined at the beginning of the year to shift a fair number of accounts into inside account management rather than direct account management. This creates a short-term disruption as we shift the accounts and re-establish those connections. So that created a negative in January. We saw it start moving back in February and March, and this is what normally has happened as we have had these types of shifts in the past. So we expect an initial reduction and then the curve to come back. And we're pleased to see it returning back to where we expect it to be. This will give us the long-term benefits of how the coverage is delivered and how the customers are interacted with. And it'll also enable us to take our cloud-based solutions to that customer group in a much easier and cost-effective manner."

Secondly, we have the leading integrity products in the marketplace. That is moving forward. Also, we're seeing customers looking at how to do more transpromotional work in these areas. So particularly, when you look at financial services and insurance, they're the areas that have been accelerating back. Now that also coincides with the switch back to growth in total mail volume. So if you recall, in '09, mail was down 15%. It was down 9% last year. And in the last quarter, it was up 1.3%. So we're starting to see the follow-on benefits from that transition and the need for people to accelerate the quality of what they're delivering in mail. So that's sort of from the global hardware side. On the software side, the continuing expansion we have in data analytics and location intelligence is providing us with some very positive and unique offerings to customers that are very exciting for them. So they're adopting those. And then we have our multi-year contracts, which have been a negative for a couple of years, but now that stream revenue is coming in. And we're continuing to see the acceleration of those multi-year contracts. And then finally, as I had mentioned, we introduced the Portrait -- new Portrait Analytics software. The combination of the Portrait tools with our existing tools provided a much richer relationship in our customers.

Obviously, we have the payments from our transformation program, which we estimate to be about $100 million. We do plan some pension contributions this year for both our U.S. and international plans in the neighborhood of about $145 million.

It's now in the 50%, 60% range. So we expect to see that continue to ramp, which is both good for equipment sales, and then it is also good for long-term supply revenue. So we expect that shift to continue. And then, as we've mentioned, we've launched it in Canada, U.K. and Australia. We will be launching it in a number of other significant markets, particularly France and Germany, a little later this year as it's approved there. That will continue its positive global impact. At the same time, it is a web-based platform, and so we'll be able to continue to go back to that customer base, and expand the capabilities that are available on it with new software options that we have out there."

So we're not really finding any effect in the marketplace from price, I think, is what you're indirectly asking. So I think that price is holding.

But we have seen the Enterprise side of the business continue to remain strong in written business. It does vary globally as different markets, particularly in Europe, with the credit items that occur, it does have some varying effect. But in general, the Enterprise segment has continued to show positive signs. The SMB area is much slower. We aren't seeing the same type of positive reaction in the SMB space as far as opening up from a spending point of view. So that remains something that we have basically put into our plan, that it will remain sort of where it is. On the positive side, though, we do see markets like Asia as being very strong. And it is not that big a component of our business, but it is very positive and very helpful as we see the market growth and the expansion there.  I'd just like to go back to Chris's question that I left unanswered. On the installed base of meters, this is all meters globally. In the U.S., in last year, the meter population declined 7%. And as you look at it at this current quarter, it was down in the 6% range. So we're starting to see a decline in the U.S. Globally, it is positive in a number of countries, and generally less than 6%. So the U.S. is about just over half of the global market of installed base. So it would say the decline is moderating around the world, and it would be somewhere down in the under 6%. If I was to pull a guess, it would be in the 3% to 4% range. And then the other component of that is the majority of that reduction has been in the very low end of the meter line, which is the lowest revenue side of the product line. Now that's why, as you noticed, we introduced SmartPostage [pbSmartPostage]. SmartPostage goes directly into that low end both below our existing meters and up to the meter, and then adds a shipping component. So it is a complementary product we'll be adding to our existing meter customers and expanding. So we see that as an offset in the low end. Certainly, at the high end, the Connect+ product is gaining in placements in that space. So we're seeing the high end as more stable, and the low end, as we've had the economic issues around the world for Small Business, has been a negative. We see that decline slowing. And then the SmartPostage, our cloud-based offering, will actually begin to address that as we go through this year."

At the same time, we did bring in a president of that business, who comes from the digital marketplace, and he is also continuing to look at the offering as we are planning to launch it, and making any appropriate adjustments that would enhance it from a digital acceptance. So the traffic and volume around it, and people wanting to participate continues to grow from both a mailer and consumer side.

Our products, historically, have been involved in connecting our customers to their customers. We are taking that connection and expanding it with our Software tools, new Hardware tools and our cloud-based tools, to enhance that communication in both physical and digital form. So you'll see all of our offerings coming out based around Customer Communication Management, helping our customers more effectively communicate with their customers to enhance and build their relationships in both physical and digital form, and the ability to have that in multiple digital forms. So we're saying this is a broad-based communication tool. We're leveraging our expertise and capability across it. And as we go forward, we'll see much more -- you look at Connect+.  It starts with the ability to put promotions on the outside of the envelope. SmartPostage does the same. You have Smart Connections [pbSmart Connections], which brings Digital Communications in. You have Volly, which starts connecting physical and digital together and creating those communications. You have all of our software tools, which enhance those communications. And then, the addition of the analytics because you can do all those things and wonder whether it's succeeding or not, and that's where the whole data analytics comes in, which ties it back to, again, how do I communicate to my customers.

It is really a matter of how it's delivered in either physical or digital form. We're now launching into a hybrid mode, where we will help our customers deliver those messages in whichever form their customers choose to receive it.  And we believe the business model is such that we will be able to have the same or more from the digital than we had from the physical. So regardless of speed of transition, as we're now moving into the digital side of the communication, we believe that declines will be offset and taken up on the digital side. So it's hard to predict what that long-term mix shift is, but what we're doing is positioning the company so that we're attacking the total delivery channel and not just one side. And that will give us the ability to both offset any shifts and to create growth as we expand the offerings."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and Mike will follow with the details on our first quarter results, and then I'll discuss the rest of the year. Afterwards, we'll take your questions. 
During the quarter, we continued to gain momentum in our plans for long-term growth as we made progress against several initiatives that we discussed at year end.  For the third consecutive quarter, both Equipment Sales and Software revenues grew. The continued improvement in Equipment Sales was led by increasing demand from high-volume mailers to update their hardware and software production platforms.  Our growth in Software was fueled by global demand for Data Analytics and Location Intelligence Solutions. The increase in Software revenue was also supported by the growing recurring revenue stream related to the increasing number of multiyear licensing agreements.  While revenues for the quarter benefited from these increases in Equipment Sales and Software, it was offset by the expected lower recurring revenue streams related to our SMB Solutions Group. We have previously explained that lower SMB Equipment Sales in past years created a headwind that reduces our supplies, rentals and financing revenue streams. We anticipate that these headwinds will continue to diminish as equipment sales improve.
As expected, the declines in the SMB recurring revenue streams did moderate in this quarter. During the quarter, we continued to reap substantial benefits from our ongoing Strategic Transformation program. The program is delivering improvements in customer processes and infrastructure, cost savings, as well as an enhanced ability to deliver new products and services. The savings and the investments made possible by Strategic Transformation will enable us to continue to introduce a number of new Customer Communications Management solutions for SMB and enterprise customers this year.
Earlier in the quarter, we announced Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. We have continued to get positive feedback from all stakeholders, and make progress with partners. We introduced additional CCM [Customer Communications Management] solutions for enterprise customers, including the expansion of our Intellijet production print line and Portrait Miner 6.0 software for predicting customer behavior. We are providing SMB customers with the industry's only family of cloud-based solutions, including pbSmartPostage and PbSmart Connections, an email marketing and communications platform.  In addition, earlier this week, we announced SendSuite Live, a new web-based shipping platform that strengthens our market leadership in the transportation management services shipping marketplace. 
We also continued our progress in the stabilization of our base business in the quarter. Positive trends, including continued gains in customer retention and ongoing placements of new products such as our Connect+ web-based communications system.  Connect+ has already been launched in Canada, U.K. and Australia, and its global rollout will continue throughout 2011.
Overall, SMB equipment sales declined, however, in part, due to the phased movement of a select group of customers to alternate sales channels. These channels will best serve their needs as we continue to offer more products and services online.  Consistent with prior shifts, we saw improving sales productivity throughout the quarter. We expect our channel transition initiatives to drive longer-term growth through greater engagement of small business customers with our new web-enabled solutions. These moves are also helping to create a more efficient cost structure, as we align the value of the sales with the cost of the delivery channel. These are all important contributing factors to our projected stabilization in this business in 2011.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion from our first quarter financial results."
297018,129364226,120087,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of about 2% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year, and a decline of about 3%  when you exclude the impact of currency.  Breaking down our revenue for the quarter be",1245,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of about 2% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year, and a decline of about 3%  when you exclude the impact of currency.  Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 5%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 4% versus the prior year.  Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 1%.  Non-U.S. operations represented 32% of total revenue.
At this point, I'd like to note 2 unusual events that occurred this quarter. First, on February 7, there was a fire at our presort processing facility in Dallas, Texas. While all employees are safe, the site was completely destroyed, and we estimate lost revenue and EBIT of about $7 million each in the first quarter.  We expect continued adverse impacts to both revenue and EBIT in the second and third quarters until the new facility is fully operational. For the full year, we expect total revenue for the company to be impacted by about 0.5%.  It's expected that the earnings associated with the lost revenue and the costs related to outfitting a new facility will be fully covered by insurance proceeds in future periods. To date, we have received a $15 million advance from the insurance companies. However, the accounting rules are such that this advance and future insurance proceeds cannot be recognized in earnings until the final settlement of the insurance claim. If the insurance claim is not settled in the current year, we estimate 2011 adjusted earnings could be reduced by $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share.
The company's response to the fire was impressive on many levels. While the loss of the facility impacted our ability to qualify customers' mail at the highest level of discount, our national network enabled us to quickly reroute mail and convert other capacity to process first-class mail, and has resulted in retention of virtually all of our customers. The facility's permanent replacement is expected to be operational in the second quarter and at previous productivity levels by the end of the third quarter.  The rest of our network continues to process increasing volumes of both first-class and standard-class mail from new and existing customers. Excluding the impact of the Dallas fire, presort-related revenue for the quarter grew and the EBIT margin continued to improve. 
Second, of course, is the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Our condolences go out to all those who have been impacted.  With respect to our business, about 1% of our total revenue is from Japan, so the impact on revenue and earnings in the quarter was minimal. We had no product supply issues in the first quarter, and based on current conditions, do not expect any disruptions in our supply chain in the second quarter. We are actively working with our supply chain partners, and have a number of strategies in place to mitigate potential disruption in the second half of the year.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $211 million, which was about 8% lower than last year. EBIT margin was about 16%. EBIT margin was affected this quarter by of the costs associated with the Dallas fire and by our planned investment in Volly, our secure digital mail service.  Excluding these impacts, EBIT margin would have been 16.7%.
We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives in our selling, general and administrative costs or SG&A. SG&A in the quarter declined by more than $13 million when compared with the prior year. And for the second consecutive quarter, SG&A improved year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, and declined 40 basis points this quarter to 32.5%. SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen continue to improve. EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments for the quarter, including both our SMB business segments.
These improvements are a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments. We are reaping the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions that we have taken since the fourth quarter of 2009, and we continue to implement additional actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $280 million or $1.37 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $51 million, a modest increase of $2 million when compared with the prior year.  The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.81%, 53 basis points higher than the prior year due to changes in our debt portfolio mix. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 29.9%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was primarily the result of a tax benefit arising from a favorable conclusion of a non-U.S. tax examination. We continue to expect the average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 33% to 35%.  The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30.9%.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.53, which compares with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Our earnings per share of $0.53 this quarter was reduced by $0.04 per share as a result of more than $0.02 per share for estimated costs related to the Dallas fire and by more than $0.01 per share for our investment in Volly.
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included restructuring charges that totaled $0.08 per share in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.01 per share noncash tax charge or out-of-the money stock option that expired during the quarter, and a $0.01 per share loss from discontinued operations.  Free cash flow was $286 million for the quarter. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from lower tax payments, a tax refund and a reduction in our finance receivables, partly offset by higher capital expenditures as we invested in the business.
During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the fourth quarter by about $8 million to a balance of $42 million. About 86% of our total debt is fixed rate, and 14% is floating rate.
Let me now highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the first quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the first quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $26 million were primarily for severance costs related to the elimination of about 800 positions across the company.  As noted, when we gave guidance last year, we're now targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011, and we are on track to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits by 2011.
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per diluted share, GAAP earnings per diluted share and free cash flow. We expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to 3% growth.  Our projected return to revenue growth for the year is due in part to the initiatives I outlined at the beginning of this call, all designed to drive new growth opportunities and to stabilize our base business.  In 2011, we anticipate generating incremental earnings of $0.32 to $0.34 per share from operations growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.
As noted previously, we expect lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. This will result in comparative earnings for the year of $2.25 to $2.40 per share.  Additionally, we plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for Volly. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.15 to $2.35.
On a GAAP basis, we expect 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.80 to $2.10. This includes the expected impact of $0.25 to $0.35 per share for restructuring charges associated with Strategic Transformation. Guidance excludes any financial impact due to the fire at our presort facility as outlined in Mike's discussion.
We expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $750 million to $850 million. We anticipate lower free cash flow in 2011 as compared to the prior year because of increased investment in finance receivables during the year. Higher investment in finance receivables is expected in relation to higher levels of equipment sales and higher levels of capital expenditures associated with investments in business growth.
Conditions in the first quarter underscored our belief that the business and economic environment will be characterized by gradual improvement at varying rates by sector and geography. However, we remain focused on investing in solutions which enable businesses to manage both physical and digital communication channels with their customers, while continuing to streamline and enhance our operations and processes. 
 
I'd just like to make one correction. I said $0.32 to $0.34 in -- as far as our incremental growth, and that was actually $0.32 to $0.42 per share for operations growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues.
Thank you. And now, let's open the line for questions."

As we look at the SMB market and how the customers prefer to be served, whether it is by direct sales or by inside sales, we determined at the beginning of the year to shift a fair number of accounts into inside account management rather than direct account management. This creates a short-term disruption as we shift the accounts and re-establish those connections. So that created a negative in January. We saw it start moving back in February and March, and this is what normally has happened as we have had these types of shifts in the past. So we expect an initial reduction and then the curve to come back. And we're pleased to see it returning back to where we expect it to be. This will give us the long-term benefits of how the coverage is delivered and how the customers are interacted with. And it'll also enable us to take our cloud-based solutions to that customer group in a much easier and cost-effective manner."

Secondly, we have the leading integrity products in the marketplace. That is moving forward. Also, we're seeing customers looking at how to do more transpromotional work in these areas. So particularly, when you look at financial services and insurance, they're the areas that have been accelerating back. Now that also coincides with the switch back to growth in total mail volume. So if you recall, in '09, mail was down 15%. It was down 9% last year. And in the last quarter, it was up 1.3%. So we're starting to see the follow-on benefits from that transition and the need for people to accelerate the quality of what they're delivering in mail. So that's sort of from the global hardware side. On the software side, the continuing expansion we have in data analytics and location intelligence is providing us with some very positive and unique offerings to customers that are very exciting for them. So they're adopting those. And then we have our multi-year contracts, which have been a negative for a couple of years, but now that stream revenue is coming in. And we're continuing to see the acceleration of those multi-year contracts. And then finally, as I had mentioned, we introduced the Portrait -- new Portrait Analytics software. The combination of the Portrait tools with our existing tools provided a much richer relationship in our customers. So we're seeing that as a continuing positive trend as we offer a much broader range of services to our customers."

In terms of looking at Management Services, I think a good view into that would be an announcement we made just yesterday about a partnership with EMC, and utilizing their Captiva software for new solutions. Those are technology-based solutions that we believe have a greater margin potential than traditional labor-based services. So while our pipeline still includes some of our traditional products and services, we're looking at more technology-based services that tend to be more off-site than on-site. And so it's going to be a mix of those types of things, the traditional products, along with some of the new technologies and new partnerships that allow us a different margin profile in that business as we go forward. And that really applies around the whole CCM or Customer Communications Management strategy that we've laid out."

Is there anything else we should really focus on in terms of pressure on cash? And I guess you also talked about CapEx.

But we have seen the Enterprise side of the business continue to remain strong in written business. It does vary globally as different markets, particularly in Europe, with the credit items that occur, it does have some varying effect. But in general, the Enterprise segment has continued to show positive signs. The SMB area is much slower. We aren't seeing the same type of positive reaction in the SMB space as far as opening up from a spending point of view. So that remains something that we have basically put into our plan, that it will remain sort of where it is. On the positive side, though, we do see markets like Asia as being very strong. And it is not that big a component of our business, but it is very positive and very helpful as we see the market growth and the expansion there.  I'd just like to go back to Chris's question that I left unanswered. On the installed base of meters, this is all meters globally. In the U.S., in last year, the meter population declined 7%. And as you look at it at this current quarter, it was down in the 6% range. So we're starting to see a decline in the U.S. Globally, it is positive in a number of countries, and generally less than 6%. So the U.S. is about just over half of the global market of installed base. So it would say the decline is moderating around the world, and it would be somewhere down in the under 6%. If I was to pull a guess, it would be in the 3% to 4% range. And then the other component of that is the majority of that reduction has been in the very low end of the meter line, which is the lowest revenue side of the product line. Now that's why, as you noticed, we introduced SmartPostage [pbSmartPostage]. SmartPostage goes directly into that low end both below our existing meters and up to the meter, and then adds a shipping component. So it is a complementary product we'll be adding to our existing meter customers and expanding. So we see that as an offset in the low end. Certainly, at the high end, the Connect+ product is gaining in placements in that space. So we're seeing the high end as more stable, and the low end, as we've had the economic issues around the world for Small Business, has been a negative. We see that decline slowing. And then the SmartPostage, our cloud-based offering, will actually begin to address that as we go through this year."

So we're well along the path of partnerships with our installed customer base. We're continuing to develop those relationships and build the tools with them to create the ability to place the mail into Volly. We are still expecting to go to the consumer market sometime late in the third quarter. We will launch it earlier as an internal trial with PB employees, and then look to go to market in the third quarter. At the same time, we did bring in a president of that business, who comes from the digital marketplace, and he is also continuing to look at the offering as we are planning to launch it, and making any appropriate adjustments that would enhance it from a digital acceptance. So the traffic and volume around it, and people wanting to participate continues to grow from both a mailer and consumer side.

Our products, historically, have been involved in connecting our customers to their customers. We are taking that connection and expanding it with our Software tools, new Hardware tools and our cloud-based tools, to enhance that communication in both physical and digital form. So you'll see all of our offerings coming out based around Customer Communication Management, helping our customers more effectively communicate with their customers to enhance and build their relationships in both physical and digital form, and the ability to have that in multiple digital forms. So we're saying this is a broad-based communication tool. We're leveraging our expertise and capability across it. And as we go forward, we'll see much more -- you look at Connect+.  It starts with the ability to put promotions on the outside of the envelope. SmartPostage does the same. You have Smart Connections [pbSmart Connections], which brings Digital Communications in. You have Volly, which starts connecting physical and digital together and creating those communications. You have all of our software tools, which enhance those communications. And then, the addition of the analytics because you can do all those things and wonder whether it's succeeding or not, and that's where the whole data analytics comes in, which ties it back to, again, how do I communicate to my customers. So I think about it as every one of our customers is looking to retain their customer base, expand their offerings to their customer base, and find new customers.

So that'll give you a better view of all of the new goods and services.

It is really a matter of how it's delivered in either physical or digital form. We're now launching into a hybrid mode, where we will help our customers deliver those messages in whichever form their customers choose to receive it.  And we believe the business model is such that we will be able to have the same or more from the digital than we had from the physical. So regardless of speed of transition, as we're now moving into the digital side of the communication, we believe that declines will be offset and taken up on the digital side. So it's hard to predict what that long-term mix shift is, but what we're doing is positioning the company so that we're attacking the total delivery channel and not just one side. And that will give us the ability to both offset any shifts and to create growth as we expand the offerings."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and then Mike will follow with the details on our second quarter results, I'll then discuss our guidance for the full year. After that, we will take your questions. 
During the quarter, we continued to see the benefits of our ongoing actions to lay the foundation for long-term growth and profitability across our business portfolio. There were three positive trends that underscored our progress in executing our plans: First, there was continued growth in equipment and software sales. Equipment sales increases were lead by strong sales of our high speed inserting systems in North America and Asia, as well as good placements of our Connect+ in North America and the U.K. 
When we launched the innovative Connect+ system last year, we stated our expectation that it would be a key component in driving the future mailing equipment sales. Software growth continued to be fueled by strong demand worldwide for our customer communication and data management software solutions. 
Softwares recurring revenue stream also continue to grow this quarter as the number of multiyear licensing agreements increased. 
The second positive trend during the quarter was that the combined recurring SMB revenue streams of supplies, rental and financing declined at a lesser rate than both the prior quarter and the prior year. These declines should continue to moderate as SMB equipment sales improve. 
The third positive trend was our improvement in EBIT margin, particularly in our SMB and Software business. This was despite an unsettled global economic environment. We continue to focus on streamlining our operations and increasing the variability of our cost structure. 
Our disciplined approach is enabling us to enhance margins, even as we experienced revenue softness, particularly in our SMB markets. It is also helping us to better leverage a revenue growth as we saw in our Software business. 
It's also important to note that as expected, the quarter's revenue and earnings were reduced by the impact of the fire that destroyed our largest presort facility in the first quarter of this year. 
The lower mail services revenues associated with the fire at our Dallas presort facility reduced our second quarter revenue growth by approximately 1% and lowered our earnings per share by $0.03 per diluted share. The substantial savings made possible by strategic transformation have allowed us to make critical investments in new solutions and enhancements to our customers experience. 
During the quarter, we continue to invest in the development of the customer and communications, management market and introduced a number of new solutions. We've added pbSmartMarketer and pbSmartCodes to our family of pbSmart solutions, our cloud-based customer communication management solutions for Small and Medium Businesses. 
PbSmartMarketer is a cloud-based software solution that allows businesses to identify potential new customers modeled after their existing customer base. Create customized direct mail marketing campaigns and track and measure the success of those campaigns. 
PbSmartCodes is a cloud-based software solution that enables businesses to create interactive marketing campaigns using a unique quick response or QR code. 
Before I discuss our guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results."

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of about 1% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Revenue would have grown 2% if not -- if it were not for the adverse impact from the February fire at our presort",1092,"Thanks, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of about 1% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Revenue would have grown 2% if not -- if it were not for the adverse impact from the February fire at our presort facility in Dallas. 
Currency was a 3% benefit to revenue growth during the quarter. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-US operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 4%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 16% versus the prior-year. 
Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-US operations now represent 33% of our total revenue. While the Dallas fire impacted our first half revenue growth, less than 5 months after the fire, at the end of June, we opened a new facility. 
This new facility reestablishes our unique ability to achieve a high level of presort discounts naturally. We expect the new site to be operating at full efficiency during the third quarter. 
In the second quarter, revenue and EBIT were adversely impacted by about $9 million each, as a result of the facility disruption. 
As of today, we have received partial payments totaling approximately $25 million from our insurance carriers, of which $15 million was received prior to June 30th. 
We will not recognize the portion of current and future proceeds related to business interruption and other recoveries in earnings, until the allocation of these proceeds are resolve with the insurance company. If the insurance claim is not finalized in the current year, we estimate 2011 adjusted earnings could be reduced by about $0.68 per diluted share, of which $0.05 were already incurred in the first half of the year. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter was $213 million which was 5% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 16.2%, an improvement of 60 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin would have been even higher except for the Dallas fire impacts. 
Adjusting for the impact of the fire, EBIT margin would have been 16.7%. We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives across our cost structure. 
SG&A expense in the quarter increased about $10 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A actually declined by about $7 million when compared with the prior year. 
SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives but also from lower credit losses, which we have seen continue this quarter. EBIT margins in this quarter improve year-over-year in both in our SMB and Enterprise solutions groups. These improvement are primarily as a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses. 
We continue to reap the benefits of the strategic transformation, actions that we have taken since the fourth quarter of 2009. There were multiple initiatives including reinvestments in the business, we have significantly increased the variable portion of our cost space to allow us to leverage future revenue growth and quickly and cost-effectively respond to a changing business mix. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $281 million or $1.38 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of less than $2 million on lower debt levels when compared with the prior year. 
The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.68%, 29 basis points higher than the prior year, due to changes in our debt portfolio mix. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33% versus 31.5% last year. 
The tax rate for this quarter is in-line with our expectations. We expect the average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 32% to 34%, excluding the impact of a recent tax settlement with the IRS, which Murray will discuss as part of guidance. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.52, which compares with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 for the same period last year. 
Our adjusted EPS would have been $0.55 this quarter, except that we have incremental losses for about $0.03 per share this quarter related to the Dallas fire. 
Also, as we plan, we invested in Volly this quarter, which further reduced our adjusted earnings per share by about $0.01. 
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included restructuring charges and asset impairment that totaled $0.02 per share. GAAP EPS for the quarter also included a less than $0.01 cent per share reduction each for a tax charge associated without of the money stock options that expired during the quarter, and a loss from discontinued operations. 
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter increased 68% over prior year. Free cash flow was $269 million for the quarter. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the timing of tax payments and refunds and an improvement in working capital. 
During the quarter, we returned $85 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of Pitney Bowes common stock outstanding for $50 million. 
We have $100 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 6 to 12 months. Additionally, we made contributions to the U.S. Pension Fund of about $123 million. 
As of the end of the quarter, we had complete be paid down our commercial paper balances and we have no debt coming due until September of 2012. 
About 76% of our debt is now fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. Let me now update you on our strategic transformation program. 
In the second quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the second quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $5 million were primarily for severance-related costs. 
Approximately 3,400 positions have been eliminated since the beginning of the program. Due to the timing of implementation of different initiatives, the charges related to strategic transformation will vary from quarter-to-quarter, as we experienced this quarter. We still expect total charges for the year related to the strategic transformation program to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. 
We continue to target annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance."

However, we are modifying our revenue guidance for the year based on tw",564,"Thanks, Mike. Turning to our guidance foor the year. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per diluted share, our GAAP earnings per diluted share and our free cash flow guidance. 
However, we are modifying our revenue guidance for the year based on two factors: First, is the impact of the presort facility fire in Dallas; and second, is the overall economic outlook particularly, given what we have experienced in our SMB markets in the first half of the year. 
Economic growth is now weaker than we originally anticipated when we first provided guidance. As a result, we now expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of minus 2% to positive 1%. 
As previously noted, in 2011, we anticipated generating incremental revenues of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations, growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. 
We anticipate a lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. 
As a result, we expect comparative earnings for the year of $2.25 to $2.40 per share. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for mark Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. 
As a result of the improve margins, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to remain in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. We also continue to expect 2011 GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.80 to $2.10. 
This includes the expected impact of $0.25 to $0.35 per share for restructuring charges and asset impairments associated with strategic transformation. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes recoveries this year of a losses related to the Dallas fire. As part of negotiations to settle the company's 2001 to 2004 IRS examination, we agreed with the IRS on a tax treatment of a number of issues, as well as revised tax calculation. 
As a result, we anticipate paying nearly $400 million of tax and interest for the years 2001 to 2004 by releasing previously funded tax bonds and as a result, this payment will not impact our cash position. 
Additionally, we expect to reduce tax reserves in the third quarter by about $50 million with about $30 million recorded in discontinued operations. The impact of this agreement is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. 
We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $750 million to $850 million. 
In closing, let me update you on Volly. We are advancing our market development activities with large mailers and our on track for phase consumer of Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. In the last 90 days, we have trained more than 50 of our existing sales representatives to sell Volly in addition to their current product portfolio. 
We have signed agreements with multiple large third-party mailers, representing over 1,500 companies that send out billions of pieces of mail annually. 
We remain confident that the actions we are taking are moving us closer to our goals for the longer term growth and profitability of our business, despite current uncertain business conditions. 
We remain focused on maximizing our operating efficiency, enhancing the customer experience and investing in the growth of our business. Thank you. Now, let's take your questions."

The only thing that we change our guidance is the revenue growth outlook. That came down 2 percentage points. Because of the margin performance we've seen to date, we have capped our adjusted earnings per share guidance range the same. So we are pleased with the margin performance of the business to date. We think because of the fire, which has impacted us particularly in the first two quarter now that we have our new facility up and running, it should be much less of an impact in the third quarter and should be really a nonissue in the fourth quarter in terms of impact. But obviously, the first half impact is reflected in our overall revenue per claimant certainly, the broader economic outlook. So the key is the revenue guidance has come down a bit but the earnings guidance remains the same. As far as volleys concern, we remain, I think on track to be within the $0.05 to send ancestries on a full-year basis. Companies what it rounds obviously, the dollar can vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter based on the level of activity."

We had anticipated that it would recover and it has remained similar to last year than we had expected. So I think we are seeing that at a lower rate. The small businesses are not investing in new but the renewal continues to stay there. As to the enterprise space, you'll see in a result that both the Software and the Production Mail, which are the large ticket items continue to perform well and it's sort of broad-based. It's a little irregular from period to period as you look at different countries. But with the broad distribution, we see Europe will be good or certain countries in Europe then Canada, then Asia then the U.S. So we saw strong deliveries in the second quarter. But than we had strong written business in a number of the areas as well. So we are seeing not that big of variance in our large accounts. And I think, I would go back to -- as you recall, back in '08 and '09, there was a lot of things postponed and delayed and so the refreshes are continuing. When you get into the other areas of Enterprise, which are volume related, our services business, mail services continues to be strong. We see a little bit of a shift in volume related in the management services business around print volume, which is down period to period. But in general, I'd say we've been fairly well on target in the enterprise space and then as we sell through the first two quarters, a little lighter in the SMB.

Our traditional mail ink for postage meters, there's other third-party supplies that we provide and then the new was stream of supplies that we have are related to our intelligent printers. And as we begin to build that base of those printers, which are high-speed, high-volume, color inkjet printing engines that we partner with HP to market to high-volume mail producers. That will build a new revenue stream for us. So some of the moderation is the fact that we are seeing more stability in our traditional mail inks and then the growth in some of these other supply categories. The other thing I'd note about some of the other elements of recurring revenues. In terms of growth in our business overall, we saw the good growth in Canada from an equipment standpoint. We had positive growth in Europe from an equipment standpoint. And that's translated into improvement in our financing revenue as well. In fact in Europe, it was flat year-over-year. So we are seeing in a number of markets that the impact of sales improvements do end up filtering through the recurring revenues. So those are some of the key drivers."

So today, we would estimate about 10% it's digital, that we don't participate in and as we look forward over the next decade, we believe there will be some shift and what Volly does is it puts us in a position to capture that shift, as well as capture the shift from high-volume mail that we do not deliver today. So when you look at our Production Mail equipment, we have a global share of less than 50%. So that would provide as an opportunity to take all of that digital as well. So we also, when we look at the shift from physical to digital to Volly, we would not expect that people will go to 100% digital. So there's going to be a long tail on hybrid regardless of what the range of transition might be and people will continue to need to produce physical mail. Also, you have the standard mail side of the business, which does not substitute into digital. And it is continuing to show positive growth over an extended time period. So we see that sort of mail continuing to be there. And what this does is it really keeps us in more of the end to end process. So we really go from the origination of the mail and all of the software tools of there to the location of where it goes whether it's physical or digital, and then the demographic and psychographics around that for enhancing the value of that communication to help people deliver more value to their customers and to find new customers.

I think the best way to look at where you've seen the improvement is to look at our gross profit. We increased that year-over-year. In fact, our gross profit this year was the best second quarter gross profit since 2008. So what we've been able to do is really shift the mix of our revenue and yet, still maintain strong margins in the business. Within those margins, rather, the benefits of the transformation initiatives that we put underway, in terms of how we service our products, the cost of the product, a lot of that's our procurement activities are baked into that. And then there's obviously some benefits in our SG&A expenses as well. In terms of seeing reduced cost there on a constant currency basis, our at levels up and G&A expenses are coming down. Year-to-date, we've probably seen about $80 million of incremental benefits from transformation and roughly $200 million, I think at the end of last year. We talked $120 million of savings through the end of 2010 in the program. So roughly, about $200 million of benefits in the program. One of the things I do emphasize though is that those benefits are captured in the numbers but more importantly, we've created a more variable cost. Meaning, we've outsourced the number functions, we've used more SaS based solution as supposed to capitalizing a lot of big software or equipment. We've reduced the number of physical locations and those things allow us more flexibility as we go forward to continue to adjust cost without incurring severance on other things that might normally come with changing priorities in the business. So I think, we've created some additional flexibility from that standpoint."

One is the basic development of the product and the refinement of that and the market research around that to really understand consumer preferences, biller's needs and those types of things. And the second build out the infrastructure support and things needed for it. The second is to begin the selling process to engage mailers and then to onboard them with the technology to enable them to be able to deliver digitally into Volly. The variable cost, as we go forward in 2012, will really be around marketing expense. And that will be driven by how much we market directly versus market through participating dealers. Perhaps, as they encourage their customers to choose the way that they want to deliver or receive digitally. So we'll learn our way into that a little bit more as we engage with the mailers and understand their marketing plans and develop our own marketing plans and get to the consumer experience on that. So at this point, I think assuming the same as this year is probably a safe thing to do, obviously, we'll have better insight when we give 2012 guidance."

They were continued growth in equipment and Software sales, lead by a high-speed inserting and Connect+, the combined recurring SMB revenue stream of supplies, rentals and financing that declined at a lesser rate than both the prior quarter and prior-year, the improvement in EBIT margin particularly in SMB and our Software business, despite an unsettled economic environment. 
We also continued to reap the benefits, as Mike touched on, of our strategic transformation actions, which has significantly increased the variable portion of our cost structure and allowed us to reinvest in our business. During quarter, we also expanded our new cloud-based SMB products and there is more to come for both the SMB and Enterprise customers. Our progress with Volly continues to be on track for a phase consumer rollout. In the last 90 days, we trained 50 of our existing reps and we have currently signed agreements with large third-party mailers representing over 1,500 companies that send out billions of pieces of mail.

There were 3 positive trends that underscored our progress in executing our plans: First, there was continued growth in equipment and software sales. Equipment sales increases were lead by strong sales of our high-speed inserting systems in North America and Asia, as well as good placements of our Connect+ in North America and the U.K. 
When we launched the innovative Connect+ system last year, we stated our expectation that it would be a key component in driving the future mailing equipment sales. Software growth continued to be fueled by strong demand worldwide for our customer communication and data management software solutions. 
Softwares recurring revenue streams also continue to grow this quarter as the number of multiyear licensing agreements increased. 
The second positive trend during the quarter was that the combined recurring SMB revenue streams of supplies, rental and financing declined at a lesser rate than both the prior quarter and the prior year. These declines should continue to moderate as SMB equipment sales improve. 
The third positive trend was our improvement in EBIT margin, particularly in our SMB and Software business. This was despite an unsettled global economic environment. We continue to focus on streamlining our operations and increasing the variability of our cost structure. 
Our disciplined approach is enabling us to enhance margins, even as we experience revenue softness, particularly in our SMB markets. It is also helping us to better leverage revenue growth as we saw in our Software business. 
It's also important to note that as expected, the quarter's revenue and earnings were reduced by the impact of the fire that destroyed our largest presort facility in the first quarter of this year. 
The lower mail services revenues associated with the fire at our Dallas presort facility reduced our second quarter revenue growth by approximately 1% and lowered our earnings per share by $0.03 per diluted share. The substantial savings made possible by strategic transformation have allowed us to make critical investments in new solutions and enhancements to our customers' experience. 
During the quarter, we continue to invest in the development of the customer communications, management market and introduced a number of new solutions. We've added pbSmartMarketer and pbSmartCodes to our family of pbSmart solutions, our cloud-based customer communications management solutions for small and medium Businesses. 
PbSmartMarketer is a cloud-based software solution that allows businesses to identify potential new customers modeled after their existing customer base, create customized direct mail marketing campaigns and track and measure the success of those campaigns. 
PbSmartCodes is a cloud-based software solution that enables businesses to create interactive marketing campaigns using a unique quick response or QR code. 
Before I discuss our guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results."

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of about 1% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Revenue would have grown 2% if not -- if it were not for the adverse impact from the February fire at our presort",1092,"Thanks, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of about 1% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Revenue would have grown 2% if not -- if it were not for the adverse impact from the February fire at our presort facility in Dallas. 
Currency was a 3% benefit to revenue growth during the quarter. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 4%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis, increased 16% versus the prior-year. 
Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations now represent 33% of our total revenue. While the Dallas fire impacted our first half revenue growth, less than 5 months after the fire, at the end of June, we opened a new facility. 
This new facility reestablishes our unique ability to achieve a high level of presort discounts naturally. We expect the new site to be operating at full efficiency during the third quarter. 
In the second quarter, revenue and EBIT were adversely impacted by about $9 million each, as a result of the facility disruption. 
As of today, we have received partial payments totaling approximately $25 million from our insurance carriers, of which $15 million was received prior to June 30th. 
We will not recognize the portion of current and future proceeds related to business interruption and other recoveries in earnings, until the allocation of these proceeds are resolve with the insurance company. If the insurance claim is not finalized in the current year, we estimate 2011 adjusted earnings could be reduced by about $0.68 per diluted share, of which $0.05 was already incurred in the first half of the year. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter was $213 million which was 5% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 16.2%, an improvement of 60 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin would have been even higher except for the Dallas fire impacts. 
Adjusting for the impact of the fire, EBIT margin would have been 16.7%. We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives across our cost structure. 
SG&A expense in the quarter increased about $10 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A actually declined by about $7 million when compared with the prior year. 
SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives but also from lower credit losses, which we had seen continue this quarter. EBIT margins in this quarter improved year-over-year in both in our SMB and Enterprise solutions groups. These improvements are primarily as a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses. 
We continue to reap the benefits of the strategic transformation, actions that we have taken since the fourth quarter of 2009. There were multiple initiatives including reinvestments in the business, we had significantly increased the variable portion of our cost space to allow us to leverage future revenue growth and quickly and cost-effectively respond to a changing business mix. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $281 million or $1.38 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of less than $2 million on lower debt levels when compared with the prior year. 
The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.68%, 29 basis points higher than the prior year, due to changes in our debt portfolio mix. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33% versus 31.5% last year. 
The tax rate for this quarter is in-line with our expectations. We expect the average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 32% to 34%, excluding the impact of a recent tax settlement with the IRS, which Murray will discuss as part of guidance. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.52, which compares with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 for the same period last year. 
Our adjusted EPS would have been $0.55 this quarter, except we had incremental losses of about $0.03 per share this quarter related to the Dallas fire. 
Also, as we plan, we invested in Volly this quarter, which further reduced our adjusted earnings per share by about $0.01. 
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.02 per share. GAAP EPS for the quarter also included a less than $0.01 per share reduction for each -- reduction each for a tax charge associated with out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the quarter, and a loss from discontinued operations. 
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter increased 68% over prior year. Free cash flow was $269 million for the quarter. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the timing of tax payments and refunds and an improvement in working capital. 
During the quarter, we returned $85 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of Pitney Bowes' common stock outstanding for $50 million. 
We have $100 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 6 to 12 months. Additionally, we made contributions to the U.S. pension fund of about $123 million. 
As of the end of the quarter, we had completely paid down our commercial paper balances and we have no debt coming due until September of 2012. 
About 76% of our debt is now fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. Let me now update you on our strategic transformation program. 
In the second quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the second quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $5 million were primarily for severance-related costs. 
Approximately 3,400 positions have been eliminated since the beginning of the program. Due to the timing of the implementation of different initiatives, the charges related to strategic transformation will vary from quarter-to-quarter, as we experienced this quarter. We still expect total charges for the year related to the strategic transformation program to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. 
We continue to target annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

Turning to our guidance for the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per diluted share, our GAAP earnings per diluted share and our free cash flow guidance. However, we are modifying our revenue guidance for the year based on 2 f",565,"Thanks, Mike. Turning to our guidance for the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per diluted share, our GAAP earnings per diluted share and our free cash flow guidance. 
However, we are modifying our revenue guidance for the year based on 2 factors: First, is the impact of the presort facility fire in Dallas; and second, is the overall economic outlook particularly, given what we have experienced in our SMB markets in the first half of the year. 
Economic growth is now weaker than we originally anticipated when we first provided guidance. As a result, we now expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of minus 2% to positive 1%. 
As previously noted, in 2011, we anticipated generating incremental revenues of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations, growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. 
We anticipate a lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. 
As a result, we expect comparative earnings for the year of $2.25 to $2.40 per share. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for mark -- Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. 
As a result of the improve margins, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to remain in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. We also continue to expect 2011 GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.80 to $2.10. 
This includes the expected impact of $0.25 to $0.35 per share for restructuring charges and asset impairments associated with strategic transformation. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes recoveries this year of losses related to the Dallas fire. As part of negotiations to settle the company's 2001 to 2004 IRS examination, we agreed with the IRS on the tax treatment of a number of issues, as well as revised tax calculation. 
As a result, we anticipate paying nearly $400 million of tax and interest for the years 2001 to 2004 by releasing previously funded tax bonds and as a result, this payment will not impact our cash position. 
Additionally, we expect to reduce tax reserves in the third quarter by about $50 million with about $30 million recorded in discontinued operations. The impact of this agreement is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. 
We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $750 million to $850 million. 
In closing, let me update you on Volly. We are advancing our market development activities with large mailers and are on track for phased consumer rollout of Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. In the last 90 days, we have trained more than 50 of our existing sales representatives to sell Volly in addition to their current product portfolio. 
We have signed agreements with multiple large third-party mailers, representing over 1,500 companies that send out billions of pieces of mail annually. 
We remain confident that the actions we are taking are moving us closer to our goals for the longer term growth and profitability of our business, despite current uncertain business conditions. 
We remain focused on maximizing our operating efficiency, enhancing the customer experience and investing in the growth of our business. Thank you. Now let's take your questions."

The only thing that we changed our guidance is the revenue growth outlook, and that came down 2 percentage points. Because of the margin performance we've seen to date, we have capped our adjusted earnings per share guidance range the same. So we are pleased with the margin performance of the business to date. We think because of the fire, which has impacted us particularly in the first 2 quarters. Now that we have our new facility up and running, it should be a much less of an impact in the third quarter and should be really a nonissue in the fourth quarter in terms of impact. But obviously, the first half impact is reflected in our overall revenue and then certainly, the broader economic outlook. So the key is the revenue guidance has come down a bit but the earnings guidance remains the same. As far as Volley is concerned, we remain, I think on track to be within the $0.05 to $0.10 range on a full year basis. The penny is what it rounds to obviously, the dollars can vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter based on the level of activity."

We had anticipated that it would recover and it has remained more similar to last year than we had expected. So I think we're seeing that as -- at a lower rate. The small businesses are not investing in new but the renewal continues to stay there. As to the enterprise space, you'll see in our results that both Software and the Production Mail, which are the large ticket items, continue to perform well and it's sort of broad-based. It's a little irregular from period to period as you look at different countries. But with the broad distribution we see, Europe will be hit good or certain countries in Europe, then Canada, then Asia then the U.S. So we saw strong deliveries in the second quarter. But than, we had strong written business in a number of the areas as well. So we are seeing not that big of variance in our large accounts. And I think, I would go back to, as you recall, back in '08 and '09, was there was a lot of things postponed and delayed and so the refreshes are continuing. When you get into the other areas of Enterprise, which are volume related, our services business, mail services continues to be strong. We see a little bit of a shift in volume related in the management services business around print volume, which is down period to period. But in general, I'd say we've been fairly well on target in the enterprise space and then as we saw through the first 2 quarters, a little lighter in the SMB. And I wouldn't say any dramatic change that we've seen in that space. It's been pretty stable."

And also, if there are smaller sites that open to services, post offices, it would open the potential for meter activity as well. So we don't see it as a negative but we see more opportunity there than there would be in the current form."

Our traditional mail ink for postage meters, there's other third-party supplies that we provide and then the newest stream of supplies that we have are related to our intelligent printers. And as we begin to build the base of those printers, which are high-speed, high-volume, color inkjet printing engines that we partner with HP to market to high-volume mail producers. That will build a new revenue stream for us. So some of the moderation is the fact that we're seeing more stability in our traditional mail inks and then the growth in some of these other supply categories. The other thing I'd note about some of the other elements of recurring revenues. In terms of growth in our businesses overall, we saw good growth in Canada from an equipment standpoint. We had positive growth in Europe from an equipment standpoint. And that's translated into improvement in our financing revenue as well. In fact in Europe, it was flat year-over-year. So we are seeing in a number of markets that the impact of sales improvements do end up filtering through to the recurring revenues. So those are some of the key drivers."

So today, there -- we would estimate about 10% it's digital, that we don't participate in and as we look forward over the next decade, we believe there will be some shift and what Volly does is it puts us in a position to capture that shift, as well as capture the shift from high-volume mail that we do not deliver today. So when you look at our Production Mail equipment, we have a global share of less than 50%. So that would provide us an opportunity to take all of that digital as well. So we also, when we look at the shift from physical to digital to Volly, we would not expect that people will go to 100% digital. So there's going to be a long tail on hybrid regardless of what the range of transition might be and people will continue to need to produce physical mail. Also, you have the standard mail side of the business, which does not substitute into digital. And it is continuing to show positive growth over an extended time period. So we see that sort of mail continuing to be there. And what this does is it really keeps us in more of the end-to-end process. So we really go from the origination of the mail and all of the software tools there to the location of where it goes whether it's physical or digital, and then the demographic and psychographics around that for enhancing the value of that communication to help people deliver more value to their customers and to find new customers.

I think the best way to look at where you've seen the improvement is to look at our gross profit. We increased that year-over-year. In fact, our gross profit this year was the best second quarter gross profit since 2008. So what we've been able to do is really shift the mix of our revenue and yet, still maintain strong margins in the business. Within those margins are reflected some of the benefits of the transformation initiatives that we put underway, in terms of how we service our product, the cost of the product. A lot of our procurement activities are baked into that. And then there's obviously some benefits in our SG&A expenses as well. In terms of seeing reduced cost there on a constant-currency basis, our absolute levels of SG&A expenses are coming down. Year-to-date, we've probably seen about $80 million of incremental benefits from transformation and roughly $200 million, I think at the end of last year. We talked $120 million of savings through the end of 2010 in the program. So roughly, about $200 million of benefits in the program. One of the things I'd emphasize though is that those benefits are captured in the numbers but more importantly, we've created more variable cost. Meaning, we've outsourced the number of functions, we've used more SaaS-based solutions as supposed to capitalizing a lot of big software or equipment. We've reduced the number of physical locations and those things allow us more flexibility as we go forward to continue to adjust cost without incurring severance on other things that might normally come with changing priorities in the business. So I think, we've created some additional flexibility from that standpoint."

The investments that we're making in Volly this year are really driven by 2 things that Murray touched on earlier. One is then the basic development of the product and the refinement of that and the market research around that to really understand consumer preferences, biller's needs and those types of things. And the second -- and build the -- build out the infrastructure support and things needed for it. The second is to begin the selling process to engage mailers and then to onboard them with the technology to enable them to be able to deliver digitally into Volly. The variable cost, as we go forward in 2012, will really be around marketing expense. And that will be driven by how much we market directly versus market through participating billers. Perhaps, as they encourage their customers to choose the way that they want to deliver or receive digitally. So we'll learn our way into that a little bit more as we engage with the mailers and understand their marketing plans and develop our own marketing plans and get to the consumer experience on that. So at this point, I think assuming the same as this year is probably a safe thing to do. Obviously, we'll have better insight when we give 2012 guidance."

I'd just like to, in conclusion, summarize a number of things that we've covered. First, there are 3 positive trends that we saw during the quarter that underscored our progress in laying the foundation for long-term growth and profitability. They were: continued growth in equipment and Software sales led by high-speed inserting and Connect+; the combined recurring SMB revenue stream of supplies, rentals and financing that declined at a lesser rate than both the prior quarter and prior-year; the improvement in EBIT margin particularly in SMB and our Software business, despite the unsettled economic environment. 
We also continued to reap the benefits, as Mike touched on, of our strategic transformation actions, which has significantly increased the variable portion of our cost structure and allowed us to reinvest in our business. During quarter, we also expanded our new cloud-based SMB products and there is more to come for both the SMB and Enterprise customers. Our progress with Volly continues to be on track for a phased consumer rollout. In the last 90 days, we trained 50 of our existing reps and we have currently signed agreements with large third-party mailers, representing over 1,500 companies that send out billions of pieces of mail.

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and then Mike will follow with the details on our second quarter results, I'll then discuss our guidance for the full year. After that, we will take your questions. 
During the quarter, we continued to see the benefits of our ongoing actions to lay the foundation for long-term growth and profitability across our business portfolio. There were 3 positive trends that underscored our progress in executing our plans: First, there was continued growth in equipment and software sales. Equipment sales increases were lead by strong sales of our high-speed inserting systems in North America and Asia, as well as good placements of our Connect+ in North America and the U.K. 
When we launched the innovative Connect+ system last year, we stated our expectation that it would be a key component in driving the future mailing equipment sales. Software growth continued to be fueled by strong demand worldwide for our customer communication and data management software solutions. 
Software’s recurring revenue streams also continue to grow this quarter as the number of multiyear licensing agreements increased. 
The second positive trend during the quarter was that the combined recurring SMB revenue streams of supplies, rental and financing declined at a lesser rate than both the prior quarter and the prior year. These declines should continue to moderate as SMB equipment sales improve. 
The third positive trend was our improvement in EBIT margin, particularly in our SMB and Software businesses. This was despite an unsettled global economic environment. We continue to focus on streamlining our operations and increasing the variability of our cost structure. 
Our disciplined approach is enabling us to enhance margins, even as we experience revenue softness, particularly in our SMB markets. It is also helping us to better leverage revenue growth as we saw in our Software business. 
It's also important to note that as expected, the quarter's revenue and earnings were reduced by the impact of the fire that destroyed our largest presort facility in the first quarter of this year. 
The lower mail services revenues associated with the fire at our Dallas presort facility reduced our second quarter revenue growth by approximately 1% and lowered our earnings per share by $0.03 per diluted share. The substantial savings made possible by strategic transformation have allowed us to make critical investments in new solutions and enhancements to our customers' experience. 
During the quarter, we continued to invest in the development of the customer communications, management market and introduced a number of new solutions. We've added pbSmartMarketer and pbSmartCodes to our family of pbSmart solutions, our cloud-based customer communications management solutions for small and medium Businesses. 
PbSmartMarketer is a cloud-based software solution that allows businesses to identify potential new customers modeled after their existing customer base, create customized direct mail marketing campaigns and track and measure the success of those campaigns. 
PbSmartCodes is a cloud-based software solution that enables businesses to create interactive marketing campaigns using a unique quick response or QR code. 
Before I discuss our guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results."

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of about 1% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Revenue would have grown 2% if not -- if it were not for the adverse impact from the February fire at our presort",1093,"Thanks, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of about 1% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Revenue would have grown 2% if not -- if it were not for the adverse impact from the February fire at our presort facility in Dallas. 
Currency was a 3% benefit to revenue growth during the quarter. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 4%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis, increased 16% versus the prior-year. 
Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 4%. Non-U.S. operations now represent 33% of our total revenue. While the Dallas fire impacted our first half revenue growth, less than 5 months after the fire, at the end of June, we opened a new facility. 
This new facility reestablishes our unique ability to achieve a high level of presort discounts naturally. We expect the new site to be operating at full efficiency during the third quarter. 
In the second quarter, revenue and EBIT were adversely impacted by about $9 million each, as a result of the facility disruption. 
As of today, we have received partial payments totaling approximately $25 million from our insurance carriers, of which $15 million was received prior to June 30th. 
We will not recognize the portion of current and future proceeds related to business interruption and other recoveries in earnings, until the allocations of these proceeds are resolve with the insurance company. If the insurance claim is not finalized in the current year, we estimate 2011 adjusted earnings could be reduced by about $0.06 to $0.08 per diluted share, of which $0.05 was already incurred in the first half of the year. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter was $213 million which was 5% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 16.2%, an improvement of 60 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin would have been even higher except for the Dallas fire impacts. 
Adjusting for the impact of the fire, EBIT margin would have been 16.7%. We continue to see the benefits of our productivity initiatives across our cost structure. 
SG&A expense in the quarter increased about $10 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A actually declined by about $7 million when compared with the prior year. 
SG&A benefited not only from our ongoing productivity initiatives but also from lower credit losses, which we had seen continue this quarter. EBIT margins in this quarter improved year-over-year in both in our SMB and Enterprise solutions groups. These improvements are primarily a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses. 
We continue to reap the benefits of the strategic transformation, actions that we have taken since the fourth quarter of 2009. Through multiple initiatives including reinvestments in the business, we had significantly increased the variable portion of our cost space to allow us to leverage future revenue growth and quickly and cost-effectively respond to a changing business mix. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $281 million or $1.38 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of less than $2 million on lower debt levels when compared with the prior year. 
The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.68%, 29 basis points higher than the prior year, due to changes in our debt portfolio mix. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33% versus 31.5% last year. 
The tax rate for this quarter is in-line with our expectations. We expect the average tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 32% to 34%, excluding the impact of a recent tax settlement with the IRS, which Murray will discuss as part of guidance. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.52, which compares with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 for the same period last year. 
Our adjusted EPS would have been $0.55 this quarter, except we had incremental losses of about $0.03 per share this quarter related to the Dallas fire. 
Also, as we planned, we invested in Volly this quarter, which further reduced our adjusted earnings per share by about $0.01. 
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.02 per share. GAAP EPS for the quarter also included a less than $0.01 per share reduction for each -- reduction each for a tax charge associated with out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the quarter, and a loss from discontinued operations. 
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter increased 68% over the prior year. Free cash flow was $269 million for the quarter. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the timing of tax payments and refunds and an improvement in working capital. 
During the quarter, we returned $85 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of Pitney Bowes' common stock outstanding for $50 million. 
We have $100 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 6 to 12 months. Additionally, we made contributions to the U.S. pension fund of about $123 million. 
As of the end of the quarter, we had completely paid down our commercial paper balances and we have no debt coming due until September of 2012. 
About 76% of our debt is now fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. Let me now update you on our strategic transformation program. 
In the second quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the second quarter, our pretax restructuring charges of $5 million were primarily for severance-related costs. 
Approximately 3,400 positions have been eliminated since the beginning of the program. Due to the timing of the implementation of different initiatives, the charges related to strategic transformation will vary from quarter-to-quarter, as we experienced this quarter. We still expect total charges for the year related to the strategic transformation program to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. 
We continue to target annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

Turning to our guidance for the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per diluted share, our GAAP earnings per diluted share and our free cash flow guidance. However, we are modifying our revenue guidance for the year based on 2 f",565,"Thanks, Mike. Turning to our guidance for the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per diluted share, our GAAP earnings per diluted share and our free cash flow guidance. 
However, we are modifying our revenue guidance for the year based on 2 factors: First, is the impact of the presort facility fire in Dallas; and second, is the overall economic outlook particularly, given what we have experienced in our SMB markets in the first half of the year. 
Economic growth is now weaker than we originally anticipated when we first provided guidance. As a result, we now expect 2011 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of minus 2% to positive 1%. 
As previously noted, in 2011, we anticipated generating incremental revenues of $0.32 to $0.42 per share from operations, growth and productivity, excluding the impact of SMB stream revenues. 
We anticipate a lower SMB stream revenues as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods to negatively impact earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. 
As a result, we expect comparative earnings for the year of $2.25 to $2.40 per share. We also plan to invest $0.05 to $0.10 per share to develop the market for mark -- Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. 
As a result of the improve margins, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to remain in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. We also continue to expect 2011 GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.80 to $2.10. 
This includes the expected impact of $0.25 to $0.35 per share for restructuring charges and asset impairments associated with strategic transformation. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes recoveries this year of losses related to the Dallas fire. As part of negotiations to settle the company's 2001 to 2004 IRS examination, we agreed with the IRS on the tax treatment of a number of issues, as well as revised tax calculation. 
As a result, we anticipate paying nearly $400 million of tax and interest for the years 2001 to 2004 by releasing previously funded tax bonds and as a result, this payment will not impact our cash position. 
Additionally, we expect to reduce tax reserves in the third quarter by about $50 million with about $30 million recorded in discontinued operations. The impact of this agreement is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. 
We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $750 million to $850 million. 
In closing, let me update you on Volly. We are advancing our market development activities with large mailers and are on track for phased consumer rollout of Volly, our secure digital mail delivery system. In the last 90 days, we have trained more than 50 of our existing sales representatives to sell Volly in addition to their current product portfolio. 
We have signed agreements with multiple large third-party mailers, representing over 1,500 companies that send out billions of pieces of mail annually. 
We remain confident that the actions we are taking are moving us closer to our goals for the longer term growth and profitability of our business, despite current uncertain business conditions. 
We remain focused on maximizing our operating efficiency, enhancing the customer experience and investing in the growth of our business. Thank you. Now let's take your questions."

I guess, the first is can you just sort of walk us a little bit through the, I guess, through the pieces of the guidance?

And to what extent might sort of Volly be tracking a little bit, I guess, less of the headwind than you expected.

The only thing that we changed our guidance is the revenue growth outlook, and that came down 2 percentage points. Because of the margin performance we've seen to date, we have kept our adjusted earnings per share guidance range the same. So we are pleased with the margin performance of the business to date. We think because of the fire, which has impacted us particularly in the first 2 quarters. Now that we have our new facility up and running, it should be a much less of an impact in the third quarter and should be really a nonissue in the fourth quarter in terms of impact. But obviously, the first half impact is reflected in our overall revenue and then certainly, the broader economic outlook. So the key is the revenue guidance has come down a bit but the earnings guidance remains the same. As far as Volley is concerned, we remain, I think on track to be within the $0.05 to $0.10 range on a full year basis. The penny is what it rounds to obviously, the dollars can vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter based on the level of activity."

What we -- we've seen the SMB market to be fairly steady at a lower level than what we had expected. So it hasn't really swung a lot. We had anticipated that it would recover and it has remained more similar to last year than we had expected. So I think we're seeing that as -- at a lower rate, the smaller businesses are not investing in new but the renewal continues to stay there. As to the enterprise space, you'll see in our results that both Software and the Production Mail, which are the large ticket items, continue to perform well and it's sort of broad-based. It's a little irregular from period to period as you look at different countries. But with the broad distribution we see, Europe will be hit good or certain countries in Europe, then Canada, then Asia then the U.S. So we saw strong deliveries in the second quarter. But then, we had strong written business in a number of the areas as well. So we are seeing not that big a variance in our large accounts. And I think, I would go back to, as you recall, back in '08 and '09, was there was a lot of things postponed and delayed and so the refreshes are continuing. When you get into the other areas of Enterprise, which are volume related, our services business, mail services continues to be strong. We see a little bit of a shift in volume related in the management services business around print volume, which is down period to period. But in general, I'd say we've been fairly well on target in the enterprise space and then as we saw through the first 2 quarters, a little lighter in the SMB. And I wouldn't say any dramatic change that we've seen in that space. It's been pretty stable."

I think the good news is going forward in 2012, as we see some of those programs come to conclusion, that usage going forward should be somewhat less. As we get into 2012, we'll look at our refinancing or pay-down options, related to the debt that's maturing in 12."

Secondly, when it comes to these very small post offices, it really has no effect to our basic delivery of mail. The people there still get there delivery, it's strictly an access site. And what they're actually doing is providing alternate access. So when they close a physical facility, they actually, in many cases, are providing more access points around of that facility than there was in the post office. That actually, as you rightly alluded, could provide us with opportunities when it comes to self-service, since we do supply kiosks. And also, if there are smaller sites that open to services, post offices, it would open the potential for meter activity as well. So we don't see it as a negative but we see more opportunity there than there would be in the current form."

And as we begin to build the base of those printers, which are high-speed, high-volume, color inkjet printing engines that we partner with HP to market to high-volume mail producers. That will build a new revenue stream for us. So some of the moderation is the fact that we're seeing more stability in our traditional mail inks and then the growth in some of these other supply categories. The other thing I'd note about some of the other elements of recurring revenues. In terms of growth in our businesses overall, we saw good growth in Canada from an equipment standpoint. We had positive growth in Europe from an equipment standpoint. And that's translated into improvement in our financing revenue as well. In fact in Europe, it was flat year-over-year. So we are seeing in a number of markets that the impact of sales improvements do end up filtering through to the recurring revenues. So those are some of the key drivers."

So when you look at our Production Mail equipment, we have a global share of less than 50%. So that would provide us an opportunity to take all of that digital as well. So we also, when we look at the shift from physical to digital to Volly, we would not expect that people will go to 100% digital. So there's going to be a long tail on hybrid regardless of what the range of transition might be and people will continue to need to produce physical mail. Also, you have the standard mail side of the business, which does not substitute into digital. And it is continuing to show positive growth over an extended time period. So we see that sort of mail continuing to be there. And what this does is it really keeps us in more of the end-to-end process. So we really go from the origination of the mail and all of the software tools there to the location of where it goes whether it's physical or digital, and then the demographic and psychographics around that for enhancing the value of that communication to help people deliver more value to their customers and to find new customers.

I think the best way to look at where you've seen the improvement is to look at our gross profit. We increased that year-over-year. In fact, our gross profit this year was the best second quarter gross profit since 2008. So what we've been able to do is really shift the mix of our revenue and yet, still maintain strong margins in the business. Within those margins are reflected some of the benefits of the transformation initiatives that we put underway, in terms of how we service our product, the cost of the product. A lot of our procurement activities are baked into that. And then there's obviously some benefits in our SG&A expenses as well. In terms of seeing reduced cost there on a constant-currency basis, our absolute levels of SG&A expenses are coming down. Year-to-date, we've probably seen about $80 million of incremental benefits from transformation and roughly $200 million, I think at the end of last year. We talked $120 million of savings through the end of 2010 in the program. So roughly, about $200 million of benefits in the program. One of the things I'd emphasize though is that those benefits are captured in the numbers but more importantly, we've created more variable cost. Meaning, we've outsourced the number of functions, we've used more SaaS-based solutions as supposed to capitalizing a lot of big software or equipment. We've reduced the number of physical locations and those things allow us more flexibility as we go forward to continue to adjust cost without incurring severance and other things that might normally come with changing priorities in the business. So I think, we've created some additional flexibility from that standpoint."

The investments that we're making in Volly this year are really driven by 2 things that Murray touched on earlier. One is then the basic development of the product and the refinement of that and the market research around that to really understand consumer preferences, biller's needs and those types of things. And the second -- and build the -- build out the infrastructure support and things needed for it. The second is to begin the selling process to engage mailers and then to onboard them with the technology to enable them to be able to deliver digitally into Volly. The variable cost, as we go forward in 2012, will really be around marketing expense. And that will be driven by how much we market directly versus market through participating billers. Perhaps, as they encourage their customers to choose the way that they want to deliver or receive digitally. So we'll learn our way into that a little bit more as we engage with the mailers and understand their marketing plans and develop our own marketing plans and get to the consumer experience on that.

We also continued to reap the benefits, as Mike touched on, of our strategic transformation actions, which has significantly increased the variable portion of our cost structure and allowed us to reinvest in our business. During the quarter, we also expanded our new cloud-based SMB products and there is more to come for both the SMB and Enterprise customers. Our progress with Volly continues to be on track for a phased consumer rollout. In the last 90 days, we trained 50 of our existing reps and we have currently signed agreements with large third-party mailers, representing over 1,500 companies that send out billions of pieces of mail. So we see that as on track and we look forward to the coming year as we look to where Volly could go as it rolls forward. Thank you."

Afterwards, we will take your questions.
Our performances this quarter reflects both the adverse impact of sustained economic uncertainty on most of our global customer base, as well as the positive effect of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. We experienced revenue weakness throughout much of our business as the global economic environment affected buying confidence and delayed some capital and lease commitments.
The notable exception was our Software business, which experienced a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter. This growth was fueled by strong demand for our Software solutions particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We are pleased that the ongoing execution of our Strategic Transformation initiatives enabled us to improve the profitability in the third quarter despite the revenue challenges.
During the quarter, EBIT and EBIT margin grew in International Mailing, Software and Mail Services, and the EBIT margin also improved in North America Mailing. Excluding the impact of the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter, presort network efficiency gains drove ongoing improvement in EBIT and Mail Services.
The net insurance recoveries during the quarter neutralized the losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year related to the Dallas fire. Before I turn it over to Mike to discuss the quarter, let me address some of the conflicting public perceptions and media reports about the mailing industry.
This past year, the U.S. Postal Service delivered nearly 170 billion pieces of mail and helped sustain a $1 trillion mailing industry, which underscored the vital role it plays in the economy and in our society. It is important to remember that the number of messages exchanged between individuals, households and the businesses is not declining. It is simply a matter of whether the messages are delivered by physical or digital channels. Customers want the flexibility of options and channel preference varies with time, location and context.
That is why we've taken a number of actions to position ourselves to leverage the growth opportunities in the total delivery channel: physical, digital and hybrid.
We continue to invest in adding technology and functionality to enhance the value of mail with offering such as our web-enabled Connect+ Intellijet printing and SendSuite Live shipping solution. PbSmart codes, the latest addition to our pbSmart solutions family, uses QR codes to link physical communication to information, video and offers online. Volly, our secure digital mail platform will enable mailers to give their customers options on how they receive mail sent to their physical address.
We continue to make good progress in contracting with mailers for this exciting cloud-based  offering. More than 25 large third-party mail service providers have now signed with us. These companies produce bills and statements on behalf of more than 4,000 companies and consumer brands and they will be able to provide these companies access to Volly as it becomes available.
We are in discussions with many more bill and statement issuers and expect to roll out the service to consumers in 2012. Earlier, I noted the strong demand for our Software capabilities, which helped customers with physical and digital Customer Communications Management solutions. We continue to make progress and investments in delivering our SMB and enterprise customers with a comprehensive array of the physical, digital and hybrid solutions they need to manage communications with their customers.
Before I discuss guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results."
297018,141203039,182186,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2011",2011-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heig",1522,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heightened economic concerns among many of our customers especially some of our larger customers who have delayed making capital investment commitments.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S.  Operations. U.S. revenue declined by about 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 3% versus the prior year while excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 4%.
Non-U.S.  Operations represented 31% of our total revenue. Let me give you a quick update on the status of our recovery from the fire last February at our Dallas presort facility. As I stated last quarter, a new site was quickly identified after the fire and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment. Less than 5 months after the fire at the end of June, the new permanent facility opened its doors. In August, the new facility achieved operational efficiency comparable to the original Dallas site. We continue to work closely with our insurance carriers to resolve our claims related to the fire. During the quarter, we received from the insurance carriers additional reimbursements related to the fire that included compensation for the loss earnings we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year which were about $15 million or $0.05 per share.
Accounting rules are such they were unable to offset the estimated $19 million in lost revenue we experienced in any of the insurance proceeds. We expect to finalize our remaining claims with the insurance carriers shortly.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $235 million, which was 3% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 18.1%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin was helped by the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter but was adversely affected by our planned investment in Volly, which was about $4 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, the EBIT margin this quarter would have been about 17%, which is an improvement versus last year.
SG&A in the quarter declined about $5 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A declined by almost $16 million. SG&A benefited from our ongoing productivity initiatives.
EBIT margin this quarter improved year-over-year and in 4 of our 7 the segments. Both our SMB segments improved this year and year-over-year EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter. Our Software and Mail Services business also had improving EBIT margins this quarter. These improvements are primarily a result of continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
Excluding the net insurance reimbursements, the Mail Services EBIT margin improved year-over-year due to the leverage of higher mail volumes processed and greater presort network efficiencies. We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions we have taken since the second half of 2009. We're implementing options that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and our cost more viable, allowing us to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $302 million or $1.49 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate for the quarter was 4.63%. It was 19 basis points higher than the prior year due to the changes in the debt portfolio mix.
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 22.4% versus 33.1% last year. The lower tax rate this year was primarily the result of our settlement with the IRS related to tax years 2001 through 2004. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of about $16 million in continuing operations. Excluding the impact of the tax settlement our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 31.2% for the quarter.
We actually had a GAAP tax benefit for the quarter in part because of the IRS tax settlement I just noted and in part because of the tax benefit we received from the sale of the leveraged leased assets in Canada. Excluding the benefits of these 2 items, GAAP tax rate this quarter would have been 31%.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.69 compared with $0.55 for the same period last year. Our adjusted per diluted share this quarter included a $0.05 benefit from that insurance proceeds received during the quarter related to the Dallas presort facility fire. This $0.05 net benefit offsets the fire related losses we experienced in the first quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share also benefited from the IRS tax settlement as I discussed earlier, which equaled $0.08.
However, adjusted earnings per share -- diluted share were reduced this quarter by additional planned investment in Volly, which was about $0.01. Last year, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.55, which included a $0.03 favorable adjustment lives our leverage these portfolio Canada. The year-on-year comparison of adjusted earnings per diluted share perspective, if you back out the $0.13 of benefits we received this quarter, we would have earned $0.56. This compares with $0.52 last year, excluding the $0.03 benefit in that period. This represents an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share.
Good afternoon earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased almost 100% over the prior year to $0.85. There are a number of unusual items impacting GAAP earnings this quarter, including restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.11.
Asset impairments included charges related to our Strategic Transformation program of $0.03 for the planned exit of our Harlow U.K. facility. In addition, there was an impairment of intangible assets associated with our International Mail Services operations of $0.04 per share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share also included a $0.15 impairment charge to goodwill related to International Mail Services due to a change in expectations for the future growth of this business. Additionally, GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter included a net benefit of $0.13 related to the sale of the leveraged leased assets in Canada and a $0.30 benefit in discontinued operations due to the tax settlement with the IRS as I discussed previously.
Free cash flow was $260 million for the quarter in comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the release of tax bonds related to the IRS tax settlement, as well as from the timing of tax payments. Because of the effects of Hurricane Irene last quarter, the IRS allowed companies to deferred tax payments normally due in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we will be making both our third quarter and fourth quarter tax payments.
Cash flow also benefited from higher net income, as well as lower finance receivables. However, the benefit from finance receivables this quarter was about 1/3 less than the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares of Pitney Bowes common stock for about $50 million. We have $15 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 3 to 9 months.
As of the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We have no debt coming due until October, 2012. About 76% of our total debt was fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. Now let me update you on our Strategic Transformation program.
In the third quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the third quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $21 million. $11 million of those charges were for severance and other exit costs associated with the elimination of about 400 positions across the company. This brings the total number of positions eliminated since the beginning of the program to 3,800.
As I noted earlier, we also have an asset impairment charge of $10 million during the quarter for the pending exit of our Harlow U.K. facility and the move to a smaller, cost-efficient building. Based on our expenditures to date, we still expect total charges for the year related to the Strategic Transformation program, will be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. We continue to target a run rate of annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011. So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance and will have some closing comments."

We are modifying our guidance to reflect the number of factors, which Mike discussed, including our results year-to-date. We now expect 2011 revenue in the range of minus 3% to minus 4%, excluding the impact of currency. We also narrowing our 2011 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to reflect the impact in the third quarter of the tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 2001 to 2004. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year in the range of $2.32 $2.35.
We are also narrowing our 2011 guidance range for GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to a range of $1.89 to $2.04. The change in the GAAP guidance range also reflects asset impairment and goodwill charges for International Mail Services, as well as the sale of a leverage lease in Canada. The above range does not include results from discontinued operations.
In the fourth quarter, we reached agreement with the IRS on the tax treatment of a number of issues and agreed to tax -- revised tax calculations as part of the negotiations to settle a 2005 to 2008 IRS tax examination. As a result, we will recognize an income tax benefit of at least $30 million in the fourth quarter with approximately $5 million recorded in discontinued operations.
The impact of this agreement with the IRS is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. We are increasing free cash flow guidance for the year by $100 million and now expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $850 million to $950 million. This is based on a free cash flow to date and expectations for the fourth quarter.
We are making progress on our journey to transform our ability to deliver sustained and long-term value for customers and shareholders. We remain confident in the actions we are taking, focused on enhancing the customer experience and committed to investing in the growth of our business.

We look at the recurring revenue streams. If you recall, when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said we expected an impact of the current revenue streams to be about $0.25 to $0.30 for the year. If we look at year-to-date, it's about $0.20 and in the third quarter, about $0.07. So it's tracking right in line with what we had given us guidance originally and the third quarter is pretty much in line with the first half of the year. So there's puts and takes within the line items but those line items generally are tracking to what our original view of them were so the biggest buyers here is on the sales side."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and Mike will follow with the details on our third quarter results and I will discuss our guidance for the full year. Afterwards, we will take your questions.
Our performances this quarter reflects both the adverse impact of sustained economic uncertainty on most of our global customer base, as well as the positive effect of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. We experienced revenue weakness throughout much of our business as the global economic environment affected buying confidence and delayed some capital and lease commitments.
The notable exception was our Software business, which experienced a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter. This growth was fueled by strong demand for our software solutions particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We are pleased that the ongoing execution of our Strategic Transformation initiatives enabled us to improve the profitability in the third quarter despite the revenue challenges.
During the quarter, EBIT and EBIT margin grew in International Mailing, Software and of Mail Services, and the EBIT margin also improved in North America Mailing. Excluding the impact of the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter, presort network efficiency gains drove ongoing improvement in EBIT at Mail Services.
The net insurance recoveries during the quarter neutralized the losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year related to the Dallas fire. Before I turn it over to Mike to discuss the quarter, let me address some of the conflicting public perceptions and media reports about the mailing industry.
This past year, the U.S. Postal Service delivered nearly 170 billion pieces of mail and helped sustain a $1 trillion mailing industry, which underscored the vital role it plays in the economy and in our society. It is important to remember that the number of messages exchanged between individuals, households and the businesses is not declining. It is simply a matter of whether the messages are being delivered via physical or digital channels. Customers want the flexibility of options and channel preference varies with time, location and context.
That is why we've taken a number of actions to position ourselves to leverage the growth opportunities in the total delivery channel: physical, digital and hybrid.
We continue to invest in adding technology and functionality to enhance the value of mail with offering such as our web-enabled Connect+, Intellijet printing and SendSuite Live shipping solutions. pbSmartCodes, the latest addition to our pbSmart solutions family, uses QR codes to link physical communication to information, video and offers online. Volly, our secure digital mail platform will enable mailers to give their customers options on how they receive mail sent to their physical address.
We continue to make good progress in contracting with mailers for this exciting cloud-based  offering. More than 25 large third-party mail service providers have now signed with us. These companies produce bills and statements on behalf of more than 4,000 companies and consumer brands and they will be able to provide these companies access to Volly as it becomes available.
We are in discussions with many more bill and statement issuers and expect to roll out this service to consumers in 2012. Earlier, I noted the strong demand for our Software capabilities, which helped customers with physical and digital Customer Communication Management solutions. We continue to make progress and investments in delivering our SMB and enterprise customers with a comprehensive array of the physical, digital and hybrid solutions they need to manage communications with their customers.
Before I discuss guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results."

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heightened economic concerns among many of our customers especially some of our larger customers who have delayed making capital investment commitments.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 3% versus the prior year, while excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 4%.
Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of our total revenue. Let me give you a quick update on the status of our recovery from the fire last February at our Dallas presort facility. As I stated last quarter, a new site was quickly identified after the fire and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment. Less than 5 months after the fire at the end of June, the new permanent facility opened its doors. In August, the new facility achieved operational efficiency comparable to the original Dallas site. We continue to work closely with our insurance carriers to resolve our claims related to the fire. During the quarter, we received from the insurance carriers additional reimbursements related to the fire that included compensation for the lost earnings we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year which were about $15 million or $0.05 per share.
Accounting rules are such they were unable to offset the estimated $19 million in lost revenue we experienced with any of the insurance proceeds. We expect to finalize our remaining claims with the insurance carriers shortly.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $235 million, which was 3% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 18.1%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin was helped by the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter but was adversely affected by our planned investment in Volly, which was about $4 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, the EBIT margin this quarter would have been about 17%, which is an improvement versus last year.
SG&A in the quarter declined about $5 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A declined by almost $16 million. SG&A benefited from our ongoing productivity initiatives.
EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. Both our SMB segments improved this year their -- year-over-year EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter. Our Software and Mail Services businesses also had improving EBIT margins this quarter. These improvements are primarily a result of continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
Excluding the net insurance reimbursements, the Mail Services EBIT margin improved year-over-year due to the leverage of higher mail volumes processed and greater presort network efficiencies. We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions we have taken since the second half of 2009. We're implementing actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and our cost more variable, allowing us to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $302 million or $1.49 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate for the quarter was 4.63%. It was 19 basis points higher than the prior year due to the changes in the debt portfolio mix.
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 22.4% versus 33.1% last year. The lower tax rate this year was primarily the result of our settlement with the IRS related to tax years 2001 through 2004. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of about $16 million in continuing operations. Excluding the impact of the tax settlement, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 31.2% for the quarter.
We actually had a GAAP tax benefit for the quarter in part because of the IRS tax settlement I just noted and in part because of the tax benefit we received from the sale of the leveraged leased asset in Canada. Excluding the benefits of these 2 items, GAAP tax rate this quarter would have been 31%.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.69 compared with $0.55 for the same period last year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter included a $0.05 benefit from net insurance proceeds received during the quarter related to the Dallas presort facility fire. This $0.05 net benefit offsets the fire related losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share also benefited from the IRS tax settlement as I discussed earlier, which equaled $0.08.
However, adjusted earnings per share -- diluted share were reduced this quarter by additional plan investment in Volly, which was about $0.01. Last year, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.55, which included a $0.03 favorable adjustment related to a leverage leased portfolio in Canada. Put the year-on-year comparison of adjusted earnings per diluted share in perspective, if you back out the $0.13 of benefits we received this quarter, we would have earned $0.56. This compares with $0.52 last year, excluding the $0.03 benefit in that period. This represents an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased almost 100% over the prior year to $0.85. There are a number of unusual items impacting GAAP earnings this quarter, including restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.11.
Asset impairments included charges related to our Strategic Transformation program of $0.03 for the planned exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility. In addition, there was an impairment of intangible assets associated with our International Mail Services operations of $0.04 per share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share also included a $0.15 impairment charge to goodwill related to International Mail Services due to a change in expectations for the future growth of this business. Additionally, GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter included a net benefit of $0.13 related to the sale of the leveraged leased asset in Canada and a $0.30 benefit in discontinued operations due to the tax settlement with the IRS as I discussed previously.
Free cash flow was $260 million for the quarter in comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the release of tax bonds related to the IRS tax settlement, as well as from the timing of tax payments. Because of the effects of Hurricane Irene last quarter, the IRS allowed companies to defer tax payments normally due in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we will be making both our third quarter and fourth quarter tax payments.
Cash flow also benefited from higher net income, as well as lower finance receivables. However, the benefit from finance receivables this quarter was about 1/3 less than the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares of Pitney Bowes common stock for about $50 million. We have $50 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 3 to 9 months.
As of the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We have no debt coming due until October 2012. About 76% of our total debt is fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. 
Now let me update you on our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the third quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $21 million. $11 million of those charges were for severance and other exit costs associated with the elimination of about 400 positions across the company. This brings the total number of positions eliminated since the beginning of the program to 3,800.
As I noted earlier, we also had an asset impairment charge of $10 million during the quarter for the pending exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility and the move to a smaller, more cost-efficient building. Based on our expenditures to date, we still expect total charges for the year related to the Strategic Transformation program, will be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. We continue to target a run rate of annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011. So that concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance and will have some closing comments."

We are modifying our guidance to reflect the number of factors, which Mike discussed, including our results year-to-date. We now expect 2011 revenue in the range of minus 3% to minus 4%, excluding the impacts of currency. We're also narrowing our 2011 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to reflect the impact in the third quarter of the tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 2001 through 2004. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year in the range of $2.30 to $2.35.
We are also narrowing our 2011 guidance range for GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to a range of $1.89 to $2.04. The change in the GAAP guidance range also reflects asset impairment and goodwill charges for International Mail Services, as well as the sale of a leveraged lease in Canada. The above range does not include results from discontinued operations.
In the fourth quarter, we reached agreement with the IRS on the tax treatment of a number of issues and agreed to tax -- revised tax calculations as part of the negotiations to settle a 2005 to 2008 IRS tax examination. As a result, we will recognize an income tax benefit of at least $30 million in the fourth quarter with approximately $5 million recorded in discontinued operations.
The impact of this agreement with the IRS is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. We are increasing free cash flow guidance for the year by $100 million and now expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $850 million to $950 million. This is based on our free cash flow to date and expectations for the fourth quarter.
We are making progress on our journey to transform our ability to deliver sustained and long-term value for customers and shareholders. We remain confident in the actions we are taking, focused on enhancing the customer experience and committed to investing in the growth of our business.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

So a part of it is a comparison to the prior year but to Murray's comment, it's really around the equipment sales line particularly the large ticket DMT equipment and to some extent, in the U.S. Mailing business. When you look at the recurring revenue streams, if you recall when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said we expected an impact from the -- impact on the recurring revenue streams to be about $0.25 to $0.30 for the year. If we look at year-to-date, it's about $0.20 and in the third quarter, about $0.07. So it's tracking right in line with what we had given as guidance originally and the third quarter is pretty much in line with the first half of the year. So there's puts and takes within the line items but those line items generally are tracking to what our original view of them were. So the biggest variance here is around the equipment sales side."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and Mike will follow with the details on our third quarter results and I will discuss our guidance for the full year. Afterwards, we will take your questions.
Our performances this quarter reflects both the adverse impact of sustained economic uncertainty on most of our global customer base, as well as the positive effect of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. We experienced revenue weakness throughout much of our business as the global economic environment affected buying confidence and delayed some capital and lease commitments.
The notable exception was our Software business, which experienced a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter. This growth was fueled by strong demand for our software solutions particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We are pleased that the ongoing execution of our Strategic Transformation initiatives enabled us to improve the profitability in the third quarter despite the revenue challenges.
During the quarter, EBIT and EBIT margin grew in International Mailing, Software and of Mail Services, and the EBIT margin also improved in North America Mailing. Excluding the impact of the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter, presort network efficiency gains drove ongoing improvement in EBIT at Mail Services.
The net insurance recoveries during the quarter neutralized the losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year related to the Dallas fire. Before I turn it over to Mike to discuss the quarter, let me address some of the conflicting public perceptions and media reports about the mailing industry.
This past year, the U.S. Postal Service delivered nearly 170 billion pieces of mail and helped sustain a $1 trillion mailing industry, which underscored the vital role it plays in the economy and in our society. It is important to remember that the number of messages exchanged between individuals, households and the businesses is not declining. It is simply a matter of whether the messages are being delivered via physical or digital channels. Customers want the flexibility of options and channel preference varies with time, location and context.
That is why we've taken a number of actions to position ourselves to leverage the growth opportunities in the total delivery channel: physical, digital and hybrid.
We continue to invest in adding technology and functionality to enhance the value of mail with offering such as our web-enabled Connect+, Intellijet printing and SendSuite Live shipping solutions. pbSmartCodes, the latest addition to our pbSmart solutions family, uses QR codes to link physical communication to information, video and offers online. Volly, our secure digital mail platform will enable mailers to give their customers options on how they receive mail sent to their physical address.
We continue to make good progress in contracting with mailers for this exciting cloud-based  offering. More than 25 large third-party mail service providers have now signed with us. These companies produce bills and statements on behalf of more than 4,000 companies and consumer brands and they will be able to provide these companies access to Volly as it becomes available.
We are in discussions with many more bill and statement issuers and expect to roll out this service to consumers in 2012. Earlier, I noted the strong demand for our Software capabilities, which helped customers with physical and digital Customer Communication Management solutions. We continue to make progress and investments in delivering our SMB and enterprise customers with a comprehensive array of the physical, digital and hybrid solutions they need to manage communications with their customers.
Before I discuss guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results."
297018,141203039,182423,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2011",2011-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heig",1529,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heightened economic concerns among many of our customers especially some of our larger customers who have delayed making capital investment commitments.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 3% versus the prior year, while excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 4%.
Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of our total revenue. Let me give you a quick update on the status of our recovery from the fire last February at our Dallas presort facility. As I stated last quarter, a new site was quickly identified after the fire and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment. Less than 5 months after the fire at the end of June, the new permanent facility opened its doors. In August, the new facility achieved operational efficiency comparable to the original Dallas site. We continue to work closely with our insurance carriers to resolve our claims related to the fire. During the quarter, we received from the insurance carriers additional reimbursements related to the fire that included compensation for the lost earnings we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year which were about $15 million or $0.05 per share.
Accounting rules are such they were unable to offset the estimated $19 million in lost revenue we experienced with any of the insurance proceeds. We expect to finalize our remaining claims with the insurance carriers shortly.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $235 million, which was 3% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 18.1%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin was helped by the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter but was adversely affected by our planned investment in Volly, which was about $4 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, the EBIT margin this quarter would have been about 17%, which is an improvement versus last year.
SG&A in the quarter declined about $5 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A declined by almost $16 million. SG&A benefited from our ongoing productivity initiatives.
EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. Both our SMB segments improved this year their -- year-over-year EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter. Our Software and Mail Services businesses also had improving EBIT margins this quarter. These improvements are primarily a result of continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
Excluding the net insurance reimbursements, the Mail Services EBIT margin improved year-over-year due to the leverage of higher mail volumes processed and greater presort network efficiencies. We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions we have taken since the second half of 2009. We're implementing actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and our cost more variable, allowing us to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $302 million or $1.49 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate for the quarter was 4.63%. It was 19 basis points higher than the prior year due to the changes in the debt portfolio mix.
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 22.4% versus 33.1% last year. The lower tax rate this year was primarily the result of our settlement with the IRS related to tax years 2001 through 2004. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of about $16 million in continuing operations. Excluding the impact of the tax settlement, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 31.2% for the quarter.
We actually had a GAAP tax benefit for the quarter in part because of the IRS tax settlement I just noted and in part because of the tax benefit we received from the sale of the leveraged leased asset in Canada. Excluding the benefits of these 2 items, GAAP tax rate this quarter would have been 31%.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.69 compared with $0.55 for the same period last year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter included a $0.05 benefit from net insurance proceeds received during the quarter related to the Dallas presort facility fire. This $0.05 net benefit offsets the fire related losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share also benefited from the IRS tax settlement as I discussed earlier, which equaled $0.08.
However, adjusted earnings per share -- diluted share were reduced this quarter by additional plan investment in Volly, which was about $0.01. Last year, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.55, which included a $0.03 favorable adjustment related to a leverage leased portfolio in Canada. Put the year-on-year comparison of adjusted earnings per diluted share in perspective, if you back out the $0.13 of benefits we received this quarter, we would have earned $0.56. This compares with $0.52 last year, excluding the $0.03 benefit in that period. This represents an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased almost 100% over the prior year to $0.85. There are a number of unusual items impacting GAAP earnings this quarter, including restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.11.
Asset impairments included charges related to our Strategic Transformation program of $0.03 for the planned exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility. In addition, there was an impairment of intangible assets associated with our International Mail Services operations of $0.04 per share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share also included a $0.15 impairment charge to goodwill related to International Mail Services due to a change in expectations for the future growth of this business. Additionally, GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter included a net benefit of $0.13 related to the sale of the leveraged leased asset in Canada and a $0.30 benefit in discontinued operations due to the tax settlement with the IRS as I discussed previously.
Free cash flow was $260 million for the quarter in comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the release of tax bonds related to the IRS tax settlement, as well as from the timing of tax payments. Because of the effects of Hurricane Irene last quarter, the IRS allowed companies to defer tax payments normally due in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we will be making both our third quarter and fourth quarter tax payments.
Cash flow also benefited from higher net income, as well as lower finance receivables. However, the benefit from finance receivables this quarter was about 1/3 less than the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares of Pitney Bowes common stock for about $50 million. We have $50 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 3 to 9 months.
As of the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We have no debt coming due until October 2012. About 76% of our total debt is fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. 
Now let me update you on our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the third quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $21 million. $11 million of those charges were for severance and other exit costs associated with the elimination of about 400 positions across the company. This brings the total number of positions eliminated since the beginning of the program to 3,800.
As I noted earlier, we also had an asset impairment charge of $10 million during the quarter for the pending exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility and the move to a smaller, more cost-efficient building. Based on our expenditures to date, we still expect total charges for the year related to the Strategic Transformation program, will be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. We continue to target a run rate of annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011. So that concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance and will have some closing comments."

We are modifying our guidance to reflect the number of factors, which Mike discussed, including our results year-to-date. We now expect 2011 revenue in the range of minus 3% to minus 4%, excluding the impacts of currency. We're also narrowing our 2011 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to reflect the impact in the third quarter of the tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 2001 through 2004. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year in the range of $2.30 to $2.35.
We are also narrowing our 2011 guidance range for GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to a range of $1.89 to $2.04. The change in the GAAP guidance range also reflects asset impairment and goodwill charges for International Mail Services, as well as the sale of a leveraged lease in Canada. The above range does not include results from discontinued operations.
In the fourth quarter, we reached agreement with the IRS on the tax treatment of a number of issues and agreed to tax -- revised tax calculations as part of the negotiations to settle a 2005 to 2008 IRS tax examination. As a result, we will recognize an income tax benefit of at least $30 million in the fourth quarter with approximately $5 million recorded in discontinued operations.
The impact of this agreement with the IRS is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. We are increasing free cash flow guidance for the year by $100 million and now expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $850 million to $950 million. This is based on our free cash flow to date and expectations for the fourth quarter.
We are making progress on our journey to transform our ability to deliver sustained and long-term value for customers and shareholders. We remain confident in the actions we are taking, focused on enhancing the customer experience and committed to investing in the growth of our business.

So a part of it is a comparison to the prior year but to Murray's comment, it's really around the equipment sales line particularly the large ticket DMT equipment and to some extent, in the U.S. Mailing business. When you look at the recurring revenue streams, if you recall when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said we expected an impact from the -- impact on the recurring revenue streams to be about $0.25 to $0.30 for the year. If we look at year-to-date, it's about $0.20 and in the third quarter, about $0.07.

It seems like you have softer revenues, but may be you can get -- you should have some bit of ongoing improvement on margins on those revenues. Is that the right way to think about it? And then I guess just a couple of other buckets. How should we think about CapEx? And there are a lot of -- or there have been this year at least, a lot of moving parts on onetime items.

In terms of cash flow, again, we tend to look at these things on an annualized basis. The timing of tax payments in this case in 2011 where we may have the delay of taxes from third to fourth quarter, we don't think that's an annual differential. We do have some cash that we received on the levered net cash flow received on the levered leased transaction as an incremental item. But beyond that, there's not a lot that would change our overall expectations on cash flow."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and Mike will follow with the details on our third quarter results and I will discuss our guidance for the full year. Afterwards, we will take your questions.
Our performance this quarter reflects both the adverse impact of sustained economic uncertainty on most of our global customer base, as well as the positive effect of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. We experienced revenue weakness throughout much of our business as the global economic environment affected buying confidence and delayed some capital and lease commitments.
The notable exception was our Software business, which experienced a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter. This growth was fueled by strong demand for our software solutions, particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We are pleased that the ongoing execution of our Strategic Transformation initiatives enabled us to improve the profitability in the third quarter despite the revenue challenges.
During the quarter, EBIT and EBIT margin grew in International Mailing, Software and of Mail Services, and the EBIT margin also improved in North America Mailing. Excluding the impact of the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter, presort network efficiency gains drove ongoing improvement in EBIT at Mail Services.
The net insurance recoveries during the quarter neutralized the losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year related to the Dallas fire. Before I turn it over to Mike, to discuss the quarter, let me address some of the conflicting public perceptions and media reports about the mailing industry.
This past year, the U.S. Postal Service delivered nearly 170 billion pieces of mail and helped sustain a $1 trillion mailing industry, which underscored the vital role it plays in the economy and in our society. It is important to remember that the number of messages exchanged between individuals, households and the businesses is not declining. It is simply a matter of whether the messages are being delivered via physical or digital channels. Customers want the flexibility of options and channel preference varies with time, location and context.
That is why we've taken a number of actions to position ourselves to leverage the growth opportunities in the total delivery channel: physical, digital and hybrid.
We continue to invest in adding technology and functionality to enhance the value of mail with offering such as, our web-enabled Connect+, Intellijet printing and SendSuite Live shipping Solutions. pbSmartCodes, the latest addition to our pbSmart solutions family, uses QR codes to link physical communication to information, video and offers online. Volly, our secure digital mail platform will enable mailers to give their customers options on how they receive mail sent to their physical address.
We continue to make good progress in contracting with mailers for this exciting cloud-based  offering. More than 25 large third-party mail service providers have now signed with us. These companies produce bills and statements on behalf of more than 4,000 companies and consumer brands and they will be able to provide these companies access to Volly as it becomes available.
We are in discussions with many more bill and statement issuers and expect to roll out this service to consumers in 2012. Earlier, I noted the strong demand for our Software capabilities, which helped customers with physical and digital Customer Communication Management solutions. We continue to make progress and investments, in delivering our SMB and enterprise customers with a comprehensive array of the physical, digital and hybrid solutions they need to manage communications with their customers.
Before I discuss guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results."
297018,141203039,182442,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2011",2011-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heig",1528,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heightened economic concerns among many of our customers especially some of our larger customers who have delayed making capital investment commitments.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 3% versus the prior year, while excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 4%.
Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of our total revenue. Let me give you a quick update on the status of our recovery from the fire last February at our Dallas presort facility. As I stated last quarter, a new site was quickly identified after the fire and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment. Less than 5 months after the fire at the end of June, the new permanent facility opened its doors. In August, the new facility achieved operational efficiency comparable to the original Dallas site. We have continued to work closely with our insurance carriers to resolve our claims related to the fire. During the quarter, we received from the insurance carriers additional reimbursements related to the fire that included compensation for the lost earnings, we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year which were about $15 million or $0.05 per share.
Accounting rules are such they were unable to offset the estimated $19 million in lost revenue we experienced with any of the insurance proceeds. We expect to finalize our remaining claims with the insurance carriers shortly.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $235 million, which was 3% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 18.1%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin was helped by the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter, but was adversely affected by our planned investment in Volly, which was about $4 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, the EBIT margin this quarter would have been about 17%, which is an improvement versus last year.
SG&A in the quarter declined about $5 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A declined by almost $16 million. SG&A benefited from our ongoing productivity initiatives.
EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. Both our SMB segments improved this year their year-over-year EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter. Our Software and Mail Services businesses also had improving EBIT margins this quarter. These improvements are primarily a result of continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
Excluding the net insurance reimbursements, the Mail Services EBIT margin improved year-over-year due to the leverage of higher mail volumes processed and greater presort network efficiencies. We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions we have taken since the second half of 2009. We're implementing actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and our cost more variable, allowing us to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $302 million or $1.49 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate for the quarter was 4.63%. It was 19 basis points higher than the prior year due to the changes in the debt portfolio mix.
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 22.4% versus 33.1% last year. The lower tax rate this year was primarily the result of our settlement with the IRS related to tax years 2001 through 2004. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of about $16 million in continuing operations. Excluding the impact of the tax settlement, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 31.2% for the quarter.
We actually had a GAAP tax benefit for the quarter in part because of the IRS tax settlement I just noted and in part because of the tax benefit we received from the sale of the leveraged leased asset in Canada. Excluding the benefits of these 2 items, GAAP tax rate this quarter would have been 31%.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.69 compared with $0.55 for the same period last year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter included a $0.05 benefit from net insurance proceeds received during the quarter related to the Dallas presort facility fire. This $0.05 net benefit offsets the fire related losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share also benefited from the IRS tax settlement as I discussed earlier, which equaled $0.08.
However, adjusted earnings per share -- diluted share were reduced this quarter by additional plan investment in Volly, which was about $0.01. Last year, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.55, which included a $0.03 favorable adjustment related to a leverage leased portfolio in Canada. Put the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings per diluted share in perspective, if you back out the $0.13 of benefits we received this quarter, we would have earned $0.56. This compares with $0.52 last year, excluding the $0.03 benefit in that period. This represents an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased almost 100% over the prior year to $0.85. There are a number of unusual items impacting GAAP earnings this quarter, including restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.11.
Asset impairments included charges related to our Strategic Transformation program of $0.03 for the planned exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility. In addition, there was an impairment of intangible assets associated with our International Mail Services operations of $0.04 per share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share also included a $0.15 impairment charge to goodwill related to International Mail Services, due to a change in expectations for the future growth of this business. Additionally, GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter included a net benefit of $0.13 related to the sale of leveraged leased asset in Canada and a $0.30 benefit in discontinued operations due to the tax settlement with the IRS as I discussed previously.
Free cash flow was $260 million for the quarter in comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the release of tax bonds related to the IRS tax settlement, as well as from the timing of tax payments. Because of the effects of Hurricane Irene last quarter, the IRS allowed companies to defer tax payments normally due in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we will be making both our third quarter and fourth quarter tax payments.
Cash flow also benefited from higher net income, as well as lower finance receivables. However, the benefit from finance receivables this quarter was about 1/3 less than the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares of Pitney Bowes common stock for about $50 million. We have $50 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 3 to 9 months.
As of the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We have no debt coming due until October 2012. About 76% of our total debt is fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. 
Now let me update you on our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the third quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $21 million. $11 million of those charges were for severance and other exit costs associated with the elimination of about 400 positions across the company. This brings the total number of positions eliminated since the beginning of the program to 3,800.
As I noted earlier, we also had an asset impairment charge of $10 million during the quarter for the pending exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility and the move to a smaller, more cost-efficient building. Based on our expenditures to date, we still expect total charges for the year related to the Strategic Transformation program, will be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. We continue to target a run rate of annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011. So that concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance and will have some closing comments."

We are modifying our guidance to reflect the number of factors, which Mike discussed, including our results year-to-date. We now expect 2011 revenue in the range of minus 3% to minus 4%, excluding the impacts of currency. We're also narrowing our 2011 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to reflect the impact in the third quarter of the tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 2001 through 2004. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year in the range of $2.30 to $2.35.
We are also narrowing our 2011 guidance range for GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to a range of $1.89 to $2.04. The change in the GAAP guidance range also reflects asset impairment and goodwill charges for International Mail Services, as well as the sale of a leveraged lease in Canada. The above range does not include results from discontinued operations.
In the fourth quarter, we reached agreement with the IRS on the tax treatment of a number of issues and agreed to tax -- revised tax calculations as part of the negotiations to settle a 2005 to 2008 IRS tax examination. As a result, we will recognize an income tax benefit of at least $30 million in the fourth quarter with approximately $5 million recorded in discontinued operations.
The impact of this agreement with the IRS is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. We are increasing free cash flow guidance for the year by $100 million and now expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $850 million to $950 million. This is based on our free cash flow to date and expectations for the fourth quarter.
We are making progress on our journey to transform our ability to deliver sustained and long-term value for customers and shareholders. We remain confident in the actions we are taking, focused on enhancing the customer experience and committed to investing in the growth of our business.

So a part of it is a comparison to the prior year but to Murray's comment, it's really around the equipment sales line particularly the large ticket DMT equipment and to some extent, in the U.S. Mailing business. When you look at the recurring revenue streams, if you recall when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said we expected an impact from the -- impact on the recurring revenue streams to be about $0.25 to $0.30 for the year. If we look at year-to-date, it's about $0.20 and in the third quarter, about $0.07. So it's tracking right in line with what we had given as guidance originally and the third quarter is pretty much in line with the first half of the year.

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance, and Mike will follow with the details on our third quarter results and I will discuss our guidance for the full year. Afterwards, we will take your questions.
Our performance this quarter reflects both the adverse impact of sustained economic uncertainty on most of our global customer base, as well as the positive effect of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. We experienced revenue weakness throughout much of our business as the global economic environment affected buying confidence and delayed some capital and lease commitments.
The notable exception was our Software business, which experienced a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter. This growth was fueled by strong demand for our software solutions, particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We are pleased that the ongoing execution of our Strategic Transformation initiatives enabled us to improve the profitability in the third quarter despite the revenue challenges.
During the quarter, EBIT and EBIT margin grew in International Mailing, Software and of Mail Services, and the EBIT margin also improved in North America Mailing. Excluding the impact of the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter, presort network efficiency gains drove ongoing improvement in EBIT at Mail Services.
The net insurance recoveries during the quarter neutralized the losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year related to the Dallas fire. Before I turn it over to Mike, to discuss the quarter, let me address some of the conflicting public perceptions and media reports about the mailing industry.
This past year, the U.S. Postal Service delivered nearly 170 billion pieces of mail and helped sustain a $1 trillion mailing industry, which underscored the vital role it plays in the economy and in our society. It is important to remember that the number of messages exchanged between individuals, households and the businesses is not declining. It is simply a matter of whether the messages are being delivered via physical or digital channels. Customers want the flexibility of options and channel preference varies with time, location and context.
That is why we've taken a number of actions to position ourselves to leverage the growth opportunities in the total delivery channel: physical, digital and hybrid.
We continue to invest in adding technology and functionality to enhance the value of mail with offering such as, our web-enabled Connect+, Intellijet printing and SendSuite Live shipping solutions. pbSmartCodes, the latest addition to our pbSmart solutions family, uses QR codes to link physical communication to information, video and offers online. Volly, our secure digital mail platform will enable mailers to give their customers options on how they receive mail sent to their physical address.
We continue to make good progress in contracting with mailers for this exciting cloud-based  offering. More than 25 large third-party mail service providers have now signed with us. These companies produce bills and statements on behalf of more than 4,000 companies and consumer brands and they will be able to provide these companies access to Volly as it becomes available.
We are in discussions with many more bill and statement issuers and expect to roll out this service to consumers in 2012. Earlier, I noted the strong demand for our Software capabilities, which helped customers with physical and digital Customer Communication Management solutions. We continue to make progress and investments, in delivering our SMB and enterprise customers with a comprehensive array of the physical, digital and hybrid solutions they need to manage communications with their customers.
Before I discuss guidance for the year and provide some closing remarks, Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results."
297018,141203039,182643,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2011",2011-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heig",1528,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 3% on a reported basis when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter was a 2% benefit to revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by heightened economic concerns among many of our customers especially some of our larger customers who have delayed making capital investment commitments.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 6%. Outside the U.S., revenue on a reported basis increased 3% versus the prior year, while excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 4%.
Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of our total revenue. Let me give you a quick update on the status of our recovery from the fire last February at our Dallas presort facility. As I stated last quarter, a new site was quickly identified after the fire and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment. Less than 5 months after the fire at the end of June, the new permanent facility opened its doors. In August, the new facility achieved operational efficiency comparable to the original Dallas site. We have continued to work closely with our insurance carriers to resolve our claims related to the fire. During the quarter, we received from the insurance carriers additional reimbursements related to the fire that included compensation for the lost earnings, we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year which were about $15 million or $0.05 per share.
Accounting rules are such they were unable to offset the estimated $19 million in lost revenue we experienced with any of the insurance proceeds. We expect to finalize our remaining claims with the insurance carriers shortly.
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, it was $235 million, which was 3% higher than last year. EBIT margin was 18.1%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin was helped by the insurance reimbursement we received this quarter, but was adversely affected by our planned investment in Volly, which was about $4 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, the EBIT margin this quarter would have been about 17%, which is an improvement versus last year.
SG&A in the quarter declined about $5 million when compared with the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, SG&A declined by almost $16 million. SG&A benefited from our ongoing productivity initiatives.
EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. Both our SMB segments improved this year their year-over-year EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter. Our Software and Mail Services businesses also had improving EBIT margins this quarter. These improvements are primarily a result of continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
Excluding the net insurance reimbursements, the Mail Services EBIT margin improved year-over-year due to the leverage of higher mail volumes processed and greater presort network efficiencies. We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions we have taken since the second half of 2009. We're implementing actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and our cost more variable, allowing us to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $302 million or $1.49 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate for the quarter was 4.63%. It was 19 basis points higher than the prior year due to the changes in the debt portfolio mix.
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 22.4% versus 33.1% last year. The lower tax rate this year was primarily the result of our settlement with the IRS related to tax years 2001 through 2004. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of about $16 million in continuing operations. Excluding the impact of the tax settlement, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 31.2% for the quarter.
We actually had a GAAP tax benefit for the quarter in part because of the IRS tax settlement I just noted and in part because of the tax benefit we received from the sale of the leveraged leased asset in Canada. Excluding the benefits of these 2 items, GAAP tax rate this quarter would have been 31%.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.69 compared with $0.55 for the same period last year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter included a $0.05 benefit from net insurance proceeds received during the quarter related to the Dallas presort facility fire. This $0.05 net benefit offsets the fire related losses we experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share also benefited from the IRS tax settlement as I discussed earlier, which equaled $0.08.
However, adjusted earnings per share -- diluted share were reduced this quarter by additional plan investment in Volly, which was about $0.01. Last year, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.55, which included a $0.03 favorable adjustment related to a leverage leased portfolio in Canada. Put the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings per diluted share in perspective, if you back out the $0.13 of benefits we received this quarter, we would have earned $0.56. This compares with $0.52 last year, excluding the $0.03 benefit in that period. This represents an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased almost 100% over the prior year to $0.85. There are a number of unusual items impacting GAAP earnings this quarter, including restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.11.
Asset impairments included charges related to our Strategic Transformation program of $0.03 for the planned exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility. In addition, there was an impairment of intangible assets associated with our International Mail Services operations of $0.04 per share.
GAAP earnings per diluted share also included a $0.15 impairment charge to goodwill related to International Mail Services, due to a change in expectations for the future growth of this business. Additionally, GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter included a net benefit of $0.13 related to the sale of leveraged leased asset in Canada and a $0.30 benefit in discontinued operations due to the tax settlement with the IRS as I discussed previously.
Free cash flow was $260 million for the quarter in comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the quarter benefited from the release of tax bonds related to the IRS tax settlement, as well as from the timing of tax payments. Because of the effects of Hurricane Irene last quarter, the IRS allowed companies to defer tax payments normally due in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we will be making both our third quarter and fourth quarter tax payments.
Cash flow also benefited from higher net income, as well as lower finance receivables. However, the benefit from finance receivables this quarter was about 1/3 less than the prior year. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares of Pitney Bowes common stock for about $50 million. We have $50 million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to use over the next 3 to 9 months.
As of the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. We have no debt coming due until October 2012. About 76% of our total debt is fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. 
Now let me update you on our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team. During the third quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $21 million. $11 million of those charges were for severance and other exit costs associated with the elimination of about 400 positions across the company. This brings the total number of positions eliminated since the beginning of the program to 3,800.
As I noted earlier, we also had an asset impairment charge of $10 million during the quarter for the pending exit of our Harlow, U.K. facility and the move to a smaller, more cost-efficient building. Based on our expenditures to date, we still expect total charges for the year related to the Strategic Transformation program, will be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. We continue to target a run rate of annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of $250 million to $300 million by the end of 2011. So that concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance and will have some closing comments."

We are modifying our guidance to reflect the number of factors, which Mike discussed, including our results year-to-date. We now expect 2011 revenue in the range of minus 3% to minus 4%, excluding the impacts of currency. We're also narrowing our 2011 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to reflect the impact in the third quarter of the tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 2001 through 2004. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year in the range of $2.30 to $2.35.
We are also narrowing our 2011 guidance range for GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to a range of $1.89 to $2.04. The change in the GAAP guidance range also reflects asset impairment and goodwill charges for International Mail Services, as well as the sale of a leveraged lease in Canada. The above range does not include results from discontinued operations.
In the fourth quarter, we reached agreement with the IRS on the tax treatment of a number of issues and agreed to tax -- revised tax calculations as part of the negotiations to settle a 2005 to 2008 IRS tax examination. As a result, we will recognize an income tax benefit of at least $30 million in the fourth quarter with approximately $5 million recorded in discontinued operations.
The impact of this agreement with the IRS is not included in our earnings guidance for the year. We are increasing free cash flow guidance for the year by $100 million and now expect to generate free cash flow for 2011 in the range of $850 million to $950 million. This is based on our free cash flow to date and expectations for the fourth quarter.
We are making progress on our journey to transform our ability to deliver sustained and long-term value for customers and shareholders. We remain confident in the actions we are taking, focused on enhancing the customer experience and committed to investing in the growth of our business.

So a part of it is a comparison to the prior year but to Murray's comment, it's really around the equipment sales line particularly the large ticket DMT equipment and to some extent, in the U.S. Mailing business. When you look at the recurring revenue streams, if you recall when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said we expected an impact from the -- impact on the recurring revenue streams to be about $0.25 to $0.30 for the year. If we look at year-to-date, it's about $0.20 and in the third quarter, about $0.07. So it's tracking right in line with what we had given as guidance originally and the third quarter is pretty much in line with the first half of the year. So there's puts and takes within the line items, but those line items generally are tracking to what our original view of them were. So the biggest variance here is around the equipment sales side."

One is that, remember that the expenses for Volly are included in the Production Mail segment for reporting purposes, so that's obviously pure investment that's going on today. That really doesn't affect the Production Mail business directly in terms of its sale of equipment, but those expenses are included there because we're leveraging that customer base. So that's number one. Number two is that this business tends to have its strongest quarter in the fourth quarter in terms of seasonality within the year. So it tends to be a business where you see leverage off the revenue."

On the meter renewal cycle in the third quarter was one of the softer quarters on the leases that are available. That begins to start moving more a little more positively as we move forward but that was sort of the -- a negative effect in that area. We have seen a positive trend in renewals. So there are more on a percentile being renewed. We did see the lease extensions continue in the third quarter at a little higher rate than we expected and I think that has to do with my comments about all the press around the postal service. I think we'll see that beginning to abate in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year, as the Postal Service is now beginning to start to talk positively about mail, and is starting to actually put advertising and marketing out about the value of mail and different programs to stimulate mail. So I think we'll start to see -- we'll see a reduction in the negative impact that we had in the third quarter and attending towards more positive feel about mail.
