Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Results for the quarter and the full year reflect growth at Boardwalk Pipeline, steady performance at CNA and some ongoing challenges facing Diamond Offshore, HighMount and",972,"Thank you, Darren. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Results for the quarter and the full year reflect growth at Boardwalk Pipeline, steady performance at CNA and some ongoing challenges facing Diamond Offshore, HighMount and Loews Hotels. G&A reported good results for the quarter benefiting from increased investment income and favorable prior year development in its core property and casualty operations. 
CNA has reported favorable prior year reserve development for 16 consecutive quarters. CNA's results for both the quarter and the full year demonstrate a strong E&P underwriting and the progress it has made on its profit-improvement strategy. CNA's underwriting discipline is demonstrated by five consecutive quarters of rate increases in the Commercial segment as well as continued strength of the Specialty segment.
CNA finished the year with a strong balance sheet and with a book value per share increasing by 13% during 2010. During the fourth quarter, however, CNA's book value per share decreased by 5%, reflecting declines in CNA's net unrealized gain position, primarily as a result of higher interest rates.
I'm sure that most of everyone understands the impact of interest rates on the Fixed-income portfolio. Nonetheless, I want to reiterate that in the future, interest rates in the U.S. could and probably will rise. And if this occurs, CNA, along with most E&P insurance companies, will likely see a negative impact on the market value of a fixed income investment portfolio, which would in turn negatively impact GAAP book value. But there is a film are running to our higher interest rate, CNA will have the ability to invest its significant cash flows into higher-yielding securities.
CNA finished the year with a strong capital position, which allowed it in the fourth quarter to redeem the remaining $500 million of the one recorded billion dollars of preferred stock that was purchased by Loews in November of '08. Additionally, given its strong capital position and solid insurance operation, CNA today announced the initiation of a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend. This action will deliver cash to CNA shareholders, including roughly $24 million below to Loews in dividend in the first quarter of this year.
Turning to offshore drilling industry. During the first quarter, Diamond Offshore announced that it entered to our contract with Hyundai Heavy Industry to build two ultra-deepwater drill shafts. There is scheduled for delivery in 2013. 
These dynamically drill ships are designed to operate being up to 12,000 feet of water. the total cost per rig including commission project management is expected to be approximately $590 million. Two or three years ago, these ships would've cost more than $750 million.
To enhance its ultra-deepwater capabilities and attractive capital costs, over the last four years, Diamond has purchased, ordered or upgraded seven rigs capable of operating in ultra-deepwater at 10,000 feet. Upon completion of these latest two drill ships, Diamond will have 16 deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs in its fleet. 
Diamond's results for the quarter and the full year were negatively impacted by the U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium. Although the moratorium was technically lifted in October, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has issued what I call a permatorium. It is issuing very few drilling permit so in effect U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains under a de facto drilling ban for the foreseeable future, especially for new, deep water oil wells. Our orders for new drill ships, however, demonstrate Diamond's confidence in the strength of the international deepwater markets in the years ahead.
Moving to our natural gas E&P business. I'd like to take a moment to review the top three initiatives that HighMount will be focusing on in 2011. Since we initially formed our HighMount subsidiary in 2007, gas prices have been lower than we originally hoped or forecast. We remain optimistic, however, about natural gas over the long term. But where we sit today is where going abundant the Med Tech gas supply and prices well under $5 per Mcf. 
Given this pricing environment, HighMount's first initiative is to optimize its base business, which is located in the Sonora in the Permian Basin in Texas. HighMount's second initiative is to utilize technology to exploit organic growth opportunities in the Sonora field. These technologies include increased use of horizontal drilling and 3D seismic to identify development opportunities. HighMount will continue to apply its expertise with unconventional reservoirs to identify new opportunities within the Sonora field.
And the third initiative for HighMount in 2011 is to grow and diversify its portfolio through acquisitions. The focus will be on adding liquid to the mix, both wet gas and oil, which should offer better economics given their strong pricing relative to dry gas. Additionally, HighMount will look for opportunities to take advantage of industry cyclicalities by acquiring hydrocarbon assets at attractive prices.
At the holding company level, our cash and investments as of December 31, 2010, stood at $4.6 billion or more than $11 per oil share. During the fourth quarter of 2010, through January of this year, we bought $2.7 million of Loews common stock for a total cost of $104 million. And during all of 2010, through January of this year, we bought 11.9 million shares or 2.8% of our outstanding common stock for a total cost of $442 million.
And finally, in the next few weeks, a blog written by yours truly, will appear on the Loews website. The blog will give you a chance to sound off on a, mostly related to Loews. Stay tuned for posts on current events, taxes, frac-ing, accounting and whatever else may cross my mind. Comments and criticisms will always be welcomed, and I look forward to a lively interaction with members of the extended of Loews community. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Peter Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

For the fourth quarter, Loews' net income increased to $466 million from $403 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Loews' net income increased to $1.3 billion from $564 million in 2009. Full year",1089,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews' net income increased to $466 million from $403 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Loews' net income increased to $1.3 billion from $564 million in 2009. 
Full year results included two onetime charges. 2010 results included charge of $328 million after tax in noncontrolling interest related to CNA's Loss Portfolio Transfer Agreement with National Indemnity Company. And results for 2009 included an impairment charge of $660 million after tax related to the carrying value of HighMount's natural gas and oil properties.
For the quarter, Loews reported net investment losses of $22 million in after tax in noncontrolling interest as compared to net investment gains of $46 million after tax in noncontrolling interest in last year's fourth quarter. Negatively impacting the quarter were increased losses at CNA and sales of securities resulting from continued management of portfolio risk. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a $217 million gain from the sale of CNA's common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics.
For the full year, net investment gains were $27 million after tax in noncontrolling interests compared to net investment losses of $503 million in 2009. Net investment gains in 2010 were driven by improvements in capital markets and included OTTI losses of $136 million versus OTTI losses in 2009 of $791 million, primarily consisting of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in CNA's investment portfolio. 
For the fourth quarter, CNA's contribution to Loews' operating income improved to $297 million from $182 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by increased favorable net prior year development. Additionally, investment income increased primarily from higher limited partnership income and investment shift during 2010 from lower yielding short-term and tax exempt securities a higher-yielding taxable fixed maturity securities.
For the full year, CNA's contribution to Loews' operating income decreased to $609 million from $904 million in 2009. Excluding the charge associated with the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA's contribution to Loews' 2010 operating income increased to $918 million. Operating income increased due to favorable net prior year development, partially offset by decreased current accident year underwriting results, including higher catastrophe losses.
For the fourth quarter, Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income decreased to $113 million from $128 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Diamond's contribution to net income decreased to $446 million from $642 million in 2011. This decrease was primarily related to lower average day rates and utilization, which have been negatively impacted by the reduction in drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
HighMount's reported net income of $21 million for the quarter versus $35 million in the prior year fourth quarter. HighMount's net income for the full year was $77 million. 
Net income for 2009 as adjusted, excluding impairment charges of $660 million after tax was $123 million. the declines for both periods primarily resulting from the sale of non-core assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama during the second quarter of 2010.
As a result of the Michigan and Alabama assets sales, a portion of HighMount interest rate of commodity hedging activities were no longer probable of occurring and hedge accounting was discontinued. This resulted in an after-tax loss during the first half of 2010 of $19 million, which is reported under Corporate and Other investment gains and losses.
In the fourth quarter, HighMount's total production in the Permian Basin increased slightly to $17.5 billion cubic feet equivalent from 70.4 Bcfe in the prior year fourth quarter. However, the average realized price decreased to $6.12 per Mcfe from $7.9 per Mcfe for the same period. 
Production details for the fourth quarter of 2010 are as follows: Natural gas production of 12.4 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.93 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production of 777,000 barrels at an average realized price of $35.84 per barrel; and oil production of 66,000 barrels at an average price of $80.05 per barrel.
As of December 31, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 75.1% of its estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.35 per Mcfe and 37.4% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.65 per Mcfe. As of December 31, 2010, HighMount owned 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of net proved reserves, of which 78% were classified as proved developed.
Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' fourth quarter net income increased to $34 million from $28 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Boardwalk's contribution to net income increased to $114 million from the $67,000,000.2009. Boardwalk's results for the quarter end of the year benefited from increased gas transportation revenues, primarily from pipeline expansion projects. 
Distributable cash flow in 2010 increased to $448 million from $314 million in 2009. For growth has declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of $0.52 per unit, continuing its track record of increasing cash distributions to each unit holders each quarter since its initial public offering and 2005.
Loews Hotels results for the quarter were breakeven versus a loss of $4 million in the prior year. For the full year, net income was $1 million versus a loss of $34 million in 2009. 
Results for 2009 include impairment charges of $16 million after tax related to the write down of Loews Hotels investment in a hotel property and $12 million after tax weighted to two hotel properties. Average room rates for the quarter increased to $225 from $217 in the prior year quarter, and occupancy increased to 67% from 62%, resulting in a 13% increase in revenue per available room.
For the quarter, net investment income from Loews' Trading portfolio increased to $56 million from a $16 million in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, investment income was $123 million versus $113 million in 2009. Improvements were primarily from larger invested cash balances and improved performance in the Trading portfolio.
As of December 31, 2010, holding company cash and investments totaled $4.6 billion. During the year, we received $720 million and interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, $1 billion from the repayment of senior preferred stock by CNA and proceeds of $333 million from the sale of $11.5 million Boardwalk Pipeline common units in February 2010. During 2010, we repurchased $405 million of our common stock and paid $105 million of dividends to our shareholders. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

And when it does, that will be a $600 billion or $900 billion purchaser of fixed-income securities exiting the market. So for those reasons and a lot of others, at some point in time, it is inevitable that interest rates will go up. We are positioning the CNA portfolio to try to stay as short as we can but also to recognize that we have liabilities that have to be matched. 1/3 of our liabilities reflect a long-term care and other long-term liabilities that we matched very close together. That's got about a 10-year duration to it. And then, the rest of the portfolio runs about a five-year duration, and that's reflective of the liabilities or the reserves that CNA has on its books scores, driven in part are and it business."

So on a per-share basis, we're probably at the high point. But I still don't feel that we're generating cash. And I believe that over the next few quarters and years, we'll have plenty of opportunities to use that cash. We as, by corporate philosophy, we like having a lot of cash on our balance sheet. We understand that it is a drag on return on equity and other statistics. But it's been the cash that's been on the balance sheet that given us the opportunities to really do value-creating transactions. in a way, it's allowed us to invest in CNA and Boardwalk at a time when if the markets would've been open to them, they would've been open at a very, very high price. It gave us the opportunity to buy Texas Gas Transmission in '03 and Golf Sievert pipelines in '04. It allowed us to get into the gas exploration and production business in '07 and going back to the 80s and early 90s, it was the cash on the balance sheet that allowed us to jump into the opportunity of buying offshore drilling rigs when nobody else wanted them. So we like to have cash and not have to go to bankers and other financiers. When we want to buy what I would call good value-creating investment. With respective to our share repurchase, all I will say is that there is a minimum amount of cash that we want to have on the balance sheet that will determine that we won't -- if we don't minimum amount of cash, we won't buy share. But to the extent that were above that amount and we are to get it, obviously, then we'll buy shares based on our assessments of whether we think it's attractive value for all of our shareholders."

And according to the good ratings that I sought, they will now become the second largest offshore drilling rig operator in the world. I've been involved in this industry eight for over 20 years, and I've seen lots of mergers and conglomerations. And this is the one industry where I can very firmly say that if you are at least of a minimum size, that you can compete with the biggest rig owners out there. And for sure, Diamond Offshore qualifies as having an upscale in order to be able to compete. When we look at the lease, it says they anticipate about $15 million of savings by putting the two companies together. Now on the one hand, $15 million is a lot of money, but on the other hand, in the context of the size and scope of the transaction, I think it's about $7.5 billion transaction. The notion that you're getting $50 million of synergy makes it plain as the reason for the transaction was not to gain those synergies. I have no doubt that Diamond Offshore can easily compete just as we have no trouble competing against Transocean and the other large offshore drilling operators."

We think carefully about strategy and the strategy that the management of acquired company sets out toward their business. We challenge them on that strategy. And then we're closely involved in the allocation of capital and the capital spending and the investment within the business. And we like to think that, that discipline look at strategy and capital allocation yields results for all of the shareholders that are beneficial over the long term. I think that was felt, for example, in the Offshore Drilling business, where we're constantly leading against the wind. When others are out buying rigs, we were instead upgrading rigs at less than half the price and half the time. We bought rigs when others didn't want to buy rigs when we bought the courage and the valor two and a half years ago. And I believe that we're able to do that because we provide for the company a long-term strategic view. We're accustomed cyclical markets and, we're accustomed to leaning against the wind.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Results for the quarter and the full year reflect growth at Boardwalk Pipeline, steady performance at CNA and some ongoing challenges facing Diamond Offshore, HighMount E&P",983,"Thank you, Darren. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Results for the quarter and the full year reflect growth at Boardwalk Pipeline, steady performance at CNA and some ongoing challenges facing Diamond Offshore, HighMount E&P and Loews Hotels. G&A reported good results for the fourth quarter benefiting from increased investment income and favorable prior year development in its core property and casualty operations. 
CNA has reported favorable prior year reserve development for 16 consecutive quarters. CNA's results for both the quarter and the full year demonstrate a strong P&C underwriting and the progress it has made on its profit-improvement strategy. CNA's underwriting discipline is demonstrated by five consecutive quarters of rate increases in the Commercial segment as well as continued strength of the Specialty segment.
CNA finished the year with a strong balance sheet and with a book value per share increasing by 13% during 2010. During the fourth quarter, however, CNA's book value per share decreased by 5%, reflecting declines in CNA's net unrealized gain position, primarily as the result of higher interest rates.
I'm sure that most everyone understand the impact of interest rates on fixed income portfolio. Nonetheless, I want to reiterate that in the future, interest rates in the U.S. could and probably will rise. And if this occurs, CNA, along with most P&C insurance companies, will likely see a negative impact on the market value of a fixed income investment portfolio, which would in turn negatively impact GAAP book value. But there is a silver lining to a higher interest rate environment, CNA will have the ability to invest its significant cash flows into higher yielding securities.
CNA finished the year with a strong capital position, which allowed it in the fourth quarter to redeem the remaining $500 million of the $1.25 billion of preferred stock that was purchased by Loews in November of '08. Additionally, given its strong capital position and solid insurance operation, CNA today announced the initiation of a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend. This action will deliver cash to CNA shareholders, including roughly $24 million to Loews in dividends in the first quarter of this year.
Turning to the offshore drilling industry. During the first quarter, Diamond Offshore announced that it entered into a contract with Hyundai Heavy Industries to build two ultra deepwater drill shafts. They are scheduled for delivery in 2013. 
These dynamically positioned drillships are designed to operate in up to 12,000 feet of water. The total cost per rig including commissioning, spares and project management is expected to be approximately $590 million. Two or three years ago, these ships would've cost more than $750 million.
To enhance its ultra deepwater capabilities and attractive capital costs over the last four years, Diamond has purchased, ordered or upgraded seven rigs capable of operating in ultra deepwaters up to 10,000 feet. Upon completion of these latest two drill ships, Diamond will have 16 deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs in its fleet. 
Diamond's results for the quarter and the full year were negatively impacted by the U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium. Although the moratorium was technically lifted in October, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has issued what I call a permatorium. It is issuing very few drilling permits, so in effect the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains under a de facto drilling ban for the foreseeable future, especially for new deepwater oil wells. Our orders for new drill ships, however, demonstrate Diamond's confidence in the strength of the international deepwater markets in the years ahead.
Moving to our natural gas E&P business. I'd like to take a moment to review the top three initiatives that HighMount will be focusing on in 2011. Since we initially formed our HighMount subsidiary in 2007, gas prices have been lower than we originally hoped or forecast. We remain optimistic however, about natural gas over the long term. But where we sit today is we have an abundant domestic gas supply and prices well under $5 per Mcf. 
Given this pricing environment, HighMount's first initiative is to optimize its base business, which is located in the Sonora Field in the Permian Basin in Texas. HighMount's second initiative is to utilize technology to exploit organic growth opportunities in the Sonora field. These technologies include increased use of horizontal drilling and 3D seismic to identify development opportunities. HighMount will continue to apply its expertise with unconventional reservoirs to identify new opportunities within the Sonora Field.
And the third initiative for HighMount in 2011 is to grow and diversify its portfolio through acquisitions. The focus would be on adding liquid to the mix, both wet gas and oil, which should offer better economics given their strong pricing relative to dry gas. Additionally, HighMount will look for opportunities to take advantage of industry cyclicalities by acquiring hydrocarbon assets at attractive prices.
At the holding company level, our cash and investments as of December 31, 2010, stood at $4.6 billion or more than $11 per Leow share. During the fourth quarter of 2010 through January of this year, we bought 2.7 million shares of Loews common stock for a total cost of $104 million. And during all of 2010 through January of this year, we bought 11.9 million shares or 2.8% of our outstanding common stock for a total cost of $442 million.
And finally in the next few weeks, a blog written by yours truly, will appear on the Loews website. The blog will give you a chance to sound off on a panel clear vision, mostly related to Loews. Stay tuned for posts on current events, taxes, frac-ing, accounting and whatever else may cross my mind. Comments and criticisms will always be welcomed, and I look forward to a lively interaction with members of the extended Loews Corp. community. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Peter Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

For the fourth quarter, Loews' net income increased to $466 million from $403 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Loews' net income increased to $1.3 billion from $564 million in 2009. Full year",1086,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews' net income increased to $466 million from $403 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Loews' net income increased to $1.3 billion from $564 million in 2009. 
Full year results included two one-time charges. 2010 results included charge of $328 million after tax in noncontrolling interest related to CNA's Loss Portfolio Transfer Agreement with National Indemnity Company. And results for 2009 included an impairment charge of $660 million after tax related to the carrying value of HighMount's natural gas and oil properties.
For the quarter, Loews' reported net investment losses of $22 million after tax and noncontrolling interest as compared to net investment gains of $46 million after tax in noncontrolling interest in last year's fourth quarter. Negatively impacting the quarter were increased losses at CNA and sales of securities resulting from continued management of portfolio risk. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a $217 million gain from the sale of CNA's common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics.
For the full year, net investment gains were $27 million after tax in noncontrolling interests compared to net investment losses of $503 million in 2009. Net investment gains in 2010 were driven by improvements in capital markets and included OTTI losses of $136 million versus OTTI losses in 2009 of $791 million, primarily consisting of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in CNA's investment portfolio. 
For the fourth quarter, CNA's contribution to Loews' operating income improved to $297 million from $182 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by increased favorable net prior year development. Additionally, investment income increased primarily from higher limited partnership income and investment shift during 2010 from lower yielding short-term and tax exempt securities to higher yielding taxable fixed maturity securities.
For the full year, CNA's contribution to Loews' operating income decreased to $609 million from $904 million in 2009. Excluding the charge associated with the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA's contribution to Loews' 2010 operating income increased to $918 million. Operating income increased due to favorable net prior year development, partially offset by decreased current accident year underwriting results, including higher catastrophe losses.
For the fourth quarter, Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income decreased to $113 million from $128 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Diamond's contribution to net income decreased to $446 million from $642 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily related to lower average day rates and utilization, which have been negatively impacted by the reduction in drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
HighMount's reported net income of $21 million for the quarter versus $35 million in the prior year fourth quarter. HighMount's net income for the full year was $77 million. 
Net income for 2009 as adjusted, excluding impairment charges of $660 million after tax was $123 million. The declines for both periods primarily resulted from the sale of non-core assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama during the second quarter of 2010.
As a result of the Michigan and Alabama asset sales, a portion of HighMount's interest rate and commodity hedging activities were no longer probable of occurring, and hedge accounting was discontinued. This resulted in an after-tax loss during the first half of 2010 of $19 million, which is reported under Corporate and Other investment gains and losses.
In the fourth quarter, HighMount's total production in the Permian Basin increased slightly to $17.5 billion cubic feet equivalent from 17.4 Bcfe in the prior year fourth quarter. However, the average realized price decreased to $6.12 per Mcfe from $7.9 per Mcfe for the same period. 
Production details for the fourth quarter 2010 are as follows: Natural gas production of 12.4 billion cubic feet at an averaged realized price of $5.93 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production of 777,000 barrels at an average realized price of $35.84 per barrel; and oil production of 66,000 barrels at an average price of $80.05 per barrel.
As of December 31, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 75.1% of its estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.35 per Mcfe and 37.4% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.65 per Mcfe. As of December 31, 2010, HighMount owned 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of net proved reserves, of which 78% were classified as proved developed.
Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' fourth quarter net income increased to $34 million from $28 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Boardwalk's contribution to net income increased to $114 million from $67 million in 2009. Boardwalk's results for the quarter and the year benefited from increased gas transportation revenues, primarily from pipeline expansion projects. 
Distributable cash flow in 2010 increased to $448 million from $314 million in 2009. Boardwalk has declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of $0.52 per unit, continuing its track record of increasing cash distributions to unitholders each quarter since its initial public offering in 2005.
Loews Hotels results for the quarter were breakeven versus a loss of $4 million in the prior year. For the full year, net income was $1 million versus a loss of $34 million in 2009. 
Results for 2009 include impairment charges of $16 million after tax related to the write down of Loews Hotels investment in a hotel property and $12 million after tax related to two hotel properties. Average room rates for the quarter increased to $225 from $217 in the prior year quarter, and occupancy increased to 67% from 62% resulting in a 13% increase in revenue per available room.
For the quarter, net investment income from Loews' trading portfolio increased to $56 million from $16 million in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, investment income was $123 million versus $113 million in 2009. Improvements were primarily from larger invested cash balances and improved performance in the trading portfolio.
As of December 31, 2010, holding company cash and investments totaled $4.6 billion. During the year, we received $720 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, $1 billion from the repayment of senior preferred stock by CNA and proceeds of $333 million from the sale of $11.5 million Boardwalk Pipeline common units in February of 2010. During 2010, we repurchased $405 million of our common stock and paid $105 million of dividends to our shareholders. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

So that's not a problem that I'm worried about. In the past, we have had more cash than we have today. Although at the time, we had more shares. So on a per-share basis, we're probably at the high point. But I still don't feel that we're drowning in cash. And I believe that over the next few quarters and years, we'll have plenty of opportunities to use that cash. The time that -- we as, by corporate philosophy, we like having a lot of cash on our balance sheet. We understand that it is a drag on return on equity and other statistics. But it's been the cash that's been on the balance sheet that's given us the opportunities to really do value-creating transaction. In a way, it allowed us to invest in CNA and Boardwalk at a time when if the markets would've been open to them, they would've been open at a very, very high price. It gave us the opportunity to buy Texas Gas Transmission in '03 and Gulf South Pipeline in '04. It allowed us to get into the Gas Exploration and Production business in '07. And going back to the 80s and early 90s, it was the cash on the balance sheet that allowed us to jump into the opportunity of buying offshore drilling rigs when nobody else wanted them. So we like to have cash and not have to go to bankers and other financiers when we want to buy what I would call, make value-creating investment. With respective to our share repurchases, all I will say is that there is a minimum amount of cash that we want to have on the balance sheet that will determine that we won't -- -- if we go below that minimum amount of cash, we would not buy share. But to the extent that we're above that amount and we are to get today obviously, then we'll buy shares based on our assessments of whether we think it's attractive value for all of our shareholders."

I've been involved in this industry for over 20 years, and I've seen lots of mergers and conglomerations. And this is the one industry where I can very firmly say that if you are at least of a minimum size, that you can compete with the biggest rig owners out there. And for sure, Diamond Offshore qualifies as having enough scale in order to be able to compete. When we look at the lease, it says they anticipate about $50 million of savings by putting the two companies together. Now on the one hand, $50 million is a lot of money, but on the other hand, in the context of the size and scope of the transaction, I think it's about $7.5 billion transaction. The notion that you're getting $50 million of synergy makes it plain as the reason for the transaction was not to gain those synergies. I have no doubt that Diamond Offshore can easily compete just as we have no trouble competing against Transocean and the other large offshore drilling operators."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Results for the quarter and the full year reflect growth at Boardwalk Pipeline, steady performance at CNA and some ongoing challenges facing Diamond Offshore, HighMount E&P and Loews Hotels. 
CNA reported good results for the fourth quarter benefiting from increased investment income and favorable prior-year development in its core property and casualty operations. CNA has reported favorable prior-year reserve development for 16 consecutive quarters. CNA's results for both the quarter and the full year demonstrate a strong P&C underwriting and the progress it has made on its profit-improvement strategy. CNA's underwriting discipline is demonstrated by five consecutive quarters of rate increases in the Commercial segment as well as continued strength of the Specialty segment.
CNA finished the year with a strong balance sheet and with a book value per share increasing by 13% during 2010. During the fourth quarter, however, CNA's book value per share decreased by 5%, reflecting declines in CNA's net unrealized gains position, primarily as the result of higher interest rates.
I'm sure that most everyone understand the impact of interest rates on fixed income portfolio. Nonetheless, I want to reiterate that in the future, interest rates in the U.S. could and probably will rise. And if this occurs, CNA, along with most P&C insurance companies, would likely see a negative impact on the market value of their fixed income investment portfolios, which would in turn negatively impact GAAP book value. But there is a silver lining to a higher interest rate environment: CNA will have the ability to invest its significant cash flows into higher-yielding securities.
CNA finished the year with a strong capital position, which allowed it in the fourth quarter to redeem the remaining $500 million of the $1.25 billion of preferred stock that was purchased by Loews in November of '08. Additionally, given its strong capital position and solid insurance operations, CNA today announced the initiation of a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend. This action will deliver cash to CNA shareholders, including roughly $24 million to Loews in dividends in the first quarter of this year.
Turning to the offshore drilling industry. During the first quarter, Diamond Offshore announced that it entered into a contract with Hyundai Heavy Industries to build two ultra-deepwater drillships. They are scheduled for delivery in 2013. 
These dynamically positioned drillships are designed to operate in up to 12,000 feet of water. The total cost per rig including commissioning, spares and project management is expected to be approximately $590 million. Two or three years ago, these ships would've cost more than $750 million.
To enhance its ultra-deepwater capabilities at attractive capital costs, over the last four years, Diamond has purchased, ordered or upgraded seven rigs capable of operating in ultra-deepwaters up to 10,000 feet. Upon completion of these latest two drillships, Diamond will have 16 deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs in its fleet. 
Diamond's results for the quarter and the full year were negatively impacted by the U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium. Although the moratorium was technically lifted in October, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has issued what I call a permatorium [ph]. It is issuing very few drilling permits, so in effect, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains under a de facto drilling ban for the foreseeable future, especially for new deepwater oil wells. Our orders for new drillships, however, demonstrate Diamond's confidence in the strength of the international deepwater markets in the years ahead.
Moving to our natural gas E&P business. I'd like to take a moment to review the top three initiatives that HighMount will be focusing on in 2011. Since we initially formed our HighMount subsidiary in 2007, gas prices have been lower than we originally hoped or forecast. We remain optimistic, however, about natural gas over the long term. But where we sit today is with an abundant domestic gas supply and prices well under $5 per Mcf. 
Given this pricing environment, HighMount's first initiative is to optimize its base business, which is located in the Sonora field in the Permian Basin in Texas. HighMount's second initiative is to utilize technology to exploit organic growth opportunities in the Sonora field. These technologies include increased use of horizontal drilling and 3D seismic to identify development opportunities. HighMount will continue to apply its expertise with unconventional reservoirs to identify new opportunities within the Sonora field.
And the third initiative for HighMount in 2011 is to grow and diversify its portfolio through acquisitions. The focus would be on adding liquids to the mix, both wet gas and oil, which should offer better economics given their strong pricing relative to dry gas. Additionally, HighMount will look for opportunities to take advantage of industry cyclicality by acquiring hydrocarbon assets at attractive prices.
At the holding company level, our cash and investments as of December 31, 2010, stood at $4.6 billion or more than $11 per Loews share. During the fourth quarter of 2010 through January of this year, we bought 2.7 million shares of Loews common stock for a total cost of $104 million. And during all of 2010 through January of this year, we bought 11.9 million shares or 2.8% of our outstanding common stock for a total cost of $442 million.
And finally in the next few weeks, a blog written by yours truly will appear on the Loews website. The blog will give me a chance to sound off on a panoply of issues, mostly related to Loews. Stay tuned for posts on current events, taxes, frac-ing, accounting and whatever else may cross my mind. Comments and criticisms will always be welcome, and I look forward to a lively interaction with members of the extended Loews Corp. community. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Peter Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

For the fourth quarter, Loews' net income increased to $466 million from $403 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Loews' net income increased to $1.3 billion from $564 million in 2009. Full year",1078,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews' net income increased to $466 million from $403 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, Loews' net income increased to $1.3 billion from $564 million in 2009. 
Full year results include a few one-time charges. 2010 results include a charge of $328 million after tax and non-controlling interests related to CNA's Loss Portfolio Transfer agreement with National Indemnity Company. And results for 2009 include an impairment charge of $660 million after tax related to the carrying value of HighMount's natural gas and oil properties.
For the quarter, Loews' reported net investment losses of $22 million after tax and non-controlling interests as compared to net investment gains of $46 million after tax and non-controlling interests in last year's fourth quarter. 
Negatively impacting the quarter were increased losses at CNA and sales of securities resulting from continued management of portfolio risk. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a $217 million gain from the sale of CNA's common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics.
For the full year, net investment gains were $27 million after tax and non-controlling interests compared to net investment losses of $503 million in 2009. Net investment gains in 2010 were driven by improvements in capital markets and included OTTI losses of $136 million versus OTTI losses in 2009 of $791 million, primarily consisting of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in CNA's investment portfolio. 
For the fourth quarter, CNA's contribution to Loews' operating income improved to $297 million from $182 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by increased favorable net prior-year development. Additionally, investment income increased primarily from higher limited partnership income and an investment shift during 2010 from lower-yielding, short-term and tax-exempt securities to higher-yielding, taxable, fixed-maturity securities.
For the full year, CNA's contribution to Loews' operating income decreased to $609 million from $904 million in 2009. Excluding the charge associated with the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA's contribution to Loews' 2010 operating income increased to $918 million. Operating income increased due to favorable net prior-year development, partially offset by decreased current accident year underwriting results, including higher catastrophe losses.
For the fourth quarter, Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income decreased to $113 million from $128 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, Diamond's contribution to net income decreased to $446 million from $642 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily related to lower average day rates and utilization, which have been negatively impacted by the reduction in drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
HighMount's reported net income of $21 million for the quarter versus $35 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. HighMount's net income for the full year was $77 million. 
Net income for 2009 as adjusted, excluding impairment charges of $660 million after tax, was $123 million. The declines for both periods primarily resulted from the sale of non-core assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama during the second quarter of 2010.
As a result of the Michigan and Alabama asset sales, a portion of HighMount's interest rate and commodity hedging activities were no longer probable of occurring and hedge accounting was discontinued. This resulted in an after-tax loss during the first half of 2010 of $19 million, which is reported under corporate and other investment gains and losses.
In the fourth quarter, HighMount's total production in the Permian Basin increased slightly to 17.5 billion cubic feet equivalent from 17.4 Bcfe in the prior-year fourth quarter. However, the average realized price decreased to $6.12 per Mcfe from $7.09 per Mcfe for the same period. 
Production details for the fourth quarter of 2010 are as follows: Natural gas production of 12.4 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.93 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production of 777,000 barrels at an average realized price of $35.84 per barrel; and oil production of 66,000 barrels at an average price of $80.05 per barrel.
As of December 31, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 75.1% of its estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.35 per Mcfe and 37.4% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.65 per Mcfe. As of December 31, 2010, HighMount owned 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of net proved reserves, of which 78% were classified as proved developed.
Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' fourth quarter net income increased to $34 million from $28 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, Boardwalk's contribution to net income increased to $114 million from $67 million in 2009. Boardwalk's results for the quarter and the year benefited from increased gas transportation revenues, primarily from pipeline expansion projects. 
Distributable cash flow in 2010 increased to $448 million from $314 million in 2009. Boardwalk has declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of $0.52 per unit, continuing its track record of increasing cash distributions to unit holders each quarter since its initial public offering in 2005.
Loews Hotels’ results for the quarter were break even versus a loss of $4 million in the prior year. For the full year, net income was $1 million versus a loss of $34 million in 2009. 
Results for 2009 included impairment charges of $16 million after tax related to the write-down of Loews Hotels’ investment in a hotel property and $12 million after tax related to two hotel properties. Average room rates for the quarter increased to $225 from $217 in the prior-year quarter, and occupancy increased to 67% from 62%, resulting in a 13% increase in revenue per available room.
For the quarter, net investment income from Loews' trading portfolio increased to $56 million from $16 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. For the full year, investment income was $123 million versus $113 million in 2009. Improvements were primarily from larger invested cash balances and improved performance in the trading portfolio.
As of December 31, 2010, holding company cash and investments totaled $4.6 billion. During the year, we received $720 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, $1 billion from the repayment of senior preferred stock by CNA and proceeds of $333 million from the sale of 11.5 million Boardwalk Pipeline common units in February of 2010. During 2010, we repurchased $405 million of our common stock and paid $105 million of dividends to our shareholders.

So for those reasons and a lot of others, at some point in time, it is inevitable that interest rates will go up. We are positioning the CNA portfolio to try to stay as short as we can but also to recognize that we have liabilities that have to be matched. 1/3 of our liabilities reflect a long-term care and other long-term liabilities that we match very close together. That's got about a 10-year duration to it.

So on a per-share basis, we're probably at the high point. But I still don't feel that we're drowning in cash. And I believe that over the next few quarters and years, we'll have plenty of opportunities to use that cash. At the time that -- by corporate philosophy, we like having a lot of cash on our balance sheet. We understand that it is a drag on return on equity and other statistics. But it's been the cash that's been on the balance sheet that's given us the opportunities to really do value-creating transactions. In a way, it allowed us to invest in CNA and Boardwalk at a time when if the markets would've been open to them, they would've been open at a very, very high price. It gave us the opportunity to buy Texas Gas Transmission in '03 and Gulf South Pipeline in '04. It allowed us to get into the Gas Exploration and Production business in '07. And going back to the 80s and early 90s, it was the cash on the balance sheet that allowed us to jump into the opportunity of buying offshore drilling rigs when nobody else wanted them. So we like to have cash and not have to go to bankers and other financiers when we want to buy what I would call -- make value-creating investment. With respective to our share repurchases, all I will say is that there is a minimum amount of cash that we want to have on the balance sheet that will determine that we won't -- -- if we go below that minimum amount of cash, we would not buy shares. But to the extent that we're above that amount, and we are to today, obviously, then we'll buy shares based on our assessment of whether we think it's attractive value for all of our shareholders."

And for sure, Diamond Offshore qualifies as having enough scale in order to be able to compete. When you look at the release, it says they anticipate about $50 million of savings by putting the two companies together. Now on the one hand, $50 million is a lot of money, but on the other hand, in the context of the size and scope of the transaction, I think it's about a $7.5 billion transaction, the notion that you're getting $50 million of synergies makes it plain that the reason for the transaction was not to gain those synergies. I have no doubt that Diamond Offshore can easily compete just as we have no trouble competing against Transocean and the other large offshore drilling operators."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earnin",712,"thank you, Darren. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earnings resulted primarily from lower average day rates of diamond offshore and a decline in earnings at. We started off 2011 with a relatively quiet first quarter, but rest assured, all of our subsidiaries are working hard towards achieving their long-term strategic goals.
While CNA reported solid results, net income for the quarter declined modestly versus the same period in 2010. CNA score Property and Casualty operations performed well, posting higher operating income for the quarter and increase in catastrophe losses was more than offset by higher investment income and improved underwriting results before catastrophes. CNA continues to improve the financial performance of its core Property and Casualty operations, while seeking to grow in its focus areas. The work that has been done over the past 2 years in gaining traction as evidenced by net written premium growth of 13% in CNA's Specialty segment in the first quarter, while rates was essentially flat.
In it's Commercial segment, CNA gained 2 points of rate as continued to push for improved pricing in risk selection. CNA has now achieved rate increases for 6 consecutive quarter's in it's Commercial segment even as it works to exit lower tier, less profitable business. By now, you have probably seen the announcement of CNA's definitive merger agreement with CNA shoring. This transaction offers compelling benefits for both companies. It will allow a minority shareholders of CNA Surety to monetize their investments at a substantial premium to the historical stock price. And for CNA, it's an opportunity to expand further its specialty franchise. CNA expects the transaction to be completed by the end of June.
In summary, we are very pleased with CNA's results. We believe that the improvements underway over the past several quarters are taking hold and that CNA is well-positioned to continue making progress on improving its financial and operational results.
Moving on to Diamond Offshore. Diamonds income for the quarter decreased as compared to 2010, primarily due to lower revenues from the decline in it s average day rates and lower utilization rates for jack-ups. However, all of prices have improved since the beginning of 2011 in markets around the world appeared to be stable to improving. In ultra-deepwater markets, there is an upward trend in day rates with indications of strong interest from the major and national oil companies. The Deepwater market shows signs of a positive trend, with market strength developing, while the midwater market is relatively flat. Diamonds exposure to the Midwater sport market is somewhat mitigated by the fact that roughly half of its midwater fleet is working in Brazil under long-term contracts. So even though earnings of Diamond have come down from cover, results nonetheless represent a pretty good quarter.
Turning now to Boardwalk pipeline partners. Today it was announced that Stan Horton has been named President of Boardwalk GP LLC effective today. And later this month, he will assume the additional role of Chief Executive Officer. Stan's background on include 10 years as President and COO shadier energy and a gaggle of leadership positions at several interstate pipeline companies. Most recently, he was the President of Cross-country Energy and Panhandle energy. It was also served as CEO of Enron Transportation Services company. We are very pleased to have a leader of Stan's caliber and experience taking over at Boardwalk.
We'd like to thank Ross Gaffer at for his 18 years of service and leadership at Boardwalk and its predecessor company, including more than 4 years as Chief Executive Officer. We wish him well as he steps down from his responsibilities as CEO.
And finally, Loews finished the first quarter of 2011 with $4.6 billion of cash and investments. So far this year, from January 1 of 2011 through April 29, we have repurchased 6.4 million shares of Loews' common stock for a total cost of approximately $273 million or approximately $42.42 to per share. But who's counting.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

Loews reported first quarter earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.99 per share in the prior year first quarter. CNA's contribution to Loews' first quarter net operating income declined to $190 million from $206 mi",728,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews reported first quarter earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.99 per share in the prior year first quarter. CNA's contribution to Loews' first quarter net operating income declined to $190 million from $206 million in the prior year quarter. Results were impacted by increased interest expense from the use of debt front part of the preferred stock redemption, as well as from costs associated with early retirement of senior notes. CNA also experienced modestly higher catastrophe losses which were partially offset by $30 million increase in net investment income primarily from Limited Partnership investments. Favorable net prior year development for the quarter was flat at $35 million as compared to the prior year quarter.
In the first quarter of 2011, realized investment gains from CNA declined to $12 million from $19 million after-tax and noncontrolling interests. In February 2011, CNA completed a $400 million debt offering and used the proceeds to prepay senior notes due in August, CNA's next major maturity is not until 2014. Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $117 million from $136 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to a decline in day rates earned across Diamond's fleet of rigs and a decline in utilization for diamonds jack up rigs. Diamond Offshore continues to feel the impact of regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the post Macondo environment and its relocated rigs to capitalize on stronger demand in international markets. These factors partially were offset by a decrease in income tax expense.
The decrease in Diamond Offshore's effective tax rate versus the prior year quarter resulted from differences in Diamond's mix of pretax earnings and losses in various international and domestic tax jurisdictions and a tax floor change. HighMount reported net income of $19 million for the first quarter versus $32 million in the prior year quarter. HighMount's operating revenues and expenses decreased primarily due to the sale of 2010 of its assets in Michigan and Alabama. As prices for natural gas have remained low, the drilling program for the Permian basin has been reduced since mid-2010 and resulted in high amounts of equivalent sales volume decreasing to 15.5 billion cubic feet equivalent from 16.6 billion cubic feet equivalent in the prior year quarter.
As of March 31st, HighMount had hedges in place to cover approximately 72% of its estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.31 per mcfe, and 40% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.64 per mcfe. For the first quarter of 2011, HighMount's production volumes and realized prices are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.6 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $6.41 per 1,000 cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production was 703,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.79 per barrel. And oil production was 61,000 barrels at an average price of $87.28 per barrel.
For pipelines contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $33 million from $38 million in the prior year quarter. Results in 2011 were impacted by higher interest expense primarily from a loans recognized in the early repayment of debt and costs incurred to repair a compressor station damaged by a fire. These impacts were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues from expansion projects completed in 2010.
In the first quarter, Loews Hotels reported higher net income of $2 million versus a net loss of $1 million in the prior year quarter, with the improvement primarily driven by Orlando properties. Revenue per available room increased to $152 from $145 in the prior year first quarter. Occupancy for the quarter increased to 67.6% from 65.3%, and average room rates increased to $225 from $221.
Holding company cash and investments as of March 31st totaled $4.6 billion. During the quarter, we received $155 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 4.4 million shares of Loews common stock for $187 million and repaid $26 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15th 2011, Loews repaid the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% ventures at maturity.
From April 1st through April 29th, we purchased an additional 2 million shares of Loews common stock for an aggregate cost of $86 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren. Darren?"

I mean, that's not a revolutionary statement. But it's on that I've really noticed. 20 and 30 years ago, there wasn't a lot of LBL firms, around there were not too many conglomerates. And so when something became available-for-sale, it was relatively easy to step in and buy it. Or even if something didn't come available-for-sale, it was, again, relatively easy to buy a business. Today, as soon as the business decides it want to sell itself for whatever reasons, unless they go to Warren Buffett, they go to an investment banker and there's an auction. And so there are lots of bidders with lots of sharp pencils and analysts who know how to work Excel, and the prices paid are usually very, very high. And so what we are seeing now is the pencils are yet even sharper and the prices are paid seemed to be yet even higher. In large part, I would imagine, because private equity firms have a lot of cash that they want to invest and there's not an awful lot that's for sale. So right now, as you might imagine, we don't see a lot of opportunity in the buyer company world. In terms of investments for our individual businesses, we are seeing opportunities. First of all, there is CNA that is spending a few hundred million dollars to buy in a minority interest in CNA surety. At Diamond Offshore, we've got investment opportunities on the order of $1 billion in buying using 2 new drill ships and we have a fill an option to buy a tool that expires later this month. And likewise, we'll see at HighMount lots of what, I would call, bite-sized investment opportunity, not companies as much as they are properties either producing or nonproducing that are for sale that could possibly be attractive acquisitions for HighMount. So I'd sum up by saying that there isn't -- we haven't yet found anything for loans Corp. to do. But having said that, we're see plenty of opportunities for our subsidiaries."

In terms of the management change at Boardwalk, as we said, Ross Gabler has been with Boardwalk and its predecessors for 18 years. He had expressed to us about 9 months ago or so a desire to retire at some point in the future. We had an extensive search process and Stan Horton quickly bubbled to the top of that search process. When we first got into the natural gas pipeline business in '03, Stan Horton was as best I could tell and legend in the industry, having run many of the Enron pipelines and put together and managed their, I would say, enviable position in the pipeline business. So if you remember, it was the pipeline business that was to be very strong, positive cash flow generating business for Enron. And Stan stayed on for a few years after Enron blew up and then went on to other things in the pipeline business. And so when his name came forth to our search process, I was very interested. And I think that Stan would be a great leader for Boardwalk. I think that he obviously has the experience in the business. He knows people in the business, customers and other pipeline operators. He has a strong understanding of MLPs and value creation. And so we're just very positive. We're happy that he is coming to Boardwalk and positive about Boardwalk's prospects under his leadership."

So thank you for",439,"Well, so you're actually very generous in your question. You could have said, Jim, you bought HighMount when natural gas prices were $8 an MCF. You looked like a hero for a year as they went to $14 and now you're a bum because they're $4. So thank you for not saying that. What happened very simply is, that something happened in the gas business that we never expected, which was that all of a sudden, technology changed and gas which had been thought to be a scarce commodity, all of a sudden became a principal commodity. now having said that, we've taken our lump for getting in at $8 at price now being at $4. Priced at $4, we're opportunities. Most of all, we're seeing some opportunities in gas, but we're also seeing opportunities and liquids. And when I talk about liquids, I'm talking about not only crude oil, but also wet gas, which includes a wholesale natural gas liquids, a number of which trade at price relative to oil, other prices relative to natural gas and as I said, we are seeing lots of opportunities in this natural gas area and also the liquids area. And assistant, before, and as I said before, we're seeing it in bite sized pieces. So I'm hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of some of those opportunities. What's going on -- what I think is going on in the natural gas business is that natural gas trades at, what I would call, crazy, a ridiculous price relative to oil. Gas trades at about a ratio of 25 to 1 to oil, notwithstanding the fact that gas should trade on a BTU basis at 6 to one. So gas is trading at about 25% to 30% per BTU of those royal trades. So gas is a very, very cheap energy commodity. And I strongly believe the statement in economics that goes, what has to happen happens. And I think that we are going to see significant increases in gas consumption just outright, but also relative to oil consumption. I think oil consumption in the United States peaked in '06 and '07 and has been flat to declining ever since an natural gas consumption has been increasing. And I think that will continue. I think we'll see continued use of natural gas as a fuel for power plant. And I think we'll see more natural gas vehicles. It is just so cheap that I think consumption will continue to increase and I think that over the longer term, gas and liquids investments in the United States should be very attractive."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earn",702,"Thank you, Darren. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earnings resulted primarily from lower average day rates at Diamond Offshore and a decline in earnings at CNA. We started off 2011 with a relatively quiet first quarter, but rest assured, all of our subsidiaries are working hard towards achieving their long-term strategic goals. 
While CNA reported solid results, net income for the quarter declined modestly versus the same period in 2010. CNA's core Property and Casualty operations performed well, posting higher operating income for the quarter and increase in catastrophe losses was more than offset by higher investment income and improved underwriting results before catastrophes. CNA continues to improve the financial performance of its core Property and Casualty operations, while seeking to grow in its focus areas. The work that has been done over the past 2 years in gaining traction is evidenced by net written premium growth of 13% in CNA's Specialty segment in the first quarter, while rate was essentially flat. 
In it's Commercial segment, CNA gained 2 points of rate as it continue to push for improved pricing and risk selection. CNA has now achieved rate increases for 6 consecutive quarters in it's Commercial segment even as it works to exit lower tier, less profitable business. By now, you have probably seen the announcement of CNA's definitive merger agreement with CNA Surety. This transaction offers compelling benefits for both companies. It will allow the minority shareholders of CNA Surety to monetize their investments at a substantial premium to the historical stock price, and for CNA, it's an opportunity to expand further its Specialty franchise. CNA expects the transaction to be completed by the end of June. 
In summary, we are very pleased with CNA's results. We believe that the improvements underway over the past several quarters are taking hold and that CNA is well positioned to continue making progress on improving its financial and operational results. 
Moving on to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's income for the quarter decreased as compared to 2010, primarily due to lower revenues from the decline in average day rates and lower utilization rates for jack-ups. However, oil prices have improved since the beginning of 2011 in water markets around the world appeared to be stable to improving. In the ultra-deepwater markets, there is an upward trend in day rates with indications of strong interest from the major and national oil companies. The deepwater market shows signs of a positive trend, with market strength developing, while the mid-water market is relatively flat. Diamond's exposure to the Mid-water sport market is somewhat mitigated by the fact that roughly half of its mid-water fleet is working in Brazil under long-term contracts. So even though earnings of Diamond have come down from deepwater, results nonetheless represent pretty good quarter. 
Turning now to Boardwalk Pipeline partners. Today it was announced that Stan Horton has been named President of Boardwalk GP, LLC effective today, and later this month, he will assume the additional role of Chief Executive Officer. Stan's background include 10 years as President and COO of shadier energy and a gaggle of leadership positions at several interstate pipeline companies. Most recently, he was the President of CrossCountry Energy and Panhandle Energy. He has also served as CEO of Enron Transportation Services Company. We are very pleased to have a leader of Stan's caliber and experience taking over at Boardwalk. 
We'd like to thank Rolf Gafvert for his 18 years of service and leadership at Boardwalk and its predecessor company, including more than 4 years as Chief Executive Officer. We wish him well as he steps down from his responsibilities as CEO. 
And finally, Loews finished the first quarter of 2011 with $4.6 billion of cash and investments. So far this year, from January 1 of 2011 through April 29, we have repurchased 6.4 million shares of Loews' common stock for a total cost of approximately $273 million or approximately $42.42 per share. But who's counting? 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

Loews reported first quarter earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.99 per share in the prior year first quarter. CNA's contribution to Loews' first quarter net operating income declined to $190 million from $206 million in the prior year quarter. Results were impacted by increased interest expense from use of debt from part of the preferred stock redemption, as well as from costs associated with early retirement of senior notes. CNA also experienced modestly higher catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by $30 million increase in net investment income primarily from limited partnership investments. Favorable net prior year development for the quarter was flat at $35 million as compared to the prior year quarter. 
In the first quarter of 2011, realized investment gains from CNA declined to $12 million from $19 million after-tax and non-controlling interests. In February 2011, CNA completed a $400 million debt offering and used the proceeds to prepay senior notes due in August, CNA's next major maturity is not until 2014. Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $117 million from $136 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to a decline in day rates earned across Diamond's fleet of rigs and a decline in utilization for Diamond's jack-up rigs. 
Diamond Offshore continues to feel the impact from regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the post-Macondo environment and its relocated rigs to capitalize on stronger demand in international markets. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense. 
The decrease in Diamond Offshore's effective tax rate versus the prior year quarter resulted from differences in Diamond's mix of pretax earnings and losses in various international and domestic tax jurisdictions and a tax floor change. HighMount reported net income of $19 million for the first quarter versus $32 million in the prior year quarter. 
HighMount's operating revenues and expenses decreased primarily due to the sale in 2010 of its assets in Michigan and Alabama. As prices for natural gas have remained low, the drilling program for the Permian basin has been reduced since mid-2010 and resulted in high amounts of equivalent sales volume decreasing to 15.5 billion cubic feet equivalent from 16.6 billion cubic feet equivalent in the prior year quarter. 
As of March 31, HighMount had hedges in place to cover approximately 72% of its estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.31 per mcfe, and 40% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.64 per mcfe. For the first quarter 2011, HighMount's production volumes and realized prices are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.6 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $6.41 per 1,000 cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production was 703,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.79 per barrel. And oil production was 61,000 barrels at an average price of $87.28 per barrel. 
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $33 million from $38 million in the prior year quarter. Results in 2011 were impacted by higher interest expense primarily from a loss recognized and the early repayment of debt and costs incurred to repair a compressor station damaged by fire. These impacts were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues from expansion projects completed in 2010. 
In the first quarter, Loews Hotels reported higher net income of $2 million versus a net loss of $1 million in the prior year quarter, with the improvement primarily driven by the Orlando properties. Revenue per available room increased to $152 from $145 in the prior year first quarter. Occupancy for the quarter increased to 67.6% from 65.3%, and average room rates increased to $225 from $221. 
Holding company cash and investments as of March 31, totaled $4.6 billion. During the quarter, we received $155 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 4.4 million shares of Loews common stock for $187 million and repaid $26 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures at maturity. 
From April 1, through April 29, we purchased an additional 2 million shares of Loews common stock for an aggregate cost of $86 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren. Darren?"

I mean, that's not a revolutionary statement. But it's one that I've really noticed. 20 and 30 years ago, there weren't a lot of LBO firms around, there were not too many conglomerates. And so when something became available for sale, it was relatively easy to step in and buy it, or even if something didn't become available for sale, it was, again, relatively easy to buy a business. Today, as soon as the business decides it want to sell itself for whatever reasons, unless they go to Warren Buffett, they go to an investment banker and there's an auction. And so there are lots of bidders with lots of sharp pencils and analysts who know how to work Excel, and the prices paid are usually very, very high. And so what we're seeing now is the pencils are yet even sharper and the prices are paid seemed to be yet even higher. In large part, I would imagine, because private equity firms have a lot of cash that they want to invest and there's not an awful lot that's for sale. So right now, as you might imagine, we don't see a lot of opportunity in the buyer company world. In terms of investments for our individual businesses, we are seeing opportunities. First of all, there is CNA that is spending a few hundred million dollars to buy in a minority interest in CNA Surety. At Diamond Offshore, we've got investment opportunities on the order of $1 billion in buying 2 new drill ships and we have a fill an option to buy a fold [ph] that expires later this month. And likewise, we'll see at HighMount lots of, what I would call bite-sized investment opportunity, not companies as much as they are properties either producing or non-producing that are for sale that could possibly be attractive acquisitions for HighMount. So I'd sum up by saying that there isn't -- we haven't yet found anything for Loews Corp. to do, but having said that, we'll see plenty of opportunities for our subsidiaries."

In terms of the management change at Boardwalk, as we said, Rolf Gafvert has been with Boardwalk and its predecessors for 18 years. He had expressed to us, about 9 months ago or so, a desire to retire at some point in the future. We had an extensive search process and Stan Horton quickly bubbled to the top of that search process. When we first got into the Natural Gas Pipeline business in '03, Stan Horton was, as best I could tell and recollect, a legend in the industry, having run many of the Enron pipelines and put together and managed their, I would say, enviable position in the pipeline business. So if you'll remember, it was the Pipeline business that was really be -- to be very strong, positive cash flow generating business for Enron. And Stan stayed on for a few years after Enron blew up and then went on to other things in the pipeline business. And so when his name came forth to our search process, I was very interested. And I think that Stan would be a great leader for Boardwalk. I think that he obviously has the experience in the business. He knows people in the business, customers and other pipeline operators. He has a strong understanding of MLPs and value creation. And so we're just very positive. We're happy that he's coming to Boardwalk and positive about Boardwalk's prospects under his leadership."

So thank you for",435,"Well, you're actually very generous in your question. You could have said, ""Jim, you bought HighMount when natural gas prices were $8 an Mcf. You looked like a hero for a year as they went to $14 and now you're a bum because they're $4."" So thank you for not saying that. What happened very simply is that something happened in the Gas business that we never expected, which was that all of a sudden, technology changed and gas, which had been thought to be a scarce commodity, all of a sudden became a principal commodity. Now having said that, we've taken our lump for getting in at $8 and the price now being at $4, and with the price at $4, we're seeing opportunities. First of all, we're seeing some opportunities in gas, but we're also seeing opportunities in liquids. And when I talk about liquids, I'm talking about not only crude oil, but also wet gas, which includes a whole slate natural gas liquids, a number of which trade at prices relative to oil, rather than prices relative to natural gas and as I said, we're seeing lots of opportunities in this natural gas area and also the liquids area. And as I said before, we're seeing that in bite-sized pieces. So I'm hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of some of those opportunities. What's going on -- what I think is going on in the natural gas business is that natural gas trades at, what I would call, a crazy, ridiculous price relative to oil. Gas trades at about a ratio of 25:1 to oil, notwithstanding the fact that gas should trade on a BTU basis at 6:1. So gas is trading at about 25% to 30% per BTU of what oil trades at. So gas is a very, very cheap energy commodity. And I strongly believe the statement in economics that goes, what has to happen happens. And I think that we are going to see significant increases in gas consumption just outright, but also relative to oil consumption. I think oil consumption in the United States peaked in '06 and '07 and has been flat to declining ever since and natural gas consumption has been increasing, and I think that will continue. I think we'll see continued use of natural gas as a fuel for power plant. And I think we'll see more natural gas vehicles. It is just so cheap that I think consumption will continue to increase and I think that over the longer term, gas and liquids investments in the United States should be very attractive."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earnin",720,"Thank you, Darren. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earnings resulted primarily from lower average day rates at Diamond Offshore and a decline in earnings at CNA. We started off 2011 with a relatively quiet first quarter, but rest assured, all of our subsidiaries are working hard towards achieving their long term strategic goals. 
While CNA reported solid results, net income for the quarter declined modestly versus the same period in 2010. CNA's core property and casualty operations performed well, posting higher operating income for the quarter.  An increase in catastrophe losses was more than offset by higher investment income and improved underwriting results before catastrophes. CNA continues to improve the financial performance of its core property and casualty operations, while seeking to grow in its focus areas. The work that has been done over the past 2 years is gaining traction is evidenced by net written premium growth of 13% in CNA's Specialty segment in the first quarter, while rate was essentially flat.
In its Commercial segment, CNA gained 2 points of rate as it continued to push for improved pricing and risk selection. CNA has now achieved rate increases for 6 consecutive quarters in its Commercial segment even as it works to exit lower tier, less profitable business. By now, you have probably seen the announcement of CNA's definitive merger agreement with CNA Surety. This transaction offers compelling benefits for both companies. It will allow the minority shareholders of CNA Surety to monetize their investment at a substantial premium to their historical stock price, and for CNA, it's an opportunity to expand further its Specialty franchise. CNA expects the transaction to be completed by the end of June. 
In summary, we are very pleased with CNA's results. We believe that the improvements underway over the past several quarters are taking hold and that CNA is well positioned to continue making progress on improving its financial and operational results. 
Moving on to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's income for the quarter decreased as compared to 2010, primarily due to lower revenues from the decline in average day rates and lower utilization rates for jack ups. However, oil prices have improved since the beginning of 2011 and water markets around the world appear to be stable to improving. In the ultra deepwater markets, there is an upward trend in day rates with indications of strong interest from the major and national oil companies. The deepwater market shows signs of a positive trend, with market strength developing, while the mid water market is relatively flat. Diamond's exposure to the mid water sport [ph] market is somewhat mitigated by the fact that roughly half of its mid water fleet is working in Brazil under long term contracts. So even though earnings at Diamond have come down from deepwater, results nonetheless represent a pretty good quarter. 
Turning now to Boardwalk Pipeline partners. Today it was announced that Stan Horton has been named President of Boardwalk GP, LLC effective today, and later this month, he will assume the additional role of Chief Executive Officer. Stan's background includes 10 years as President and COO of Cheniere Energy and a gaggle of leadership positions at several intrastate pipeline companies. Most recently, he was the President of CrossCountry Energy and Panhandle Energy. He has also served as CEO of Enron Transportation Services Company. We are very pleased to have a leader of Stan's caliber and experience taking over at Boardwalk. 
We'd like to thank Rolf Gafvert for his 18 years of service and leadership at Boardwalk and its predecessor company, including more than 4 years as Chief Executive Officer. We wish him well as he steps down from his responsibilities as CEO. 
And finally, Loews finished the first quarter of 2011 with $4.6 billion of cash and investments. So far this year, from January 1 of 2011 through April 29, we have repurchased 6.4 million shares of Loews' common stock for a total cost of approximately $273 million or approximately $42.42 per share. But who's counting? 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

Loews reported first quarter earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.99 per share in the prior year first quarter. CNA's contribution to Loews' first quarter net operating income declined to $190 million from $206 million in the prior year quarter. Results were impacted by increased interest expense from use of debt to fund part of the preferred stock redemption, as well as from costs associated with early retirement of senior notes. CNA also experienced modestly higher catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by a $30 million increase in net investment income primarily from limited partnership investments. Favorable net prior year development for the quarter was flat at $35 million as compared to the prior year quarter. 
In the first quarter of 2011, realized investment gains from CNA declined to $12 million from $19 million after tax and non controlling interests. In February 2011, CNA completed a $400 million debt offering and used the proceeds to prepay senior notes due in August. CNA's next major maturity is not until 2014. Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $117 million from $136 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to a decline in day rates earned across Diamond's fleet of rigs and a decline in utilization for Diamond's jack up rigs. 
Diamond Offshore continues to feel the impact from regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the post Macondo environment and has relocated rigs to capitalize on stronger demand in international markets. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense. 
The decrease in Diamond Offshore's effective tax rate versus the prior year quarter resulted from differences in Diamond's mix of pretax earnings and losses in various international and domestic tax jurisdictions and a tax law change. HighMount reported net income of $19 million for the first quarter versus $32 million in the prior year quarter. 
HighMount's operating revenues and expenses decreased primarily due to the sale in 2010 of its assets in Michigan and Alabama. As prices for natural gas have remained low, the drilling program for the Permian Basin has been reduced since mid 2010 and resulted in HighMount's equivalent sales volume decreasing to 15.5 billion cubic feet equivalent from 16.6 billion cubic feet equivalent in the prior year quarter. 
As of March 31, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 72% of its estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.31 per Mcfe, and 40% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.64 per Mcfe. For the first quarter 2011, HighMount's production volumes and realized prices are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.6 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $6.41 per 1,000 cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production was 703,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.79 per barrel. And oil production was 61,000 barrels at an average price of $87.28 per barrel. 
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $33 million from $38 million in the prior year quarter. Results in 2011 were impacted by higher interest expense primarily from a loss recognized on the early repayment of debt and costs incurred to repair a compressor station damaged by a fire. These impacts were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues from expansion projects completed in 2010. 
In the first quarter, Loews Hotels reported higher net income of $2 million versus a net loss of $1 million in the prior year quarter, with the improvement primarily driven by the Orlando properties. Revenue per available room increased to $152 from $145 in the prior year first quarter. Occupancy for the quarter increased to 67.6% from 65.3%, and average room rates increased to $225 from $221. 
Holding company cash and investments as of March 31, totaled $4.6 billion. During the quarter, we received $155 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, we purchased 4.4 million shares of Loews common stock for $187 million and we paid $26 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures at maturity.

I mean, that's not a revolutionary statement. But it's one that I've really noticed. 20 and 30 years ago, there weren't a lot of LBO firms around, there were not too many conglomerates. And so when something became available for sale, it was relatively easy to step in and buy it, or even if something didn't become available for sale, it was, again, relatively easy to buy a business. Today, as soon as a business decides it want to sell itself for whatever reason, unless they go to Warren Buffett, they go to an investment banker and there's an auction. And so there are lots of bidders with lots of sharp pencils and analysts who know how to work Excel, and the prices paid are usually very, very high. And so what we're seeing now is the pencils are yet even sharper and the prices paid seem to be yet even higher. In large part, I would imagine, because private equity firms have a lot of cash that they want to invest and there's not an awful lot that's for sale. So right now, as you might imagine, we don't see a lot of opportunity in the buy a company world. In terms of investments for our individual businesses, we are seeing opportunity. First of all, there's CNA that is spending a few hundred million dollars to buy in the minority interest in CNA Surety. At Diamond Offshore, we've got investment opportunities on the order of $1 billion in buying 2 new drill ships and we have a fill an option to buy a fold [ph] that expires later this month. And likewise, we'll see at HighMount lots of, what I would call bite sized investment opportunity, not companies as much as they are properties either producing or non producing that are for sale that could possibly be attractive acquisitions for HighMount. So I'd sum up by saying that there isn't    we haven't yet found anything for Loews Corp. to do, but having said that, we're seeing plenty of opportunities for our subsidiaries."

In terms of the management change at Boardwalk, as we said, Rolf Gafvert has been with Boardwalk and its predecessor for 18 years. He had expressed to us, about 9 months ago or so, a desire to retire at some point in the future. We had an extensive search process and Stan Horton quickly bubbled to the top of that search process. When we first got into the natural gas pipeline business in '03, Stan Horton was, as best I could tell and recollect, a legend in the industry, having run many of the Enron pipelines and put together and managed their, I would say, enviable position in the pipeline business. So if you'll remember, it was the pipeline business that was really the    the very strong, positive cash flow generating business for Enron. And Stan stayed on for a few years after Enron blew up and then went on to other things in the pipeline business. And so when his name came forth through our search process, I was very interested. And I think that Stan would be a great leader for Boardwalk. I think that he obviously has the experience in the business. He knows people in the business, customers and other pipeline operators. He has a strong understanding of MLPs and value creation. And so we're just very positive. We're happy that he's coming to Boardwalk and positive about Boardwalk's prospects under his leadership."

So thank you for",439,"Well, you're actually very generous in your question. You could have said, ""Jim, you bought HighMount when natural gas prices were $8 an Mcf. You looked like a hero for a year as they went to $14 and now you're a bum because they're $4."" So thank you for not saying that. What happened very simply is that something happened in the gas business that we never expected, which was that all of a sudden, technology changed and gas, which had been thought to be a scarce commodity, all of a sudden became a principal commodity. Now having said that, we've taken our lump [ph] for getting in at $8 and the price now being at $4, and with the price at $4, we're seeing opportunities. First of all, we're seeing some opportunities in gas, but we're also seeing opportunities in liquids. And when I talk about liquids, I'm talking about not only crude oil, but also wet gas, which includes a whole slate of natural gas liquids, a number of which trade at prices relative to oil, rather than prices relative to natural gas and as I said, we're seeing lots of opportunities in this natural gas area and also the liquids areas. And as I said before, we're seeing that in bite sized pieces. So I'm hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of some of those opportunities. What's going on    what I think is going on in the natural gas business is that natural gas trades at, what I would call, a crazy, ridiculous price relative to oil. Gas trades at about a ratio of 25:1 to oil, notwithstanding the fact that gas should trade on a BTU basis at 6:1. So gas is trading at about 25% to 30% per BTU of what oil trades at. So gas is a very, very cheap energy commodity. And I strongly believe the statement in economics that goes, what has to happen happens. And I think that we are going to see significant increases in gas consumption just outright, but also relative to oil consumption. I think oil consumption in the United States peaked in '06 and '07 and has been flat to declining ever since and natural gas consumption has been increasing, and I think that will continue. I think we'll see continued use of natural gas as a fuel for power plants. And I think we'll see more natural gas vehicles. It is just so cheap that I think consumption will continue to increase and I think that over the longer term, gas and liquids investments in the United States should be very attractive."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earnin",715,"Thank you, Darren. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. For the first quarter of 2011, Loews reported net income of $382 million, a decline from net income of $420 million in last year's first quarter. The decline in Loews' earnings resulted primarily from lower average day rates at Diamond Offshore and a decline in earnings at CNA. We started off 2011 with a relatively quiet first quarter, but rest assured, all of our subsidiaries are working hard towards achieving their long term strategic goals. 
While CNA reported solid results, net income for the quarter declined modestly versus the same period in 2010. CNA's core property and casualty operations performed well, posting higher operating income for the quarter.  An increase in catastrophe losses was more than offset by higher investment income and improved underwriting results before catastrophes. CNA continues to improve the financial performance of its core property and casualty operations, while seeking to grow in its focus areas. The work that has been done over the past 2 years is gaining traction is evidenced by net written premium growth of 13% in CNA's Specialty segment in the first quarter, while rate was essentially flat.
In its Commercial segment, CNA gained 2 points of rate as it continued to push for improved pricing and risk selection. CNA has now achieved rate increases for 6 consecutive quarters in its Commercial segment even as it works to exit lower tier, less profitable business. By now, you have probably seen the announcement of CNA's definitive merger agreement with CNA Surety. This transaction offers compelling benefits for both companies. It will allow the minority shareholders of CNA Surety to monetize their investment at a substantial premium to their historical stock price, and for CNA, it's an opportunity to expand further its Specialty franchise. CNA expects the transaction to be completed by the end of June. 
In summary, we are very pleased with CNA's results. We believe that the improvements underway over the past several quarters are taking hold and that CNA is well positioned to continue making progress on improving its financial and operational results. 
Moving on to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's income for the quarter decreased as compared to 2010, primarily due to lower revenues from the decline in average day rates and lower utilization rates for jack ups. However, oil prices have improved since the beginning of 2011 and water markets around the world appear to be stable to improving. In the ultra-deepwater markets, there is an upward trend in day rates with indications of strong interest from the major and national oil companies. The deepwater market shows signs of a positive trend, with market strength developing, while the mid-water market is relatively flat. Diamond's exposure to the mid-water sport [ph] market is somewhat mitigated by the fact that roughly half of its mid-water fleet is working in Brazil under long-term contracts. So even though earnings at Diamond have come down from deepwater, results nonetheless represent a pretty good quarter. 
Turning now to Boardwalk Pipeline partners. Today it was announced that Stan Horton has been named President of Boardwalk GP, LLC effective today, and later this month, he will assume the additional role of Chief Executive Officer. Stan's background includes 10 years as President and COO of Cheniere Energy and a gaggle of leadership positions at several intrastate pipeline companies. Most recently, he was the President of CrossCountry Energy and Panhandle Energy. He has also served as CEO of Enron Transportation Services Company. We are very pleased to have a leader of Stan's caliber and experience taking over at Boardwalk. 
We'd like to thank Rolf Gafvert for his 18 years of service and leadership at Boardwalk and its predecessor company, including more than 4 years as Chief Executive Officer. We wish him well as he steps down from his responsibilities as CEO. 
And finally, Loews finished the first quarter of 2011 with $4.6 billion of cash and investments. So far this year, from January 1 of 2011 through April 29, we have repurchased 6.4 million shares of Loews' common stock for a total cost of approximately $273 million or approximately $42.42 per share. But who's counting? 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

Loews reported first quarter earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.99 per share in the prior year first quarter. CNA's contribution to Loews' first quarter net operating income declined to $190 million from $206 mi",730,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews reported first quarter earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.99 per share in the prior year first quarter. CNA's contribution to Loews' first quarter net operating income declined to $190 million from $206 million in the prior year quarter. Results were impacted by increased interest expense from use of debt to fund part of the preferred stock redemption, as well as from costs associated with early retirement of senior notes. CNA also experienced modestly higher catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by a $30 million increase in net investment income primarily from limited partnership investments. Favorable net prior year development for the quarter was flat at $35 million as compared to the prior year quarter. 
In the first quarter of 2011, realized investment gains from CNA declined to $12 million from $19 million after-tax and noncontrolling interests. In February 2011, CNA completed a $400 million debt offering and used the proceeds to prepay senior notes due in August. CNA's next major maturity is not until 2014. Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $117 million from $136 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to a decline in day rates earned across Diamond's fleet of rigs and a decline in utilization for Diamond's jack up rigs. 
Diamond Offshore continues to feel the impact from regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the post Macondo environment and has relocated rigs to capitalize on stronger demand in international markets. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense. 
The decrease in Diamond Offshore's effective tax rate versus the prior year quarter resulted from differences in Diamond's mix of pretax earnings and losses in various international and domestic tax jurisdictions and a tax law change. HighMount reported net income of $19 million for the first quarter versus $32 million in the prior year quarter. 
HighMount's operating revenues and expenses decreased primarily due to the sale in 2010 of its assets in Michigan and Alabama. As prices for natural gas have remained low, the drilling program for the Permian Basin has been reduced since mid 2010 and resulted in HighMount's equivalent sales volume decreasing to 15.5 billion cubic feet equivalent from 16.6 billion cubic feet equivalent in the prior year quarter. 
As of March 31, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 72% of its estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.31 per Mcfe, and 40% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.64 per Mcfe. For the first quarter 2011, HighMount's production volumes and realized prices are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.6 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $6.41 per 1,000 cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production was 703,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.79 per barrel. And oil production was 61,000 barrels at an average price of $87.28 per barrel. 
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $33 million from $38 million in the prior year quarter. Results in 2011 were impacted by higher interest expense primarily from a loss recognized on the early repayment of debt and costs incurred to repair a compressor station damaged by a fire. These impacts were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues from expansion projects completed in 2010. 
In the first quarter, Loews Hotels reported higher net income of $2 million versus a net loss of $1 million in the prior year quarter, with the improvement primarily driven by the Orlando properties. Revenue per available room increased to $152 from $145 in the prior year first quarter. Occupancy for the quarter increased to 67.6% from 65.3%, and average room rates increased to $225 from $221. 
Holding company cash and investments as of March 31, totaled $4.6 billion. During the quarter, we received $155 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, we purchased 4.4 million shares of Loews common stock for $187 million and we paid $26 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures at maturity. 
From April 1, through April 29, we purchased an additional 2 million shares of Loews common stock for an aggregate cost of $86 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren. Darren?"

I mean, that's not a revolutionary statement. But it's one that I've really noticed. 20 and 30 years ago, there weren't a lot of LBO firms around, there were not too many conglomerates. And so when something became available for sale, it was relatively easy to step in and buy it, or even if something didn't become available for sale, it was, again, relatively easy to buy a business. Today, as soon as a business decides it want to sell itself for whatever reason, unless they go to Warren Buffett, they go to an investment banker and there's an auction. And so there are lots of bidders with lots of sharp pencils and analysts who know how to work Excel, and the prices paid are usually very, very high. And so what we're seeing now is the pencils are yet even sharper and the prices paid seem to be yet even higher. In large part, I would imagine, because private equity firms have a lot of cash that they want to invest and there's not an awful lot that's for sale. So right now, as you might imagine, we don't see a lot of opportunity in the buy a company world. In terms of investments for our individual businesses, we are seeing opportunity. First of all, there's CNA that is spending a few hundred million dollars to buy in the minority interest in CNA Surety. At Diamond Offshore, we've got investment opportunities on the order of $1 billion in buying 2 new drill ships and we have a fill an option to buy a fold [ph] that expires later this month. And likewise, we'll see at HighMount lots of, what I would call bite-sized investment opportunity, not companies as much as they are properties either producing or nonproducing that are for sale that could possibly be attractive acquisitions for HighMount. So I'd sum up by saying that there isn't we haven't yet found anything for Loews Corp. to do, but having said that, we're seeing plenty of opportunities for our subsidiaries."

And right now, those opportunities happen to be in the energy area. So we're happy to take on those investments where we feel we can earn a significant return for not only the subsidiaries but also for Loews as a shareholder in those subsidiaries. In terms of the management change at Boardwalk, as we said, Rolf Gafvert has been with Boardwalk and its predecessor for 18 years. He had expressed to us, about 9 months ago or so, a desire to retire at some point in the future. We had an extensive search process and Stan Horton quickly bubbled to the top of that search process. When we first got into the natural gas pipeline business in '03, Stan Horton was, as best I could tell and recollect, a legend in the industry, having run many of the Enron pipelines and put together and managed their, I would say, enviable position in the pipeline business. So if you'll remember, it was the pipeline business that was really the the very strong, positive cash flow generating business for Enron. And Stan stayed on for a few years after Enron blew up and then went on to other things in the pipeline business. And so when his name came forth through our search process, I was very interested. And I think that Stan would be a great leader for Boardwalk. I think that he obviously has the experience in the business. He knows people in the business, customers and other pipeline operators. He has a strong understanding of MLPs and value creation. And so we're just very positive. We're happy that he's coming to Boardwalk and positive about Boardwalk's prospects under his leadership."

You could have said, ""Jim, you bought HighMount when natural gas prices were $8 an Mcf. You looked like a hero for a year as they went to $14 and now you're a bum because they're $4."" So thank you for",439,"Well, you're actually very generous in your question. You could have said, ""Jim, you bought HighMount when natural gas prices were $8 an Mcf. You looked like a hero for a year as they went to $14 and now you're a bum because they're $4."" So thank you for not saying that. What happened very simply is that something happened in the gas business that we never expected, which was that all of a sudden, technology changed and gas, which had been thought to be a scarce commodity, all of a sudden became a principal commodity. Now having said that, we've taken our lump [ph] for getting in at $8 and the price now being at $4, and with the price at $4, we're seeing opportunities. First of all, we're seeing some opportunities in gas, but we're also seeing opportunities in liquids. And when I talk about liquids, I'm talking about not only crude oil, but also wet gas, which includes a whole slate of natural gas liquids, a number of which trade at prices relative to oil, rather than prices relative to natural gas and as I said, we're seeing lots of opportunities in this natural gas area and also the liquids areas. And as I said before, we're seeing that in bite sized pieces. So I'm hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of some of those opportunities. What's going on    what I think is going on in the natural gas business is that natural gas trades at, what I would call, a crazy, ridiculous price relative to oil. Gas trades at about a ratio of 25:1 to oil, notwithstanding the fact that gas should trade on a BTU basis at 6:1. So gas is trading at about 25% to 30% per BTU of what oil trades at. So gas is a very, very cheap energy commodity. And I strongly believe the statement in economics that goes, what has to happen happens. And I think that we are going to see significant increases in gas consumption just outright, but also relative to oil consumption. I think oil consumption in the United States peaked in '06 and '07 and has been flat to declining ever since and natural gas consumption has been increasing, and I think that will continue. I think we'll see continued use of natural gas as a fuel for power plants. And I think we'll see more natural gas vehicles. It is just so cheap that I think consumption will continue to increase and I think that over the longer term, gas and liquids investments in the United States should be very attractive."

In the second quarter, Loews' net income decreased to $262 million from $366 million in 2010. The decline is mainly attributable to two factors at CNA. First, there was a lower level of favorable net prior year your reserve development than in 2010, and second, CNA posted higher catastrophe losses during the quarter than during the second quarter of 2010. CNA continued to make progress growing and improving the underlying performance of its core property and casualty operations despite the natural catastrophe losses affecting the industry during the second quarter. Net written premiums grew by over 5% in CNA's core P&C operations. Growth in both the specialty and commercial segments was driven by new business and higher retention in targeted industry segments, in P&C operations rates increased by 1% versus the prior year quarter.
Further expanding its specialty franchise, on June 10, CNA completed the acquisition of the minority share of the CNA surety, increasing the profitable specialty business. We continue to believe that CNA and its surety business will benefit from the strategic realignment. This quarter, CNA reported favorable net prior year development of $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, the 18th consecutive quarter, during which it released reserves. In the prior year quarter, CNA recorded net prior year development of $665 million up before tax and noncontrolling interest, hence the year-over-year decline.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's results reflect an increase in average utilization of high spec floaters versus the prior year quarter, although this was part partially offset by decline in contract-only revenues from mid-quarter and jack-up fleet. Results for the quarter benefited from high spec floaters, which result returned to work following Macondo accident. One of these rigs remains in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico of the other two were mobilized in international markets.
This year, Diamond has ordered 3 new ultra Deepwater drill ships that were designed in operations opted 12,000 feet of water. During the second quarter, Diamond announced that it's entered into five-year charters for the first 2 drill ships. Used charters is expected to generate combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion when the rigs begin working in 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, Diamond recently announced 10 new contracts that are expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue and that represent over 14 years of contract drilling backlog. The addition of these new contracts brings total revenue backlog as of July 21, to over $8.6 billion, and extending through 2019.
Our Boardwalk Pipeline partners, the company increased revenues over the prior year period primarily from continued growth from its expansion projects and strength in the power generation and industrial markets. Boardwalk's new CEO, Stan Horton, has now been on board for about 100 days, and we are pleased with the progress that's underway. Earlier today, on the Boardwalk Earnings Call, Stan enumerated a growth strategy that includes strengthening the company's existing pipeline of assets by connecting new supply and markets to its system. Boardwalk will continue its efforts to diversify further into midstream sector via gathering and processor, but it will also consider opportunities outside of the traditional natural gas sector that could help diversify its business mix. The goal over the next several years is to strengthen its traditional pipeline business while diversify its product and services. Boardwalk will work for organic growth and acquisition opportunities that are accretive, and that do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.
Since going public in '05, Boardwalk has increased its cash distribution each and every quarter. Today, it continued that streak, declaring a dis of $0.25 1/2.
Moving on to HighMount E&P. HighMount's net income increased significantly versus the prior year quarter, although the comparison was relatively easy due to a number of one-time factors related to the sale of assets in the Antrim shale in the Black Warrior Basin last year. HighMount remains focused on exploring more of liquids-rich resources in resource while working to improve the performance of the base business in the Sonora field. Additionally, HighMount will continue looking for opportunities to grow its asset base organically and through acquisitions.
And finally, Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $4.3 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $228 million or about $41.89 per share. Year-to-date, through July 28, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total cost of $455 million.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income decreased to $103 million in the second quarter from $247 million in the prior year quarter. As Jim stated, favorable net prior year development was $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, but declined year-over-year compared to favorable net prior year development of $265 million in the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, CNA's pre-tax catastrophe losses increased to $100 million from $48 million of the same period 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 related primarily to domestic storms and the earthquake in Japan.
CNA's realized investment gains were unchanged versus the prior-year second quarter, totaling $12 million after tax and noncontrolling interest. Diamond Offshore contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $125 million from $104 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in average utilization of its high specification floaters, partially offset by a decline in contract drilling revenues earned by the remainder of its fleet. Contract drilling expenses increased with the addition of normal operation cost for Diamond's newest rig, the Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically.
Partially offsetting increased drilling costs were lower income tax expenses.
HighMount E&P's operating income for the  quarter increased to $15 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year comparison includes a number of nonrecurring items related to the sale in 2010 of assets in the Antrim shale and Black Warrior Basin. HighMount's operating revenues, as well as expenses, decreased versus the prior year quarter due to the sale of assets. Operating revenues for HighMount's Permian Basin assets increased by $3 million versus last year's second quarter owing to higher average realized prices despite a decline of production volumes resulted from lower drilling activity. HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the second quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.53 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 671,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.72 per barrel; and oil production was 82,000 barrels at an average price of $97.28 per barrel. As of June 30, HighMount has hedges in place that cover approximately 76% of total estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.27 per Mcfe, and 53% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.48 per Mcfe.
For the quarter, HighMount's interest expense decreased reflecting the partial repayment of its outstanding term loan with proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, results in the prior-year second quarter included higher tax expense that was incurred as result of the write off deferred taxes in connection with asset sales. Also as a result of asset sales in the second quarter of last year, HighMount recorded an after-tax charge of $11 million related to discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions.
Moving on to Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk's conservation to net income for the quarter decreased to $5 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter. This decline primarily resulted from a $28 million pretax impairment charge associated with Boardwalks position to dispose of a portion of its inventory of large diameter pipeline supplies.
Boardwalk reported higher gas transportation revenues versus the prior quarter stemming from capacity increases from completion of several compression projects in 2010, and operation operating of the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity. This growth was partially offset by a decline in park and loan and storage revenues cost by unfavorable natural gas price spreads.
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels reported net income of $6 million versus $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Hotels continue to benefit from ongoing strike at our Orlando properties.
In the second quarter, revenue per available room increased to $175.59 from $152.82 in the prior year quarter. Holding company cash and investments as of June 30 totaled $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $158 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 228 million of Loews, stock and we pay $25 million of dividends to our shareholders.
On April 15, 2011, Loews paid at maturity the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures. From July 1, 2011 through July 28, we acquired an additional $41 million of our common stock.

As you mentioned, we do also have the financial discipline, and the to make these acquisitions, and my belief is if we can do some of these, we can do some of these acquisitions. It will not only be beneficial to HighMount but also beneficial to Loews, and that we will be able to invest our cash at very attractive rates of return."

In the second quarter, Loews' net income decreased to $252 million from $366 million in 2010. 
The decline is mainly attributable to 2 factors at CNA. First, there was a lower level of favorable net prior year reserve development than in 2010; and second, CNA posted higher catastrophe losses during the quarter than during the second quarter of 2010. CNA continued to make progress growing and improving the underlying performance of its core property and casualty operations despite the natural catastrophe losses affecting the industry during the second quarter. Net written premiums grew by over 5% in CNA's core P&C operations. Growth in both the specialty and commercial segments was driven by new business and higher retention in targeted industry segments. In P&C operations, rate increased by 1% versus the prior year quarter.
Further expanding its specialty franchise, on June 10, CNA completed the acquisition of the minority shares of the CNA Surety, increasing the scale of the company's profitable specialty business. We continue to believe that CNA and its surety business will benefit from this strategic realignment. 
This quarter, CNA reported favorable net prior year development of $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, the 18th consecutive quarter during which it released reserves. In the prior year quarter, CNA recorded net prior year development of $265 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, hence the year-over-year decline.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's results reflect an increase in average utilization of high-spec floaters versus the prior year quarter, although this was partially offset by decline in contract drilling revenues from mid-water and jack up fleet. Results for the quarter benefited from 3 high-spec floaters returning to work after being idle during the second quarter of last year following the Macondo accident. One of these rigs remains in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the other 2 were mobilized in international markets.
This year, Diamond has ordered 3 new ultra-deepwater drill ships that are designed in operations in up to 12,000 feet of water. During the second quarter, Diamond announced that it's entered into 5-year charters for the first 2 drill ships. These charters are expected to generate combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion when the rigs begin working in 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, Diamond recently announced 10 new contracts that are expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. And that represents over 14 years of contract drilling backlog. The addition of these new contracts brings total revenue backlog, as of July 21, to over $8.6 billion, and extending through 2019.
At Boardwalk Pipeline partners, the company increased revenues over the prior year period, primarily from continued growth from its expansion projects and strength in the power generation and industrial markets. Boardwalk's new CEO, Stan Horton, has now been on board for about 100 days, and we are pleased with the progress that's underway. Earlier today, on the Boardwalk Earnings Call, Stan enumerated a growth strategy that includes strengthening the company's existing pipeline assets by connecting new supplies and markets to its system. 
Boardwalk will continue its efforts to diversify further into midstream sector via gathering and processing, but would also consider opportunities outside of the traditional natural gas sector that could help diversify its business mix. The goal over the next several years is to strengthen its traditional pipeline business while diversifying its product and services. Boardwalk will look for organic growth and acquisition opportunities that are accretive and that do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.  
Since going public in '05, Boardwalk has increased its cash distribution each and every quarter. Today, it continued that streak, declaring a distribution of $0.255.
Moving on to HighMount E&P. HighMount's net income increased significantly versus the prior year quarter, although the comparison was relatively easy due to a number of onetime factors related to the sale of assets in the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin last year. HighMount remains focused on exploring for more liquids-rich resources in existing lead holes [ph] while working to improve the performance of its base business in the Sonora field. Additionally, HighMount will continue looking for opportunities to grow its asset base organically and through acquisitions.
And finally, Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $4.3 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $228 million or about $41.89 per share. Year-to-date through July 28, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total cost of $455 million.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income decreased to $103 million in the second quarter from $247 million in the prior year quarter. As Jim stated, favorable net prior year development was $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, but declined year-over-year compared to favorable net prior year development of $265 million in the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, CNA's pre-tax catastrophe losses increased to $100 million from $48 million of the same period in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 related primarily to domestic storms and the earthquake in Japan. CNA's realized investment gains were unchanged versus the prior year second quarter, totaling $12 million after tax and noncontrolling interest. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $125 million from $104 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in average utilization of its high specification floaters, partially offset by a decline in contract drilling revenues earned by the remainder of its fleet. Contract drilling expenses increased with the addition of normal operating cost for Diamond's newest rig, the Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Partially offsetting increased drilling costs were lower income tax expenses.
HighMount E&P's operating income for the  quarter increased to $15 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year comparison includes a number of nonrecurring items related to the sale in 2010 of assets in the Antrim Shale and Black Warrior Basin. HighMount's operating revenues, as well as expenses, decreased versus the prior year quarter due to the sale of assets. Operating revenues for HighMount's Permian Basin assets increased by $3 million versus last year's second quarter, owing to higher average realized prices despite a decline of production volumes resulted from lower drilling activity. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the second quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.53 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 671,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.72 per barrel; and oil production was 82,000 barrels at an average price of $97.28 per barrel. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 76% of total estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.27 per Mcfe, and 53% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.48 per Mcfe.
For the quarter, HighMount's interest expense decreased, reflecting the partial repayment of its outstanding term loan with proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, results in the prior year second quarter included higher tax expense that was incurred as result of the write off of deferred taxes in connection with asset sales. Also as a result of the asset sales in the second quarter of last year, HighMount recorded an after-tax charge of $11 million related to discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions.
Moving on to Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $5 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter. This decline primarily resulted from a $28 million pretax impairment charge associated with Boardwalk's decision to dispose of a portion of its inventory of large-diameter pipeline supplies.
Boardwalk reported higher gas transportation revenues versus the prior year quarter, stemming from capacity increases from completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operation of the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity. This growth was partially offset by a decline in park and loan and storage revenues caused by unfavorable natural gas price spreads.
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels reported net income of $6 million versus $4 million in the prior year quarter. Hotels continued to benefit from ongoing strength at our Orlando properties. In the second quarter, revenue per available room increased to $175.59 from $152.82 in the prior year quarter. 
Holding company cash and investments as of June 30 totaled $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $158 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 228 million of Loews common stock, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid at maturity the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures. From July 1, 2011 through July 28, we acquired an additional $41 million of our common stock.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

Nothing has come to fruition yet. But in fact, there is a lot to look at. And the things that we're looking at primarily are buying rights to leases on land for both -- we're both looking at gas, gas liquids and oil. And there are, in fact, lots of transactions that take place in the oil patch in these types of acquisitions, and there are plenty of them around. We are looking for transactions that will return for us what I would call significant double-digit after-tax returns. And I would say that we've come close on a few times but still haven't finalized anything. But I think we do have the opportunity to do so. I think that what HighMount brings to the table is a very good, very disciplined approach to finding and developing hydrocarbons under the ground. And combined with that, combined with having the right people, as you mentioned, we do also have the financial discipline and the wherewithal to make these acquisitions. And my belief is if we can do some of these, it will be -- some of these acquisitions, it will be not only beneficial to HighMount, but also beneficial to Loews, in that we will be able to invest our cash at very attractive rates of return."

In the second quarter, Loews' net income decreased to $252 million from $366 million in 2010. 
The decline is mainly attributable to 2 factors at CNA. First, there was a lower level of favorable net prior year reserve development than in 2010; and second, CNA posted higher catastrophe losses during the quarter than during the second quarter of 2010. CNA continued to make progress growing and improving the underlying performance of its core property and casualty operations despite the natural catastrophe losses affecting the industry during the second quarter. Net written premiums grew by over 5% in CNA's core P&C operations. Growth in both its specialty and commercial segments was driven by new business and higher retention in targeted industry segments. In P&C operations, rate increased by 1% versus the prior year quarter.
Further expanding its specialty franchise, on June 10, CNA completed the acquisition of the minority shares of the CNA Surety, increasing the scale of the company's profitable specialty business. We continue to believe that CNA and its surety business will benefit from this strategic realignment. 
This quarter, CNA reported favorable net prior year development of $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, the 18th consecutive quarter during which it released reserves. In the prior year quarter, CNA recorded favorable net prior year development of $265 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, hence the year-over-year decline.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's results reflect an increase in average utilization of high-spec floaters versus the prior year quarter, although this was partially offset by decline in contract drilling revenues from mid-water and jack up fleet. Results for the quarter benefited from 3 high-spec floaters returning to work after being idle during the second quarter of last year following the Macondo accident. One of these rigs remains in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the other 2 were mobilized in international markets.
This year, Diamond has ordered 3 new ultra-deepwater drill ships that are designed for operations in up to 12,000 feet of water. During the second quarter, Diamond announced that it entered into 5-year charters for the first 2 drill ships. These charters are expected to generate combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion when the rigs begin working in 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, Diamond recently announced 10 new contracts that are expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. And that represents over 14 years of contract drilling backlog. The addition of these new contracts brings total revenue backlog, as of July 21, to over $8.6 billion, and extending through 2019.
At Boardwalk Pipeline partners, the company increased revenues over the prior year period, primarily from continued growth from its expansion projects and strength in the power generation and industrial markets. Boardwalk's new CEO, Stan Horton, has now been on board for about 100 days, and we are pleased with the progress that's underway. Earlier today, on the Boardwalk Earnings Call, Stan enumerated a growth strategy that includes strengthening the company's existing pipeline assets by connecting new supplies and markets to its system. 
Boardwalk will continue its efforts to diversify further into midstream sector via gathering and processing, but would also consider opportunities outside of the traditional natural gas sector that could help diversify its business mix. The goal over the next several years is to strengthen its traditional pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk will look for organic growth and acquisition opportunities that are accretive and that do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.  
Since going public in '05, Boardwalk has increased its cash distribution each and every quarter. Today, it continued that streak, declaring a distribution of $0.255.
Moving on to HighMount E&P. HighMount's net income increased significantly versus the prior year quarter, although the comparison was relatively easy due to a number of onetime factors related to the sale of assets in the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin last year. HighMount remains focused on exploring for more liquids with rich resources in existing lead holes [ph] while working to improve the performance of its base business in the Sonora field. Additionally, HighMount will continue looking for opportunities to grow its asset base organically and through acquisitions.
And finally, Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $4.3 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $228 million or about $41.89 per share. Year-to-date through July 28, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total cost of $455 million.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings",783,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income decreased to $103 million in the second quarter from $247 million in the prior year quarter. As Jim stated, favorable net prior year development was $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, but declined year-over-year compared to favorable net prior year development of $265 million in the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, CNA's pretax catastrophe losses increased to $100 million from $48 million of the same period in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 related primarily to domestic storms and the earthquake in Japan. CNA's realized investment gains were unchanged versus the prior year second quarter, totaling $12 million after tax and noncontrolling interest. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $125 million from $104 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in average utilization of its high specification floaters, partially offset by a decline in contract drilling revenues earned by the remainder of its fleet. Contract drilling expenses increased with the addition of normal operating cost for Diamond's newest rig, the Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Partially offsetting increased drilling costs were lower income tax expenses.
HighMount E&P's operating income for the quarter increased to $15 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year comparison includes a number of nonrecurring items related to the sale in 2010 of assets in the Antrim Shale and Black Warrior Basin. HighMount's operating revenues, as well as expenses, decreased versus the prior year quarter due to the sale of assets. Operating revenues for HighMount's Permian Basin assets increased by $3 million versus last year's second quarter, owing to higher average realized prices despite the decline of production volumes resulted from lower drilling activity. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the second quarter are as follows: natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.53 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 671,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.72 per barrel; and oil production was 82,000 barrels at an average price of $97.28 per barrel. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 76% of total estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.27 per Mcfe, and 53% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.48 per Mcfe.
For the quarter, HighMount's interest expense decreased, reflecting the partial repayment of its outstanding term loan with proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, results in the prior year second quarter included higher tax expense that was incurred as result of the write off of deferred taxes in connection with the asset sales. Also as a result of the asset sales in the second quarter of last year, HighMount recorded an after-tax charge of $11 million related to discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions.
Moving on to Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $5 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter. This decline primarily resulted from a $28 million pretax impairment charge associated with Boardwalk's decision to dispose of a portion of its inventory of large-diameter pipeline supplies.
Boardwalk reported higher gas transportation revenues versus the prior year quarter, stemming from capacity increases from completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operation of the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity. This growth was partially offset by a decline in park and loan and storage revenues caused by unfavorable natural gas price spreads.
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels reported net income of $6 million versus $4 million in the prior year quarter. Hotels continued to benefit from ongoing strength at our Orlando properties. In the second quarter, revenue per available room increased to $175.59 from $152.82 in the prior year quarter. 
Holding company cash and investments as of June 30 totaled $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $158 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 228 million of Loews common stock, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid at maturity the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures. From July 1, 2011 through July 28, we acquired an additional $41 million of our common stock.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

We are looking for transactions that will return for us what I would call significant double-digit after-tax returns. And I would say that we've come close on a few times but still haven't finalized anything. But I think we do have the opportunity to do so. I think that what HighMount brings to the table is a very good, very disciplined approach to finding and developing hydrocarbons under the ground.

We're not doing it because it's the corporate vogue, but rather because we think that it creates very good long-term value for all our shareholders.

In the second quarter, Loews' net income decreased to $252 million from $366 million in 2010. 
The decline is mainly attributable to 2 factors at CNA. First, there was a lower level of favorable net prior year reserve development than in 2010; and second, CNA posted higher catastrophe losses during the quarter than during the second quarter of 2010. CNA continued to make progress growing and improving the underlying performance of its core property and casualty operations despite the natural catastrophe losses affecting the industry during the second quarter. Net written premiums grew by over 5% in CNA's core P&C operations. Growth in both its specialty and commercial segments was driven by new business and higher retention in targeted industry segments. In P&C operations, rate increased by 1% versus the prior year quarter.
Further expanding its specialty franchise, on June 10, CNA completed the acquisition of the minority shares of the CNA Surety, increasing the scale of the company's profitable specialty business. We continue to believe that CNA and its surety business will benefit from this strategic realignment. 
This quarter, CNA reported favorable net prior year development of $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, the 18th consecutive quarter during which it released reserves. In the prior year quarter, CNA recorded favorable net prior year development of $265 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, hence the year-over-year decline.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's results reflect an increase in average utilization of high-spec floaters versus the prior year quarter, although this was partially offset by decline in contract drilling revenues from mid-water and jack up fleet. Results for the quarter benefited from 3 high-spec floaters returning to work after being idle during the second quarter of last year following the Macondo accident. One of these rigs remains in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the other 2 were mobilized in international markets.
This year, Diamond has ordered 3 new ultra-deepwater drill ships that are designed for operations in up to 12,000 feet of water. During the second quarter, Diamond announced that it entered into 5-year charters for the first 2 drill ships. These charters are expected to generate combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion when the rigs begin working in 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, Diamond recently announced 10 new contracts that are expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. And that represents over 14 years of contract drilling backlog. The addition of these new contracts brings total revenue backlog, as of July 21, to over $8.6 billion, and extending through 2019.
At Boardwalk Pipeline partners, the company increased revenues over the prior year period, primarily from continued growth from its expansion projects and strength in the power generation and industrial markets. Boardwalk's new CEO, Stan Horton, has now been on board for about 100 days, and we are pleased with the progress that's underway. Earlier today, on the Boardwalk Earnings Call, Stan enumerated a growth strategy that includes strengthening the company's existing pipeline assets by connecting new supplies and markets to its system. 
Boardwalk will continue its efforts to diversify further into midstream sector via gathering and processing, but would also consider opportunities outside of the traditional natural gas sector that could help diversify its business mix. The goal over the next several years is to strengthen its traditional pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk will look for organic growth and acquisition opportunities that are accretive and that do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.  
Since going public in '05, Boardwalk has increased its cash distribution each and every quarter. Today, it continued that streak, declaring a distribution of $0.255.
Moving on to HighMount E&P. HighMount's net income increased significantly versus the prior year quarter, although the comparison was relatively easy due to a number of onetime factors related to the sale of assets in the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin last year. HighMount remains focused on exploring for more liquids with rich resources in existing lead holes [ph] while working to improve the performance of its base business in the Sonora field. Additionally, HighMount will continue looking for opportunities to grow its asset base organically and through acquisitions.
And finally, Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $4.3 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $228 million or about $41.89 per share. Year-to-date through July 28, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total cost of $455 million.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings",783,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income decreased to $103 million in the second quarter from $247 million in the prior year quarter. As Jim stated, favorable net prior year development was $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, but declined year-over-year compared to favorable net prior year development of $265 million in the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, CNA's pretax catastrophe losses increased to $100 million from $48 million of the same period in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 related primarily to domestic storms and the earthquake in Japan. CNA's realized investment gains were unchanged versus the prior year second quarter, totaling $12 million after tax and noncontrolling interest. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $125 million from $104 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in average utilization of its high specification floaters, partially offset by a decline in contract drilling revenues earned by the remainder of its fleet. Contract drilling expenses increased with the addition of normal operating cost for Diamond's newest rig, the Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Partially offsetting increased drilling costs were lower income tax expenses.
HighMount E&P's operating income for the quarter increased to $15 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year comparison includes a number of nonrecurring items related to the sale in 2010 of assets in the Antrim Shale and Black Warrior Basin. HighMount's operating revenues, as well as expenses, decreased versus the prior year quarter due to the sale of assets. Operating revenues for HighMount's Permian Basin assets increased by $3 million versus last year's second quarter, owing to higher average realized prices despite the decline of production volumes resulted from lower drilling activity. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the second quarter are as follows: natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.53 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 671,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.72 per barrel; and oil production was 82,000 barrels at an average price of $97.28 per barrel. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 76% of total estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.27 per Mcfe, and 53% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.48 per Mcfe.
For the quarter, HighMount's interest expense decreased, reflecting the partial repayment of its outstanding term loan with proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, results in the prior year second quarter included higher tax expense that was incurred as result of the write off of deferred taxes in connection with the asset sales. Also as a result of the asset sales in the second quarter of last year, HighMount recorded an after-tax charge of $11 million related to discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions.
Moving on to Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $5 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter. This decline primarily resulted from a $28 million pretax impairment charge associated with Boardwalk's decision to dispose of a portion of its inventory of large-diameter pipeline supplies.
Boardwalk reported higher gas transportation revenues versus the prior year quarter, stemming from capacity increases from completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operation of the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity. This growth was partially offset by a decline in park and loan and storage revenues caused by unfavorable natural gas price spreads.
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels reported net income of $6 million versus $4 million in the prior year quarter. Hotels continued to benefit from ongoing strength at our Orlando properties. In the second quarter, revenue per available room increased to $175.59 from $152.82 in the prior year quarter. 
Holding company cash and investments as of June 30 totaled $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $158 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 228 million of Loews common stock, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid at maturity the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures. From July 1, 2011 through July 28, we acquired an additional $41 million of our common stock.

In the second quarter, Loews' net income decreased to $252 million from $366 million in 2010. 
The decline is mainly attributable to 2 factors at CNA. First, there was a lower level of favorable net prior year reserve development than in 2010; and second, CNA posted higher catastrophe losses during the quarter than during the second quarter of 2010. CNA continued to make progress growing and improving the underlying performance of its core property and casualty operations despite the natural catastrophe losses affecting the industry during the second quarter. Net written premiums grew by over 5% in CNA's core P&C operations. Growth in both its specialty and commercial segments was driven by new business and higher retention in targeted industry segments. In P&C operations, rate increased by 1% versus the prior-year quarter.
Further expanding its specialty franchise, on June 10, CNA completed the acquisition of the minority shares of CNA Surety, increasing the scale of the company's profitable specialty business. We continue to believe that CNA and its surety business will benefit from the strategic realignment. 
This quarter, CNA reported favorable net prior-year development of $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, the 18th consecutive quarter during which it released reserves. In the prior-year quarter, CNA recorded favorable net prior-year development of $265 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, hence the year-over-year decline.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's results reflect an increase in average utilization of high-spec floaters versus the prior-year quarter, although this was partially offset by decline in contract drilling revenues from the mid-water and jack up fleets. Results for the quarter benefited from 3 high-spec floaters returning to work after being idle during the second quarter of last year following the Macondo accident. One of these rigs remains in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the other 2 were mobilized in international markets.
This year, Diamond has ordered 3 new ultra-deepwater drillships that are designed for operations in up to 12,000 feet of water. During the second quarter, Diamond announced that it entered into 5-year charters for the first 2 drillships. These charters are expected to generate combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion when the rigs begin working in 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, Diamond recently announced 10 new contracts that are expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. And that represents over 14 years of contract drilling backlog. The addition of these new contracts brings total revenue backlog, as of July 21, to over $8.6 billion and extending through 2019.
At Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, the company increased revenues over the prior-year period, primarily from continued growth from its expansion projects and strength in the power generation and industrial markets. Boardwalk's new CEO, Stan Horton, has now been on board for about 100 days, and we are pleased with the progress that's underway. Earlier today, on the Boardwalk earnings call, Stan enumerated a growth strategy that includes strengthening the company's existing pipeline assets by connecting new supplies and markets to its system. 
Boardwalk will continue its efforts to diversify further into midstream sector via gathering and processing but would also consider opportunities outside of the traditional natural gas sector that could help diversify its business The goal over the next several years is to strengthen its traditional pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk will look for organic growth and acquisition opportunities that are accretive and that do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.  
Since going public in '05, Boardwalk has increased its cash distribution each and every quarter. Today, it continued that streak, declaring a distribution of $0.255.
Moving on to HighMount E&P. HighMount's net income increased significantly versus the prior-year quarter, although the comparison was relatively easy due to a number of onetime factors related to the sale of assets in the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin last year. HighMount remains focused on exploring for more liquids-rich resources in its existing leaseholds while working to improve the performance of its base business in the Sonora field. Additionally, HighMount will continue looking for opportunities to grow its asset base organically and through acquisitions.
And finally, Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $4.3 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $228 million or about $41.89 per share. Year-to-date through July 28, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total cost of $455 million.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior-year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income decreased to $103 million in the second quarter from $247 million in the prior-year quarter. As Jim stated, favorable net prior-year development was $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest but declined year-over-year compared to favorable net prior-year development of $265 million in the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, CNA's pretax catastrophe losses increased to $100 million from $48 million for the same period in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 related primarily to domestic storms and the earthquake in Japan. CNA's realized investment gains were unchanged versus the prior year's second quarter, totaling $12 million after tax and noncontrolling interest. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $125 million from $104 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in average utilization of its high specification floaters, partially offset by a decline in contract drilling revenues earned by the remainder of its fleet. Contract drilling expenses increased with the addition of normal operating cost for Diamond's newest rig, the Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Partially offsetting increased drilling costs were lower income tax expenses.
HighMount E&P's operating income for the quarter increased to $15 million from $5 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year comparison includes a number of nonrecurring items related to the sale in 2010 of assets in the Antrim Shale and Black Warrior Basin. HighMount's operating revenues, as well as expenses, decreased versus the prior-year quarter due to the sale of assets. Operating revenues for HighMount's Permian Basin assets increased by $3 million versus last year's second quarter, owing to higher average realized prices despite the decline of production volumes resulted from lower drilling activity. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the second quarter are as follows: natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.53 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 671,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.72 per barrel; and oil production was 82,000 barrels at an average price of $97.28 per barrel. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 76% of total estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.27 per Mcfe, and 53% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.48 per Mcfe.
For the quarter, HighMount's interest expense decreased, reflecting the partial repayment of its outstanding term loan with proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, results in the prior year second quarter included higher tax expense that was incurred as result of the write off of deferred taxes in connection with the asset sales. Also as a result of the asset sales in the second quarter of last year, HighMount recorded an after-tax charge of $11 million related to discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions.
Moving on to Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $5 million from $21 million in the prior-year quarter. This decline primarily resulted from a $28 million pretax impairment charge associated with Boardwalk's decision to dispose of a portion of its inventory of large-diameter pipeline supplies.
Boardwalk reported higher gas transportation revenues versus the prior-year quarter, stemming from capacity increases from completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operation of the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity. This growth was partially offset by a decline in park and loan and storage revenues caused by unfavorable natural gas price spreads.
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels reported net income of $6 million versus $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Hotels continued to benefit from ongoing strength at our Orlando properties. In the second quarter, revenue per available room increased to $175.59 from $152.82 in the prior-year quarter. 
Holding company cash and investments as of June 30 totaled $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $158 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 228 million of Loews common stock, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid at maturity the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures. From July 1, 2011 through July 28, we acquired an additional $41 million of our common stock.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

We are looking for transactions that will return for us what I would call significant double-digit after-tax returns. And I would say that we've come close on a few times but still haven't finalized anything. But I think we do have the opportunity to do so. I think that what HighMount brings to the table is a very good, very disciplined approach to finding and developing hydrocarbons under the ground. And combined with that -- combined with having the right people, as you mentioned, we do also have the financial discipline and the wherewithal to make these acquisitions. And my belief is if we can do some of these, it will be -- some of these acquisitions, it will be not only beneficial to HighMount, but also beneficial to Loews, in that we'll be able to invest our cash at very attractive rates of return."

In the second quarter, Loews' net income decreased to $252 million from $366 million in 2010. 
The decline is mainly attributable to 2 factors at CNA. First, there was a lower level of favorable net prior year reserve development than in 2010; and second, CNA posted higher catastrophe losses during the quarter than during the second quarter of 2010. CNA continued to make progress growing and improving the underlying performance of its core property and casualty operations despite the natural catastrophe losses affecting the industry during the second quarter. Net written premiums grew by over 5% in CNA's core P&C operations. Growth in both its specialty and commercial segments was driven by new business and higher retention in targeted industry segments. In P&C operations, rate increased by 1% versus the prior-year quarter.
Further expanding its specialty franchise, on June 10, CNA completed the acquisition of the minority shares of CNA Surety, increasing the scale of the company's profitable specialty business. We continue to believe that CNA and its surety business will benefit from the strategic realignment. 
This quarter, CNA reported favorable net prior-year development of $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, the 18th consecutive quarter during which it released reserves. In the prior-year quarter, CNA recorded favorable net prior-year development of $265 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, hence the year-over-year decline.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's results reflect an increase in average utilization of high-spec floaters versus the prior-year quarter, although this was partially offset by decline in contract drilling revenues from the mid-water and jack up fleets. Results for the quarter benefited from 3 high-spec floaters returning to work after being idle during the second quarter of last year following the Macondo accident. One of these rigs remains in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the other 2 were mobilized in international markets.
This year, Diamond has ordered 3 new ultra-deepwater drillships that are designed for operations in up to 12,000 feet of water. During the second quarter, Diamond announced that it entered into 5-year charters for the first 2 drillships. These charters are expected to generate combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion when the rigs begin working in 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, Diamond recently announced 10 new contracts that are expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. And that represents over 14 years of contract drilling backlog. The addition of these new contracts brings total revenue backlog, as of July 21, to over $8.6 billion and extending through 2019.
At Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, the company increased revenues over the prior-year period, primarily from continued growth from its expansion projects and strength in the power generation and industrial markets. Boardwalk's new CEO, Stan Horton, has now been on board for about 100 days, and we are pleased with the progress that's underway. Earlier today, on the Boardwalk earnings call, Stan enumerated a growth strategy that includes strengthening the company's existing pipeline assets by connecting new supplies and markets to its system. 
Boardwalk will continue its efforts to diversify further into midstream sector via gathering and processing but would also consider opportunities outside of the traditional natural gas sector that could help diversify its business The goal over the next several years is to strengthen its traditional pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk will look for organic growth and acquisition opportunities that are accretive and that do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.  
Since going public in '05, Boardwalk has increased its cash distribution each and every quarter. Today, it continued that streak, declaring a distribution of $0.255.
Moving on to HighMount E&P. HighMount's net income increased significantly versus the prior-year quarter, although the comparison was relatively easy due to a number of onetime factors related to the sale of assets in the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin last year. HighMount remains focused on exploring for more liquids-rich resources in its existing leaseholds while working to improve the performance of its base business in the Sonora field. Additionally, HighMount will continue looking for opportunities to grow its asset base organically and through acquisitions.
And finally, Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $4.3 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $228 million or about $41.89 per share. Year-to-date through July 28, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total cost of $455 million.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior-year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings",772,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior-year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income decreased to $103 million in the second quarter from $247 million in the prior-year quarter. As Jim stated, favorable net prior-year development was $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest but declined year-over-year compared to favorable net prior-year development of $265 million in the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, CNA's pretax catastrophe losses increased to $100 million from $48 million for the same period in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 related primarily to domestic storms and the earthquake in Japan. CNA's realized investment gains were unchanged versus the prior year's second quarter, totaling $12 million after tax and noncontrolling interest. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $125 million from $104 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in average utilization of its high specification floaters, partially offset by a decline in contract drilling revenues earned by the remainder of its fleet. Contract drilling expenses increased with the addition of normal operating cost for Diamond's newest rig, the Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Partially offsetting increased drilling costs were lower income tax expenses.
HighMount E&P's operating income for the quarter increased to $15 million from $5 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year comparison includes a number of nonrecurring items related to the sale in 2010 of assets in the Antrim Shale and Black Warrior Basin. HighMount's operating revenues, as well as expenses, decreased versus the prior-year quarter due to the sale of assets. Operating revenues for HighMount's Permian Basin assets increased by $3 million versus last year's second quarter, owing to higher average realized prices despite the decline of production volumes resulted from lower drilling activity. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the second quarter are as follows: natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.53 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 671,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.72 per barrel; and oil production was 82,000 barrels at an average price of $97.28 per barrel. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 76% of total estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.27 per Mcfe, and 53% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.48 per Mcfe.
For the quarter, HighMount's interest expense decreased, reflecting the partial repayment of its outstanding term loan with proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, results in the prior year second quarter included higher tax expense that was incurred as result of the write off of deferred taxes in connection with the asset sales. Also as a result of the asset sales in the second quarter of last year, HighMount recorded an after-tax charge of $11 million related to discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions.
Moving on to Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $5 million from $21 million in the prior-year quarter. This decline primarily resulted from a $28 million pretax impairment charge associated with Boardwalk's decision to dispose of a portion of its inventory of large-diameter pipeline supplies.
Boardwalk reported higher gas transportation revenues versus the prior-year quarter, stemming from capacity increases from completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operation of the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity. This growth was partially offset by a decline in park and loan and storage revenues caused by unfavorable natural gas price spreads.
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels reported net income of $6 million versus $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Hotels continued to benefit from ongoing strength at our Orlando properties. In the second quarter, revenue per available room increased to $175.59 from $152.82 in the prior-year quarter. 
Holding company cash and investments as of June 30 totaled $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $158 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 228 million of Loews common stock, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid at maturity the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures. From July 1, 2011 through July 28, we acquired an additional $41 million of our common stock.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

Nothing has come to fruition yet. But in fact, there is a lot to look at.

And there, in fact, are lots of transactions that take place in the oil patch in these types of acquisitions, and there are plenty of them around. We are looking for transactions that will return for us what I would call significant double-digit after-tax returns. And I would say that we've come close on a few times but still haven't finalized anything. But I think we do have the opportunity to do so. I think that what HighMount brings to the table is a very good, very disciplined approach to finding and developing hydrocarbons under the ground. And combined with that -- combined with having the right people, as you mentioned, we do also have the financial discipline and the wherewithal to make these acquisitions. And my belief is if we can do some of these, it will be -- some of these acquisitions, it will be not only beneficial to HighMount, but also beneficial to Loews, in that we'll be able to invest our cash at very attractive rates of return."

In the second quarter, Loews' net income decreased to $252 million from $366 million in 2010. 
The decline is mainly attributable to 2 factors at CNA. First, there was a lower level of favorable net prior year reserve development than in 2010; and second, CNA posted higher catastrophe losses during the quarter than during the second quarter of 2010. CNA continued to make progress growing and improving the underlying performance of its core property and casualty operations despite the natural catastrophe losses affecting the industry during the second quarter. Net written premiums grew by over 5% in CNA's core P&C operations. Growth in both its specialty and commercial segments was driven by new business and higher retention in targeted industry segments. In P&C operations, rate increased by 1% versus the prior-year quarter.
Further expanding its specialty franchise, on June 10, CNA completed the acquisition of the minority shares of CNA Surety, increasing the scale of the company's profitable specialty business. We continue to believe that CNA and its surety business will benefit from the strategic realignment. 
This quarter, CNA reported favorable net prior-year development of $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, the 18th consecutive quarter during which it released reserves. In the prior-year quarter, CNA recorded favorable net prior-year development of $265 million before tax and noncontrolling interest, hence the year-over-year decline.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond's results reflect an increase in average utilization of high-spec floaters versus the prior-year quarter, although this was partially offset by decline in contract drilling revenues from the mid-water and jack up fleets. Results for the quarter benefited from 3 high-spec floaters returning to work after being idle during the second quarter of last year following the Macondo accident. One of these rigs remains in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the other 2 were mobilized in international markets.
This year, Diamond has ordered 3 new ultra-deepwater drillships that are designed for operations in up to 12,000 feet of water. During the second quarter, Diamond announced that it entered into 5-year charters for the first 2 drillships. These charters are expected to generate combined revenues of approximately $1.8 billion when the rigs begin working in 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, Diamond recently announced 10 new contracts that are expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. And that represents over 14 years of contract drilling backlog. The addition of these new contracts brings total revenue backlog, as of July 21, to over $8.6 billion and extending through 2019.
At Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, the company increased revenues over the prior-year period, primarily from continued growth from its expansion projects and strength in the power generation and industrial markets. Boardwalk's new CEO, Stan Horton, has now been on board for about 100 days, and we are pleased with the progress that's underway. Earlier today, on the Boardwalk earnings call, Stan enumerated a growth strategy that includes strengthening the company's existing pipeline assets by connecting new supplies and markets to its system. 
Boardwalk will continue its efforts to diversify further into midstream sector via gathering and processing but would also consider opportunities outside of the traditional natural gas sector that could help diversify its business The goal over the next several years is to strengthen its traditional pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk will look for organic growth and acquisition opportunities that are accretive and that do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.  
Since going public in '05, Boardwalk has increased its cash distribution each and every quarter. Today, it continued that streak, declaring a distribution of $0.255.
Moving on to HighMount E&P. HighMount's net income increased significantly versus the prior-year quarter, although the comparison was relatively easy due to a number of onetime factors related to the sale of assets in the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin last year. HighMount remains focused on exploring for more liquids-rich resources in its existing leaseholds while working to improve the performance of its base business in the Sonora field. Additionally, HighMount will continue looking for opportunities to grow its asset base organically and through acquisitions.
And finally, Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $4.3 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $228 million or about $41.89 per share. Year-to-date through July 28, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total cost of $455 million.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior-year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings",772,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Loews Corporation's earnings per share declined to $0.62 from $0.87 in the prior-year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower results from CNA and partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income decreased to $103 million in the second quarter from $247 million in the prior-year quarter. As Jim stated, favorable net prior-year development was $72 million before tax and noncontrolling interest but declined year-over-year compared to favorable net prior-year development of $265 million in the second quarter of 2010.
For the quarter, CNA's pretax catastrophe losses increased to $100 million from $48 million for the same period in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 related primarily to domestic storms and the earthquake in Japan. CNA's realized investment gains were unchanged versus the prior year's second quarter, totaling $12 million after tax and noncontrolling interest. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $125 million from $104 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in average utilization of its high specification floaters, partially offset by a decline in contract drilling revenues earned by the remainder of its fleet. Contract drilling expenses increased with the addition of normal operating cost for Diamond's newest rig, the Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Partially offsetting increased drilling costs were lower income tax expenses.
HighMount E&P's operating income for the quarter increased to $15 million from $5 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year comparison includes a number of nonrecurring items related to the sale in 2010 of assets in the Antrim Shale and Black Warrior Basin. HighMount's operating revenues, as well as expenses, decreased versus the prior-year quarter due to the sale of assets. Operating revenues for HighMount's Permian Basin assets increased by $3 million versus last year's second quarter, owing to higher average realized prices despite the decline of production volumes resulted from lower drilling activity. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the second quarter are as follows: natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.53 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 671,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.72 per barrel; and oil production was 82,000 barrels at an average price of $97.28 per barrel. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 76% of total estimated 2011 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.27 per Mcfe, and 53% of estimated 2012 production at an equivalent price of $5.48 per Mcfe.
For the quarter, HighMount's interest expense decreased, reflecting the partial repayment of its outstanding term loan with proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, results in the prior year second quarter included higher tax expense that was incurred as result of the write off of deferred taxes in connection with the asset sales. Also as a result of the asset sales in the second quarter of last year, HighMount recorded an after-tax charge of $11 million related to discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions.
Moving on to Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $5 million from $21 million in the prior-year quarter. This decline primarily resulted from a $28 million pretax impairment charge associated with Boardwalk's decision to dispose of a portion of its inventory of large-diameter pipeline supplies.
Boardwalk reported higher gas transportation revenues versus the prior-year quarter, stemming from capacity increases from completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operation of the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity. This growth was partially offset by a decline in park and loan and storage revenues caused by unfavorable natural gas price spreads.
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels reported net income of $6 million versus $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Hotels continued to benefit from ongoing strength at our Orlando properties. In the second quarter, revenue per available room increased to $175.59 from $152.82 in the prior-year quarter. 
Holding company cash and investments as of June 30 totaled $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $158 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, repurchased 228 million of Loews common stock, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. On April 15, 2011, Loews repaid at maturity the outstanding principal amount of $175 million to retire the 8.9% debentures. From July 1, 2011 through July 28, we acquired an additional $41 million of our common stock.

Loews reported net income of $163 million for this year's third quarter compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2010. Results for the prior year quarter included a",1100,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and thanks for joining us on our call today. Loews reported net income of $163 million for this year's third quarter compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2010. Results for the prior year quarter included a $328 million after-tax charge related to CNA's agreement to cede its legacy, specialist and solution liabilities to a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Excluding that charge, net income for the quarter decreased by $202 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily from the 3 factors: One, decreased limited partnerships investment results that CNA; two, lower performance of equity-based investment in the Loews holding company portfolio; and three, higher natural catastrophe losses at CNA.
Setting aside these factors, our subsidiaries delivered solid performance in their operations. At CNA, the growth strategies that has been put in place are resulting in continued improvement in the fundamental of its core property and casualty operations. The increased net written premium has marked the third consecutive quarter of topline growth, which was driven by strong new business and high retention. Along with this growth trend, CNA continues to achieve rate improvement, particularly in its commercial segment.
Third quarter combined ratios before catastrophes and development improved for both specialty and commercial, while the property and casualty business segment benefited from its 19th consecutive quarter of favorable loss reserve development. CNA remains confident in the overall adequacy of this reserve, and will continue to maintain its disciplined reserving practices.
Despite the good operating performance in its property and casualty operations, CNA's results were negatively impacted by the performance of its limited partnership investment. LP losses were driven by negative equity market return during the quarter combined with widening credit spreads and overall capital market volatility. Although CNA's portfolio of limited partnership investments can create earnings volatility, it continues to be an attractive investment strategy for CNA. These holdings have limited equity like returns over the years, there's less volatility and higher absolute returns than in equity portfolio.
Given the LP results in the quarter, it might be helpful to review how these LP investments has performed over a longer timeframe by repeating some performance that CNA disclosed on its call earlier today. CNA's LP portfolio produced a third quarter return of negative 3.7%, while the S&P 500 total return was negative 13.9%. Over the last 10 years, CNA's LP investments produced an annualized return of approximately 8% compared to a 3% total return for the S&P 500. So as you can see, over the longer term, the hedge fund portfolio has provided this return especially in light of the prevailing low yield in other asset classes.
Turning now to Boardwalk. On board is CEO for about 2 quarters now, Boardwalk is in full growth mode. Last quarter, Boardwalk enumerated a growth strategy that included expanding existing pipeline assets to connect to new supplies and markets. Two weeks ago, Boardwalk announced that it has won a joint venture with an affiliate of its general partner, which is owned by Loews. The new JV has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pedal Gas Storage and Hattiesburg Gas Storage from enterprise products partners for $550 million. Pedal and Hattiesburg operate 7 high-deliverability sulfur natural gas storage cabins located in Mississippi. These assets are a great addition to Boardwalk's pipeline footprint. The facilities are anchored by the long-term fund agreement with approximately 80% of the existing customer base being either electric or natural gas utilities. The location of the storage assets are very desirable, and when combined with the existing assets, Boardwalk expects numerous opportunities for synergies and growth. Loews will contribute $280 million of the joint venture's equity for an 80% ownership interest, and Boardwalk will contribute $70 million for 20% ownership. An additional $200 million will be raised by the JV through a 5-year bank loan. At a later date, if it makes economic sense, Loews' 80% ownership interest can be dropped down from Boardwalk in one or more transaction.
Within its field business, Boardwalk has also announced a new gathering pipeline in the Marcellus shale. This new project is expected to cost approximately $90 million, and will be build out over the several years. It is anchored by a 15-year fee-based contract with Southwestern Energy. Marcellus is likely to become a very significant supply basin for the United States, and Boardwalk hopes to identify and execute on additional opportunities in the Marcellus area in the future. 
Additionally, Boardwalk has received regulatory approval to turn some of its assets in South Texas into a rich-gas system in order to transport liquids-rich natural gas on the Eagle Ford region. The project is expected to be completed by year end, and while Boardwalk has not announced any firm commitment, it is seeing interest from the producer community. Boardwalk's goal over the next several years is to strengthen its position of pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk is working hard to identify organic growth opportunities and other acquisition opportunities that are accretive, and do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.
Turning now to HighMount. I'd like to give an update on its most recent acquisition. As of today, HighMount has completed the purchase of working interest in oil and gas properties located on approximately 70,000 net acres in Oklahoma. These properties are mostly undeveloped, and HighMount believes that they contain primarily oil and liquids reserves that can be produced through horizontal drilling. The purchase price of $106 million was funded with a capital contribution from Loews. There are a few key points to the investment rationale: First, we believe there is a large upside potential in this oil resource play. HighMount will be able to drill nearly 600 wells, which will should have favorable single-well economics. Second, the resource opportunity will focus on the Mississippi line and Woodford shale. The Mississippi line has been reasonably derisked by development on and surrounding the properties. Third, while we remain bullish on natural gas over the longer term, these properties should help to the diversify HighMount's reserves, which consists almost entirely of natural gas and liquids. And fourth, HighMount will control operations over 82% of the leasehold, and the continuous makeup of the acreage creates operational efficiency. The resource opportunity fits well with HighMount's core technical competencies. While this acquisition is not a game changer in terms of its magnitude, it is a significant step in HighMount's overall growth strategy. HighMount will continue to look for other value-creating opportunities.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income was $84 million in the third quarter. In the prior year quarter, CNA contributed an operating loss of $140 million, or when adjusted for the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA contributed operating income of $169 million in the prior year quarter.
Net operating income in CNA casualty operations declined primarily because of lower net investment income than higher catastrophe losses. Net investment income for the 3 months ended September 20, 2011 decreased by $187 million pretax as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily driven by the previously discussed decrease in the limited partnership results, as well as lower fixed maturities security income. In the third quarter, CNA reported catastrophe losses of $29 million after tax and noncontrolling interest as compared to $7 million for the same period in 2010.
P&C operations produced the third quarter combined ratio of 99.1% versus 98% in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impacts of prior year development and catastrophe losses, combined ratios were 101% and 103.7% for the comparable periods.
For the quarter, CNA reported realized investment losses of $15 million after tax and noncontrolling interest versus realized investment gains of $37 million in the prior year quarter.
Diamond Offshore's contribution for the net income for the quarter increased to $121 million from $93 million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of an increase in contract drilling revenues. Results for the third quarter of 2011 reflect the return to service of 3 of Diamond Offshore's high-specification floaters, that are idle during the second quarter of 2010 following the Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Also the newest addition to Diamond Offshore's floater fleet, the Ocean Valor, began generating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 when it commenced to operating under contract in Brazil. Contract drilling expense increased by $41 million and included normal operating cost for the Ocean Valor, as well as the increased amortized mobilization cost and higher cost associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically.
Additionally, Diamond Offshore recognized a pretax gain of $31 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the sale of the Ocean Shield. Also benefiting Diamond's results for the quarter was a lower effective tax rate as compared to 2010 period.
HighMount's operating income for the quarter decreased to $16 million from $19 million in the prior quarter due to decreased sales volumes stemming from the reduction in HighMount's drilling activity. Average prices realized per Mcfe were $6.22 in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $5.80 in the 2010 period. Operating expenses increased by $2 million in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the 2010 period primarily due to increased DD&A expenses related to negative reserve revisions in December 2010 and projected future development cost.
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the third quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.73 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 664,000 barrels at an average realized price of $40.57 per barrel. Oil production was 68,000 barrels at an average price of $82.67 per barrel. As of September 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 77% and 54% of total estimated 2011 and 2012 natural gas equivalent production at a weighted average price of $6.28 and $5.51 per Mcfe respectively.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $18 million from $21 million the prior year quarter. The decrease in net income versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to higher interest expense from a loss in the early extinguishment of debt. Additionally, Boardwalk reported higher operation and maintenance expense related to integrity management and reliability spending. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues resulting from increased capacities from the completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operating at Fayette Lateral at its designed capacity.
Loews Hotels reported breakeven results for the third quarter versus the loss of $2 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue per available room increased to $161.76 from the third quarter from $143.89 in the prior year quarter, reflecting improved occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of September 30 totaled $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $275 million. We received $154 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we have made a capital contribution to HighMount of $106 million, and we also anticipate making an equity contribution of approximately $280 million for an equity ownership interest in the joint venture discussed in the call today. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

Loews reported net income of $162 million for this year's third quarter compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2010. Results for the prior year quarter included a",1108,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and thanks for joining us on our call today. Loews reported net income of $162 million for this year's third quarter compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2010. Results for the prior year quarter included a $328 million after-tax charge related to CNA's agreement to cede its legacy, specialist and solution liabilities to a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Excluding that charge, net income for the quarter decreased by $202 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily from 3 factors: one, decreased limited partnership investment results at CNA; two, lower performance of equity-based investment in the Loews holding company portfolio; and three, higher natural catastrophe losses at CNA.
Setting aside these factors, our subsidiaries delivered solid performance in their operation. At CNA, the growth strategies that has been put in place are resulting in continued improvement in the fundamental of its core property and casualty operation. Increased net written premium has marked the third consecutive quarter of topline growth, which was driven by strong new business and high retention. Along with this growth trend, CNA continues to achieve rate improvement particularly in its commercial segment.
Third quarter combined ratios before catastrophes and development improved for both specialty and commercial, while the property and casualty business segment benefited from its 19th consecutive quarter of favorable loss reserve development. CNA remains confident in the overall adequacy of its reserve and will continue to maintain its disciplined reserving practices.
Despite the good operating performance in its property and casualty operation, CNA's results were negatively impacted by the performance of its limited partnership investment. LP losses were driven by negative equity market return during the quarter, combined with widening credit spreads and overall capital market volatility. Although CNA's portfolio of limited partnership investment can create earnings volatility, it continues to be an attractive investment strategy for CNA. These holdings have noted equity like returns over the years with less volatility and higher absolute returns than in equity portfolio.
Given the LP results for the quarter, it might be helpful to review how these LP investments have performed over a longer timeframe by repeating some performance figures that CNA disclosed on its call earlier today. CNA's LP portfolio produced a third quarter return of negative 3.7%, while the S&P 500 total return was negative 13.9%. Over the last 10 years, CNA's LP investments produced an annualized return of approximately 8% compared to a 3% total return for the S&P 500. So as you can see, over the longer term, the hedge fund portfolio has provided good return especially in light of the prevailing low yield in other asset classes.
Turning now to Boardwalk. With Stan Horton on board as CEO for about 2 quarters now, Boardwalk is in full growth mode. Last quarter, Boardwalk enumerated a growth strategy that included expanding its existing pipeline assets to connect to new supplies and markets. Two weeks ago, Boardwalk announced that it has won a joint venture with an affiliate of its general partner, which is owned by Loews. The new JV has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Petal Gas Storage and Hattiesburg Gas Storage from Enterprise Products Partners for $550 million. Petal and Hattiesburg operate 7 high deliverability salt dome natural gas storage caverns located in Mississippi. These assets are a great addition to Boardwalk's pipeline footprint. The facilities are anchored by the long-term fund agreement with approximately 80% of the existing customer base being either electric or natural gas utilities. The location and types of the storage assets are very desirable, and when combined with existing assets, Boardwalk expects numerous opportunities for synergy and growth. 
Loews will contribute $280 million of the joint venture's equity for an 80% ownership interest, and Boardwalk will contribute $70 million for 20% ownership. An additional $200 million will be raised by the JV through a 5-year bank loan. At a later date, if it makes economic sense, Loews' 80% ownership interest can be dropped down from Boardwalk in one or more transaction.
Within its field services business, Boardwalk has also announced a new gathering pipeline in the Marcellus shale. This new project is expected to cost approximately $90 million and will be built out over several years. It is anchored by a 15-year fee-based contract with Southwestern Energy. Marcellus is likely to become a very significant supply basin for the United States, and Boardwalk hopes to identify and execute on additional opportunities in the Marcellus area in the future. 
Additionally, Boardwalk has received regulatory approval to turn some of its assets in South Texas into a rich gas system in order to transport liquids rich natural gas out of the Eagle Ford region. The project is expected to be completed by year end, and while Boardwalk has not announced any firm commitment, it is seeing interest from the producer community. Boardwalk's goal over the next several years is to strengthen its position of pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk is working hard to identify organic growth opportunities and other acquisition opportunities that are accretive and do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.
Turning now to HighMount. I'd like to give an update on its most recent acquisition. As of today, HighMount has completed the purchase of working interest in oil and gas properties located on approximately 70,000 net acres in Oklahoma. These properties are mostly undeveloped, and HighMount believes that they contain primarily oil and liquids reserves that can be produced through horizontal drilling. The purchase price of $106 million was funded with a capital contribution from Loews. There are a few key points to the investment rationale: First, we believe there is a large upside potential in this oil resource play. HighMount will be able to drill nearly 600 wells, which will should have favorable single-well economics. Second, the resource opportunity will focus on the Mississippian line and Woodford Shale. The Mississippian line has been reasonably de-risked by development on and surrounding the properties. Third, while we remain bullish on natural gas over the longer term, these properties should help to diversify HighMount's reserves, which consists almost entirely of natural gas and liquids. And fourth, HighMount will control operations over 82% of the leasehold, and the continuous makeup of the acreage creates operational efficiency. The resource opportunity fits well with HighMount's core technical competencies. While this acquisition is not a game changer in terms of its magnitude, it is a significant step in HighMount's overall growth strategy. HighMount will continue to look for other value-creating opportunities.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"
285930,141454975,181031,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2011",2011-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation reported earnings of $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the charge associated with CNA's Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction in 2010, earnings for the prior year third qu",892,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation reported earnings of $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the charge associated with CNA's Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction in 2010, earnings for the prior year third quarter would have been $0.87 per share rather than the reported $0.09 per share. This decline in results versus the adjusted number was primarily due to lower results from CNA and lower investment income in the holding company portfolio but was partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. 
CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income was $84 million in the third quarter. In the prior year quarter, CNA contributed an operating loss of $140 million, or when adjusted for the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA contributed operating income of $169 million in the prior year quarter. Net operating income in CNA's core property and casualty operations declined primarily because of lower net investment income than higher catastrophe losses.  
Net investment income for the 3 months ended September 20, 2011 decreased by $187 million pretax as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily driven by the previously discussed decrease in limited partnership results, as well as lower fixed maturity security income. In the third quarter, CNA reported catastrophe losses of $29 million after tax and noncontrolling interest as compared to $7 million for the same period in 2010.
P&C operations produced a third quarter combined ratio of 99.1% versus 98% in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impacts of prior year development and catastrophe losses, combined ratios were 101% and 103.7% for the comparable periods.
For the quarter, CNA reported realized investment losses of $15 million after tax and noncontrolling interest versus realized investment gains of $37 million in the prior year quarter. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution of net income for the quarter increased to $121 million from $93 million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of an increase in contract drilling revenues. Results for the third quarter of 2011 reflect the return to service of 3 of Diamond Offshore's high-specification floaters that were idled during the second quarter of 2010 following the Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Also, the newest addition to Diamond Offshore's floater fleet, the Ocean Valor, began generating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 when it commenced to operating under contract in Brazil. Contract drilling expense increased by $41 million and included normal operating cost for the Ocean Valor, as well as the increased amortized mobilization cost and higher cost associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically.  Additionally, Diamond Offshore recognized a pretax gain of $31 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the sale of the Ocean Shield. Also benefiting Diamond's results for the quarter was a lower effective tax rate as compared with the 2010 period.
HighMount's operating income for the quarter decreased to $16 million from $19 million in the prior quarter due to decreased sales volumes stemming from the reduction in HighMount's drilling activity. Average prices realized per Mcfe were $6.22 in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $5.80 in the 2010 period. Operating expenses increased by $2 million in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the 2010 period primarily due to increased DD&A expenses related to negative reserve revisions in December 2010 and projected future development cost.
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the third quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 11.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.73 per thousand cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production was 664,000 barrels at an average realized price of $40.57 per barrel. Oil production was 68,000 barrels at an average price of $82.67 per barrel. As of September 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 77% and 54% of total estimated 2011 and 2012 natural gas equivalent production at a weighted average price of $6.28 and $5.51 per Mcfe, respectively.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $18 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net income versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to higher interest expense from a loss in the early extinguishment of debt. Additionally, Boardwalk reported higher operation and maintenance expense related to integrity management and reliability spending. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues resulting from increased capacities from the completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operating at Fayetteville Lateral at its designed capacity.
Loews Hotels reported breakeven results for the third quarter versus the loss of $2 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue per available room increased to $161.76 from the third quarter from $143.89 in the prior year quarter, reflecting improved occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of September 30 totaled $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $275 million. We received $154 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we have made a capital contribution to HighMount of $106 million, and we also anticipate making an equity contribution of approximately $280 million for an equity ownership interest in the joint venture discussed in the call today. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

285930,141454975,181181,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2011",2011-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and thanks for joining us on our call today. Loews reported net income of $162 million for this year's third quarter compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2010. Results for the prior year quarter included a",1102,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and thanks for joining us on our call today. Loews reported net income of $162 million for this year's third quarter compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2010. Results for the prior year quarter included a $328 million after-tax charge related to CNA's agreement to cede its legacy asbestos and pollution liabilities to a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Excluding that charge, net income for the quarter decreased by $202 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily from 3 factors: one, decreased limited partnership investment results at CNA; two, lower performance of equity-based investment in the Loews holding company portfolio; and three, higher natural catastrophe losses at CNA.
Setting aside these factors, our subsidiaries delivered solid performance in their operations. At CNA, the growth strategies that has been put in place are resulting in continued improvement in the fundamental of its core property and casualty operation. Increased net written premium has marked the third consecutive quarter of topline growth, which was driven by strong new business and high retention. Along with this growth trend, CNA continues to achieve rate improvement, particularly in its commercial segment.
Third quarter combined ratios before catastrophes and development improved for both specialty and commercial, while the property and casualty business segment benefited from its 19th consecutive quarter of favorable loss reserve development. CNA remains confident in the overall adequacy of its reserve and will continue to maintain its disciplined reserving practices.
Despite the good operating performance in its property and casualty operation, CNA's results were negatively impacted by the performance of its limited partnership investment. LP losses were driven by negative equity market return during the quarter, combined with widening credit spreads and overall capital market volatility. Although CNA's portfolio of limited partnership investment can create earnings volatility, it continues to be an attractive investment strategy for CNA. These holdings have yielded equity-like returns over the years with less volatility and higher absolute returns than in equity portfolio.
Given the LP results for the quarter, it might be helpful to review how these LP investments have performed over a longer timeframe by repeating some performance figures that CNA disclosed on its call earlier today. CNA's LP portfolio produced a third quarter return of negative 3.7%, while the S&P 500 total return was negative 13.9%. Over the last 10 years, CNA's LP investments produced an annualized return of approximately 8% compared to a 3% total return for the S&P 500. So as you can see, over the longer term, the hedge fund portfolio has provided good return, especially in light of the prevailing low yield in other asset classes.
Turning now to Boardwalk. With Stan Horton on board as CEO for about 2 quarters now, Boardwalk is in full growth mode. Last quarter, Boardwalk enumerated a growth strategy that included expanding its existing pipeline assets to connect to new supplies and markets. Two weeks ago, Boardwalk announced that it has won a joint venture with an affiliate of its general partner, which is owned by Loews. The new JV has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Petal Gas Storage and Hattiesburg Gas Storage from Enterprise Products Partners for $550 million. Petal and Hattiesburg operate 7 high-deliverability salt dome natural gas storage caverns located in Mississippi. These assets are a great addition to Boardwalk's pipeline footprint. The facilities are anchored by a long-term fund agreement, with approximately 80% of the existing customer base being either electric or natural gas utilities. The location and types of storage assets are very desirable, and when combined with existing assets, Boardwalk expects numerous opportunities for synergy and growth. 
Loews will contribute $280 million of the joint venture's equity for an 80% ownership interest, and Boardwalk will contribute $70 million for 20% ownership. An additional $200 million will be raised by the JV through a 5-year bank loan. At a later date, if it makes economic sense, Loews' 80% ownership interest can be dropped down to Boardwalk in one or more transactions.
Within its field services business, Boardwalk has also announced a new gathering pipeline in the Marcellus shale. This new project is expected to cost approximately $90 million and will be built out over several years. It is anchored by a 15-year fee-based contract with Southwestern Energy. Marcellus is likely to become a very significant supply basin for the United States, and Boardwalk hopes to identify and execute on additional opportunities in the Marcellus area in the future. 
Additionally, Boardwalk has received regulatory approval to turn some of its assets in South Texas into a rich gas system in order to transport liquids-rich natural gas out of the Eagle Ford region. The project is expected to be completed by year end, and while Boardwalk has not announced any firm commitment, it is seeing interest from the producer community. Boardwalk's goal over the next several years is to strengthen its position of pipeline business while diversifying its products and services. Boardwalk is working hard to identify organic growth opportunities and other acquisition opportunities that are accretive and do not significantly increase its overall risk profile.
Turning now to HighMount. I'd like to give an update on its most recent acquisition. As of today, HighMount has completed the purchase of working interest in oil and gas properties located on approximately 70,000 net acres in Oklahoma. These properties are mostly undeveloped, and HighMount believes that they contain primarily oil and liquids reserves that can be produced through horizontal drilling. The purchase price of $106 million was funded with a capital contribution from Loews. There are a few key points to the investment rationale: First, we believe there is a large upside potential in this oil resource play. HighMount will be able to drill nearly 600 wells which should have favorable single-well economics. Second, the resource opportunity will focus on the Mississippian line and Woodford Shale. The Mississippian line has been reasonably de-risked by development on and surrounding the properties. Third, while we remain bullish on natural gas over the longer term, these properties should help to diversify HighMount's reserves, which consists almost entirely of natural gas and liquids. And fourth, HighMount will control operations over 82% of the leasehold, and the continuous makeup of the acreage creates operational efficiencies. The resource opportunity fits well with HighMount's core technical competencies. While this acquisition is not a game-changer in terms of its magnitude, it is a significant step in HighMount's overall growth strategy. HighMount will continue to look for other value-creating opportunities.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"
285930,141454975,181181,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2011",2011-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation reported earnings of $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the charge associated with CNA's Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction in 2010, earnings for the prior year third qu",891,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation reported earnings of $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the charge associated with CNA's Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction in 2010, earnings for the prior year third quarter would have been $0.87 per share rather than the reported $0.09 per share. This decline in results versus the adjusted number was primarily due to lower results from CNA and lower investment income in the holding company portfolio but was partially offset by higher earnings from Diamond Offshore. 
CNA's contribution to Loews' net operating income was $84 million in the third quarter. In the prior year quarter, CNA contributed an operating loss of $140 million, or, when adjusted for the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA contributed operating income of $169 million in the prior year quarter. Net operating income in CNA's core property and casualty operations declined primarily because of lower net investment income than higher catastrophe losses.  
Net investment income for the 3 months ended September 20, 2011 decreased by $187 million pretax as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily driven by the previously discussed decrease in limited partnership results as well as lower fixed-maturity security income. In the third quarter, CNA reported catastrophe losses of $29 million after tax and noncontrolling interest as compared to $7 million for the same period in 2010.
P&C operations produced a third quarter combined ratio of 99.1% versus 98% in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impacts of prior year development and catastrophe losses, combined ratios were 101% and 103.7% for the comparable periods.
For the quarter, CNA reported realized investment losses of $15 million after tax and noncontrolling interest versus realized investment gains of $37 million in the prior year quarter. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $121 million from $93 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in contract drilling revenues. Results for the third quarter of 2011 reflect the return to service of 3 of Diamond Offshore's high-specification floaters that were idled during the second quarter of 2010 following the Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Also, the newest addition to Diamond Offshore's floater fleet, the Ocean Valor, began generating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 when it commenced operating under contract in Brazil. Contract drilling expense increased by $41 million and included normal operating cost for the Ocean Valor as well as the increased amortized mobilization costs and higher cost associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically.  Additionally, Diamond Offshore recognized a pretax gain of $31 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the sale of the Ocean Shield. Also benefiting Diamond's results for the quarter was a lower effective tax rate as compared with the 2010 period.
HighMount's operating income for the quarter decreased to $16 million from $19 million in the prior year quarter due to decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in HighMount's drilling activity. Average prices realized per Mcfe were $6.22 in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $5.80 in the 2010 period. Operating expenses increased by $2 million in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the 2010 period, primarily due to increased DD&A expenses related to negative reserve revisions in December 2010 and projected future development cost.
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the third quarter are as follows: natural gas production was 11.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.73 per thousand cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production was 664,000 barrels at an average realized price of $40.57 per barrel. Oil production was 68,000 barrels at an average price of $82.67 per barrel. As of September 30, HighMount had hedges in place that cover approximately 77% and 54% of total estimated 2011 and 2012 natural gas equivalent production at a weighted average price of $6.28 and $5.51 per Mcfe, respectively.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter decreased to $18 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net income versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to higher interest expense from a loss in the early extinguishment of debt. Additionally, Boardwalk reported higher operation and maintenance expense related to integrity management and reliability spending. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues resulting from increased capacities from the completion of several compression projects in 2010 and operating the Fayetteville Lateral at its designed capacity.
Loews Hotels reported breakeven results for the third quarter versus the loss of $2 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue per available room increased to $161.76 from the third quarter from $143.89 in the prior year quarter, reflecting improved occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of September 30 totaled $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $275 million. We received $154 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries, and we paid $25 million of dividends to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we have made a capital contribution to HighMount of $106 million, and we also anticipate making an equity contribution of approximately $280 million for an equity ownership interest in the joint venture discussed in the call today. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

Instead, as you can see, Loews has been buying its own stock, and the stock -- the price of Loews stock, I think, reflects the low valuation that CNA is receiving. So that's one of the reasons that gives us so much confidence buying in our own shares."

Tax basis is a very simple item when it comes to your own portfolio. When it comes to subsidiaries and other corporate assets, it is phenomenally complicated and takes an enormous amount of effort, and we do not typically adjust the basis. We do not calculate the basis on either a quarterly nor annual basis. And I would say, likewise, I don't think there are any S&P 500 companies that actually do that."

There are a lot more analysts that follow the company, and he's staying dramatically more busy than he's been here at Loews. Take it away, Darren. You'll be among the missed here."
