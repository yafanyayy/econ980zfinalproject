I'm pleased to say 2010 was a year of exceptional records and results for our company. As mentioned in the highlights in the last Mike Sweet, we achieved our financial, operational and growth milestones during 2010. The ongoing execution of our strategy in recent years, including our increasing exposure to seaborne markets, has generated an exciting growth trajectory that we believe will extend well beyond 2010.
I'm enthusiastic about our accomplishments over the past five years, which arguably reached the pinnacle into 2010 that I am even more excited about where we are headed in 2011 and beyond.
Today, we are positioned with iron ore pellet equity production capacity in North American Iron Ore of 29.5 million tons. This 28% increase from 2005 is a result of a number of strategic steps taken by this management team, including the 2007 expansion of production capacity at North Shore, the 2008 purchase of our remaining partners interesting to United Taconite in the 2010 purchase of our to partner centers in Wabush Mines.
In Asia-Pacific Iron Ore, upon completion of our announced infrastructure upgrades, we'll also be positioned to produce at 11 million tons of what invites products by 2012. This is over 100% increase in volumes from 2005, the year we acquired the operations.
Based on our track record for iron ore acquisitions over the past few years, I believe you should feel confident in our ability to execute and integrate large strategic transactions that have the potential to create significant shareholder value. As you know, last month, we announced an agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of Consolidated Thompson, an emerging world-class iron ore producers located in Eastern Canada. Among other things, Consolidated Thompson's asset will diversify Spike Cliffs North America customer base to include new customers in Asia, including a strategic relationship with China's third largest steel maker, Wesco. In addition, Consolidated Thompson Assets will provide impressive growth profile with an opportunity to expand production capacity of 8 million tons to a run rate of 16 million tons by 2013.
We anticipate this acquisition will close in early second quarter of 2011. In addition to iron ore, our large greenfield project in Northern Ontario will diversify our product base to include a more and ferrochrome, a strategic mineral used in the production as be a steel.
Discussions with key stakeholders are ongoing and we recently announced additional information about the project and our plans. 
Now turning to the performance of our core businesses during the quarter and full year.
North American Iron Ore's fourth quarter and full-year sales volume were 7.6 million tons and 26.2 million tons, respectively. Exclusive of the overall increase in the demand of iron ore pellets when comparing 2010 to 2009, we sold nearly 400,000 tons of pellets from our Minnesota and Michigan operations into the seaborne market. Given the current demand for iron ore products around the world, we expect to place approximately 1 million to 2 million tons of pounds from the senior U.S. operations into the seaborne market in 2011. The year-over-year increases in sales volumes is also related to the purchase of our remaining partners interest in Wabush Mines. Noteworthy is the fact that the sales margin dollars generated from Wabush Mines in 2010 well exceeded the roughly $100 million we paid by our former partner's 73% ownership. In short, it was less than a one-year payback on the investment.
This is not only a prime example of the successful execution of our strategy to increase our seaborne exposure, but also the fourth iron ore acquisition we have completed in the last six years.
During 2010, we prevailed in our binding arbitration out of what he wanted to -- arbitrations with customers. The remaining arbitration is still underway and at this point we are assuming a resolution to occur in 2011 and this resolution is reflected in our outlook.
Moving forward, we continue to make efforts to clarify the language in our customer's supply contracts around pricing mechanisms to help mitigate the risk of future arbitrations. I am extremely proud of our operator's succeeded ramping up production in such a short period of time. As you know, in late 2008, and into the beginning of 2009, we ceased production very quickly to meet lower U.S. demand for pellets. In 2010, driven by significant higher demand, we achieved a record 26 million tons in sales volumes. This level of sophistication required to manage our complex operations to satisfy these quick swings in demand is a testament to the expertise of our operators.
Now turning to North American Coal, primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the iron ore energy transaction, we reported a sales volume increase of 24% versus 2009's fourth quarter. Iron ore's coal operations are essentially fully integrated, and we were accretive to our 2010 full year results.
The incremental contribution from these operations more than offset year-over-year decreases in sales volume across the pinnacle and Oak Grove mines, both of which continued to experience the effects of adverse geological conditions. Although the longwall installation in pinnacle was successfully completed in late October, the adverse geological conditions prevented us from ramping up production as quickly as we had initially anticipated.
With the new long wall systems upgraded capabilities, we anticipate it will significantly be more efficient than the antiquate predecessor in 2011.
The upgrades that the technical spec authority plant were completed at the beginning of January 2011. The new upgraded technology will allow us to produce more sellable part going forward. Additionally, by the end of January, we were more than three quarters of the way through our planned 800-foot excavation of that you might check at the world is a great summer computer. wanted to come in the current time from the will be significantly reduced.
During the first quarter, we'll make one additional long wall move a Pinnacle Mine. Upon completion of this, and with the progress we've made around the North American Coal Capital Projects, we expect to show you significantly increased production and significantly lower unit cost in our core businesses.
At Cliff's Asia-Pacific Iron Ore business, we achieved a record-breaking year with fourth quarter sales volumes up 24% and sales margin surging over 800% when compared to 2009's fourth quarter. Significantly higher prices in the seaborne market, steady demand for our products and higher sales volume from the Cockatoo Island joint venture contributed to this segment's very strong performance. Although the exceptionally high spot prices experienced in recent weeks are most likely not sustainable in perpetuity, I do believe there are a number of factors that support high pricing in the near term. I point out to the recent debate in India, as fire roughly 100 million tons of iron or into seaborne market. Recently, the country's Ministry of Steel just the opposite is that an all-out veteran iron ore exports. While this probably won't happen overnight, Indian states and there is a have begun increasing export restrictions. Another point to note, higher labor, energy and material cost will impact China's marginal cost producers, potentially raising the floor in spot market pricing.
These points, coupled with the increasing steel production capacity in emerging economies will likely both well for seaborne iron ore pricing. This would match we have a positive impact on our realized revenue in the near future.
Durning 2011, we will continue to be bad with our capital project plans in Asia-Pacific Iron Ore.
I'm sure many of you have been following the recent flooding of Australia. Fortunately for us, Cliff's Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations are located in the southwest part of Australia, approximately 300 miles east of Perth. These operations were untouched by the cyclone that recently reached the iron ore will be Richard, which is located about 1000 miles north to the north. Additionally, Sonoma Coal is located north of the hardest hit flooding areas in Queensland -- to pump water out of the pit, we fortunately have not had to declare force majeure in any production. We are cognizant of potential continuing impacts weather may have on future production as the wet season typically extends through April.
At this time, there is no way of knowing the full scope of damage to infrastructure or the time it will take it to be restored. Although these weather-related impacts have increased spot prices for Medco, we are really aware of these by comparing disaster. Earlier this month, we announced our comprehensive global reorganization plans. As I mentioned on the top of the call, we have significantly grow in this company over the past five years. This growth has prompted a need for greater collaboration between our North American and Asia-Pacific business units. I believe there are many commercial, logistical and operating opportunities in having a truly integrated global management structure. We will look to adapt best practice solutions across the challenges we face a global company. With the integration of our new management alignment, I believe the company is well-positioned to next generation of leaders.
In summary, it is apparent Cliffs is poised to grow. The year 2010 was working hard to find an array of performance investment opportunities from Greenfield projects to large-scale acquisitions. Looking ahead in 2011, it will be the year of integration and execution.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of financial highlights and our outlook for the year. Laurie?"

Financially speaking, 2010 was off the charts year for Cliff's. Not only with the fourth quarter the strongest have ever worded, but we achieved full-year record revenues those margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and free cash flow, other operations.
These impressive results were driven by increased sales volumes in all of our business segments and significantly higher pricing in the commodities that we sell. Full-year consolidated revenues doubled to $4.7 billion, while our full-year consolidated sales margin increased nearly 400% over the full year 2009.
Net income for the year increased to over $1 billion or $7.49 per diluted share versus last year's $205 million or $1.63 per diluted share.
Cash from operations was over $1.3 billion for the year. This is an impressive increase of over 600% from 2009, and while over a 55% increase from 2008, a year we all thought was an extremely strong year. I think it's important to point out that the $1.3 billion in cash from operations excludes the anticipated cash impact from 2010's previously disclosed arbitrations.
We did, however, collect $129 million in January 2011 from the arbitration with that was settled at the end of December. While the customer has taken legal action in an attempt to vacate the award, this payment will be reflected in 2011 to first quarter cash flows.
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 74% to a record $1.4 billion, compared with $821 million in last year's final quarter. And sales margin was up well over 2.5x that of last year, reaching $482 million in the quarter.
Operating income increased 155% to $397 million, and net income improved to $384 million, compared with last year's $108 million. This resulted in $2.82 per diluted share versus the prior year's fourth quarter of $0.82 per diluted share, an increase of almost 250%.
Average revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore rose to $107, up 33%, compared with $80 in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting favorable pricing for more seaborne iron ore and hot-band steel.
The 2010 revenue per ton results were exclusive of a pending arbitration with one of our customers, resulting in an unfavorable $300 million impact to sales margin.
As of today, we're assuming a final resolution and award for this arbitration will occur in 2011, and this is reflected in our outlook. when compared to last year's fourth quarter, the current quarter's increase in cost per ton were a direct result of higher profit sharing, employee-related and materials cost, along with royalties and the result of additional sales volume from the purchase of our partner's interest in Wabush Mines.
Last year's fourth quarter cost per ton also benefited from purchase and tonnage from some of our remind partners at variable costs. In North American Coal, average revenue per ton for the quarter improved 29% to $117, compared with $91 last year. Average cost per ton increased 39%, which included approximately $20 per ton of DD&A.
As Joe mentioned earlier, the adverse geological conditions experienced during the quarter had an impact on our production. As a result, cash costs increased 40% from last year's fourth quarter to $122 per ton. For the full year, cash costs were slightly lower year-over-year due to increased volume.
As we've indicated before, as the capital -projects underway ramp up in this segment, we anticipate significantly higher production volumes and significantly lower costs.
Turning to Asia-Pacific iron ore, average revenue per ton in the quarter was $135, up 110% from last year's $64. This, combined with the per ton cost increase of only 19% to $66, resulted in a sharply higher sales margin per ton of $70 versus $9 in the prior year.
On top of 2010's increased spot prices for seaborne iron ore, we realized a premium of about $16 per ton for a lump product, which represents approximately 50% of our sales volume.
In addition, during 2010, we transitioned to pricing mechanisms, more closely tied to the seaborne iron ore spot market. This helps us monetize the ongoing increases in spot prices throughout the year, contributed to our outstanding financial performance in this segment.
Sonoma Coal continue to post positive results. During the quarter, Sonoma contributed $59 million to close revenue and $23 million to sales margin.
At Amapa, increased pricing and sales volumes resulted in $5.6 million of equity income were 30% interest in the project. During the quarter, we completed a restructuring of the legal entities that hold our 30% investment on the project. This was the primary driver of a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $78 million recorded in the quarter.
At December 31, Chris had $1.6 billion in cash. During 2010, we were successful in achieving and investment grade rating and raising $1.4 billion in public senior notes. In addition, we have $325 million in Private placement senior notes. For a combined total of $1.7 billion in long-term debt at year end. We have not withdrawn under our revolver under letters of credit, it is fully available to us.
With our increased liquidity, during the year, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 60%, while also investing $1.3 billion in capital projects and acquisition-related assets.
For 2011, we have a very optimistic outlook for each of our businesses. This optimism is based on favorable and ongoing global supply and demand fundamentals. We continue to be bullish on pricing in light of the factors Joe mentioned earlier.
For our North American Iron Ore business, we increased our 2011 sales volume estimate to approximately 28 million tons. The higher sales volume is attributable to improved market conditions and to sales recognition timing of 600,000 tons of ballots that have been pushed into 2011. This was related to customer timing requirements and weather-related shipping delays on the Great Lakes.
Pellet prices in our North American Iron Ore segment are currently estimated to be $140 to $145 per ton in 2011. This estimate includes various assumptions, which would be detailed in last night's press release.
Additionally, ask is typically the case, we would anticipate our reported average revenue per ton to be lower during the first half of the year than our full-year outlook. Due to the seasonality in our businesses, particularly with a maintenance and the Great Lakes this in the winter months, our most quarters debt tend to be the last two in the calendar year.
We expect to produce 28 million tons in 2011 with average cost per ton expected to be between $65 and $70. Sales and production estimates at our North American Coal segment remain unchanged from the previous guidance. We anticipate producing and selling a total of 6.5 million tons comprised of 4 million tons of, 1.5 million tons of high and 1 million tons of thermal coal. Average revenue for the full year is expected to be $135 to $145 per ton. Let's nice press release, we complete breakdown of committed to noncommitted tonnage volume, while with the prices contracted today.
Based on the capital improvements we've made at our coal operations and the increased volume, cost per ton is expected to decline to approximately $105 to $110.
At our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, sales and production guidance remains unchanged at 9 million tons. Revenue per ton is expected to be between $175 and $180, an increase of nearly 50% over the average 2010 revenue of $121 per ton. This significantly higher expectation is based on the assumption of flat stock price of $187  at January 31, consistent for the remainder of the year.
As many of you know, spot prices fluctuate and you'll make your own assumption about where you believe this will trend for the full year.
Cost per ton is expected to average between $70 and $75, with approximately $12 of DD&A. The year-over-year increase in cost per ton is driven by increased royalties, unfavorable exchange rates and additional mining costs. Also, cost per ton will be higher due to our planned infrastructure capital project at this operation.
We expect our share of Sodoma's 2011 sales volume will total 1.6 million tons, with an approximate product mix of 60% thermal coal and 40% met coal. As many of you are aware, Queensland's flooding from sliding a significant volatility in our Australian coal prices. We would anticipate pricing in this business to move with rising for us relative meant Joining me today are Cliffs’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Carrabba; and Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, Laurie Brlas.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Joe for his initial remarks. relevant meta- thermal coal some adjusted for our quality.
Sonoma's 2011 costs are expected to average $105 to $110 per ton, reflecting unfavorable exchange rates and higher royalty expenses. Modestly profitable in 2011.
Currently, we're anticipating 2011 SG&A cost of approximately $200 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our global exploration activities and approximately $35 million for our chromite project.
Based on our outlook, we expect to generate more than $2.7 billion in cash from operations in 2011, more than double 2010's impressive record-breaking results. We anticipate 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of about $200 million in sustaining capital, and $400 million in growth and expansion projects.
In last night's release, we provided a further breakdown of capital by business segment. Our plans for the permanent financing in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson are coming together nicely and are supported by our 2011 outlook, including our expected cash flow from operations.
The bank term loan is moving forward quite well and demand to participate has been strong. We still expect to access the capital markets for a portion of our permanent financing. The timing of that will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions.
Although we intend to execute our final plans for long-term debt, reported closing of the Consolidated Thompson transaction, we've expect that our the remaining.

I'm pleased to say 2010 was a year of exceptional records and results for our company. As mentioned in the highlights in last night's release, we achieved a number of financial, operational and growth milestones during 2010. The ongoing execution of our strategy in recent years, including our increasing exposure to seaborne markets, has generated an exciting growth trajectory that we believe will extend well beyond 2010. I'm enthusiastic about our accomplishments over the past five years, which arguably reached the Pinnacle in 2010, but I am even more excited about where we are headed in 2011 and beyond.
Today, we are positioned with iron ore pellet equity production capacity in North American Iron Ore of 29.5 million tons. This 28% increase from 2005 is a result of a number of strategic steps taken by this management team, including the 2007 expansion of production capacity at Northshore, the 2008 purchase of our remaining partners' interest in United Taconite and the 2010 purchase of our two partners' interest in Wabush Mines. In Asia-Pacific Iron Ore, upon completion of our announced infrastructure upgrades, we will also be positioned to produce and sell 11 million tons of lump and fines products by 2012. This is over 100% increase in volumes from 2005, the year we acquired the operations.
Based on our track record for iron ore acquisitions over the past few years, I believe you should feel confident in our ability to execute and integrate large strategic transactions that have the potential to create significant shareholder value. As you know, last month, we announced an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Consolidated Thompson, an emerging world-class iron ore producer located in Eastern Canada. Among other things, Consolidated Thompson's asset will diversify Cliffs North American customer base to include new customers in Asia, including a strategic relationship with China's third largest steel maker,  WISCO. In addition, Consolidated Thompson assets will provide Cliffs an impressive growth profile with an opportunity to expand production capacity of 8 million tons to a run rate of 16 million tons by 2013. We anticipate this acquisition will close in early second quarter of 2011. In addition to iron ore, our large greenfield project in Northern Ontario will diversify our product base to include chrome ore and ferrochrome, a strategic mineral used in the production stainless steel. Discussions with key stakeholders are ongoing, and we recently announced additional information about the project and our plans. 
Now turning to the performance of our core businesses during the quarter and full year. North American Iron Ore's fourth quarter and full year sales volume were 7.6 million tons and 26.2 million tons, respectively. Exclusive of the overall increase in the demand of iron ore pellets when comparing 2010 to 2009, we sold nearly 400,000 tons of pellets from our Minnesota and Michigan operations into the seaborne market. Given the current demand for iron ore products around the world, we expect to place approximately 1 million to 2 million tons of pellets from these same U.S. operations into the seaborne market in 2011. The year-over-year increases in sales volumes is also related to the purchase of our remaining partners' interest in Wabush Mines. Noteworthy is the fact that the sales margin dollars generated from Wabush Mines in 2010 well exceeded the roughly $100 million we paid to buy our former partner's 73% ownership. In short, it was less than a one-year payback on the investment. This is not only a prime example of the successful execution of our strategy to increase our seaborne exposure but also the fourth iron ore acquisition we have completed in the last six years.  
During 2010, we prevailed in our binding arbitration with Algoma, one of our two previously disclosed arbitrations with customers. The remaining arbitration is still underway, and at this point, we are assuming a resolution to occur in 2011. And this resolution is reflected in our outlook. Moving forward, we continue to make efforts to clarify the language in our customers' supply contracts around pricing mechanisms to help mitigate the risk of future arbitrations. I am extremely proud of our operators' abilities to succeed in ramping up production in such a short period of time. As you know, in late 2008 and into the beginning of 2009, we ceased production very quickly to meet lower U.S. demand for pellets. In 2010, driven by significant higher demand, we achieved a record 26 million tons in sales volumes. This level of sophistication required to manage our complex operations to satisfy these quick swings in demand is a testament to the expertise of our operators.
Now turning to North American Coal. Primarily, as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the INR Energy transaction, we reported a sales volume increase of 24% versus 2009's fourth quarter. INR's coal operations are essentially fully integrated, and we were accretive to our 2010 full year results.  The incremental contribution from these operations more than offset year-over-year decreases in sales volume of Cliffs' Pinnacle and Oak Grove mines, both of which continued to experience the effects of adverse geological conditions. Although the longwall installation at Pinnacle was successfully completed in late October, the adverse geological conditions prohibit us from ramping up production as swiftly as we had initially anticipated. With the new longwall systems' upgraded capabilities, we anticipate it will significantly be more efficient than its antiquated predecessor in 2011.
The upgrades to Pinnacle's preparation plan were completed as of the beginning of January 2011. The new upgraded technology will allow us to produce more salable product going forward. Additionally, by the end of January, we were more than three quarters of the way through our planned 800-foot excavation of the new mine shaft at Oak Grove, slated for late summer completion. Once installed, the current trip time to and from the face of the coal panel will be significantly reduced.
During the first quarter, we will make one additional longwall move at Pinnacle Mine. Upon completion of this and with the progress we've made around the North American Coal Capital Projects, we expect to show you significantly increased production and significantly lower unit cost in our Coal businesses.
At Cliffs' Asia-Pacific Iron Ore business, we achieved a record-breaking year, with fourth quarter sales volumes up 24% and sales margin surging over 800% when compared to 2009's fourth quarter. Significantly higher prices in the seaborne market, steady demand for our products and higher sales volume from the Cockatoo Island joint venture contributed to this segment's very strong performance. Although the exceptionally high spot prices experienced in recent weeks are most likely not sustainable in perpetuity, I do believe there are a number of factors that support high pricing over the near term. 
I pointed out to the recent debate in India a supplier of roughly 100 million tons of iron into the seaborne market. Recently, the country's Ministry of Steel has suggested an all-out ban on iron ore exports. While this probably won't happen overnight, Indian states, Karnataka and Orissa, have begun increasing export restrictions. Another point to note, higher labor, energy and material cost will impact China's marginal cost producers, potentially raising the floor in spot market pricing. These points, coupled with the increasing steel production capacity in emerging economies, will likely bode well for seaborne iron ore pricing. This would naturally have a positive impact on our realized revenue in the near future.
Durning 2011, we will continue to move ahead with our capital project plans in Asia-Pacific Iron Ore.  I'm sure many of you have been following the recent flooding of Australia. Fortunately for us, Cliffs' Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations are located in the southwest part of Australia, approximately 300 miles east of Perth. These operations were untouched by the cyclone that recently hit the iron ore-rich Pilbara region, which is located about 1,000 miles north to the north. Additionally, Sonoma Coal is located north of the hardest hit flooding areas in Queensland. While some rain is prompting us to pump water out of the pit, we fortunately have not had to declare force majeure on any production. We are cognizant of potential continuing impacts weather may have on future production as the wet season typically extends through April.
At this time, there is no way of knowing the full scope of damage to infrastructure or the time it will take it to be restored. Although these weather-related impacts have increased spot prices for met coal, we are keenly aware of the humanitarian disaster these floods have brought to the region. 
Earlier this month, we announced our comprehensive global reorganization plans. As I mentioned on the top of the call, we have significantly grown this company over the past five years. This growth has prompted a need for greater collaboration between our North American and Asia-Pacific business units. I believe there are many commercial, logistical and operating opportunities in having a truly integrated global management structure. We will look to adapt best practice solutions to the complex challenges we face a global company. With the integration of our new management alignment, I believe the company is well positioned to prepare Cliffs' next generation of leaders.
In summary, it is apparent, Cliffs is poised to grow. The year 2010 was spent working hard to find an array of portfolio investment opportunities from greenfield projects to large-scale acquisitions. Looking ahead in 2011, it will be the year of integration and execution.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook for the coming year. Laurie?"
261738,118950305,104201,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2011",2011-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Financially speaking, 2010 was an off-the-charts year for Cliffs. Not only was the fourth quarter the strongest we have ever worded, but we achieved full year record revenues,",1712,"Thank you, Joe, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Financially speaking, 2010 was an off-the-charts year for Cliffs. Not only was the fourth quarter the strongest we have ever worded, but we achieved full year record revenues, sales margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and free cash flow, among other accomplishments.
These impressive results were driven by increased sales volumes in all of our business segments and significantly higher pricing in the commodities that we sell. Full year consolidated revenues doubled to $4.7 billion, while our full year consolidated sales margin increased nearly 400% over the full year 2009. Net income for the year increased to over $1 billion or $7.49 per diluted share versus last year's $205 million or $1.63 per diluted share.
Cash from operations was over $1.3 billion for the year. This is an impressive increase of over 600% from 2009 and well over a 55% increase from 2008, a year we all thought was an extremely strong year. I think it's important to point out that the $1.3 billion in cash from operations excludes the anticipated cash impact from 2010's previously disclosed arbitrations. We did, however, collect $129 million in January 2011 from the arbitration with Algoma that was settled at the end of December. While the customer has taken legal action in an attempt to vacate the award, this payment will be reflected in 2011 to first quarter cash flows.
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 74% to a record $1.4 billion compared with $821 million in last year's final quarter. And sales margin was up well over 2.5x that of last year, reaching $482 million in the quarter.
Operating income increased 155% to $397 million, and net income improved to $384 million compared with last year's $108 million. This resulted in $2.82 per diluted share versus the prior year's fourth quarter of $0.82 per diluted share, an increase of almost 250%.
Average revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore rose to $107, up 33%, compared with $80 in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting favorable pricing for seaborne iron ore and hot band steel. The 2010 revenue per ton results were exclusive of a pending arbitration with one of our customers, resulting in an unfavorable $300 million impact to sales margin.  As of today, we're assuming a final resolution and award for this arbitration will occur in 2011, and this is reflected in our outlook. 
when compared to last year's fourth quarter, the current quarter's increase in cost per ton were a direct result of higher profit sharing, employee-related and materials cost, along with royalties and the result of additional sales volume from the purchase of our partners' interest in Wabush Mines. Last year's fourth quarter cost per ton also benefited from purchasing tonnage from some of our mine partners at variable costs. In North American Coal, average revenue per ton for the quarter improved 29% to $117 compared with $91 last year. Average cost per ton increased 39%, which included approximately $20 per ton of DD&A. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, the adverse geological conditions experienced during the quarter had an impact on our production. As a result, cash costs increased 40% from last year's fourth quarter to $122 per ton. For the full year, cash costs were slightly lower year-over-year due to increased volume. As we've indicated before, as the capital projects underway ramp up in this segment, we anticipate significantly higher production volumes and significantly lower costs.
Turning to Asia-Pacific Iron Ore. Average revenue per ton in the quarter was $135, up 110% from last year's $64. This, combined with a per ton cost increase of only 19% to $66, resulted in a sharply higher sales margin per ton of $70 versus $9 in the prior year. On top of 2010's increased spot prices for seaborne iron ore, we realized a premium of about $16 per ton for our lump product, which represents approximately 50% of our sales volume.  In addition, during 2010, we transitioned to pricing mechanisms more closely tied to the seaborne iron ore spot market. This helps us monetize the ongoing increases in spot prices throughout the year, contributing to our outstanding financial performance in this segment.
Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results. During the quarter, Sonoma contributed $59 million to Cliffs' revenue and $23 million to sales margin.
At Amapa, increased pricing and sales volumes resulted in $5.6 million of equity income for Cliffs' 30% interest in the project. During the quarter, we completed a restructuring of the legal entities that hold our 30% investment in the project. This was the primary driver of a noncash deferred tax benefit of $78 million recorded in the quarter.
At December 31, Cliffs had $1.6 billion in cash. During 2010, we were successful in achieving an investment-grade rating and raising $1.4 billion in public senior notes. In addition, we have $325 million in private placement senior notes, for a combined total of $1.7 billion in long-term debt at year end. We have nothing drawn on our revolver, so other than letters of credit, it is fully available to us. 
With our increased liquidity, during the year, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 60% while also investing $1.3 billion in capital projects and acquisition-related assets. For 2011, we have a very optimistic outlook for each of our businesses. This optimism is based on favorable and ongoing global supply and demand fundamentals. We continue to be bullish on pricing in light of the factors Joe mentioned earlier.
For our North American Iron Ore business, we increased our 2011 sales volume estimate to approximately 28 million tons. The higher sales volume is attributable to improved market conditions and to sales recognition timing of 600,000 tons of pellets that have been pushed into 2011. This was related to customer timing requirements and weather-related shipping delays on the Great Lakes.  
Pellet prices in our North American Iron Ore segment are currently estimated to be $140 to $145 per ton in 2011. This estimate includes various assumptions, which were detailed in last night's press release.
Additionally, as is typically the case, we would anticipate our reported average revenue per ton to be lower during the first half of the year than our full year outlook. Due to the seasonality in our businesses, particularly with lot maintenance and the Great Lakes freezing in the winter months, our most profitable quarters tend to be the last two in the calendar year.
We expect to produce 28 million tons in 2011 with average cost per ton expected to be between $65 and $70. Sales and production estimates at our North American Coal segment remain unchanged from the previous guidance. We anticipate producing and selling a total of 6.5 million tons comprised of 4 million tons of low-vol met coal, 1.5 million tons of high-vol met coal and 1 million tons of thermal coal. Average revenue for the full year is expected to be $135 to $145 per ton. Again, I refer you to last night's press release for a complete breakdown of committed and uncommitted tonnage volume, along with the prices contracted to-date. Based on the capital improvements we've made at our coal operations and the increased volume, cost per ton is expected to decline to approximately $105 to $110.
At our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, sales and production guidance remains unchanged at 9 million tons. Revenue per ton is expected to be between $175 and $180, an increase of nearly 50% over the average 2010 revenue of $121 per ton. This significantly higher expectation is based on the assumption the flat spot pricing of $187 at January 31 holds consistent for the remainder of the year.  As many of you know, spot prices fluctuate and you'll make your own assumption about where you believe this will trend for the full year.
Cost per ton is expected to average between $70 and $75, with approximately $12 of DD&A. The year-over-year increase in cost per ton is driven by increased royalties, unfavorable exchange rates and additional mining costs. Also cost per ton will be higher due to our planned infrastructure capital project at this operation. We expect our share of Sonoma's 2011 sales volume will total 1.6 million tons, with an approximate product mix of 60% thermal coal and 40% met coal. 
As many of you are aware, Queensland's flooding had caused significant volatility in Australian coal prices. We would anticipate pricing in this business to move with pricing for Australian met and thermal coal adjusted for our quality. Sonoma's 2011 costs are expected to average $105 to $110 per ton, reflecting unfavorable exchange rates and higher royalty expenses. Amapa is expected to be modestly profitable in 2011.
Currently, we're anticipating 2011 SG&A cost of approximately $200 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our global exploration activities and approximately $35 million for our chromite project.
Based on our outlook, we expect to generate more than $2.7 billion in cash from operations in 2011, more than double 2010's impressive record-breaking results. We anticipate 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of about $300 million in sustaining capital and $400 million in growth and expansion projects.
In last night's release, we provided a further breakdown of capital by business segment. Our plans for the permanent financing in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson are coming together nicely and are supported by our 2011 outlook, including our expected cash flow from operations. The bank term loan is moving forward quite well, and demand to participate has been strong. We still expect to access the capital markets for a portion of our permanent financing. The timing of that will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions. Although we intend to execute our final plans for long-term debt before the closing of the Consolidated Thompson transaction, we expect that our remaining permanent  capital structure will be put in place later.
Our fourth quarter performance marked the end of a very exciting and productive year for Cliffs. 2011 has gotten off to a fast start, and we look forward to reporting our progress as the year progresses. Steve, we're ready to open the call for questions."

The cash that we generate and the timing of that equity raise will determine how much equity exactly has to be added."

I'm pleased to say 2010 was a year of exceptional records and results for our company. As mentioned in the highlights in last night's release, we achieved a number of financial, operational and g",1610,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to say 2010 was a year of exceptional records and results for our company. As mentioned in the highlights in last night's release, we achieved a number of financial, operational and growth milestones during 2010. The ongoing execution of our strategy in recent years, including our increasing exposure to seaborne markets, has generated an exciting growth trajectory that we believe will extend well beyond 2010. I am enthusiastic about our accomplishments over the past five years, which arguably reached a pinnacle in 2010, but I am even more excited about where we are headed in 2011 and beyond.
Today, we are positioned with iron ore pellet equity production capacity in North American Iron Ore of 29.5 million tons. This 28% increase from 2005 is a result of a number of strategic steps taken by this management team, including the 2007 expansion of production capacity at Northshore, the 2008 purchase of our remaining partners' interest in United Taconite and the 2010 purchase of our two partners' interest in Wabush Mines. In Asia-Pacific Iron Ore, upon completion of our announced infrastructure upgrades, we will also be positioned to produce and sell 11 million tons of lump and fines products by 2012. This is over 100% increase in volumes from 2005, the year we acquired the operations.
Based on our track record for iron ore acquisitions over the past few years, I believe you should feel confident in our ability to execute and integrate large strategic transactions that have the potential to create significant shareholder value. As you know, last month, we announced an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Consolidated Thompson, an emerging world-class iron ore producer located in Eastern Canada. Among other things, Consolidated Thompson's assets will diversify Cliffs North American customer base to include new customers in Asia, including a strategic relationship with China's third largest steel maker, WISCO. In addition, Consolidated Thompson assets will provide Cliffs an impressive growth profile with an opportunity to expand production capacity of 8 million tons to a run rate of 16 million tons by 2013. We anticipate this acquisition will close in early second quarter of 2011. In addition to iron ore, our large greenfield project in Northern Ontario will diversify our product base to include chrome ore and ferrochrome, a strategic mineral used in the production stainless steel. Discussions with key stakeholders are ongoing, and we recently announced additional information about the project and our plans. 
Now turning to the performance of our core businesses during the quarter and full year. North American Iron Ore's fourth quarter and full year sales volume were 7.6 million tons and 26.2 million tons, respectively. Exclusive of the overall increase in the demand of iron ore pellets when comparing 2010 to 2009, we sold nearly 400,000 tons of pellets from our Minnesota and Michigan operations into the seaborne market. Given the current demand for iron ore products around the world, we expect to place approximately 1 million to 2 million tons of pellets from these same U.S. operations into the seaborne market in 2011. The year-over-year increases in sales volumes is also related to the purchase of our remaining partners' interest in Wabush Mines. Noteworthy is the fact that the sales margin dollars generated from Wabush Mines in 2010 well exceeded the roughly $100 million we paid to buy our former partner's 73% ownership. In short, it was less than a one-year payback on the investment. This is not only a prime example of the successful execution of our strategy to increase our seaborne exposure but also the fourth iron ore acquisition we have completed in the last six years.  
During 2010, we prevailed in our binding arbitration with Algoma, one of our two previously disclosed arbitrations with customers. The remaining arbitration is still underway, and at this point, we are assuming a resolution to occur in 2011. And this resolution is reflected in our outlook. Moving forward, we continue to make efforts to clarify the language in our customer supply contracts around pricing mechanisms to help mitigate the risk of future arbitrations. I am extremely proud of our operators' abilities to succeed in ramping up production in such a short period of time. As you know, in late 2008 and into the beginning of 2009, we ceased production very quickly to meet lower U.S. demand for pellets. In 2010, driven by significant higher demand, we achieved a record 26 million tons in sales volumes. This level of sophistication required to manage our complex operations to satisfy these quick swings in demand is a testament to the expertise of our operators.
Now turning to North American Coal. Primarily, as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the INR Energy transaction, we reported a sales volume increase of 24% versus 2009's fourth quarter. INR's coal operations are essentially fully integrated, and we were accretive to our 2010 full year results.  The incremental contribution from these operations more than offset year-over-year decreases in sales volume of Cliffs' Pinnacle and Oak Grove mines, both of which continued to experience the effects of adverse geological conditions. Although the longwall installation at Pinnacle was successfully completed in late October, the adverse geological conditions prohibit us from ramping up production as swiftly as we had initially anticipated. With the new longwall systems' upgraded capabilities, we anticipate it will significantly be more efficient than its antiquated predecessor in 2011.
The upgrades to Pinnacle's preparation plant were completed as of the beginning of January 2011. The new upgraded technology will allow us to produce more salable product going forward. Additionally, by the end of January, we were more than three quarters of the way through our planned 800-foot excavation of the new mine shaft at Oak Grove, slated for late summer completion. Once installed, the current trip time to and from the face of the coal panel will be significantly reduced.
During the first quarter, we will make one additional longwall move at Pinnacle Mine. Upon completion of this and with the progress we've made around the North American Coal Capital Projects, we expect to show you significantly increased production and significantly lower unit cost in our Coal businesses.
At Cliffs' Asia-Pacific Iron Ore business, we achieved a record-breaking year, with fourth quarter sales volumes up 24% and sales margin surging over 800% when compared to 2009's fourth quarter. Significantly higher prices in the seaborne market, steady demand for our products and higher sales volume from the Cockatoo Island joint venture contributed to this segment's very strong performance. Although the exceptionally high spot prices experienced in recent weeks are most likely not sustainable in perpetuity, I do believe there are a number of factors that support high pricing over the near term. 
I point out to the recent debate in India, a supplier of roughly 100 million tons of iron into the seaborne market. Recently, the country's Ministry of Steel has suggested an all-out ban on iron ore exports. While this probably won't happen overnight, Indian states, Karnataka and Orissa, have begun increasing export restrictions. Another point to note, higher labor, energy and material cost will impact China's marginal cost producers, potentially raising the floor in spot market pricing. These points, coupled with the increasing steel production capacity in emerging economies, will likely bode well for seaborne iron ore pricing. This would naturally have a positive impact on our realized revenue in the near future.
Durning 2011, we will continue to move ahead with our capital project plans in Asia-Pacific Iron Ore.  I'm sure many of you have been following the recent flooding of Australia. Fortunately for us, Cliffs' Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations are located in the southwest part of Australia, approximately 300 miles east of Perth. These operations were untouched by the cyclone that recently hit the iron ore-rich Pilbara region, which is located about 1,000 miles to the north. Additionally, Sonoma Coal is located north of the hardest hit flooding areas in Queensland. While some rain is prompting us to pump water out of the pit, we fortunately have not had to declare force majeure on any production. We are cognizant of potential continuing impacts weather may have on future production as the wet season typically extends through April.
At this time, there is no way of knowing the full scope of damage to infrastructure or the time it will take it to be restored. Although these weather-related impacts have increased spot prices for met coal, we are keenly aware of the humanitarian disaster these floods have brought to the region. 
Earlier this month, we announced our comprehensive global reorganization plans. As I mentioned on the top of the call, we have significantly grown this company over the past five years. This growth has prompted a need for greater collaboration between our North American and Asia-Pacific business units. I believe there are many commercial, logistical and operating opportunities in having a truly integrated global management structure. We will look to adapt best practice solutions to the complex challenges we face as a global company. With the integration of our new management alignment, I believe the company is well positioned to prepare Cliffs' next generation of leaders.
In summary, it is apparent, Cliffs is poised to grow. The year 2010 was spent working hard to find an array of portfolio investment opportunities from greenfield projects to large-scale acquisitions. Looking ahead in 2011, it will be the year of integration and execution.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook for the coming year. Laurie?"
261738,118950305,104298,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2011",2011-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Financially speaking, 2010 was an off-the-charts year for Cliffs. Not only was the fourth quarter the strongest we have ever reported, but we achieved full year record revenues",1711,"Thank you, Joe, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Financially speaking, 2010 was an off-the-charts year for Cliffs. Not only was the fourth quarter the strongest we have ever reported, but we achieved full year record revenues, sales margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and free cash flow, among other accomplishments.
These impressive results were driven by increased sales volumes in all of our business segments and significantly higher pricing in the commodities that we sell. Full year consolidated revenues doubled to $4.7 billion, while our full year consolidated sales margin increased nearly 400% over the full year 2009. Net income for the year increased to over $1 billion or $7.49 per diluted share versus last year's $205 million or $1.63 per diluted share.
Cash from operations was over $1.3 billion for the year. This is an impressive increase of over 600% from 2009 and well over a 55% increase from 2008, a year we all thought was an extremely strong year. I think it's important to point out that the $1.3 billion in cash from operations excludes the anticipated cash impact from 2010's previously disclosed arbitrations. We did, however, collect $129 million in January 2011 from the arbitration with Algoma that was settled at the end of December. While the customer has taken legal action in an attempt to vacate the award, this payment will be reflected in 2011’s first quarter cash flows.
For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 74% to a record $1.4 billion compared with $821 million in last year's final quarter. And sales margin was up well over 2.5x that of last year, reaching $482 million in the quarter.
Operating income increased 155% to $397 million, and net income improved to $384 million compared with last year's $108 million. This resulted in $2.82 per diluted share versus the prior year's fourth quarter of $0.82 per diluted share, an increase of almost 250%.
Average revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore rose to $107, up 33%, compared with $80 in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting favorable pricing for seaborne iron ore and hot band steel. The 2010 revenue per ton results were exclusive of a pending arbitration with one of our customers, resulting in an unfavorable $300 million impact to sales margins.  As of today, we're assuming a final resolution and award for this arbitration will occur in 2011, and this is reflected in our outlook. 
When compared to last year's fourth quarter, the current quarter's increase in cost per ton were a direct result of higher profit sharing, employee-related and materials cost, along with royalties and the result of additional sales volume from the purchase of our partners' interest in Wabush Mines. Last year's fourth quarter cost per ton also benefited from purchasing tonnage from some of our mine partners at variable costs. In North American Coal, average revenue per ton for the quarter improved 29% to $117 compared with $91 last year. Average cost per ton increased 39%, which included approximately $20 per ton of DD&A. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, the adverse geological conditions experienced during the quarter had an impact on our production. As a result, cash costs increased 40% from last year's fourth quarter to $122 per ton. For the full year, cash costs were slightly lower year-over-year due to increased volume. As we've indicated before, as the capital projects underway ramp up in this segment, we anticipate significantly higher production volumes and significantly lower costs.
Turning to Asia-Pacific Iron Ore. Average revenue per ton in the quarter was $135, up 110% from last year's $64. This, combined with a per ton cost increase of only 19% to $66, resulted in a sharply higher sales margin per ton of $70 versus $9 in the prior year. On top of 2010's increased spot prices for seaborne iron ore, we realized a premium of about $16 per ton for our lump product, which represents approximately 50% of our sales volume.  In addition, during 2010, we transitioned to pricing mechanisms more closely tied to the seaborne iron ore spot market. This helps us monetize the ongoing increases in spot prices throughout the year, contributing to our outstanding financial performance in this segment.
Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results. During the quarter, Sonoma contributed $59 million to Cliffs' revenue and $23 million to sales margin.
At Amapa, increased pricing and sales volumes resulted in $5.6 million of equity income for Cliffs' 30% interest in the project. During the quarter, we completed a restructuring of the legal entities that hold our 30% investment in the project. This was the primary driver of a noncash deferred tax benefit of $78 million recorded in the quarter.
At December 31, Cliffs had $1.6 billion in cash. During 2010, we were successful in achieving an investment-grade rating and raising $1.4 billion in public senior notes. In addition, we have $325 million in private placement senior notes, for a combined total of $1.7 billion in long-term debt at year end. We have nothing drawn on our revolver, so other than letters of credit, it is fully available to us. 
With our increased liquidity, during the year, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 60% while also investing $1.3 billion in capital projects and acquisition-related assets. For 2011, we have a very optimistic outlook for each of our businesses. This optimism is based on favorable and ongoing global supply and demand fundamentals. We continue to be bullish on pricing in light of the factors Joe mentioned earlier.
For our North American Iron Ore business, we increased our 2011 sales volume estimate to approximately 28 million tons. The higher sales volume is attributable to improved market conditions and to sales recognition timing of 600,000 tons of pellets that have been pushed into 2011. This was related to customer timing requirements and weather-related shipping delays on the Great Lakes.  
Pellet prices in our North American Iron Ore segment are currently estimated to be $140 to $145 per ton in 2011. This estimate includes various assumptions, which were detailed in last night's press release.
Additionally, as is typically the case, we would anticipate our reported average revenue per ton to be lower during the first half of the year than our full year outlook. Due to the seasonality in our businesses, particularly with lot maintenance and the Great Lakes freezing in the winter months, our most profitable quarters tend to be the last two in the calendar year.
We expect to produce 28 million tons in 2011 with average cost per ton expected to be between $65 and $70. Sales and production estimates at our North American Coal segment remain unchanged from the previous guidance. We anticipate producing and selling a total of 6.5 million tons comprised of 4 million tons of low-vol met coal, 1.5 million tons of high-vol met coal and 1 million tons of thermal coal. Average revenue for the full year is expected to be $135 to $140 per ton. Again, I refer you to last night's press release for a complete breakdown of committed and uncommitted tonnage volume, along with the prices contracted to-date. Based on the capital improvements we've made at our coal operations and the increased volume, cost per ton is expected to decline to approximately $105 to $110.
At our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, sales and production guidance remains unchanged at 9 million tons. Revenue per ton is expected to be between $175 and $180, an increase of nearly 50% over the average 2010 revenue of $121 per ton. This significantly higher expectation is based on the assumption of flat spot pricing of $187 at January 31 holds consistent for the remainder of the year.  As many of you know, spot prices fluctuate and you'll make your own assumption about where you believe these will trend for the full year.
Cost per ton is expected to average between $70 and $75, with approximately $12 of DD&A. The year-over-year increase in cost per ton is driven by increased royalties, unfavorable exchange rates and additional mining costs. Also cost per ton will be higher due to our planned infrastructure capital project at this operation. We expect our share of Sonoma's 2011 sales volume will total 1.6 million tons, with an approximate product mix of 60% thermal coal and 40% met coal. 
As many of you are aware, Queensland's flooding has caused significant volatility in Australian coal prices. We would anticipate pricing in this business to move with pricing for Australian met and thermal coal adjusted for our quality. Sonoma's 2011 costs are expected to average $105 to $110 per ton, reflecting unfavorable exchange rates and higher royalty expenses. Amapa is expected to be modestly profitable in 2011.
Currently, we're anticipating 2011 SG&A cost of approximately $200 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our global exploration activities and approximately $35 million for our chromite project.
Based on our outlook, we expect to generate more than $2.7 billion in cash from operations in 2011, more than double 2010's impressive record-breaking results. We anticipate 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of about $300 million in sustaining capital and $400 million in growth and expansion projects.
In last night's release, we provided a further breakdown of capital by business segment. Our plans for the permanent financing in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson are coming together nicely and are supported by our 2011 outlook, including our expected cash flow from operations. The bank term loan is moving forward quite well, and demand to participate has been strong. We still expect to access the capital markets for a portion of our permanent financing. The timing of that will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions. Although we intend to execute our final plans for long-term debt before the closing of the Consolidated Thompson transaction, we expect that our remaining permanent capital structure will be put in place later.
Our fourth quarter performance marked the end of a very exciting and productive year for Cliffs. 2011 has gotten off to a fast start, and we look forward to reporting our progress as the year progresses. Steve, we're ready to open the call for questions."

The strong demand we experienced for our products throughout 2010 has continued into 2011. Global steel production increased approximately 9% from the comparable period in 2010 with Asia experienced even greater production increases. Assuming the space continues, it appears 2011's full year global steel production will match or exceed 2010's record-breaking 1.4 billion tons.
In addition, China's GDP grew 9.7% during the first quarter of 2011 from the prior year year's period, while most observers would not expect that the high-growth rates would be maintained indefinitely, China's targeted urbanization rates suggest moderate growth can be expected. These data points for your support our belief that strong demand for steelmaking raw materials will continue.
Here at Cliffs, we believe continuing to increase our exposure to issue is crucial for capturing increased prices for commodities we sell. We have executed a major step in increasing this exposure with our announced intention to acquire consolidated Thompson Iron Minings Limited. As previously discussed, Consolidated Thompson is a world-class iron ore producer located in Eastern Canada. As I have said before, this acquisition is a low-risk opportunity to accomplish a number of strategic objectives, including building scale by enhancing our Global portfolio of assets, diversifying our customer base with increasing exposure to seaborne markets, establishing relationships with new customers in Asia and expanding our Global presence.
Up close, not only with Consolidated Thompson's Bloom Lake operations enhanced Cliffs profile, production profile, but Consolidated Thompson's two developmental properties Emily and Pepper Lake, also add to its potential longer-term growth project pipeline.
Turning to our large Greenfield Chromite Project. At this time, we are proceeding with our Pre-Feasibility Study, which we will plan to finalize later this year. We continue to work with first nations communities and government officials on key decisions that will make this exciting project a reality.
Now turning to the performance of our core businesses during the quarter. Sales volume in North American Iron Ore increased 19% to 3.5 million tons from, decreased 19% to 3.5 million tons from 4.4 million tons in a year-ago quarter. As most of you know, our first quarter sales volumes are typically the lightest when compared to other quarters due to the winter weather and lock maintenance that occurs on the Great Lakes. In contrast, Cliffs share production volume increased over 30% from the prior year year's comparable quarter.
To meet this year's increased demand for iron ore of our North American Iron mines are running at or near capacity. We have increased our full year sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from 28 million tons and we anticipate placing approximately 1 million  to 2 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations into the seaborne market in 2011.
I am pleased to say since we last reported, we resolved all pending arbitrations and litigations with our North American Iron Ore customers. Due to last year's industry shift from historical annual price settlements for seaborne iron ore to shorter-term pricing mechanisms, we adjusted and in some cases, renegotiated a portion of our long-term customer supply agreements.
All of this negotiating to time and resulted in delayed 2010 revenue recognition and cash collection, ultimately, this change is good for the company. We have established the commercial terms with our existing customers and we are looking, we look forward to working with them in supplying quality steelmaking raw materials. With the negotiated settlements complete, we are optimistic our new established methods for determining prices will bring greater clarity to our pricing assumptions going forward.
Now turning to our North American Coal segment. Yesterday, we reported that during the evening of April 27, our aboveground operations at Oak Grove Mine were struck by severe weather, including a tornado. We're extremely pleased that all of our employees are accounted for and safe with no known injuries. The severe weather did cost a significant amount of damage to the mine's preparation plant and overland conveyor system and this along with over all infrastructure damage in Alabama that will impact customer deliveries to the extent to which we are still assessing.
We are in the early stages of this process and we'll communicate more when we have better visibility, but our first focus is of course safety.
For the first quarter performance, primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the iron ore energy transaction, we reported a sales volume increase of nearly double 2010's first quarter. Since the mid-2010 acquisition, these assets have operated seamlessly and have exceeded our initial expectations based on year-to-date profitability. 
Currently, we're increasing our headcount in anticipation of the lower war Eagle startup, which is scheduled for the second half of 2011. The Lower War Eagle mine was a growth project Cliffs' acquired with iron ore's coal operations. The mine is located in West Virginia and produces a high volume at cold.
During the quarter, we moved our new long wall machine at Pinnacle Mine into a new coal panel. As a result, production was down for 6 weeks during the quarter, which resulted in lower sales volume and increased cost. We believe we are now at a high-quality battle of goal and the longwall panel is running smoothly. We also don't anticipate any additional longwall moved in either legacy mines for the remainder of 2011.
During the quarter, we, along with other producers experienced shipping congestion at port facilities in Virginia, along with Will real corporate EUROS. These countries are due to increased international demand for Central Appalachian met coal. As many of you know, the severe flooding in Queensland, Australia has taken significant volumes of supply out of the seaborne market.
In terms of our large capital projects in North American Coal, we are now complete with both projects at Pinnacle Mine and we have excavated all 800 feet of Oak Grove Mine's new portal. It remains to be seen that the severe weather will impact our plan completion of this project in late summer of this year.
With the adverse geology behind us, the significantly higher coal pricing and completion of a majority of our capital projects, we do however, anticipate significant improvements in our coal operations, not impacted by the severe weather.
Turning to Asia-Pacific Iron Ore. First quarter sales volume was nearly flat at 2.2 million tons when compared to 2.1 million tons in 2010's first quarter. Although quarter-over-quarter sales volume was slightly higher, several significant rain storms hindered production at Cockatoo Island and too much extent that Koolyanobbing. Despite the rain, Cliffs is maintaining it's expected sales and production volume of 9 million tons.
Outside of the weather, another imagine challenge we are monitoring of the shortage of skilled labor in a stronger. Although our operations are significantly stab of the Pilbara where most major mining was really producers are located, we are competing with many mining companies for skilled labor. We believe Cliffs has a competitive employment and that's in place and the safety track record that makes the company a safe and great place to work. That said, this point in time, the shortages of skilled labor will be a major challenge for the industry for the foreseeable future.
Construction has commenced on our infrastructure upgrades at Asia-Pacific Iron Ore, and we are currently finished with the approximately 1/3 of the project to expand production to $11 million contact annually. In the quarter, we performed a fare amount of restricting in advance in preparation for the expansion and we continue to be on schedule for our 2012 completion.
As I mentioned earlier, severe flooding from the destructive tropical cyclones at impacted coal production at Queensland, Australia. While we did not see the construct disruption than many others in Queensland experience, our first quarter sales volume economical was negatively impacted. As a result, we have no lowered Sonoma Coal's full year sales volume expectation to 1.2 million tons from 1.6 million tons. Although it does appear some efforts to restore Queensland's are progressing, the full extent and timing required to restore production to pre-cyclone level is unknown.
In summary, the first quarter was exceptionally busy for cliffs. Looking ahead, our primary focus in 2011 is executing the number of expansion projects we have underway and integrating Consolidated Thompson's operations upon closure of the acquisition. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we continue to execute our long-standing strategy of growing the company.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie, for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook for the coming year. Laurie?"
261738,129706287,119709,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter.

Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Contributing to our significantly increased revenues and operating profit was a negotiated settlement with our limit that Joe discussed on the top of the call.
Although we result the arbitration subsequent to quarter and is much of the settlement related to previously shipped volumes, we recognized portions of the settlement in the first quarter.
This along with increased pricing across-the-board resulted in a 63% increase in first quarter consolidated revenues to a record $1.2 billion, up from $728 million last year.
Sales margin nearly quadrupled to just under $600 million, compared with $150 million in 2010's first quarter. 
Operating income also improved sharply toward a year's first quarter increasing to $562 million from $147 million in 2010.
Net income improved to $423 million or $3.11 per diluted share, compared with $77 million or $0.57 per diluted share last year. While performance on a segment basis, in North American Iron Ore, reported revenue per ton was $168, a 77% increase from last years first quarter results of $95 per ton.
Excluding the positive revenue impact from the ArcelorMittal settlement, average revenue in North American Iron Ore rose 29% to $123 per ton, driven by increased pricing. The settlement with ArcelorMittal also had a favorable impact on cost to goods sold due to a cost reimbursement related to growth Empire Mine where ArcelorMittal is a 21% minority partner.
Reported cost of goods sold per ton decreased 19% to $57 from $70 in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the settlement, North American Iron Ore cost per ton was slightly increased over the prior year's first quarter due to increased cost related to labor, maintenance, supplies and energy, particularly electricity and diesel fee.
In total, the, the ArcelorMittal settlement had a $194 million favorable impact to North American Iron Ore's first quarter reported sales margin. Although we recognized a portion of the sales margin related to this settlement during the first quarter, the $275 million cash payment was not received until this week and, therefore, was not reflected in our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter.
The balance of the settlement will be recognized later in the year when the remaining tons are shipped.
Now turning to North American Coal. Average revenue per ton increased 19% to $124 versus the prior year's revenue of $104 per ton. Our reported average selling price contains a blend of domestic contracts, which we set in January and international contracts, which we set April 1. As a result, our first quarter sales volume included a mix of pricing levels among customers with a portion price of 2011 market prices and a portion, primarily for international customers, at 2010 pricing.
In addition, the first quarter 2011 sales volume is representative of a more diverse product mix, including thermal, high ball and low ball metallurgical coal. As a result of the planned a long normal that Joe discussed earlier, average cost per ton in this segment increased 5% to $126. Overall, this resulted in negative sales margin of $2 per ton, an improvement from last year's $15 per ton sales margin loss. I'd also point out that for the quarter, this business was cash flow positive and trending in the right direction.
In our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, higher pricing for seaborne iron ore and pricing mechanisms more reflective of spot market resulted in first quarter's average revenue per ton more than doubling to $156. Cost per ton increased 22%, which resulted in significantly increased sales margin per ton up $88 when compared to $21 in last year's first quarter. The increased costs were primarily driven by increased royalties funds, higher shipping cost and unfavorable exchange rates. The increased shipping is in preparation for expansion to 11 million tons next year.
Although it decreased production due to weather conditions resulted in lower revenue in sales margin during 2011's first quarter, Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results, contributing $35 million to Cliffs revenue and $11 million to consolidated sales margin.
We are also encouraged by the operating improvements occurring at Amapá. Production volume for the quarter was 1.1 million tons and the operations contributed $2.6 million to first quarter's equity income. Keep in mind that this is an after-tax number, but Amapa continues to ramp up. We anticipated to meaningfully contribute to Cliffs profitability in 2011.
Turning to capital structure and liquidity. At March 31, we have $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Our long-term debt stood at $2.4 billion with no borrowings on our $600 million revolver. Both of these figures include the $700 million tenured tranche of senior notes, closed prior to quarter end. Another $300 million 30-yr tranche of public that was close subsequent to quarter. And as I already indicated, we received $275 million as a result of our settlement with ArcelorMittal, both of which increased our current cash positions. These two items would push our cash close to $3 billion. 
The total amount needed to fund our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson is approximately $5 billion. We withdraw our $1.25 billion term loan and we would expect to use the bridge financing for the remaining piece in the short term. In the longer-term, we anticipate replacing the bridge facility by further accessing the capital markets.
Turning to our updated outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic about our prospects to further enhance value to the continued execution of our strategy. When looking at external factors like the global economic environment and the outlook for steelmaking raw materials, particularly in Asia, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our products.
In addition to the favorable supply and demand dynamics in our markets, the shift to more current pricing mechanisms also bodes well for our future performance.
For our North American Iron Ore business, we are increasing our anticipated 2011 sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from our previous expectation of 28 million tons. We are maintaining our per ton revenue outlook of $140  to $145. I'll refer you to last night's press release for more detailed discussion of the assumptions on which the outlook is based, as well as sensitivities to certain factors used in the supply agreement.
We expect production volume in North American Iron Ore to be approximately 27 million tons in 2011 with average cost to goods sold per ton between $65 and $70, $5 of which is DD&A.
As Joe indicated, the recent severe weather experienced in Alabama and a extent of the damage, both to Cliffs and the infrastructure we depend on, makes it difficult to forecast potential business impact at this time. Prior to this event, we expected 2011 North American Coal sales and production volumes of approximately 6.5 million tons, comprised of 1 million tons of thermal coal, 1.5 million tons of high ball met coal, and 4 million tons of low volatile met coal. With the national disaster in Alabama, we are not providing an update in sales volume, production volume, revenue per ton or cost per ton outlook at this time. Once we are complete with our assessment and have additional information, we will communicate it. 
We Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, sales and production guidance remains unchanged at 9 million tons. As you recall, our previous outlook in this business segment was driven by an assumption that helped the plant's index flat at $187  for 2011.
Since providing that outlook, the plus iron ore index has dipped to as low as $165 in the first quarter and recently backdropped to about $180 per ton. Given this dip in the first quarter and a lower current Platts spot price included within our revenue per ton assumption, we are decreasing of our revenue per ton outlook to $155 to $170. This outlook assumes among other variables that Platts spot price at April 15, 2011, $181 continues to hold for the remainder of the year. Cost per ton is expected to average between $70 and $75, with approximately $12 as DD&A. 
Currently, we are anticipating 2011 SG&A cost of approximately $200 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our Global exploration activities and approximately $40 million for our chromite project.
Based on our current outlook, we expect to generate approximately $2.6 billion in cash from operations. We anticipate 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of about $300 million in sustaining capital and $400 million in growth and expansion projects.
In closing, over the years, the growth and diversity of our geographic revenue base across our business has enabled us to capture today's pricing with the commodities we sell. As we look ahead, we believe our capital projects in progress, along with our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, will only strengthen Cliffs earnings power. To execute this, we're grateful for the hardwork demonstrated by all of our employees and the continued support we receive from our shareholders. 
Steve, we're ready to open the questions."

The strong demand we experienced for our products throughout 2010 has continued into 2011. Global steel production increased approximately 9% from the comparable period in 2010, with Asia",1447,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. The strong demand we experienced for our products throughout 2010 has continued into 2011. Global steel production increased approximately 9% from the comparable period in 2010, with Asia experienced even greater production increases. Assuming this pace continues, it appears 2011's full year global steel production will match or exceed 2010's record-breaking 1.4 billion tons.
In addition, China's GDP grew 9.7% during the first quarter of 2011 from the prior year's period. While most observers would not expect that the high-growth rates would be maintained indefinitely, China's targeted urbanization rates suggest modest -- moderate growth can be expected. These data points further support our belief that strong demand for steelmaking raw materials will continue.
Here at Cliffs, we believe continuing to increase our exposure to Asia is crucial for capturing increased prices for the commodities we sell. We have executed a major step in increasing this exposure with our announced intention to acquire Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Limited. As previously discussed, Consolidated Thompson is a world-class iron ore producer located in Eastern Canada. As I have said before, this acquisition is a low-risk opportunity to accomplish a number of strategic objectives, including building scale by enhancing our global portfolio of assets, diversifying our customer base with increasing exposure to seaborne markets, establishing relationships with new customers in Asia and expanding our global presence.
Upon close, not only would Consolidated Thompson's Bloom Lake operations enhance Cliffs' production profile, but Consolidated Thompson's two developmental properties Lamelee and Peppler Lake, also add to crisp, potential, longer-term growth project pipeline.
Turning to our large greenfield chromite project. At this time, we are proceeding with our pre-feasibility study, which we will plan to finalize later this year. We continue to work with First Nations communities and government officials on key decisions that will make this exciting project a reality.
Now turning to the performance of our core businesses during the quarter. Sales volume in North American Iron Ore increased 19% to 3.5 million tons from 4.4 -- I'm sorry, decreased 19% from -- to 3.5 million tons from 4.4 million tons in a year-ago quarter. As most of you know, our first quarter sales volumes are typically the lightest when compared to other quarters due to the winter weather and locked maintenance that occurs on the Great Lakes. In contrast, Cliffs share production volume increased over 30% from the prior year's comparable quarter.
To meet this year's increased demand for iron ore, our North American iron ore mines are running at/or near capacity. We have increased our full year sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from 28 million tons, and we anticipate placing approximately 1 million  to 2 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations into the seaborne market in 2011.
I am pleased to say, since we last reported, we resolved all pending arbitrations and litigations with our North American iron ore customers. Due to last year's industry shift from historical annual price settlements for seaborne iron ore to shorter-term pricing mechanisms, we adjusted and, in some cases, renegotiated a portion of our long-term customer supply agreements.
Although this negotiating took time and resulted in delayed 2010 revenue recognition and cash collection, ultimately, this change is good for the company. We have established new commercial terms with our existing customers, and we are looking -- we look forward to working with them in supplying quality steelmaking raw materials. With the negotiated settlements complete, we are optimistic our newly established methods for determining price will bring greater clarity to our pricing assumptions going forward.
Now turning to our North American Coal segment. Yesterday, we reported that during the evening of April 27, our aboveground operations at Oak Grove mine were struck by severe weather, including a tornado. We are extremely pleased that all of our employees are accounted for and safe with no known injuries. The severe weather did cause a significant amount of damage to the mine's preparation plant and overland conveyor system. And this, along with over all infrastructure damage in Alabama, will impact customer deliveries to the extent to which we are still assessing. We are in the early stages of this process and we'll communicate more when we have better visibility, but our first focus is of course safety.
For the first quarter's performance, primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the iron ore energy transaction, we reported a sales volume increase of nearly double to 2010's first quarter. Since the mid-2010 acquisition, these assets have operated seamlessly and have exceeded our initial expectations based on year-to-date profitability. 
Currently, we are increasing our headcount in anticipation of the Lower War Eagle startup, which is scheduled for the second half of 2011. The Lower War Eagle mine was a growth project Cliffs acquired with iron ore's coal operations. The mine is located in West Virginia and produces a high bulk of met  [metallurgical] coal.
During the quarter, we moved our new longwall machine at Pinnacle Mine into a new coal panel. As a result, production was down for 6 weeks during the quarter, which resulted in lower sales volume and increased cost. We believe we are now at a high-quality panel of coal and the longwall plow is running smoothly. We also don't anticipate any additional longwall moves in either legacy mine for the remainder of 2011.
During the quarter, we, along with other producers, experienced shipping congestion at port facilities in Virginia, along with railcar shortages. These constraints are due to the increased international demand for Central Appalachian met coal. As many of you know, the severe flooding in Queensland, Australia has taken significant volumes of supply out of the seaborne market.
In terms of our large capital projects in North American coal, we are now complete with both projects at Pinnacle Mine, and we have excavated all 800 feet of Oak Grove Mine's new portal. It remains to be seen if the severe weather will impact our planned completion of this project in late summer of this year.
With the adverse geology behind us, the significantly higher coal pricing and completion of a majority of our capital projects, we do, however, anticipate significant improvements in our coal operations, not impacted by the severe weather.
Turning to Asia-Pacific Iron Ore. First quarter sales volume was nearly flat at 2.2 million tons when compared to 2.1 million tons in 2010's first quarter. Although quarter-over-quarter sales volume was slightly higher, several significant rain storms hindered production at Cockatoo Island, and too much of us are extent [ph] at Koolyanobbing. Despite the rain, Cliffs is maintaining it's 2011 expected sales and production volumes of 9 million tons.
Outside of the weather, another emerging challenge we are monitoring is the shortage of skilled labor in Australia. Although our operations are significantly south of the Pilbara where most major mining Australian producers are located, we are competing with many mining companies for skilled labor. We believe Cliffs has a competitive employment and synergies in place and a safety track record that makes the company a safe and great place to work. That said, at this point in time, the shortage of skilled labor will be a major challenge for the industry for the foreseeable future.
Construction has commenced on our infrastructure upgrades at Asia-Pacific Iron Ore, and we are currently finished with the approximately 1/3 of the project to expand production to $11 million contact annually. In the quarter, we performed a fair amount of prestripping, in advance, in preparation for the expansion, and we continue to be on schedule for our 2012 completion.
As I mentioned earlier, severe flooding from the destructive tropical cyclones have impacted coal production in Queensland, Australia. While we did not see the disruption that many others in Queensland experienced, our first quarter sales volume at Sonoma Coal was negatively impacted. As a result, we have lowered Sonoma Coal's full year sales volume expectation to 1.2 million tons from 1.6 million tons. Although it does appear some efforts to restore Queensland's infrastructure are progressing, the full extent and timing required to restore production to precyclone levels is unknown.
In summary, the first quarter was exceptionally busy for Cliffs. Looking ahead, our primary focus in 2011 is executing the number of expansion projects we have underway and integrating Consolidated Thompson's operations upon closure of the acquisition. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, as we continue to execute our long-standing strategy of growing the company.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie, for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook for the coming year. Laurie?"
261738,129706287,119919,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Contributing to our significantly increased revenues and operating profit with a",1506,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Contributing to our significantly increased revenues and operating profit with a negotiated settlement with ArcelorMittal that Joe discussed at the top of the call.
Although we resolved the arbitration subsequent to quarter end, because much of the settlement related to previously shipped volumes, we recognized portions of the settlement in the first quarter. This, along with increased pricing across-the-board, resulted in a 63% increase in first quarter consolidated revenues to a record $1.2 billion, up from $728 million last year.
Sales margin nearly quadrupled to just under $600 million, compared with $150 million in 2010's first quarter. 
Operating income also improved sharply toward a year's first quarter, increasing to $562 million from $147 million in 2010. Net income improved to $423 million or $3.11 per diluted share compared with $77 million or $0.57 per diluted share last year. 
For our performance on a segment basis, in North American Iron Ore, reported revenue per ton was $168, a 77% increase from last year's first quarter results of $95 per ton. Excluding the positive revenue impact from the ArcelorMittal settlement, average revenue in North American Iron Ore rose 29% to $123 per ton, driven by increased pricing. The settlement with ArcelorMittal also had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold, due to a cost-sharing reimbursement related to Cliffs' Empire mine where ArcelorMittal is a 21% minority partner.
Reported cost of goods sold per ton decreased 19% to $57 from $70 in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the settlement, North American Iron Ore cost per ton were slightly increased over the prior year's first quarter due to increased costs related to labor, maintenance, supplies and energy, particularly electricity and diesel fuel.
In total, the, the ArcelorMittal settlement had a $194 million favorable impact to North American Iron Ore's first quarter reported sales margin. Although we recognized a portion of the sales margin related to this settlement during the first quarter, the $275 million cash payment was not received until this week and, therefore, was not reflected in our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. The balance of the settlement will be recognized later in the year when the remaining tons are shipped.
Now turning to North American Coal. Average revenue per ton increased 19% to $124 versus the prior year's revenue of $104 per ton. Our reported average selling price contains a blend of domestic contracts, which we set in January, and international contracts, which we set April 1. As a result, our first quarter sales volume included a mix of pricing levels among customers with a portion price at 2011 market prices, and a portion primarily for international customers at 2010 pricing.
In addition, the first quarter 2011 sales volume is representative of a more diverse product mix, including thermal, high-vol [high-volatile] and low-vol [low-volatile] metallurgical coal. As a result of the planned longwall move that Joe discussed earlier, average cost per ton in this segment increased 5% to $126. Overall, this resulted in negative sales margin of $2 per ton, an improvement from last year's $15 per ton sales margin loss. I'd also point out that for the quarter, this business was cash flow positive and trending in the right direction.
In our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, higher pricing for seaborne iron ore and pricing mechanisms more reflective of spot market resulted in first quarter's average revenue per ton more than doubling to $156. Cost per ton increased 22%, which resulted in significantly increased sales margin per ton, up $88 when compared to $21 in last year's first quarter. The increased costs were primarily driven by increased royalty expense, higher stripping costs and unfavorable exchange rates. The increased stripping is in preparation for expansion to 11 million tons next year.
Although decreased production due to weather conditions resulted in lower revenue and sales margin during 2011's first quarter, Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results, contributing $35 million to Cliffs' revenue and $11 million to consolidated sales margin.
We are also encouraged by the operating improvements occurring at Amapá. Production volume for the quarter was 1.1 million tons and the operations contributed $2.6 million to first quarter's equity income. Keep in mind that this is an after-tax number, as Amapá continues to ramp up, we anticipate it to meaningfully contribute to Cliffs' profitability in 2011.
Turning to capital structure and liquidity. At March 31, we held $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Our long-term debt stood at $2.4 billion with no borrowings on our $600 million revolver. Both of these figures include the $700 million tenured tranche of senior notes, closed prior to quarter end. Another $300 million 30-year tranche of public debt was closed subsequent to quarter end. And as I already indicated, we received $275 million as a result of our settlement with ArcelorMittal, both of which increased our current cash positions. These two items would push our cash close to $3 billion. 
The total amount needed to fund our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson is approximately $5 billion. We would draw on our $1.25 billion term loan, and we would expect to use the bridge financing for the remaining piece in the short term. In the longer term, we anticipate replacing the bridged facility by further accessing the capital markets.
Turning to our updated outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic about our prospects to further enhance value to the continued execution of our strategy. When looking at external factors like the global economic environment and the outlook for steelmaking raw materials, particularly in Asia, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our products.
In addition to the favorable supply-and-demand dynamics in our markets, the shift to more current pricing mechanisms also bodes well for our future performance.
For our North American Iron Ore business, we are increasing our anticipated 2011 sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from our previous expectation of 28 million tons. We are maintaining our per-ton revenue outlook of $140 to $145. I'll refer you to last night's press release for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions on which the outlook is based, as well as sensitivities to certain factors used in the supply agreement.
We expect production volume in North American Iron Ore to be approximately 27 million tons in 2011, with average cost to goods sold per ton between $65 and $70, $5 of which is DD&A.
As Joe indicated, the recent severe weather experienced in Alabama and the extent of the damage, both to Cliffs and the infrastructure we depend on, makes it difficult to accurately forecast potential business impact at this time. Prior to this event, we expect that 2011 North American Coal sales and production volumes of approximately 6.5 million tons, comprised of 1 million tons of thermal coal, 1.5 million tons of high-vol met coal, and 4 million tons of low-vol met coal. With the natural disaster in Alabama, we are not providing an update in sales volume, production volume, revenue-per-ton or cost-per-ton outlook at this time. Once we are complete with our assessment and have additional information, we will communicate it. 
Our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, sales and production guidance remains unchanged at 9 million tons. As you recall, our previous outlook in this business segment was driven by an assumption that held the Platts index flat at $187 for 2011.
Since providing that outlook, the Platts iron ore index has dipped to as low as $165 in the first quarter and recently backed up to about $180 per ton. Given this dip in the first quarter and a lower current Platts spot price included within our revenue-per-ton assumption, we are decreasing our revenue-per-ton outlook to $155 to $170. This outlook assumes, among other variables, that Platts spot price at April 15, 2011, of $181 continues to hold for the remainder of the year. Cost per ton is expected to average between $70 and $75 with approximately $12 of DD&A. 
Currently, we are anticipating 2011 SG&A cost of approximately $200 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our global exploration activities and approximately $40 million for our chromite project.
Based on our current outlook, we expect to generate approximately $2.6 billion in cash from operations. We anticipate 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of about $300 million in sustaining capital and $400 million in growth and expansion projects.
In closing, over the years, the growth and diversity of our geographic revenue base across our business has enabled us to capture today's pricing with the commodities we sell. As we look ahead, we believe our capital projects in progress, along with our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, will only strengthen Cliffs' earnings power. To execute this, we're grateful for the hard work demonstrated by all of our employees and the continued support we receive from our shareholders. 
Steve, we're ready to open the call for questions."

261738,129706287,120011,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. The strong demand we experienced for our products throughout 2010 has continued into 2011. Global steel production increased approximately 9% from the comparable period in 2010, with Asia",1442,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. The strong demand we experienced for our products throughout 2010 has continued into 2011. Global steel production increased approximately 9% from the comparable period in 2010, with Asia experience even greater production increases. Assuming this pace continues, it appears 2011's full year global steel production will match or exceed 2010's record-breaking 1.4 billion tons.
In addition, China's GDP grew 9.7% during the first quarter of 2011 from the prior year's period. While most observers would not expect that these high-growth rates would be maintained indefinitely, China's targeted urbanization rates suggest modest -- moderate growth can be expected. These data points further support our belief that strong demand for steelmaking raw materials will continue.
Here at Cliffs, we believe continuing to increase our exposure to Asia is crucial for capturing increased prices for the commodities we sell. We have executed a major step in increasing this exposure with our announced intention to acquire Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Limited. As previously discussed, Consolidated Thompson is a world-class iron ore producer located in Eastern Canada. As I have said before, this acquisition is a low-risk opportunity to accomplish a number of strategic objectives, including building scale by enhancing our global portfolio of assets, diversifying our customer base with increasing exposure to seaborne markets, establishing relationships with new customers in Asia and expanding our global presence.
Upon close, not only would Consolidated Thompson's Bloom Lake operations enhance Cliffs' production profile, but Consolidated Thompson's two developmental properties, Lamelee and Peppler Lake, also add to Cliffs’ potential, longer-term growth project pipeline.
Turning to our large greenfield chromite project. At this time, we are proceeding with our pre-feasibility study, which we will plan to finalize later this year. We continue to work with First Nations communities and government officials on key decisions that will make this exciting project a reality.
Now turning to the performance of our core businesses during the quarter. Sales volume in North American Iron Ore increased 19% to 3.5 million tons from 4.4 -- I'm sorry, decreased 19% from -- to 3.5 million tons from 4.4 million tons in a year-ago quarter. As most of you know, our first quarter sales volumes are typically the lightest when compared to other quarters due to the winter weather and locked maintenance that occurs on the Great Lakes. In contrast, Cliffs’ share of production volume increased over 30% from the prior year's comparable quarter.
To meet this year's increased demand for iron ore, our North American iron ore mines are running at or near capacity. We have increased our full year sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from 28 million tons, and we anticipate placing approximately 1 million to 2 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations into the seaborne market in 2011.
I am pleased to say, since we last reported, we resolved all pending arbitrations and litigations with our North American iron ore customers. Due to last year's industry shift from historical annual price settlements for seaborne iron ore to shorter-term pricing mechanisms, we adjusted and, in some cases, renegotiated a portion of our long-term customer supply agreements.
Although this negotiating took time and resulted in delayed 2010 revenue recognition and cash collection, ultimately, this change is good for the company. We have established new commercial terms with our existing customers, and we are looking -- we look forward to working with them in supplying quality steelmaking raw materials. With the negotiated settlements complete, we are optimistic our newly established methods for determining price will bring greater clarity to our pricing assumptions going forward.
Now turning to our North American Coal segment. Yesterday, we reported that during the evening of April 27, our aboveground operations at Oak Grove mine were struck by severe weather, including a tornado. We are extremely pleased that all of our employees are accounted for and safe with no known injuries. The severe weather did cause a significant amount of damage to the mine's preparation plant and overland conveyor system. And this, along with over all infrastructure damage in Alabama, will impact customer deliveries, the extent to which we are still assessing. We are in the early stages of this process and we'll communicate more when we have better visibility, but our first focus is, of course, safety.
For the first quarter's performance, primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the iron ore energy transaction, we reported a sales volume increase of nearly double 2010's first quarter. Since the mid-2010 acquisition, these assets have operated seamlessly and have exceeded our initial expectations based on year-to-date profitability. 
Currently, we are increasing our headcount in anticipation of the Lower War Eagle startup, which is scheduled for the second half of 2011. The Lower War Eagle mine was a growth project Cliffs acquired with INR's coal operations. The mine is located in West Virginia and produces a high bulk of met [metallurgical] coal.
During the quarter, we moved our new longwall machine at Pinnacle Mine into a new coal panel. As a result, production was down for 6 weeks during the quarter, which resulted in lower sales volume and increased cost. We believe we are now at a high-quality panel of coal and the longwall plow is running smoothly. We also don't anticipate any additional longwall moves in either legacy mine for the remainder of 2011.
During the quarter, we, along with other producers, experienced shipping congestion at port facilities in Virginia, along with railcar shortages. These constraints are due to the increased international demand for Central Appalachian met coal. As many of you know, the severe flooding in Queensland, Australia has taken significant volumes of supply out of the seaborne market.
In terms of our large capital projects in North American coal, we are now complete with both projects at Pinnacle Mine, and we have excavated all 800 feet of Oak Grove Mine's new portal. It remains to be seen if the severe weather will impact our planned completion of this project in late summer of this year.
With the adverse geology behind us, the significantly higher coal pricing and completion of a majority of our capital projects, we do, however, anticipate significant improvements in our coal operations not impacted by the severe weather.
Turning to Asia-Pacific Iron Ore. First quarter sales volume was nearly flat at 2.2 million tons when compared to 2.1 million tons in 2010's first quarter. Although quarter-over-quarter sales volume was slightly higher, several significant rain storms hindered production at Cockatoo Island, and to much lesser extent at Koolyanobbing. Despite the rain, Cliffs is maintaining its 2011 expected sales and production volumes of 9 million tons.
Outside of the weather, another emerging challenge we are monitoring is the shortage of skilled labor in Australia. Although our operations are significantly south of the Pilbara where most major mining Australian producers are located, we are competing with many mining companies for skilled labor. We believe Cliffs has a competitive employment incentives [ph] in place and a safety track record that makes the company a safe and great place to work. That said, at this point in time, the shortage of skilled labor will be a major challenge for the industry for the foreseeable future.
Construction has commenced on our infrastructure upgrades at Asia-Pacific Iron Ore, and we are currently finished with approximately 1/3 of the project to expand production to 11 million tons annually. In the quarter, we performed a fair amount of pre-stripping, in advance and preparation for the expansion, and we continue to be on schedule for our 2012 completion.
As I mentioned earlier, severe flooding from the destructive tropical cyclones have impacted coal production in Queensland, Australia. While we did not see the disruption that many others in Queensland experienced, our first quarter sales volume at Sonoma Coal was negatively impacted. As a result, we have lowered Sonoma Coal's full year sales volume expectation to 1.2 million tons from 1.6 million tons. Although it does appear some efforts to restore Queensland's infrastructure are progressing, the full extent and timing required to restore production to pre-cyclone levels is unknown.
In summary, the first quarter was exceptionally busy for Cliffs. Looking ahead, our primary focus in 2011 is executing the number of expansion projects we have underway and integrating Consolidated Thompson's operations upon closure of the acquisition. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, as we continue to execute our long-standing strategy of growing the company.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie, for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook of the coming year. Laurie?"
261738,129706287,120011,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Contributing to our significantly increased revenues and operating profit with t",1505,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Contributing to our significantly increased revenues and operating profit with the negotiated settlement with ArcelorMittal that Joe discussed at the top of the call.
Although we resolved the arbitration subsequent to quarter end, because much of the settlement related to previously shipped volumes, we recognized portions of the settlement in the first quarter. This, along with increased pricing across-the-board, resulted in a 63% increase in first quarter consolidated revenues to a record $1.2 billion, up from $728 million last year.
Sales margin nearly quadrupled to just under $600 million, compared with $150 million in 2010's first quarter. 
Operating income also improved sharply for the year's first quarter, increasing to $562 million from $147 million in 2010. Net income improved to $423 million or $3.11 per diluted share compared with $77 million or $0.57 per diluted share last year. 
For our performance on a segment basis, in North American Iron Ore, reported revenue per ton was $168, a 77% increase from last year's first quarter results of $95 per ton. Excluding the positive revenue impact from the ArcelorMittal settlement, average revenue in North American Iron Ore rose 29% to $123 per ton, driven by increased pricing. The settlement with ArcelorMittal also had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold, due to a cost-sharing reimbursement related to Cliffs' Empire mine where ArcelorMittal is a 21% minority partner.
Reported cost of goods sold per ton decreased 19% to $57 from $70 in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the settlement, North American Iron Ore cost per ton were slightly increased over the prior year's first quarter due to increased costs related to labor, maintenance, supplies and energy, particularly electricity and diesel fuel.
In total, the ArcelorMittal settlement had a $194 million favorable impact to North American Iron Ore's first quarter reported sales margin. Although we recognized a portion of the sales margin related to this settlement during the first quarter, the $275 million cash payment was not received until this week and, therefore, was not reflected in our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. The balance of the settlement will be recognized later in the year when the remaining tons are shipped.
Now turning to North American Coal. Average revenue per ton increased 19% to $124 versus the prior year's revenue of $104 per ton. Our reported average selling price contains a blend of domestic contracts, which we set in January, and international contracts, which we set April 1. As a result, our first quarter sales volume included a mix of pricing levels among customers with a portion priced at 2011 market prices, and a portion primarily for international customers, at 2010 pricing.
In addition, the first quarter 2011 sales volume is representative of a more diverse product mix, including thermal, high-vol [high-volatile] and low-vol [low-volatile] metallurgical coal. As a result of the planned longwall move that Joe discussed earlier, average cost per ton in this segment increased 5% to $126. Overall, this resulted in negative sales margin of $2 per ton, an improvement from last year's $16 per ton sales margin loss. I'd also point out that for the quarter, this business was cash flow positive and trending in the right direction.
In our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, higher pricing for seaborne iron ore and pricing mechanisms more reflective of spot market resulted in first quarter's average revenue per ton more than doubling to $156. Cost per ton increased 22%, which resulted in significantly increased sales margin per ton, up $88 when compared to $21 in last year's first quarter. The increased costs were primarily driven by increased royalty expense, higher stripping costs and unfavorable exchange rates. The increased stripping is in preparation for expansion to 11 million tons next year.
Although decreased production due to weather conditions resulted in lower revenue and sales margin during 2011's first quarter, Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results, contributing $35 million to Cliffs' revenue and $11 million to consolidated sales margins.
We are also encouraged by the operating improvements occurring at Amapá. Production volume for the quarter was 1.1 million tons and the operations contributed $2.6 million to first quarter's equity income. Keeping in mind that this is an after-tax number, as Amapá continues to ramp up, we anticipate it to meaningfully contribute to Cliffs' profitability in 2011.
Turning to capital structure and liquidity. At March 31, we held $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Our long-term debt stood at $2.4 billion with no borrowings on our $600 million revolver. Both of these figures include the $700 million tenured tranche of senior notes, closed prior to quarter end. Another $300 million 30-year tranche of public debt was closed subsequent to quarter end. And as I already indicated, we received $275 million as a result of our settlement with ArcelorMittal, both of which increased our current cash positions. These two items would push our cash close to $3 billion. 
The total amount needed to fund our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson is approximately $5 billion. We would draw on our $1.25 billion term loan, and we would expect to use the bridge financing for the remaining piece in the short term. In the longer term, we anticipate replacing the bridged facility by further accessing the capital markets.
Turning to our updated outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic about our prospects to further enhance value through the continued execution of our strategy. When looking at external factors like the global economic environment and the outlook for steelmaking raw materials, particularly in Asia, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our products.
In addition to the favorable supply-and-demand dynamics in our markets, the shift to more current pricing mechanisms also bodes well for our future performance.
For our North American Iron Ore business, we are increasing our anticipated 2011 sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from our previous expectation of 28 million tons. We are maintaining our per-ton revenue outlook of $140 to $145. I'll refer you to last night's press release for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions on which the outlook is based, as well as sensitivities to certain factors used in the supply agreement.
We expect production volume in North American Iron Ore to be approximately 27 million tons in 2011, with average cost of goods sold per ton between $65 and $70, $5 of which is DD&A.
As Joe indicated, the recent severe weather experienced in Alabama and the extent of the damage, both to Cliffs and the infrastructure we depend on, makes it difficult to accurately forecast potential business impact at this time. Prior to this event, we expect that 2011 North American Coal sales and production volumes of approximately 6.5 million tons, comprised of 1 million tons of thermal coal, 1.5 million tons of high-vol met coal, and 4 million tons of low-vol met coal. With the natural disaster in Alabama, we are not providing an updated sales volume, production volume, revenue-per-ton or cost-per-ton outlook at this time. Once we are complete with our assessment and have additional information, we will communicate it. 
At our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, sales and production guidance remains unchanged at 9 million tons. As you recall, our previous outlook in this business segment was driven by an assumption that held the Platts index flat at $187 for 2011.
Since providing that outlook, the Platts iron ore index has dipped to as low as $165 in the first quarter and recently back up to about $180 per ton. Given this dip in the first quarter and a lower current Platts spot price included within our revenue-per-ton assumption, we are decreasing our revenue-per-ton outlook to $165 to $170. This outlook assumes, among other variables, that Platts spot price at April 15, 2011, of $181 continues to hold for the remainder of the year. Cost per ton is expected to average between $70 and $75 with approximately $12 of DD&A. 
Currently, we are anticipating 2011 SG&A costs of approximately $200 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our global exploration activities and approximately $40 million for our chromite project.
Based on our current outlook, we expect to generate approximately $2.6 billion in cash from operations. We anticipate 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of about $300 million in sustaining capital and $400 million in growth and expansion projects.
In closing, over the years, the growth and diversity of our geographic revenue base across our business has enabled us to capture today's pricing for the commodities we sell. As we look ahead, we believe our capital projects in progress, along with our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, will only strengthen Cliffs' earnings power. To execute this, we're grateful for the hard work demonstrated by all of our employees and the continued support we receive from our shareholders. 
Steve, we're ready to open the call for questions."

The strong demand we experienced for our products throughout 2010 has continued into 2011. Global steel production increased approximately 9% from the comparable period in 2010, with Asia",1442,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. The strong demand we experienced for our products throughout 2010 has continued into 2011. Global steel production increased approximately 9% from the comparable period in 2010, with Asia experience even greater production increases. Assuming this pace continues, it appears 2011's full year global steel production will match or exceed 2010's record-breaking 1.4 billion tons.
In addition, China's GDP grew 9.7% during the first quarter of 2011 from the prior year's period. While most observers would not expect that these high-growth rates would be maintained indefinitely, China's targeted urbanization rates suggest modest -- moderate growth can be expected. These data points further support our belief that strong demand for steelmaking raw materials will continue.
Here at Cliffs, we believe continuing to increase our exposure to Asia is crucial for capturing increased prices for the commodities we sell. We have executed a major step in increasing this exposure with our announced intention to acquire Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Limited. As previously discussed, Consolidated Thompson is a world-class iron ore producer located in Eastern Canada. As I have said before, this acquisition is a low-risk opportunity to accomplish a number of strategic objectives, including building scale by enhancing our global portfolio of assets, diversifying our customer base with increasing exposure to seaborne markets, establishing relationships with new customers in Asia and expanding our global presence.
Upon close, not only would Consolidated Thompson's Bloom Lake operations enhance Cliffs' production profile, but Consolidated Thompson's two developmental properties, Lamelee and Peppler Lake, also add to Cliffs’ potential, longer-term growth project pipeline.
Turning to our large greenfield chromite project. At this time, we are proceeding with our pre-feasibility study, which we will plan to finalize later this year. We continue to work with First Nations communities and government officials on key decisions that will make this exciting project a reality.
Now turning to the performance of our core businesses during the quarter. Sales volume in North American Iron Ore increased 19% to 3.5 million tons from 4.4 -- I'm sorry, decreased 19% from -- to 3.5 million tons from 4.4 million tons in a year-ago quarter. As most of you know, our first quarter sales volumes are typically the lightest when compared to other quarters due to the winter weather and locked maintenance that occurs on the Great Lakes. In contrast, Cliffs’ share of production volume increased over 30% from the prior year's comparable quarter.
To meet this year's increased demand for iron ore, our North American iron ore mines are running at or near capacity. We have increased our full year sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from 28 million tons, and we anticipate placing approximately 1 million to 2 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations into the seaborne market in 2011.
I am pleased to say, since we last reported, we resolved all pending arbitrations and litigations with our North American iron ore customers. Due to last year's industry shift from historical annual price settlements for seaborne iron ore to shorter-term pricing mechanisms, we adjusted and, in some cases, renegotiated a portion of our long-term customer supply agreements.
Although this negotiating took time and resulted in delayed 2010 revenue recognition and cash collection, ultimately, this change is good for the company. We have established new commercial terms with our existing customers, and we are looking -- we look forward to working with them in supplying quality steelmaking raw materials. With the negotiated settlements complete, we are optimistic our newly established methods for determining price will bring greater clarity to our pricing assumptions going forward.
Now turning to our North American Coal segment. Yesterday, we reported that during the evening of April 27, our aboveground operations at Oak Grove mine were struck by severe weather, including a tornado. We are extremely pleased that all of our employees are accounted for and safe with no known injuries. The severe weather did cause a significant amount of damage to the mine's preparation plant and overland conveyor system. And this, along with over all infrastructure damage in Alabama, will impact customer deliveries, the extent to which we are still assessing. We are in the early stages of this process and we'll communicate more when we have better visibility, but our first focus is, of course, safety.
For the first quarter's performance, primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the iron ore energy transaction, we reported a sales volume increase of nearly double 2010's first quarter. Since the mid-2010 acquisition, these assets have operated seamlessly and have exceeded our initial expectations based on year-to-date profitability. 
Currently, we are increasing our headcount in anticipation of the Lower War Eagle startup, which is scheduled for the second half of 2011. The Lower War Eagle mine was a growth project Cliffs acquired with INR's coal operations. The mine is located in West Virginia and produces a high bulk of met [metallurgical] coal.
During the quarter, we moved our new longwall machine at Pinnacle Mine into a new coal panel. As a result, production was down for 6 weeks during the quarter, which resulted in lower sales volume and increased cost. We believe we are now at a high-quality panel of coal and the longwall plow is running smoothly. We also don't anticipate any additional longwall moves in either legacy mine for the remainder of 2011.
During the quarter, we, along with other producers, experienced shipping congestion at port facilities in Virginia, along with railcar shortages. These constraints are due to the increased international demand for Central Appalachian met coal. As many of you know, the severe flooding in Queensland, Australia has taken significant volumes of supply out of the seaborne market.
In terms of our large capital projects in North American coal, we are now complete with both projects at Pinnacle Mine, and we have excavated all 800 feet of Oak Grove Mine's new portal. It remains to be seen if the severe weather will impact our planned completion of this project in late summer of this year.
With the adverse geology behind us, the significantly higher coal pricing and completion of a majority of our capital projects, we do, however, anticipate significant improvements in our coal operations not impacted by the severe weather.
Turning to Asia-Pacific Iron Ore. First quarter sales volume was nearly flat at 2.2 million tons when compared to 2.1 million tons in 2010's first quarter. Although quarter-over-quarter sales volume was slightly higher, several significant rain storms hindered production at Cockatoo Island, and to much lesser extent at Koolyanobbing. Despite the rain, Cliffs is maintaining its 2011 expected sales and production volumes of 9 million tons.
Outside of the weather, another emerging challenge we are monitoring is the shortage of skilled labor in Australia. Although our operations are significantly south of the Pilbara where most major mining Australian producers are located, we are competing with many mining companies for skilled labor. We believe Cliffs has a competitive employment incentives [ph] in place and a safety track record that makes the company a safe and great place to work. That said, at this point in time, the shortage of skilled labor will be a major challenge for the industry for the foreseeable future.
Construction has commenced on our infrastructure upgrades at Asia-Pacific Iron Ore, and we are currently finished with approximately 1/3 of the project to expand production to 11 million tons annually. In the quarter, we performed a fair amount of pre-stripping, in advance and preparation for the expansion, and we continue to be on schedule for our 2012 completion.
As I mentioned earlier, severe flooding from the destructive tropical cyclones have impacted coal production in Queensland, Australia. While we did not see the disruption that many others in Queensland experienced, our first quarter sales volume at Sonoma Coal was negatively impacted. As a result, we have lowered Sonoma Coal's full year sales volume expectation to 1.2 million tons from 1.6 million tons. Although it does appear some efforts to restore Queensland's infrastructure are progressing, the full extent and timing required to restore production to pre-cyclone levels is unknown.
In summary, the first quarter was exceptionally busy for Cliffs. Looking ahead, our primary focus in 2011 is executing the number of expansion projects we have underway and integrating Consolidated Thompson's operations upon closure of the acquisition. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, as we continue to execute our long-standing strategy of growing the company.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie, for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook of the coming year. Laurie?"
261738,129706287,120316,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2011",2011-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Contributing to our significantly increased revenues and operating profit with t",1505,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Once again, Cliffs achieved another record-breaking financial performance, which marks our fourth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Contributing to our significantly increased revenues and operating profit with the negotiated settlement with ArcelorMittal that Joe discussed at the top of the call.
Although we resolved the arbitration subsequent to quarter end, because much of the settlement related to previously shipped volumes, we recognized portions of the settlement in the first quarter. This, along with increased pricing across-the-board, resulted in a 63% increase in first quarter consolidated revenues to a record $1.2 billion, up from $728 million last year.
Sales margin nearly quadrupled to just under $600 million, compared with $150 million in 2010's first quarter. 
Operating income also improved sharply for the year's first quarter, increasing to $562 million from $147 million in 2010. Net income improved to $423 million or $3.11 per diluted share compared with $77 million or $0.57 per diluted share last year. 
For our performance on a segment basis, in North American Iron Ore, reported revenue per ton was $168, a 77% increase from last year's first quarter results of $95 per ton. Excluding the positive revenue impact from the ArcelorMittal settlement, average revenue in North American Iron Ore rose 29% to $123 per ton, driven by increased pricing. The settlement with ArcelorMittal also had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold, due to a cost-sharing reimbursement related to Cliffs' Empire mine where ArcelorMittal is a 21% minority partner.
Reported cost of goods sold per ton decreased 19% to $57 from $70 in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the settlement, North American Iron Ore cost per ton were slightly increased over the prior year's first quarter due to increased costs related to labor, maintenance, supplies and energy, particularly electricity and diesel fuel.
In total, the ArcelorMittal settlement had a $194 million favorable impact to North American Iron Ore's first quarter reported sales margin. Although we recognized a portion of the sales margin related to this settlement during the first quarter, the $275 million cash payment was not received until this week and, therefore, was not reflected in our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. The balance of the settlement will be recognized later in the year when the remaining tons are shipped.
Now turning to North American Coal. Average revenue per ton increased 19% to $124 versus the prior year's revenue of $104 per ton. Our reported average selling price contains a blend of domestic contracts, which we set in January, and international contracts, which we set April 1. As a result, our first quarter sales volume included a mix of pricing levels among customers with a portion priced at 2011 market prices, and a portion primarily for international customers, at 2010 pricing.
In addition, the first quarter 2011 sales volume is representative of a more diverse product mix, including thermal, high-vol [high-volatile] and low-vol [low-volatile] metallurgical coal. As a result of the planned longwall move that Joe discussed earlier, average cost per ton in this segment increased 5% to $126. Overall, this resulted in negative sales margin of $2 per ton, an improvement from last year's $16 per ton sales margin loss. I'd also point out that for the quarter, this business was cash flow positive and trending in the right direction.
In our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, higher pricing for seaborne iron ore and pricing mechanisms more reflective of spot market resulted in first quarter's average revenue per ton more than doubling to $156. Cost per ton increased 22%, which resulted in significantly increased sales margin per ton, up $88 when compared to $21 in last year's first quarter. The increased costs were primarily driven by increased royalty expense, higher stripping costs and unfavorable exchange rates. The increased stripping is in preparation for expansion to 11 million tons next year.
Although decreased production due to weather conditions resulted in lower revenue and sales margin during 2011's first quarter, Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results, contributing $35 million to Cliffs' revenue and $11 million to consolidated sales margins.
We are also encouraged by the operating improvements occurring at Amapá. Production volume for the quarter was 1.1 million tons and the operations contributed $2.6 million to first quarter's equity income. Keeping in mind that this is an after-tax number, as Amapá continues to ramp up, we anticipate it to meaningfully contribute to Cliffs' profitability in 2011.
Turning to capital structure and liquidity. At March 31, we held $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Our long-term debt stood at $2.4 billion with no borrowings on our $600 million revolver. Both of these figures include the $700 million tenured tranche of senior notes, closed prior to quarter end. Another $300 million 30-year tranche of public debt was closed subsequent to quarter end. And as I already indicated, we received $275 million as a result of our settlement with ArcelorMittal, both of which increased our current cash positions. These two items would push our cash close to $3 billion. 
The total amount needed to fund our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson is approximately $5 billion. We would draw on our $1.25 billion term loan, and we would expect to use the bridge financing for the remaining piece in the short term. In the longer term, we anticipate replacing the bridged facility by further accessing the capital markets.
Turning to our updated outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic about our prospects to further enhance value through the continued execution of our strategy. When looking at external factors like the global economic environment and the outlook for steelmaking raw materials, particularly in Asia, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our products.
In addition to the favorable supply-and-demand dynamics in our markets, the shift to more current pricing mechanisms also bodes well for our future performance.
For our North American Iron Ore business, we are increasing our anticipated 2011 sales volume expectation to 29 million tons from our previous expectation of 28 million tons. We are maintaining our per-ton revenue outlook of $140 to $145. I'll refer you to last night's press release for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions on which the outlook is based, as well as sensitivities to certain factors used in the supply agreement.
We expect production volume in North American Iron Ore to be approximately 27 million tons in 2011, with average cost of goods sold per ton between $65 and $70, $5 of which is DD&A.
As Joe indicated, the recent severe weather experienced in Alabama and the extent of the damage, both to Cliffs and the infrastructure we depend on, makes it difficult to accurately forecast potential business impact at this time. Prior to this event, we expect that 2011 North American Coal sales and production volumes of approximately 6.5 million tons, comprised of 1 million tons of thermal coal, 1.5 million tons of high-vol met coal, and 4 million tons of low-vol met coal. With the natural disaster in Alabama, we are not providing an updated sales volume, production volume, revenue-per-ton or cost-per-ton outlook at this time. Once we are complete with our assessment and have additional information, we will communicate it. 
At our Asia-Pacific Iron Ore operations, sales and production guidance remains unchanged at 9 million tons. As you recall, our previous outlook in this business segment was driven by an assumption that held the Platts index flat at $187 for 2011.
Since providing that outlook, the Platts iron ore index has dipped to as low as $165 in the first quarter and recently back up to about $180 per ton. Given this dip in the first quarter and a lower current Platts spot price included within our revenue-per-ton assumption, we are decreasing our revenue-per-ton outlook to $165 to $170. This outlook assumes, among other variables, that Platts spot price at April 15, 2011, of $181 continues to hold for the remainder of the year. Cost per ton is expected to average between $70 and $75 with approximately $12 of DD&A. 
Currently, we are anticipating 2011 SG&A costs of approximately $200 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our global exploration activities and approximately $40 million for our chromite project.
Based on our current outlook, we expect to generate approximately $2.6 billion in cash from operations. We anticipate 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of about $300 million in sustaining capital and $400 million in growth and expansion projects.
In closing, over the years, the growth and diversity of our geographic revenue base across our business has enabled us to capture today's pricing for the commodities we sell. As we look ahead, we believe our capital projects in progress, along with our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, will only strengthen Cliffs' earnings power. To execute this, we're grateful for the hard work demonstrated by all of our employees and the continued support we receive from our shareholders. 
Steve, we're ready to open the call for questions."

I mean, I think the other things are important with it, as we got most of the engineering team has been built out. It's well-established in Toronto, working with SNC-Lavelin. The prefeasibility work is going on very well. They've done a lot of different optionality around a prefeasibility. We're going to spend as much time as we need to in prefeasibility. So that when we go into the feasibility stage, it will be just that much cleaner. Negotiations and discussions and outreaches into both the First Nations communities, as well as the surrounding communities that will be affected has been ongoing. There's been numerous meetings and discussions with all of those folks. And as you know, we've been looking for different areas within Canada where we could potentially sight the furnace for the ferrochrome, and that work is ongoing as well. So all going to plan, early days, no surprises at this point in time. The chromite deposits are holding up as we drill more holes. And everything that we first thought about those deposits is coming to fruition."

On energy, there were some rulings last year for higher energy prices that came in both in Michigan and in Minnesota. Again, those have been baked into the numbers, Jorge. None of these are surprises is what I'm giving you. But that's where costs are, why they moved, but they're baked in as well. Natural gas continues to hold, as you know, which is a big -- about 1/3 of our energy pie that goes with it. And obviously, diesel fuel is going up like it's affecting everybody in the marketplace. As I’ve always said it many times, we're not a huge consumer of diesel fuel. A lot of our pits are electrified from the shovels and the drills. We're about 30 million gallons, I think, or so in North America of diesel fuel. While there is some impact, we're getting some nice offsets from natural gas. But obviously, pressure is coming on.

Now that we are well into the summer months, w",1385,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Pricing for our iron ore products continues to be near all-time highs which contributed to another record-breaking second quarter for Cliffs. Now that we are well into the summer months, we are seeing the typical seasonality in steel pricing and production in both the U.S. and China. However, we continue to believe North American utilization rates will remain in the mid-70s range for the remainder of the year. Today, 31 of the 39 blast furnaces in North America are running and with additional startup amounts and slated for the second half of 2011. 
In China, June steel production was an annualized rate of approximately 700 million tons. This production increase in 2010 is supported by China's first half 2011 GDP growth of 9.6%. I believe these data points should be considered when the industry discussions for claim increased iron ore inventories at Chinese ports signal slowing demand for steel-making raw materials. 
Also in Asia, we have been encouraged by Japan's progress which has rebounded faster than many had originally expected. 
Overall, during the quarter, we continued down our path of integration and execution. Our chromite project is moving ahead as planned, with pre-feasibility stated to be completed in the second half of 2011. 
During the quarter, we submitted our project description to the Ontario government. This week, the government officially accepted the report which initiated the critical path to permitting. Our feasibility study is expected to begin in the latter half of this year and will extend into 2012. 
The consolidated Thompson acquisition is closed and we are well on our way to quickly integrating Bloom Lake's operations. I will talk a bit more about Bloom Lake's production ramp up, along with updates on our other capital projects within the business segment discussion. 
As I'm sure you are aware in last night's release, we have reorganized our reportable business segments to now include U.S. iron ore, Eastern Canadian iron ore, Asia-Pacific iron ore and North American coal. 
Turning to our business segment performance for the second quarter. Sales volume in U.S. iron ore is virtually flat at 5.8 million tons compared with 5.9 million tons sold in last quarter's -- last year's second quarter. This includes approximately 220,000 tons of pellets from our U.S. operations going into the seaborne market. Taking shipping seasonality in consideration, this puts us on track to ship over 1 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations in the seaborne market. 
As we mentioned last quarter, to meet this year's increased demand for iron ore, our U.S. iron ore mines are running at or near capacity. During the second quarter, we produced approximately 6.2 million tons of pellets, a 25% increase over last year. 
Now turning to our Eastern Canadian iron ore segment. This segment is comprised of our Wabush Mines and the recently acquired Bloom Lake Mine. Sales volume for the quarter was 1.7 million tons, a 122% increase over last year's second quarter. The increase was the result of additional concentrate sales from Bloom Lake. We have owned Bloom Lake for just 6 weeks and have sold approximately 900,000 tons of concentrate from the mine. Also during the same period, we produced 1 million tons of concentrate, well on our way to reaching the 8 million ton annual production rate previously indicated. 
During the quarter, we also experienced temporary equipment outages at Wabush Mines which slightly lowered Wabush's production volumes when compared to last year's second quarter. We have worked thr0ugh these temporary challenges and Wabush is back into full production. 
Bloom Lake's ramp up to 68 million tons is also on track and still slated to be completed in the latter part of 2013. 
After additional drilling at Bloom Lake mine was completed, we announced our Phase III expansion to increase production capacity to 24 million tons per year. Although we are in the early stages of planning this expansion, I believe this project has fairly low execution risk, as we will be constructing yet another mirror image of the current operations. 
In addition to these ramp up projects, we recently completed some dock modifications at Point Noire. These modifications enable us to efficiently load larger capes -- Cape class shipping vessels carrying about 180,000 tons. 
As we have discussed before, transportation is one of the largest synergy components we expect to achieve with the consolidated Thompson acquisition. 
Through our integration process, we will continue to make logistics investments to optimize those strategic advantage of our real import assets. 
Turning to Asia-Pacific iron ore, second quarter sales volumes was flat at 2.2 million tons when compared to 2010 second quarter. Due to recent stoppages at the Port of Esperance during the quarter, we have reduced our Asia-Pacific iron ore sales volume expectation to 8.8 million tons from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. Subsequent to quarter end, the Port of Esperance reached a new enterprise bargaining agreement with the unionized labor force which we anticipate will bring an end to the work stoppages. We are maintaining our production volume expectation of 9 million tons for the full year 2011. 
Construction continues on our infrastructure upgrades to increase Asia/Pacific iron ores annual production capacity to 11 million tons. Due to our accelerated efforts to complete this project in a timely matter, most of the major construction needed for bridges, rail passing loops, rail yard facilities and the new J-1 deposit road is now expected to be completed by the end of 2011. 
Now turning to North American coal. Primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the transaction of iron ore energy's coal operations, we reported a sales volume increase of 76% versus 2010 second quarter. The incremental contribution from these operations more than offset year-over-year decreases in production volume of Cliffs Pinnacle and Oak Grove Mine. 
Construction at Oak Grove Mine is moving along as planned after April's devastating tornado damage to the operations. The overlink conveyor system is nearly complete and construction to restore the preparation plant is underway. Although this weather-related challenge hindered Oak Grove's turnaround, we are looking at the situation as an opportunity to upgrade the prep plant with more sophisticated technology. This will create better gravity flow and spiral equipment which are expected to improve the efficiency of the plant. 
Fortunately, the tornado damage at Oak Grove Mine has not significantly delayed our portal project, as we anticipate that will be completed and in use by September. 
Oak Grove's underground operations are fully functional and we expect to stockpile approximately 1.5 million tons of raw coal. This will likely yield over 600,000 tons of clean coal equivalent, some of which we anticipate selling prior to year-end. 
Turning to Pinnacle Mine. Also during the quarter  and as previously disclosed, unusual levels of carbon monoxide was detected in the mine. We are working with M. Shaw and other regulators to get back into long production as soon as possible before our current fourth quarter estimate. 
In early August, we expect to begin continuous miner development of coal panels that will help improve future production efficiency. Our high vol met coal and thermal mines required last year from INR energy continue to achieve record shipping levels, outperforming our plan for these assets. Lower it to one of the growth projects acquired as part of the transaction is scheduled to commence production in November. In 2012, we expect this mine to contribute over 500,000 tons of high vol met coal to North American coal production volume. 
In summary, with the close of Consolidated Thompson, the second quarter 2011 marked a key milestone in the company's history. Although our legacy iron ore operations which are the cornerstone of our business performed well, we continue to be challenged by the North American coal segment. I am however, steadfast in my belief that we will turn the corner with these operations. 
As many of you know, we recently hired Dave Webb, as our Senior Vice President at Global Coal. Dave's already hit the ground running in his first few weeks with Cliffs the mines and completing his initial operation success. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook for the coming year."

Echoing Joe's comments, the first half of 2011 has been quite eventful. We were pleased with the enthusiastic response and turn out at our recent analyst and Investor Day in New York and appreciated the opportunity to present our long-term strategy and plan for continuing to deliver shareholder value. 
As Joe indicated in his commentary earlier, our reportable segments have been reorganized. We have adjusted our prior year second quarter and year-to-date results retrospectively to reflect the new business segment. 
From a financial standpoint, the second quarter of 2011 marked our fifth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Consolidated sales increased to $1.8 billion which is 52% higher than the previous second quarter record of $1.2 billion set last year. 
Increased prices for iron ore products and sales from our recently acquired Bloom Lake operations contributed to the quarter's outstanding performance. Sales margin rose 76% to $731 million compared with $415 million in last year's second quarter. This resulted in operating income reaching $617 million, up 69% from the $366 million posted in the previous year's comparable quarter. 
Net income improved to $408 million or $2.92 per diluted share compared with $261 million or $1.92 per diluted share last year. I would point out that as a result of our recent equity offering, our weighted average diluted share count increased by 4 million shares from second quarter 2010. 
Turning to the business segment results. Our U.S. iron ore segment turned in a strong performance during the quarter. Average realized prices increased 47%, reaching $138 per ton, up from $94 last year. Costs were down slightly primarily due to lower spending related to various large scale maintenance projects that were in process during 2010's second quarter. 
Higher prices and lower cost compounded to produce a strong sales margin of $441 million or approximately $77 per ton for U.S. iron ore. This compares with $180 million in sales margin or $31 per ton last year. 
In Eastern Canadian iron ore, second quarter revenues were $298 million compared with $111 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was driven by higher year-over-year pricing and the additional incremental tons sold from Bloom Lake that Joe discussed earlier. Sales prices averaged $177 per ton, up 20% from $147 last year. 
Cash costs per ton averaged $90 which was slightly lower than last year's cash cost of $93 per ton. We normally don't breakdown cost by mine. But due to the change in segments and the recent acquisition of CT, it is helpful to understand these results to look at it by mine. 
Wabush cash cost increased versus last year due to maintenance and stripping. During the 6 weeks we've owned CT, cash cost averaged $66, as we had a significant number of contractors on-site to complete the construction and to increase production. This is expected to be in the mid-50s by fourth quarter and under $50 per ton by year-end. 
Also during the quarter, costs were unfavorably impacted by non-cash expenses of approximately $48 million related to the purchase of Consolidated Thompson. This is the inventory step-up in valuation of approximately 1 million tons of Bloom Lake mine concentrate which is required under purchase accounting. It translates to $29 per ton for this segment. 
Turning to the Asia-Pacific iron ore operation, average revenue per ton in the quarter increased 41% to $173 from last year's $123. Average cash cost per ton was up 56% to $69 compared with $44 last year due to unfavorable currency exchange rates, higher royalty expense and accelerated mining cost related to our capacity expansion. Sales margin per ton increased 53% to $93 from $61 in last year's second quarter. 
We do hedge against the Australian dollar which mitigates the impact of currency changes. However, because the hedges against revenue, it doesn't change the increase in cost which are in Aussie dollars. It just protects the margin. 
Now turning to North American coal. Average revenue per ton decreased 18% to $119. The decrease was driven by a change in our current product sales mix from 2010. Last year's second quarter results were comprised exclusively of premium low vol met coal which was sold at a much higher selling price. 
Cash cost for the quarter increased 18% to $114 per ton. This is primarily driven by the production challenges at Pinnacle and Oak Grove that Joe mentioned earlier.
Although this segment was not profitable on a book basis, our year-to-date cash margin is nearly $10 per ton. 
Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results in the second quarter. Sales volume for equity interest was 481,000 tons which contributed $83 million to put revenue and $32 million to consolidated sales margins. 
Amapá continues to ramp up production and contributed to earnings per share during the quarter, generating approximately $8 million in after-tax equity income. In addition, production volume for the second quarter was 1.2 million tons. 
I'd also point out that during the quarter, we recorded an $18 million impairment adjustment for our investment in Oquist which accounts for the equity loss reported in our income statement. This non-cash charge relates to an investment we've held for several years. 
Looking to the balance sheet, Cliffs had a busy quarter transitioning our capital structure for the longer-term. In June, we priced a 10.3 million share equity offering at $85.63 which netted us just over $850 million. At June 30, we held $238 million in cash and equivalents and long-term debt of $3.9 billion. 
During the quarter, we produced over $600 million in cash from operations versus about $170 million last year and that was a significant improvement. We are very comfortable with the condition of our balance sheet and overall financial condition, particularly given our cash from operations outlook of $2.6 billion, which is double 2010's record-breaking year. Based on this outlook, Cliffs' Board of Directors recently declared a 100% increase to our quarterly cash dividend which brings our pay out more in line with our peers. 
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we'll direct our focus on integrating recently acquired assets and working to bring the ongoing capacity expansion online as expected. Please note that we provided a detailed discussion of our outlook assumptions within last night's press release. We will use of our working assumption that iron ore pricing for the remainder of 2011 remains flat at the June 30 flat 52% iron ore spot price of $171 per ton, as we provide our expected revenue per ton by segment. 
For our U.S. iron ore business, 2011 sales volume is expected to be 25 million tons and anticipated per ton revenue is expected to be in the range of $130 to $135. We expect total production volumes in U.S. iron ore to be about 23 million tons in 2011, with average cash cost per ton between $55 and $60. DD&A for the full year is expected to be $3 per ton. 
Full year 2011 sales volume in Eastern Canadian iron ore is expected to be approximately $9 million tons and production volumes are expected to be 8.8 million tons. Revenue is anticipated to be approximately $170 to $175 per ton. 
Average cash cost per ton is expected to be between $85 and $90. In addition for full year 2011, we anticipate non-cash inventory step-up cost of approximately $5 to $10 per ton and DD&A of approximately $15 per ton. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, we've lowered our Asia-Pacific iron ore sales volume expectation to 8.8 million tons from 9 million tons due to constraints at the port related to work stoppages. 
Our revenue per ton has decreased to approximately $160 to $165 which is in line with the lower spot prices since we last provided guidance. Cash cost per ton at Asia-Pacific iron ore is in line with our previous estimate of $60 to $65. DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $12 for the full year. 
Expected sales volume at our North American coal segment has been reduced to 4.5 million tons as a result of the production challenges addressed by Joe. We expect to sell approximately 1.4 million tons of highball met coal and 1.8 million tons of lowball met coal with the balance being thermal coal. 
Average revenue for the full year is now expected to be $120 to $125 per ton. Cash cost per ton in North American coal is projected to be between $110 and $115. Full year DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $20 per ton. 
At Sonoma Coal, we're maintaining our sales volume estimate of 1.2 million tons, but increasing our production volume to 1.4 million tons. Sonoma's sales mix will be comprised of 1/3 met coal and 2/3 thermal coal. Full year 2011 cash cost is expected to be approximately $90 to $95 per ton and full year DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $14. 
From Amapá, we anticipate generating over $35 million in equity income for the full year 2011. Based on our current expectations, we expect to generate about $2.6 billion in cash from operations in 2011. Our CapEx budget remains unchanged at $1 billion which is roughly $300 million in sustaining capital and $700 million related to growth capital projects, including spend for our Bloom Lake expansion, Asia-Pacific iron ore expansion and bringing on the lower Ware Eagle metallurgical coal mine. We've made considerable progress over the last few years in our quest for expanding and diversifying Cliffs' revenue base and product mix. Our current capital projects, along with the close of our consolidated Thompson acquisition will only add to our cash flow generation momentum and financial strength. We thank our employees and shareholders for their continuing support in the execution of our strategy and most recently in seeing our Bloom Lake acquisition to a successful close. Steve, with that lets open the call for questions now."

It certainly looks like shades of the last mining boom that we had from '04 to '08, where certainly pressures on cost are going to increase. We are not seeing the inflationary piece of that yet, as evidenced particularly in North America. Now a lot of the North American cost are due to maintenance timing and we had an awful lot of heavy maintenance last year. If you remember the, we replaced at the rotary record but not sure. However, we continue to look for these inflationary pressures that come on. But to date, the lag time hasn't caught up with us in North America. If you turn to Australia, you look at the cost that you see at this point in time where they have increased. A lot of that is FX that affected you see this coming in at this point in time. There is some effect on inflation in diesel fuels obviously with the mines being run on diesel out there. But the other big piece of our is the accelerated stripping that we're involved in, as we advance the mines in the stripping and the ore uncovered as we get into 2011 when we move from '09 to '11. So it's a generic answer. We think inflation and cost pressures are coming in the back half of the year. But there's a lag time between what we have in inventories and parts that will come through the system. But we really can't define that number and we maintain our guidance that you saw with the cost parameters.  Laurie, do you have anything to add to that?"

Pricing for our iron ore products continues to be near all-time highs, which contributed to another record-breaking second quarter for Cliffs. Now that we are well into the summer months,",1384,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Pricing for our iron ore products continues to be near all-time highs, which contributed to another record-breaking second quarter for Cliffs. Now that we are well into the summer months, we are seeing the typical seasonality in steel pricing and production in both the U.S. and China. However, we continue to believe North American utilization rates will remain in the mid-70s range for the remainder of the year. Today, 31 of the 39 blast furnaces in North America are running and with additional startup announced and slated for the second half of 2011. 
In China, June steel production was an annualized rate of approximately 700 million tons. This production increase from 2010 is supported by China's first half 2011 GDP growth of 9.6%. I believe these data points should be considered when the industry discussions for claim increased iron ore inventories at Chinese ports signal slowing demand for steel-making raw materials. Also in Asia, we have been encouraged by Japan's progress, which has rebounded faster than many had originally expected. 
Overall, during the quarter, we continued down our path of integration and execution. Our chromite project is moving ahead as planned, with prefeasibility stated to be completed in the second half of 2011. During the quarter, we submitted our project description to the Ontario government. This week, the government officially accepted the report, which initiated the critical path to permitting. Our feasibility study is expected to begin in the latter half of this year and will extend into 2012. 
The Consolidated Thompson acquisition is closed, and we are well on our way to quickly integrating Bloom Lake's operations. I will talk a bit more about Bloom Lake's production ramp-up, along with updates on our other capital projects within the business segment discussion. As I'm sure you are aware in last night's release, we have reorganized our reportable business segments to now include U.S. Iron Ore, Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Iron Ore and North American Coal. 
Turning to our business segment performance for the second quarter. Sales volume in U.S. Iron Ore is virtually flat at 5.8 million tons compared with 5.9 million tons sold in last quarter's -- last year's second quarter. This includes approximately 220,000 tons of pellets from our U.S. operations going into the seaborne market. Taking shipping seasonality in consideration, this puts us on track to ship over 1 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations in the seaborne market. As we mentioned last quarter, to meet this year's increased demand for iron ore, our U.S. Iron Ore mines are running at or near capacity. During the second quarter, we produced approximately 6.2 million tons of pellets, a 25% increase over last year. 
Now turning to our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment. This segment is comprised of our Wabush Mines and the recently acquired Bloom Lake Mine. Sales volume for the quarter was 1.7 million tons, a 122% increase over last year's second quarter. The increase was a result of additional concentrate sales from Bloom Lake. We have owned Bloom Lake for just 6 weeks and have sold approximately 900,000 tons of concentrate from the mine. Also during the same period, we produced 1 million tons of concentrate, well on our way to reaching the 8 million ton annual production rate previously indicated. During the quarter, we also experienced temporary equipment outages at Wabush Mines, which slightly lowered Wabush's production volumes when compared to last year's second quarter. We have worked through these temporary challenges, and Wabush is back into full production. 
Bloom Lake's ramp-up to 16 million tons is also on track and still slated to be completed in the latter part of 2013. After additional drilling at Bloom Lake Mine was completed, we announced our Phase 3 expansion to increase production capacity to 24 million tons per year. Although we are in the early stages of planning this expansion, I believe this project has fairly low execution risk, as we will be constructing yet another mirror image of the current operations. 
In addition to these ramp-up projects, we recently completed some dock modifications at Point Noire. These modifications enable us to efficiently load larger capes -- Cape-class shipping vessels carrying about 180,000 tons. As we have discussed before, transportation is one of the largest synergy components we expect to achieve with the  Consolidated Thompson acquisition. Through our integration process, we will continue to make logistics investments to optimize the strategic advantage of our real important assets. 
Turning to Asia Pacific Iron Ore, second quarter sales volumes was flat at 2.2 million tons when compared to 2010 second quarter. Due to recent stoppages at the Port of Esperance during the quarter, we have reduced our Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume expectation to 8.8 million tons from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. Subsequent to quarter end, the Port of Esperance reached a new enterprise bargaining agreement with the unionized labor force, which we anticipate will bring an end to the work stoppages. We are maintaining our production volume expectation of 9 million tons for the full year 2011. Construction continues on our infrastructure upgrades to increase Asia Pacific Iron Ore's annual production capacity to 11 million tons. Due to our accelerated efforts to complete this project in a timely matter, most of the major construction needed for bridges, rail passing loops, railyard facilities in the new J1 Deposit haul road is now expected to be completed by the end of 2011. 
Now turning to North American Coal. Primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the transaction of INR Energy's coal operations, we reported a sales volume increase of 76% versus 2010 second quarter. The incremental contribution from these operations more than offset year-over-year decreases in production volume of Cliffs' Pinnacle and Oak Grove Mines. Construction at Oak Grove Mine is moving along as planned after April's devastating tornado damage to the operations. 
The overland conveyor system is nearly complete and construction to restore the preparation plant is underway. Although this weather-related challenge hindered Oak Grove's turnaround, we are looking at the situation as an opportunity to upgrade the prep plant with more sophisticated technology. This will include better gravity flow and spiral equipment, which are expected to improve the efficiency of the plant. Fortunately, the tornado damage at Oak Grove Mine has not significantly delayed our portal project, as we anticipate that will be completed and in use by September. Oak Grove's underground operations are fully functional, and we expect to stockpile approximately 1.5 million tons of raw coal. This will likely yield over 600,000 tons of clean coal equivalent, some of which we anticipate selling prior to year end. 
Turning to Pinnacle Mine. Also during the quarter  and as previously disclosed, unusual levels of carbon monoxide were detected in the mine. We are working with MSHA and other regulators to get back into longwall production as soon as possible before our current fourth quarter estimate. In early August, we expect to begin continuous minor development of coal panels that will help improve future production efficiency. Our high vol met coal and thermal mines acquired last year from INR Energy continue to achieve record shipping levels, outperforming our plan for these assets. Lower War Eagle, one of the growth projects acquired as part of the transaction, is scheduled to commence production in November. In 2012, we expect this mine to contribute over 500,000 tons of high vol met coal to North American Coal production volume. 
In summary, with the close of Consolidated Thompson, the second quarter 2011 marked a key milestone in the company's history. Although our legacy iron ore operations, which are the cornerstone of our business, performed well, we continue to be challenged by our North American Coal segment. I am however, steadfast in my belief that we will turn the corner with these operations. As many of you know, we recently hired Dave Webb, as our Senior Vice President, Global Coal. Dave's already hit the ground running in his first few weeks with Cliffs, touring the mines and completing his initial operation success. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook for the coming year."
261738,137394965,148207,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Echoing Joe's comments, the first half of 2011 has been quite eventful. We were pleased with the enthusiastic response and turnout at our recent Analyst and Investor Day in New York, and appreciated the opportunity to present our long-term",1647,"Thank you, Joe. Echoing Joe's comments, the first half of 2011 has been quite eventful. We were pleased with the enthusiastic response and turnout at our recent Analyst and Investor Day in New York, and appreciated the opportunity to present our long-term strategy and plan for continuing to deliver shareholder value. As Joe indicated in his commentary earlier, our reportable segments have been reorganized. We have adjusted our prior year second quarter and year-to-date results retrospectively to reflect the new business segments. 
From a financial standpoint, the second quarter of 2011 marked our fifth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Consolidated sales increased to $1.8 billion, which is 52% higher than the previous second quarter record of $1.2 billion set last year. 
Increased prices for iron ore products and sales from our recently acquired Bloom Lake operations contributed to the quarter's outstanding performance. Sales margin rose 76% to $731 million compared with $415 million in last year's second quarter. This resulted in operating income reaching $617 million, up 69% from the $366 million posted in the previous year's comparable quarter. Net income improved to $408 million or $2.92 per diluted share, compared with $261 million or $1.92 per diluted share last year. I would point out that, as a result of our recent equity offering, our weighted average diluted share count increased by 4 million shares from second quarter 2010. 
Turning to the business segment results. Our U.S. Iron Ore segment turned in a strong performance during the quarter. Average realized prices increased 47%, reaching $138 per ton, up from $94 last year. Costs were down slightly, primarily due to lower spending related to various large-scale maintenance projects that were in process during 2010 second quarter. Higher prices and lower cost compounded to produce a strong sales margin of $441 million or approximately $77 per ton for U.S. Iron Ore. This compares with $180 million in sales margin or $31 per ton last year. 
In Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, second quarter revenues were $298 million, compared with $111 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was driven by higher year-over-year pricing and the additional incremental tons sold from Bloom Lake that Joe discussed earlier. Sales prices averaged $177 per ton, up 20% from $147 last year. 
Cash cost per ton averaged $90, which was slightly lower than last year's cash cost of $93 per ton. We normally don't break down cost by mine. But due to the change in segments and the recent acquisition of CT, it is helpful to understand these results to look at it by mine. 
Wabush cash cost increased versus last year due to maintenance and stripping. During the 6 weeks we've owned CT, cash cost averaged $66, as we had a significant number of contractors on-site to complete the construction and to increase production. This is expected to be in the mid-50s by fourth quarter and under $50 per ton by year end. 
Also during the quarter, costs were unfavorably impacted by noncash expenses of approximately $48 million related to the purchase of Consolidated Thompson. This is the inventory step-up in valuation of approximately 1 million tons of Bloom Lake Mine concentrates, which is required under purchase accounting. It translates to $29 per ton for this segment. 
Turning to the Asia Pacific Iron Ore operation. Average revenue per ton in the quarter increased 41% to $173 from last year's $123. Average cash cost per ton was up 56% to $69, compared with $44 last year due to unfavorable currency exchange rates, higher royalty expense and accelerated mining cost related to our capacity expansion. Sales margin per ton increased 53% to $93 from $61 in last year's second quarter. We do hedge against the Australian dollar, which mitigates the impact of currency changes. However, because the hedge is against revenue, it doesn't change the increase in cost, which are in Aussie dollars, it just protects the margin. 
Now turning to North American Coal. Average revenue per ton decreased 18% to $119. The decrease was driven by a change in our current product sales mix from 2010. Last year's second quarter results were comprised exclusively of premium low vol met coal, which is sold at a much higher selling price. Cash cost for the quarter increased 18% to $114 per ton. This is primarily driven by the production challenges at Pinnacle and Oak Grove that Joe mentioned earlier. Although this segment was not profitable on a book basis, our year-to-date cash margin is nearly $10 per ton. 
Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results in the second quarter. Sales volume for equity interest was 481,000 tons, which contributed $83 million to Cliffs' revenue and $32 million to consolidated sales margins. Amapá continues to ramp up production and contributed to earnings per share during the quarter, generating approximately $8 million in after-tax equity income. In addition, production volume for the second quarter was 1.2 million tons.  I'd also point out that during the quarter, we recorded an $18 million impairment adjustment for our investment in AusQuest, which accounts for the equity loss reported in our income statement. This noncash charge relates to an investment we've held for several years. 
Looking to the balance sheet. Cliffs had a busy quarter transitioning our capital structure for the longer-term. In June, we priced a 10.3 million share equity offering at $85.63, which netted us just over $850 million. At June 30, we held $238 million in cash and equivalents and long-term debt of $3.9 billion. During the quarter, we produced over $600 million in cash from operations versus about $170 million last year, an absolutely significant improvement. We're very comfortable with the condition of our balance sheet and overall financial condition, particularly given our cash from operations outlook of $2.6 billion, which is double 2010's record-breaking year. Based on this outlook, Cliffs' Board of Directors recently declared a 100% increase to our quarterly cash dividend, which brings our payout more in line with our peers. 
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we'll direct our focus on integrating recently acquired assets and working to bring the ongoing capacity expansions online as expected. Please note that we provided a detailed discussion of our outlook assumptions within last night's press release. We will use as our working assumption that iron ore pricing for the remainder of 2011 remains flat at the June 30 Platts 62% iron ore spot price of $171 per ton, as we provide our expected revenue per ton by segment. 
For our U.S. Iron Ore business, 2011 sales volume is expected to be 25 million tons and anticipated per ton revenue is expected to be in the range of $130 to $135. We expect total production volumes in U.S. iron ore to be about 23 million tons in 2011, with average cash cost per ton between $55 and $60. DD&A for the full year is expected to be $3 per ton. 
Full year 2011 sales volume in Eastern Canadian Iron Ore is expected to be approximately 9 million tons and production volumes are expected to be 8.8 million tons. Revenue is anticipated to be approximately $170 to $175 per ton. Average cash cost per ton is expected to be between $85 and $90. In addition for full year 2011, we anticipate noncash inventory step-up cost of approximately $5 to $10 per ton and DD&A of approximately $15 per ton. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, we've lowered our Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume expectation to 8.8 million tons from 9 million tons due to constraints at the port related to work stoppages. 
Our revenue per ton has decreased to approximately $160 to $165, which is in line with the lower spot prices since we last provided guidance. Cash cost per ton at Asia Pacific Iron Ore is in line with our previous estimate of $60 to $65. DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $12 for the full year. 
Expected sales volume at our North American Coal segment has been reduced to 4.5 million tons as a result of the production challenges addressed by Joe. We expect to sell approximately 1.4 million tons of high vol met coal and 1.8 million tons of low vol met coal, with the balance being thermal coal. Average revenue for the full year is now expected to be $120 to $125 per ton. Cash cost per ton in North American Coal is projected to be between $110 and $115. Full year DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $20 per ton. 
At Sonoma Coal, we're maintaining our sales volume estimate of 1.2 million tons but increasing our production volume to 1.4 million tons. Sonoma's sales mix will be comprised of 1/3 met coal and 2/3 thermal coal. Full year 2011 cash cost is expected to be approximately $90 to $95 per ton and full year DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $14.  From Amapá, we anticipate generating over $35 million in equity income for the full year 2011. Based on our current expectations, we expect to generate about $2.6 billion in cash from operations in 2011. 
Our CapEx budget remains unchanged at $1 billion, which is roughly $300 million in sustaining capital and $700 million related to growth capital projects, including spend for our Bloom Lake expansion, Asia Pacific Iron Ore expansions and bringing on the Lower War Eagle metallurgical coal mine. We've made considerable progress over the last few years in our quest for expanding and diversifying Cliffs' revenue base and product mix. Our current capital projects, along with the close of our Consolidated Thompson acquisition, will only add to our cash flow generation momentum and financial strength. 
We thank our employees and shareholders for their continuing support in the execution of our strategy, and most recently, in seeing our Bloom Lake acquisition to a successful close. Steve, with that, let's open the call for questions now."

And I'm sure, again not only through the theme of the earnings season but also the articles we've written, it certainly looks like shades of the last mining boom that we had from '04 to '08, where certainly pressures on cost are going to increase. We are not seeing the inflationary piece of that yet, as evidenced particularly in North America. Now a lot of the North American costs are due to maintenance timing, and we had an awful lot of heavy maintenance last year. If you remember the kiln ring, we replaced at Tilden and the rotary car dump at Northshore. However, we continue to look for these inflationary pressures, Brian, that come on. But to date, the lag time hasn't caught up with us in North America. If you turn to Australia, you look at the costs that you see at this point in time, where they've increased. A lot of that is FX, that effect that you see coming in at this point in time. There is some effect on inflation in diesel fuels, obviously with the mines being run on diesel out there. But the other big piece of ours is the accelerated stripping that we're involved in, as we advance the mines into stripping and the ore uncovered as we get into 2011, when we move from '09 to '11. So it's a generic answer. We think inflation and cost pressures are coming in the back half of the year. But there's a lag time between what we have in inventories and the parts that will come through the system. But we really can't define that number and we maintain our guidance that you saw with the cost parameters. Laurie, do you have anything to add to that?"

And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Pricing for our iron ore products continues to be near all-time highs, which contributed to another record-breaking second quarter for Cliffs. Now that we are well into the summer months,",1387,"Thanks, Steve. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Pricing for our iron ore products continues to be near all-time highs, which contributed to another record-breaking second quarter for Cliffs. Now that we are well into the summer months, we are seeing the typical seasonality in steel pricing and production in both the U.S. and China. However, we continue to believe North American utilization rates will remain in the mid-70s range for the remainder of the year. Today, 31 of the 39 blast furnaces in North America are running and with additional startup announced and slated for the second half of 2011. 
In China, June steel production was an annualized rate of approximately 700 million tons. This production increase from 2010 is supported by China's first half 2011 GDP growth of 9.6%. I believe these data points should be considered when the industry discussions for claim increased iron ore inventories at Chinese ports signal slowing demand for steel-making raw materials. 
Also in Asia, we have been encouraged by Japan's progress, which has rebounded faster than many had originally expected. Overall, during the quarter, we continued down our path of integration and execution. Our chromite project is moving ahead as planned, with prefeasibility stated to be completed in the second half of 2011. During the quarter, we submitted our project description to the Ontario government. This week, the government officially accepted the report, which initiated the critical path to permitting. Our feasibility study is expected to begin in the latter half of this year and will extend into 2012. 
The Consolidated Thompson acquisition is closed, and we are well on our way to quickly integrating Bloom Lake's operations. I will talk a bit more about Bloom Lake's production ramp-up, along with updates on our other capital projects within the business segment discussion. As I'm sure you are aware in last night's release, we have reorganized our reportable business segments to now include U.S. Iron Ore, Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Iron Ore and North American Coal. 
Turning to our business segment performance for the second quarter. Sales volume in U.S. Iron Ore is virtually flat at 5.8 million tons compared with 5.9 million tons sold in last quarter's -- last year's second quarter. This includes approximately 220,000 tons of pellets from our U.S. operations going into the seaborne market. Taking shipping seasonality in consideration, this puts us on track to ship over 1 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations in the seaborne market. As we mentioned last quarter, to meet this year's increased demand for iron ore, our U.S. Iron Ore mines are running at or near capacity. During the second quarter, we produced approximately 6.2 million tons of pellets, a 25% increase over last year. 
Now turning to our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment. This segment is comprised of our Wabush Mines and the recently acquired Bloom Lake Mine. Sales volume for the quarter was 1.7 million tons, a 122% increase over last year's second quarter. The increase was a result of additional concentrate sales from Bloom Lake. We have owned Bloom Lake for just 6 weeks and have sold approximately 900,000 tons of concentrate from the mine. Also during the same period, we produced 1 million tons of concentrate, well on our way to reaching the 8 million ton annual production rate previously indicated. During the quarter, we also experienced temporary equipment outages at Wabush Mines, which slightly lowered Wabush's production volumes when compared to last year's second quarter. We have worked through these temporary challenges, and Wabush is back into full production. 
Bloom Lake's ramp-up to 16 million tons is also on track and still slated to be completed in the latter part of 2013. After additional drilling at Bloom Lake Mine was completed, we announced our Phase 3 expansion to increase production capacity to 24 million tons per year. Although we are in the early stages of planning this expansion, I believe this project has fairly low execution risk, as we will be constructing yet another mirror image of the current operations. 
In addition to these ramp-up projects, we recently completed some dock modifications at Point Noire. These modifications enable us to efficiently load larger capes -- Cape-class shipping vessels carrying about 180,000 tons. As we have discussed before, transportation is one of the largest synergy components we expect to achieve with the  Consolidated Thompson acquisition. Through our integration process, we will continue to make logistics investments to optimize the strategic advantage of our rail and port assets. 
Turning to Asia Pacific Iron Ore, second quarter sales volumes was flat at 2.2 million tons when compared to 2010 second quarter. Due to recent stoppages at the Port of Esperance during the quarter, we have reduced our Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume expectation to 8.8 million tons from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. Subsequent to quarter end, the Port of Esperance reached a new enterprise bargaining agreement with the unionized labor force, which we anticipate will bring an end to the work stoppages. We are maintaining our production volume expectation of 9 million tons for the full year 2011. 
Construction continues on our infrastructure upgrades to increase Asia Pacific Iron Ore's annual production capacity to 11 million tons. Due to our accelerated efforts to complete this project in a timely matter, most of the major construction needed for bridges, rail passing loops, rail yard facilities and the new J1 Deposit haul road is now expected to be completed by the end of 2011. 
Now turning to North American Coal. Primarily as a result of incremental tonnage acquired in the transaction of INR Energy's coal operations, we reported a sales volume increase of 76% versus 2010 second quarter. The incremental contribution from these operations more than offset year-over-year decreases in production volume of Cliffs' Pinnacle and Oak Grove Mines. Construction at Oak Grove Mine is moving along as planned after April's devastating tornado damage to the operations. The overland conveyor system is nearly complete and construction to restore the preparation plant is underway. Although this weather-related challenge hindered Oak Grove's turnaround, we are looking at the situation as an opportunity to upgrade the prep plant with more sophisticated technology. This will include better gravity flow and spiral equipment, which are expected to improve the efficiency of the plant. 
Fortunately, the tornado damage at Oak Grove Mine has not significantly delayed our portal project, as we anticipate that will be completed and in use by September. Oak Grove's underground operations are fully functional, and we expect to stockpile approximately 1.5 million tons of raw coal. This will likely yield over 600,000 tons of clean coal equivalent, some of which we anticipate selling prior to year end. 
Turning to Pinnacle Mine. Also during the quarter  and as previously disclosed, unusual levels of carbon monoxide were detected in the mine. We are working with MSHA and other regulators to get back into longwall production as soon as possible before our current fourth quarter estimate. In early August, we expect to begin continuous minor development of coal panels that will help improve future production and efficiency. Our high vol met coal and thermal mines acquired last year from INR Energy continued to achieve record shipping levels, outperforming our plan for these assets. Lower War Eagle, one of the growth projects acquired as part of the transaction, is scheduled to commence production in November. In 2012, we expect this mine to contribute over 500,000 tons of high vol met coal to North American Coal production volume. 
In summary, with the close of Consolidated Thompson, the second quarter 2011 marked a key milestone in the company's history. Although our legacy iron ore operations, which are the cornerstone of our business, performed well, we continue to be challenged by our North American Coal segment. I am however, steadfast in my belief that we will turn the corner with these operations. As many of you know, we recently hired Dave Webb, as our Senior Vice President, Global Coal. Dave's already hit the ground running in his first few weeks with Cliffs, touring the mines and completing his initial operation success. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights and our outlook for the coming year."

Echoing Joe's comments, the first half of 2011 has been quite eventful. We were pleased with the enthusiastic response and turnout at our recent Analyst and Investor Day in New York, and appreciated the opportunity to present our long-term",1647,"Thank you, Joe. Echoing Joe's comments, the first half of 2011 has been quite eventful. We were pleased with the enthusiastic response and turnout at our recent Analyst and Investor Day in New York, and appreciated the opportunity to present our long-term strategy and plan for continuing to deliver shareholder value. As Joe indicated in his commentary earlier, our reportable segments have been reorganized. We have adjusted our prior year second quarter and year-to-date results retrospectively to reflect the new business segments. 
From a financial standpoint, the second quarter of 2011 marked our fifth consecutive record-breaking quarter. Consolidated sales increased to $1.8 billion, which is 52% higher than the previous second quarter record of $1.2 billion set last year. 
Increased prices for iron ore products and sales from our recently acquired Bloom Lake operations contributed to the quarter's outstanding performance. 
Sales margin rose 76% to $731 million compared with $415 million in last year's second quarter. This resulted in operating income reaching $617 million up 69% from the $366 million posted in the previous year's comparable quarter. Net income improved to $408 million or $2.92 per diluted share, compared with $261 million or $1.92 per diluted share last year. I would point out that, as a result of our recent equity offering, our weighted average diluted share count increased by 4 million shares from second quarter 2010. 
Turning to the business segment results. Our U.S. Iron Ore segment turned in a strong performance during the quarter. Average realized prices increased 47%, reaching $138 per ton, up from $94 last year. Costs were down slightly, primarily due to lower spending related to various large-scale maintenance projects that were in process during 2010 second quarter. Higher prices and lower cost compounded to produce a strong sales margin of $441 million or approximately $77 per ton for U.S. Iron Ore. This compares with $180 million in sales margin or $31 per ton last year. 
In Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, second quarter revenues were $298 million, compared with $111 million in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was driven by higher year-over-year pricing and the additional incremental tons sold from Bloom Lake that Joe discussed earlier. Sales prices averaged $177 per ton, up 20% from $147 last year. 
Cash cost per ton averaged $90, which was slightly lower than last year's cash cost of $93 per ton. We normally don't break down cost by mine, but due to the change in segments and the recent acquisition of CT, it is helpful to understand these results to look at it by mine. Wabush cash cost increased versus last year due to maintenance and stripping. During the 6 weeks we've owned CT, cash cost averaged $66, as we had a significant number of contractors on-site to complete the construction and to increase production. This is expected to be in the mid-50s by fourth quarter and under $50 per ton by year end. 
Also during the quarter, costs were unfavorably impacted by noncash expenses of approximately $48 million related to the purchase of Consolidated Thompson. This is the inventory step-up in valuation of approximately 1 million tons of Bloom Lake Mine concentrates, which is required under purchase accounting. It translates to $29 per ton for this segment. 
Turning to the Asia Pacific Iron Ore operation. Average revenue per ton in the quarter increased 41% to $173 from last year's $123. Average cash cost per ton was up 56% to $69, compared with $44 last year, due to unfavorable currency exchange rates, higher royalty expense and accelerated mining cost related to our capacity expansion. Sales margin per ton increased 53% to $93 from $61 in last year's second quarter. We do hedge against the Australian dollar, which mitigates the impact of currency changes. However, because the hedge is against revenue, it doesn't change the increase in cost, which are in Aussie dollars, it just protects the margin. 
Now turning to North American Coal. Average revenue per ton decreased 18% to $119. The decrease was driven by a change in our current product sales mix from 2010. Last year's second quarter results were comprised exclusively of premium low vol met coal, which is sold at a much higher selling price. Cash cost for the quarter increased 18% to $114 per ton. This is primarily driven by the production challenges at Pinnacle and Oak Grove that Joe mentioned earlier. Although this segment was not profitable on a book basis, our year-to-date cash margin is nearly $10 per ton. 
Sonoma Coal continued to post positive results in the second quarter. Sales volume for equity interest was 481,000 tons, which contributed $83 million to Cliffs' revenue and $32 million to consolidated sales margins. Amapá continues to ramp up production and contributed to earnings per share during the quarter, generating approximately $8 million in after-tax equity income. In addition, production volume for the second quarter was 1.2 million tons.  I'd also point out that during the quarter, we recorded an $18 million impairment adjustment for our investment in AusQuest, which accounts for the equity loss reported in our income statement. This noncash charge relates to an investment we've held for several years. 
Looking to the balance sheet. Cliffs had a busy quarter transitioning our capital structure for the longer-term. In June, we priced a 10.3 million share equity offering at $85.63, which netted us just over $850 million. At June 30, we held $238 million in cash and equivalents and long-term debt of $3.9 billion. During the quarter, we produced over $600 million in cash from operations versus about $170 million last year, an absolutely significant improvement. We're very comfortable with the condition of our balance sheet and overall financial condition, particularly given our cash from operations outlook of $2.6 billion, which is double 2010's record-breaking year. Based on this outlook, Cliffs' Board of Directors recently declared a 100% increase to our quarterly cash dividend, which brings our payout more in line with our peers. 
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we'll direct our focus on integrating recently acquired assets and working to bring the ongoing capacity expansions online as expected. Please note that we provided a detailed discussion of our outlook assumptions within last night's press release. We will use as our working assumption that iron ore pricing for the remainder of 2011 remains flat at the June 30 Platts 62% iron ore spot price of $171 per ton, as we provide our expected revenue per ton by segment. 
For our U.S. Iron Ore business, 2011 sales volume is expected to be 25 million tons and anticipated per ton revenue is expected to be in the range of $130 to $135. We expect pellet production volume in U.S. iron ore to be about 23 million tons in 2011, with average cash cost per ton between $55 and $60. DD&A for the full year is expected to be $3 per ton. 
Full year 2011 sales volume in Eastern Canadian Iron Ore is expected to be approximately 9 million tons and production volumes are expected to be 8.8 million tons. Revenue is anticipated to be approximately $170 to $175 per ton. Average cash cost per ton is expected to be between $85 and $90. In addition for full year 2011, we anticipate noncash inventory step-up cost of approximately $5 to $10 per ton and DD&A of approximately $15 per ton. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, we've lowered our Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume expectation to 8.8 million tons from 9 million tons due to constraints at the port related to work stoppages. 
Our revenue per ton has decreased to approximately $160 to $165, which is in line with the lower spot prices since we last provided guidance. Cash cost per ton at Asia Pacific Iron Ore is in line with our previous estimate of $60 to $65. DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $12 for the full year. 
Expected sales volume at our North American Coal segment has been reduced to 4.5 million tons as a result of the production challenges addressed by Joe. We expect to sell approximately 1.4 million tons of high vol met coal and 1.8 million tons of low vol met coal, with the balance being thermal coal. Average revenue for the full year is now expected to be $120 to $125 per ton. Cash cost per ton in North American Coal is projected to be between $110 and $115. Full year DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $20 per ton. 
At Sonoma Coal, we're maintaining our sales volume estimate of 1.2 million tons but increasing our production volume to 1.4 million tons. Sonoma's sales mix will be comprised of 1/3 met coal and 2/3 thermal coal. Full year 2011 cash cost is expected to be approximately $90 to $95 per ton and full year DD&A per ton is expected to be approximately $14.  From Amapá, we anticipate generating over $35 million in equity income for the full year 2011. Based on our current expectations, we expect to generate about $2.6 billion in cash from operations in 2011. 
Our CapEx budget remains unchanged at $1 billion, which is roughly $300 million in sustaining capital and $700 million related to growth capital projects, including spend for our Bloom Lake expansion, Asia Pacific Iron Ore expansions and bringing on the Lower War Eagle metallurgical coal mine. 
We've made considerable progress over the last few years in our quest for expanding and diversifying Cliffs' revenue base and product mix. Our current capital projects, along with the close of our Consolidated Thompson acquisition, will only add to our cash flow generation momentum and financial strength. 
We thank our employees and shareholders for their continuing support in the execution of our strategy, and most recently, in seeing our Bloom Lake acquisition to a successful close.

And I'm sure, again, not only through the theme of the earnings season but also the articles we've written, it certainly looks like shades of the last mining boom that we had from '04 to '08, where certainly pressures on cost are going to increase. We are not seeing the inflationary piece of that yet, as evidenced particularly in North America. Now a lot of the North American costs are due to maintenance timing, and we had an awful lot of heavy maintenance last year. If you remember the kiln ring we replaced at Tilden and the rotary car dump at Northshore. However, we continue to look for these inflationary pressures, Brian, that come on. But to date, the lag time hasn't caught up with us in North America. If you turn to Australia, you look at the costs that you see at this point in time, where they've increased. A lot of that is FX, that effect that you see coming in at this point in time. There is some effect on inflation in diesel fuels, obviously with the mines being run on diesel out there. But the other big piece of ours is the accelerated stripping that we're involved in, as we advance the mines into stripping and the ore uncovered as we get into 2011, when we move from '09 to '11. So it's a generic answer. We think inflation and cost pressures are coming in the back half of the year. But there's a lag time between what we have in inventories and the parts that will come through the system. But we really can't define that number and we maintain our guidance that you saw with the cost parameters. Laurie, do you have anything to add to that?"

Last night, Cliffs reported the strongest quarter in the company's history. Third quarter's results were driven by strong demand for our products throughout 2011. North America blast furnace",1196,"Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. Last night, Cliffs reported the strongest quarter in the company's history. Third quarter's results were driven by strong demand for our products throughout 2011. North America blast furnace utilization rates averaged 76% during the quarter, 5% higher than the prior year's comparable quarter average of 71%. Additionally, the Platt's index for our pricing averaged $178 per ton during the quarter, 31% higher than 2010's average third quarter pricing. Both of these factors, coupled with the additional sales from Bloom Lake's operations, drove our exceptional third quarter results. However, we do with knowledge the recent softness of iron ore spot prices. This is not entirely surprising given the immediate macroeconomic concerns over future growth rates in certain world economies and volatility in virtually all industrial commodities. 
As many of you know, since the end of the annual benchmark pricing mechanism, Cliffs has been moving sales agreements to more narrow pricing periods that are closer to the shipping date. We anticipate our industry will continue in this direction, moving away from lagging pricing period and towards those that are closer to shipping or landing dates. For Cliffs, while lower spot pricing will directly impact results given our exposure to the seaborne market, we expect to run a very profitable business at these iron ore spot prices. Fluctuation in pricing is expected and current reduced spot pricing is still very healthy and indicative of strong global demand. We believe that megatrends underpinning our industry in general remains intact, including industrialization of emerging economies which continues to support our growth and expansion initiatives.
After the deterioration of benchmark pricing, we have often stated our belief that iron ore will trade within the pricing band, affected by certain realtime market conditions and dynamics. Barring any further material deteriorations in European or North American economies, we expect 2012's pricing brand will recommend relatively consistent with 2011 range. 
Now turning to the performance of our core business during the quarter. Sales volume in U.S. iron ore increased to 7.9 million tons compared to 6.9 million tons sold in last year's third quarter. This includes approximately 0.5 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations going into the seaborne market in the quarter. Due to vessel availability and adjustments in customer pellet requirements, we are revising our full year 2011 U.S. iron ore sales volume expectations to 24 million tons, down from our previous expectations of 25 million tons.
In 2012, we expect to see steelmaking utilization rates range between 70% and 75%. Based on this, we expect to produce and sell approximately 23 million tons from our U.S. iron ore business segment next year. 
Now turning to Eastern Canadian Iron Ore. Sales volume for the quarter was 3.1 million tons, a 294% increase over last year's third quarter. This increase was a result of approximately 1.8 million tons of concentrate sales from Bloom Lake, an increase year-over-year sales volume at Wabush Mines. During September, Bloom Lake reduced at an 8 million-ton run rate for 10 consecutive days. Given that, we feel confident in reaching the 8 million-ton annual production rate previously indicated.
Despite our ramp-up progress at Bloom Lake, we are reducing our full year 2011 sales volume expectation in Eastern Canadian Iron Ore to 8 million tons from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. This lower sales volume expectation is partially attributed to pellet availability from Wabush and partially related to a transition in our marketing strategy to work more directly with end-users of the product and lastly, trading customers in Asia. We have delivered Bloom Lake concentrate to 2 of our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers during the quarter and we'll continue working with our customers the test trial cargoes. We believe this strategic shift will provide increased sales flexibility over the long term and build stronger relationships among large seaborne customers.
Throughout the integration and optimization process within our Eastern Canadian operations, it is our goal to achieve the production reliability and consistency that has been established over time with our U.S. and Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. I am pleased to report that our Phase II expansion at Bloom Lake is moving ahead as planned. The concentrating facility's exterior framework is complete and in the process of being enclosed. This work is expected to be finalized by year end, enabling interior work that we plan to move forward throughout the winter months.
For next year, we expect to produce and sell approximately 12 million tons from our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment, comprised of approximately 1/3 pellets and 2/3 concentrate. 
Turning to Asia Pacific Iron Ore, third quarter sales volume was nearly flat at 2.4 million tons when compared to 2010's third quarter. For the remainder of that, 2011, virtually all vessels and orders are booked through the end of November. We are maintaining our sales volume expectation for 2011 at 8.8 million tons. Our Asia Pacific Iron Ore expansions to 11 million tons per year is progressing well year. All equipment are complete, along with the rail over paths in the town of Esperanza. 
Considering the challenging labor and equipment markets in Western Australia, I'm very pleased about the team's success there in completing all the required expense-related stripping and mine prep work. This is enabling project completion ahead of schedule and on budget. As such, we anticipate our 2012 sales and production volumes in Asia Pacific Iron Ore to be approximately 11 million tons. The product mix is expected to be similar to prior periods, evenly split between lump and volumes.
Now turning to our North American coal segment. As many of you know, production at our low [indiscernible] met coal mines was largely during the quarter as a result of our previously disclosed carbon monoxide detected at [indiscernible] mine, along with restoration construction at the Oak Grove Mine. After receiving approval to restart operations, we commenced [indiscernible] longwall machine in early October. At Oak Grove Mine, the prep plan is expected to restart in December with customer shipments to resume in January. 
Our high-volume met coal and thermal mines acquired last year from INR Energy continue to achieve record shipping levels, outperforming our plan for these assets. Near the end of the quarter, production began at lower War Eagle, which is slightly ahead of schedule. 
For 2011, we have reduced our sales volume expectation to 4 million tons from our previous expectation of 4.5 million tons. The decrease is primarily related to sales from Oak Grove resuming in January 2012 rather than our previous estimate of December 2011. We expect 2012 to be the turnaround year for our North American coal business. We anticipate being well-positioned for increased volumes and improved profitability. That said, we expect to sell 7.2 million tons and produce 6.6 million tons of coal from this business segment next year. 
We are approximately 75% of our anticipated 2012 met coal volumes open for pricing. For the met coal tonnage already priced, we are at approximately $150 per short-ton at the mine. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights. Laurie?"
261738,141453516,180075,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Following on Joe's comments, our record performance reinforces our strategic growth and diversification efforts. Despite the recent valuation declines for commodities producers in the market, we believe our long-term strategy will continue",1920,"Thank you, Joe. Following on Joe's comments, our record performance reinforces our strategic growth and diversification efforts. Despite the recent valuation declines for commodities producers in the market, we believe our long-term strategy will continue to add value for shareholders. Our growth role for this pointed that deployed economically healthiest regions in the world. Our growth is based on organic expansion initiative and is expected to result in significant cash flows generation in 2011's final quarter and well beyond.
To further support these efforts, during the third quarter, we replaced our $600 million revolving credit facility with the new $1.75 billion credit facility that has no meaningfully restrictive debt covenant. This solid capital structure will allow us to advance current projects in our global pipeline and remain opportunistic while at the same time, returning capital to shareholders. To that end, in the last 18 months, our board has tripled the annualized cash dividend to more than $1 per share and also authorized a $4 million share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we bought 3 million shares at an average price of $74 per share, lowering our current diluted shares outstanding to approximately 143 million. From a P&L standpoint, the third quarter of 2011 marked our 6th consecutive record-breaking quarter. Consolidated sales increased to an all-time quarterly record of $2.1 billion, which is 59% higher than the record $1.3 billion sales set in last year's third quarter.
This was pushed our revenue for the September 9-month ended period past $5 billion, which exceeds 2010's full year record revenue of $4.6 billion. In addition, our year-to-date September diluted EPS of $10.12 per share, well exceeds 2010's full year diluted EPS of $7.49. Increased prices for iron ore products and sales from our recently acquired Bloom Lake operations contributed to the quarter's standout performance.
Sales margin expanded 81% to $863 million compared with $477 million in last year's third quarter. This resulted in quarterly operating income of $820 million, more than doubling the $390 million posted in 2010's third quarter. Net income attributable to Cliffs shareholders reached $590 million or $4.07 per diluted share, exceeding last year's record of $297 million or $2.18 per diluted share.
Included in net income for the quarter is a $17.5 million net of tax, noncash loss from discontinued operations. Due to our previously settled pricing arbitration and the favorable pricing environment, Cliffs' minority partners interest in Empire Mine increased to a positive equity position during the quarter. As a result, Cliffs is now fully consolidating the Empire Mine with the partner's interest reflected on the noncontrolling interest line item on the P&L. Historically, Cliffs reported Empire Mine as [indiscernible] cost entity. The net impact of fully consolidating was an $83 million reduction to earnings attributable to Cliffs shareholders, of which $68 million is related to prior quarter adjustments within 2011. The total adjustment had an impact to the quarter's earnings per share of $0.57 per share. 
In addition, our third quarter effective income tax rate was 2% as a result of the combined impact of fully consolidating Empire Mine, along with strategic tax planning and certain the discrete items. The benefits in the quarter to our tax expense are primarily related to changes in foreign currency, which ultimately impact tax liabilities, along with other discrete items. As a result, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to be an estimated 18%, including discrete items. This is lower than our previous expectation of 26%.
I would also point out that during the quarter, we incurred $152 million attributable to noncontrolling interest. Approximately $34.5 million of this is related to our minority partner's 25% interest in Bloom Lake mine, with the remaining attributable to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. Noncontrolling interest for both mines will be recurring items in our financial statements in future reporting periods. 
Turning to our U.S. iron ore reporting segment, in last night's release for comparison purposes, we included 2 tables as appendices related to the full consolidation of Empire Mine's impact on our U.S. iron ore segment and also on our consolidated income statement. These adjustments had no impact on U.S. iron ore sales margin dollars reported for the quarter. For comparability, it's helpful to look at U.S. Iron Ore excluding the adjustments for Empire Mine. 
On this basis, sales volume for the quarter increased 9% to 7.4 million tons from the previous year's third quarter. Revenue per ton was $125, up 24% from the previous year, driven by higher pricing and volume. Cash costs were down to $57 per ton, primarily due to greater fixed cost leverage versus the prior year's quarter. As I mentioned, the adjustments related to Empire Mine had no impact on U.S. Iron Ore sales margin dollars, which increased 82% to $481 million from $264 million last year. Our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore business generated revenues of $517 million compared with $124 million in the third quarter of 2010. Sales prices averaged $166 per ton, up about 5% compared with last year's $158 per ton. 
[indiscernible] during the third quarter, Bloom Lake contributed approximately $155 million in cash sales margin to the company's results. Cash cost per ton in the Eastern Canadian iron ore segment averaged $87, down 6% from last year's $93 per ton, reflecting lower realized cost related to production in Bloom Lake, partially offset by higher cash costs at Wabush Mines as a result of increased royalty rates, labor costs, shipping, stripping and transportation rates.
Bloom Lake's cash costs were $74 per ton during the quarter, higher than second quarter's cash cost of $66 per ton. The increase is primarily driven by approximately $14 per ton related to lower production in the quarter, as well as mining costs related to the Phase II expansion. Although higher quarter-over-quarter, we anticipate Bloom Lake's cash cost to be approximately $60 per ton by year end. While this is slightly increased from our previous expectation of $55 per ton, we believe the long-term benefit of making the investments today is the most effective way to manage the mine for the future.
Wabush Mines cash cost per ton were $106 during the quarter, lower when compared with second quarter's cash cost primarily to increased sales and production volumes during the quarter. Also during the quarter, the company incurred a noncash nonrecurring expense of $11 million associated with the step-up of inventory at Bloom Lake.
Turning to the Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. Average revenue per ton in the quarter increased 33% to $170 from last year's $128. Average cash cost was up 63% to $58 per ton compared with $42 per ton last year. This was due to higher royalty expense, accelerated mining cost related to our capacity expansion and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Nonetheless, per ton sales margin continued to expand 25% to $91, up from $73 in last year's comparable quarter.
In our North American coal segment, average revenue per ton was $99 versus $118 last year. This reflects a greater percentage of lower-priced high volume thermal coals year-over-year. Based on the lack of volume from Pinnacle and Oak Grove, we reported an increase in average cash cost per ton to $135 compared with $108 last year. We estimate that approximately $47 per ton of additional cash cost realized in the third quarter were due to the production curtailment. 
Looking at the balance sheet, as I mentioned previously, during the quarter, we continued our efforts to transition the company's capital structure for the longer term. We replaced our $600 million revolving credit facility with the new $1.75 billion facility. We used approximately $250 million of this to pay down a portion of our term loan. At the end of September, we held $545 million in cash and equivalents and long-term debt of $3.9 billion, including the borrowings on our revolver. The company generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations year-to-date. This is a 145% increase over the comparable 9-month period in 2010. 
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we intend to continue integrating recently acquired assets and working to bridge capacity expansion to bring capacity expansions online as expected. For our U.S. iron ore business, as Joe mentioned, we're lowering our full year 2011 sales volume guidance to 24 million tons, down from 25 million tons. This reflects adjustments the customer pellet requirements and shipping vessel availability. Per ton revenue expectations have changed as a result of the full consolidation of Empire Mine, but outside of this would have remain the same. We now anticipate revenue per ton in the range of $135 to $145. Note, we provided in our press release, a detailed discussion of the assumptions on which this pricing is based. It does include an assumption of $140 per ton for iron ore finds throughout the remainder of 2011. 
We expect pellet production in volume in U.S. iron ore to be approximately 24 million tons in 2011, with average cash cost per ton between $60 and $65. The increase again attributed again to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. DD&A is expected to be $4 per ton. Sales volume at our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment is expected to be approximately 8 million tons, down from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. This is driven by an adjustment to Bloom Lake's current shipping plan and pellet availability at Wabush Mines, as Joe indicated earlier. Average revenue is anticipated to be in the range of approximately $160 to $165 per ton for 2011. Average cash cost per ton for 2011 is expected to be between $90 and $95, slightly higher than the previous guidance.
Eastern Canadian iron ore segment DD&A is anticipated to be $16 per ton. In addition, Bloom Lake's noncash inventory step-up expense is expected to be approximately $8 per ton for the year. In our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment, we're maintaining our expected sales volume of 8.8 million tons and production volume of 9 million tons. Per ton revenue is expected to be $155 to $160, and cash cost per ton between $60 and $65, with approximately $11 of DD&A.
Sales and production at estimates for 2011 at our North American coal segment have been reduced to 4 million tons from 4.5 million tons, primarily as a result of adjustments to our sales volume plans from Oak Grove in December. We expect to sell approximately 1.6 million tons of low [indiscernible] coals and 1.4 million tons of high vol met coal with the balance [indiscernible]. Average revenue per ton for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $115 to $120 per ton. Cash cost per ton in North American coal is projected to be between 1 ton and 1.15, with approximately $20 noncash DD&A. 
Cliffs 2011 full year estimates for SG&A expenses approximately $290 million, which includes $35 million related to profit-sharing at Sonoma and $25 million in nonrecurring acquisition-related cost related to the acquisition of [indiscernible] Thompson. 
In addition, we anticipate incurring a total of $40 million for exploration activities and approximately $45 million related to our Bloom Lake project. Based on our current expectations, we intend to generate approximately $2.2 billion in cash from operations in 2011. Our CapEx being revised down from the previously anticipated $1 billion to approximately $900 million, as a result of timing and lower-than-anticipated cash outlays for our growth projects, which all remain on schedule. 
And with that, I'll turn the floor back over to Joe for final comment before we begin, the Q&A. Joe?"

We do not have any knowledge right now of blast furnaces being idled like they were in '09 to our knowledge. We have had some of the blast furnaces of our customers, the maintenance has been pulled forward. With that, so a lot of it is around the shipping and the timing and of course the customers have to think about going into the winter and where the winter lower lake inventories go with it. So that's a difficult -- what the answer other than what -- we stated as we went to the script that we're still within the balance of blast furnace utilizations and don't have any knowledge of blast furnaces being idled at this point in time.

However, we do acknowledge the recent softening of iron ore spot prices. This is not entirely surprising given the immediate macroeconomic concerns over future growth rates in certain world economies and volatility in virtually all industrial commodities. 
As many of you know, since the end of the annual benchmark pricing mechanism, Cliffs has been moving sales agreements to more narrow pricing periods that are closer to the shipping date. We anticipate our industry will continue in this direction, moving away from lagging pricing periods and towards those that are closer to shipping or landing dates. For Cliffs, while lower spot pricing will directly impact results given our exposure to the seaborne market, we expect to run a very profitable business at these iron ore spot prices. Fluctuation in pricing is expected and current reduced spot pricing is still very healthy and indicative of a strong global demand. We believe the megatrends underpinning our industry, in general, remain intact, including industrialization of emerging economies which continues to support our growth and expansion initiatives.
After the deterioration of benchmark pricing, we have often stated our belief that iron ore will trade within a pricing band, affected by certain realtime market conditions and dynamics. Barring any further material deterioration in European or North American economies, we expect 2012's pricing band will remain relatively consistent with 2011's range. 
Now turning to the performance of our core business during the quarter. Sales volume in U.S. iron ore increased to 7.9 million tons compared with 6.9 million tons sold in last year's third quarter. This includes approximately 0.5 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations going into the seaborne market during the quarter. Due to vessel availability and adjustments in customer pellet requirements, we are revising our full-year 2011 U.S. iron ore sales volume expectations to 24 million tons, down from our previous expectation of 25 million tons.
In 2012, we expect to see steelmaking utilization rates range between 70% and 75%. Based on this, we expect to produce and sell approximately 23 million tons from our U.S. iron ore business segment next year. 
Now turning to Eastern Canadian Iron Ore. Sales volume for the quarter was 3.1 million tons, a 294% increase over last year's third quarter. This increase was a result of approximately 1.8 million tons of concentrate sales from Bloom Lake, an increased year-over-year sales volume at Wabush Mines. During September, Bloom Lake reduced at an 8 million-ton run rate for 10 consecutive days. Given that, we feel confident in reaching the 8 million-ton annual production rate previously indicated.
Despite our ramp-up progress at Bloom Lake, we are reducing our full-year 2011 sales volume expectation in Eastern Canadian Iron Ore to 8 million tons from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. This lower sales volume expectation is partially attributed to pellet availability from Wabush and partially related to a transition in our marketing strategy to work more directly with end-users of the product and less with trading customers in Asia. We have delivered Bloom Lake concentrate to 2 of our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers during the quarter and we'll continue working with our customers to  test trial cargoes. We believe this strategic shift will provide increased sales flexibility over the long term and build stronger relationships among large seaborne customers.
Throughout the integration and optimization process within our Eastern Canadian operations, it is our goal to achieve the production reliability and consistency that has been established over time with our U.S. and Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. I am pleased to report that our Phase 2 expansion at Bloom Lake is moving ahead as planned. The concentrating facility's exterior framework is complete and in the process of being enclosed. This work is expected to be finalized by year end, enabling interior work at the plant to move forward throughout the winter months.
For next year, we expect to produce and sell approximately 12 million tons from our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment, comprised of approximately 1/3 pellets and 2/3 concentrate. 
Turning to Asia Pacific Iron Ore. Third quarter sales volume was nearly flat at 2.4 million tons when compared to 2010's third quarter. For the remainder of 2011, virtually all vessels and orders are booked through the end of November. We are maintaining our sales volume expectation for 2011 at 8.8 million tons. Our Asia Pacific Iron Ore expansion to 11 million tons per year is progressing well. All equipment deliveries are complete, along with the rail over paths in the town of Esperanza. 
Considering the challenging labor and equipment markets in Western Australia, I'm very pleased about the team's success there in completing all required expansion-related stripping and other mine prep work. This is enabling project completion ahead of schedule and on budget. As such, we anticipate our 2012 sales and production volumes in Asia Pacific Iron Ore to be approximately 11 million tons. The product mix is expected to be similar to prior periods, evenly split between the lump and volumes.
Now turning to our North American Coal segment. As many of you know, production at our low-vol met coal mines was largely down during the quarter as a result of our previously disclosed carbon monoxide detected at Pinnacle Mine, along with restoration construction at the Oak Grove Mine. After receiving approval to restart operations, we commenced Pinnacle's longwall machine in early October. At Oak Grove Mine, the prep plan is expected to restart in December with customer shipments to resume in January. 
Our high-vol met coal and thermal mines acquired last year from INR Energy continued to achieve record shipping levels, outperforming our plan for these assets. Near the end of the quarter, production began at Lower War Eagle, which is slightly ahead of schedule. 
For 2011, we have reduced our sales volume expectation to 4 million tons from our previous expectation of 4.5 million tons. The decrease is primarily related to sales from Oak Grove resuming in January 2012 rather than our previous estimate of December 2011. We expect 2012 to be the turnaround year for our North American Coal business. We anticipate being well positioned for increased volumes and improved profitability. That said, we expect to sell 7.2 million tons and produce 6.6 million tons of coal from this business segment next year. 
We are approximately 75% of our anticipated 2012 met coal volumes open for pricing. For the met coal tonnage already priced, we are at approximately $150 per short ton at the mine. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights. Laurie?"
261738,141453516,180325,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Following on Joe's comments, our record performance reinforces our strategic growth and diversification efforts. Despite the recent valuation declines for commodity producers in the market, we believe our long-term strategy will continue t",1919,"Thank you, Joe. Following on Joe's comments, our record performance reinforces our strategic growth and diversification efforts. Despite the recent valuation declines for commodity producers in the market, we believe our long-term strategy will continue to add value for shareholders. Our growth profile is pointed at deploying the economically healthiest regions in the world. Our growth is based on organic expansion initiatives and is expected to result in significant cash flow generation in 2011's final quarter and well beyond.
To further support these efforts, during the third quarter, we replaced our $600 million revolving credit facility with the new $1.75 billion credit facility that has no meaningfully restrictive debt covenant. This solid capital structure will allow us to advance current projects in our global pipeline and remain opportunistic while at the same time, returning capital to shareholders. To that end, in the last 18 months, our board has tripled the annualized cash dividend to more than $1 per share and also authorized a $4 million share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we bought 3 million shares at an average price of $74 per share, lowering our current diluted shares outstanding to approximately 143 million. From a P&L standpoint, the third quarter of 2011 marked our 6th consecutive record-breaking quarter. Consolidated sales increased to an all-time quarterly record of $2.1 billion, which is 59% higher than the record $1.3 billion in sales set in last year's third quarter.
This pushed our revenue for the September 9-month ended period past $5 billion, which exceeds 2010's full-year record revenue of $4.6 billion. In addition, our year-to-date September diluted EPS of $10.12 per share well exceeds 2010's full-year diluted EPS of $7.49. Increased prices for iron ore products and sales from our recently acquired Bloom Lake operations contributed to the quarter's standout performance.
Sales margin expanded 81% to $863 million compared with $477 million in last year's third quarter. This resulted in quarterly operating income of $820 million, more than doubling the $390 million posted in 2010's third quarter. Net income attributable to Cliffs shareholders reached $590 million or $4.07 per diluted share, exceeding last year's record of $297 million or $2.18 per diluted share.
Included in net income for the quarter is a $17.5 million net of tax, noncash loss from discontinued operations. Due to our previously settled pricing arbitration and a favorable pricing environment, Cliffs' minority partners interest in Empire Mine increased to a positive equity position during the quarter. As a result, Cliffs is now fully consolidating Empire Mine with the partner's interest reflected on the noncontrolling interest line item on the P&L. Historically, Cliffs reported Empire Mine as a captive cost entity. The net impact of fully consolidating was an $83 million reduction to earnings attributable to Cliffs shareholders, of which $68 million is related to prior quarter adjustments within 2011. The total adjustment had an impact to the quarter's earnings per share of $0.57 per share. 
In addition, our third quarter effective income tax rate was 2% as a result of the combined impact of fully consolidating Empire Mine, along with strategic tax planning and certain discrete items. The benefits in the quarter to our tax expense are primarily related to changes in foreign currency, which ultimately impact tax liabilities, along with other discrete items. As a result, we now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be an estimated 18% including discrete items. This is lower than our previous expectation of 26%.
I would also point out that during the quarter, we incurred $152 million attributable to noncontrolling interest. Approximately $34.5 million of this is related to our minority partner's 25% interest in Bloom Lake Mine, with the remaining attributable to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. Noncontrolling interest for both mines will be recurring items in our financial statements in future reporting periods. 
Turning to our U.S. Iron Ore reporting segment, in last night's release for comparison purposes, we included 2 tables as appendixes related to the full consolidation of Empire Mine's impact on our U.S. Iron Ore segment and also on our consolidated income statement. These adjustments had no impact on U.S. Iron Ore sales margin dollars reported for the quarter. For comparability, it's helpful to look at U.S. Iron Ore excluding the adjustments for Empire Mine. 
On this basis, sales volume for the quarter increased 9% to 7.4 million tons from the previous year's third quarter. Revenue per ton was $125, up 24% from the previous year, driven by higher pricing and volume. Cash costs were down to $57 per ton, primarily due to greater fixed cost leverage versus the prior year's quarter. As I mentioned, the adjustments related to Empire Mine had no impact on U.S. Iron Ore sales margin dollars, which increased 82% to $481 million from $264 million last year. Our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore business generated revenues of $517 million compared with $124 million in the third quarter of 2010. Sales prices averaged $166 per ton, up about 5% compared with last year's $158 per ton. 
Impressively during the third quarter, Bloom Lake contributed approximately $155 million in cash sales margin to the company's result. Cash cost per ton in the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment averaged $87, down 6% from last year's $93 per ton, reflecting lower realized cost related to production at Bloom Lake, partially offset by higher cash costs at Wabush Mine as a result of increased royalty rate, labor cost, shipping, stripping and transportation rate.
Bloom Lake's cash costs were $74 per ton during the quarter, higher than second quarter's cash cost of $66 per ton. The increase is primarily driven by approximately $14 per ton related to lower production in the quarter, as well as mining costs related to the Phase 2 expansion. Although higher quarter-over-quarter, we anticipate Bloom Lake's cash cost to be approximately $60 per ton by year end. While this is slightly increased from our previous expectation of $55 per ton, we believe the long-term benefit of making the investments today is the most effective way to manage the mine for the future.
Wabush Mine's cash cost per ton were $106 during the quarter, lower when compared with second quarter's cash cost primarily due to increased sales and production volumes during the quarter. Also during the quarter, the company incurred a noncash, nonrecurring expense of $11 million associated with the step-up of inventory at Bloom Lake.
Turning to the Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. Average revenue per ton in the quarter increased 33% to $170 from last year's $128. Average cash cost was up 63% to $58 per ton compared with $42 per ton last year. This was due to higher royalty expense, accelerated mining cost related to our capacity expansion and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Nonetheless, per ton sales margin continued to expand 25% to $91, up from $73 in last year's comparable quarter.
In our North American Coal segment, average revenue per ton was $99 versus $118 last year. This reflects a greater percentage of lower-priced, high-vol and thermal coals year-over-year. Based on the lack of volume from Pinnacle and Oak Grove, we reported an increase in average cash cost per ton to $135 compared with $108 last year. We estimate that approximately $47 per ton of additional cash cost realized in the third quarter were due to the production curtailment. 
Looking at the balance sheet, as I mentioned previously, during the quarter, we continued our effort to transition the company's capital structure for the longer term. We replaced our $600 million revolving credit facility with the new $1.75 billion facility. We used approximately $250 million of this to pay down a portion of our term loan. At the end of September, we held $545 million in cash and equivalents and long-term debt of $3.9 billion, including the borrowings on our revolver. The company generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations year-to-date. This is a 145% increase over the comparable 9-month period in 2010. 
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we intend to continue integrating recently acquired assets and working to bridge capacity expansion to bring capacity expansions online as expected. For our U.S. Iron Ore business, as Joe mentioned, we are lowering our full-year 2011 sales volume guidance to 24 million tons, down from 25 million tons. This reflects adjustments with customer pellet requirements and shipping vessel availability. Per ton revenue expectations have changed as a result of the full consolidation of Empire Mine, but outside of this would have remained the same. We now anticipate revenue per ton in the range of $135 to $140. Note we provided in our press release a detailed discussion of the assumption on which this pricing is based. It does include an assumption of $140 per ton for iron ore finds throughout the remainder of 2011. 
We expect pellet production volume in U.S. Iron Ore to be approximately 24 million tons in 2011, with average cash cost per ton between $60 and $65. The increase, again, attributed to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. DD&A is expected to be $4 per ton. Sales volume at our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment is expected to be approximately 8 million tons, down from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. This is driven by an adjustment to Bloom Lake's current shipping plan and pellet availability at Wabush Mines, as Joe indicated earlier. Average revenue is anticipated to be in the range of approximately $160 to $165 per ton for 2011. Average cash cost per ton for 2011 is expected to be between $90 and $95, slightly higher than the previous guidance.
Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment DD&A is anticipated to be $16 per ton. In addition, Bloom Lake's noncash inventory step-up expense is expected to be approximately $8 per ton for the year. In our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment, we're maintaining our expected sales volume of 8.8 million tons and production volume of 9 million tons. Per ton revenue is expected to be $155 to $160, and cash cost per ton between $60 and $65, with approximately $11 of DD&A.
Sales and production estimates for 2011 at our North American coal segment have been reduced to 4 million tons from 4.5 million tons, primarily as a result of adjustments to our sales volume plans from Oak Grove in December. We expect to sell approximately 1.6 million tons of low-vol met coals and 1.4 million tons of high-vol met coal with the balance seeing thermal product. Average revenue per ton for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $115 to $120 per ton. Cash cost per ton in North American Coal is projected to be between 1 ton and 1.15, with approximately $20 of noncash DD&A. 
Cliffs' 2011 full-year estimate for SG&A expense is approximately $290 million, which includes $35 million related to profit sharing at Sonoma and $25 million in nonrecurring acquisition-related cost related to the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. 
In addition, we anticipate incurring a total of $40 million for exploration activities and approximately $45 million related to our Chromite project. Based on our current expectations, we intend to generate approximately $2.2 billion in cash from operations in 2011. Our CapEx budget is being revised down from the previously anticipated $1 billion to approximately $900 million, as a result of timing and lower-than-anticipated cash outlays for our growth projects, which all remain on schedule. 
And with that, I'll turn the floor back over to Joe for a final comment before we begin the Q&A. Joe?"

I think there's always been a belief of -- within the industry that there is also a floor, a natural floor that Chinese production will come off. We seem to be testing that floor right now and we'll see from there. So I think the balance would be more of Chinese production coming off if indeed the industry is correct in their assumptions on the floor pricing, the floor cost, rather for the Chinese producers.

So we're quite comfortable there, both in terms of hitting the 8 million tons and where we think we'll also be. Wabush, we think the cost will maintain and will rise slightly higher with the labor cost as they always go up year in and year out.

We do not see a dramatic drop or rise in Wabush and it's sustained at about that level of cost for quite some time with inflation in it.

The smelting tests that we've run, the pilot test in South Africa came out very well. So again, all of the signs continue to be very encouraging."

And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Last night, Cliffs reported the strongest quarter in the company's history. Third quarter's results were driven by strong demand for our products throughout 2011. North American blast furn",1199,"Thanks, Steve. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Last night, Cliffs reported the strongest quarter in the company's history. Third quarter's results were driven by strong demand for our products throughout 2011. North American blast furnace utilization rates averaged 76% during the quarter, 5% higher than the prior year's comparable quarter average of 71%. Additionally, the Platts index for iron ore pricing averaged $178 per ton during the quarter, 31% higher than 2010's average third quarter pricing. Both of these factors, coupled with the additional sales from Bloom Lake's operations, drove our exceptional third quarter results. However, we do acknowledge the recent softening of iron ore spot prices. This is not entirely surprising given the immediate macroeconomic concerns over future growth rates in certain world economies and volatility in virtually all industrial commodities. 
As many of you know, since the end of the annual benchmark pricing mechanism, Cliffs has been moving sales agreements to more narrow pricing periods that are closer to the shipping date. We anticipate our industry will continue in this direction, moving away from lagging pricing periods and towards those that are closer to shipping or landing dates. For Cliffs, while lower spot pricing will directly impact results given our exposure to the seaborne market, we expect to run a very profitable business at these iron ore spot prices. Fluctuation in pricing is expected and current reduced spot pricing is still very healthy and indicative of a strong global demand. We believe the megatrends underpinning our industry, in general, remain intact, including industrialization of emerging economies which continues to support our growth and expansion initiatives.
After the deterioration of benchmark pricing, we have often stated our belief that iron ore will trade within a pricing band, affected by certain realtime market conditions and dynamics. Barring any further material deterioration in European or North American economies, we expect 2012's pricing band will remain relatively consistent with 2011's range. 
Now turning to the performance of our core business during the quarter. Sales volume in U.S. iron ore increased to 7.9 million tons compared with 6.9 million tons sold in last year's third quarter. This includes approximately 0.5 million tons of pellets from our U.S. operations going into the seaborne market during the quarter. Due to vessel availability and adjustments in customer pellet requirements, we are revising our full-year 2011 U.S. iron ore sales volume expectations to 24 million tons, down from our previous expectation of 25 million tons.
In 2012, we expect to see steelmaking utilization rates range between 70% and 75%. Based on this, we expect to produce and sell approximately 23 million tons from our U.S. iron ore business segment next year. 
Now turning to Eastern Canadian Iron Ore. Sales volume for the quarter was 3.1 million tons, a 294% increase over last year's third quarter. This increase was a result of approximately 1.8 million tons of concentrate sales from Bloom Lake, an increased year-over-year sales volume at Wabush Mines. During September, Bloom Lake reduced at an 8 million-ton run rate for 10 consecutive days. Given that, we feel confident in reaching the 8 million-ton annual production rate previously indicated.
Despite our ramp-up progress at Bloom Lake, we are reducing our full-year 2011 sales volume expectation in Eastern Canadian Iron Ore to 8 million tons from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. This lower sales volume expectation is partially attributed to pellet availability from Wabush and partially related to a transition in our marketing strategy to work more directly with end-users of the product and less with trading customers in Asia. We have delivered Bloom Lake concentrate to 2 of our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers during the quarter and we'll continue working with our customers to test trial cargoes. We believe this strategic shift will provide increased sales flexibility over the long term and build stronger relationships among large seaborne customers.
Throughout the integration and optimization process within our Eastern Canadian operations, it is our goal to achieve the production reliability and consistency that has been established over time with our U.S. and Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. I am pleased to report that our Phase 2 expansion at Bloom Lake is moving ahead as planned. The concentrating facility's exterior framework is complete and in the process of being enclosed. This work is expected to be finalized by year end, enabling interior work at the plant to move forward throughout the winter months.
For next year, we expect to produce and sell approximately 12 million tons from our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment, comprised of approximately 1/3 pellets and 2/3 concentrate. 
Turning to Asia Pacific Iron Ore. Third quarter sales volume was nearly flat at 2.4 million tons when compared to 2010's third quarter. For the remainder of 2011, virtually all vessels and orders are booked through the end of November. We are maintaining our sales volume expectation for 2011 at 8.8 million tons. Our Asia Pacific Iron Ore expansion to 11 million tons per year is progressing well. All equipment deliveries are complete, along with the rail over paths in the town of Esperanza. 
Considering the challenging labor and equipment markets in Western Australia, I'm very pleased about the team's success there in completing all required expansion-related stripping and other mine prep work. This is enabling project completion ahead of schedule and on budget. As such, we anticipate our 2012 sales and production volumes in Asia Pacific Iron Ore to be approximately 11 million tons. The product mix is expected to be similar to prior periods, evenly split between the lump and volumes.
Now turning to our North American Coal segment. As many of you know, production at our low-vol met coal mines was largely down during the quarter as a result of our previously disclosed carbon monoxide detected at Pinnacle Mine, along with restoration construction at the Oak Grove Mine. After receiving approval to restart operations, we commenced Pinnacle's longwall machine in early October. At Oak Grove Mine, the prep plan is expected to restart in December with customer shipments to resume in January. 
Our high-vol met coal and thermal mines acquired last year from INR Energy continued to achieve record shipping levels, outperforming our plan for these assets. Near the end of the quarter, production began at Lower War Eagle, which is slightly ahead of schedule. 
For 2011, we have reduced our sales volume expectation to 4 million tons from our previous expectation of 4.5 million tons. The decrease is primarily related to sales from Oak Grove resuming in January 2012 rather than our previous estimate of December 2011. We expect 2012 to be the turnaround year for our North American Coal business. We anticipate being well positioned for increased volumes and improved profitability. That said, we expect to sell 7.2 million tons and produce 6.6 million tons of coal from this business segment next year. 
We are approximately 75% of our anticipated 2012 met coal volumes open for pricing. For the met coal tonnage already priced, we are at approximately $150 per short ton at the mine. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie for a review of the financial highlights. Laurie?"
261738,141453516,180594,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2011",2011-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Following on Joe's comments, our record performance reinforces our strategic growth and diversification efforts. Despite the recent valuation declines for commodity producers in the market, we believe our long-term strategy will continue t",1919,"Thank you, Joe. Following on Joe's comments, our record performance reinforces our strategic growth and diversification efforts. Despite the recent valuation declines for commodity producers in the market, we believe our long-term strategy will continue to add value for shareholders. Our growth profile is pointed at deploying the economically healthiest regions in the world. Our growth is based on organic expansion initiatives and is expected to result in significant cash flow generation in 2011's final quarter and well beyond.
To further support these efforts, during the third quarter, we replaced our $600 million revolving credit facility with the new $1.75 billion credit facility that has no meaningfully restrictive debt covenant. This solid capital structure will allow us to advance current projects in our global pipeline and remain opportunistic while at the same time, returning capital to shareholders. To that end, in the last 18 months, our board has tripled the annualized cash dividend to more than $1 per share and also authorized a $4 million share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we bought 3 million shares at an average price of $74 per share, lowering our current diluted shares outstanding to approximately 143 million. From a P&L standpoint, the third quarter of 2011 marked our 6th consecutive record-breaking quarter. Consolidated sales increased to an all-time quarterly record of $2.1 billion, which is 59% higher than the record $1.3 billion in sales set in last year's third quarter.
This pushed our revenue for the September 9-month ended period past $5 billion, which exceeds 2010's full-year record revenue of $4.6 billion. In addition, our year-to-date September diluted EPS of $10.12 per share well exceeds 2010's full-year diluted EPS of $7.49. Increased prices for iron ore products and sales from our recently acquired Bloom Lake operations contributed to the quarter's standout performance.
Sales margin expanded 81% to $863 million compared with $477 million in last year's third quarter. This resulted in quarterly operating income of $820 million, more than doubling the $390 million posted in 2010's third quarter. Net income attributable to Cliffs shareholders reached $590 million or $4.07 per diluted share, exceeding last year's record of $297 million or $2.18 per diluted share.
Included in net income for the quarter is a $17.5 million net of tax, noncash loss from discontinued operations. Due to our previously settled pricing arbitration and a favorable pricing environment, Cliffs' minority partners interest in Empire Mine increased to a positive equity position during the quarter. As a result, Cliffs is now fully consolidating Empire Mine with the partner's interest reflected on the noncontrolling interest line item on the P&L. Historically, Cliffs reported Empire Mine as a captive cost entity. The net impact of fully consolidating was an $83 million reduction to earnings attributable to Cliffs shareholders, of which $68 million is related to prior quarter adjustments within 2011. The total adjustment had an impact to the quarter's earnings per share of $0.57 per share. 
In addition, our third quarter effective income tax rate was 2% as a result of the combined impact of fully consolidating Empire Mine, along with strategic tax planning and certain discrete items. The benefits in the quarter to our tax expense are primarily related to changes in foreign currency, which ultimately impact tax liabilities, along with other discrete items. As a result, we now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be an estimated 18% including discrete items. This is lower than our previous expectation of 26%.
I would also point out that during the quarter, we incurred $152 million attributable to noncontrolling interest. Approximately $34.5 million of this is related to our minority partner's 25% interest in Bloom Lake Mine, with the remaining attributable to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. Noncontrolling interest for both mines will be recurring items in our financial statements in future reporting periods. 
Turning to our U.S. Iron Ore reporting segment, in last night's release for comparison purposes, we included 2 tables as appendixes related to the full consolidation of Empire Mine's impact on our U.S. Iron Ore segment and also on our consolidated income statement. These adjustments had no impact on U.S. Iron Ore sales margin dollars reported for the quarter. For comparability, it's helpful to look at U.S. Iron Ore excluding the adjustments for Empire Mine. 
On this basis, sales volume for the quarter increased 9% to 7.4 million tons from the previous year's third quarter. Revenue per ton was $125, up 24% from the previous year, driven by higher pricing and volume. Cash costs were down to $57 per ton, primarily due to greater fixed cost leverage versus the prior year's quarter. As I mentioned, the adjustments related to Empire Mine had no impact on U.S. Iron Ore sales margin dollars, which increased 82% to $481 million from $264 million last year. Our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore business generated revenues of $517 million compared with $124 million in the third quarter of 2010. Sales prices averaged $166 per ton, up about 5% compared with last year's $158 per ton. 
Impressively during the third quarter, Bloom Lake contributed approximately $155 million in cash sales margin to the company's results. Cash cost per ton in the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment averaged $87, down 6% from last year's $93 per ton, reflecting lower realized cost related to production at Bloom Lake, partially offset by higher cash costs at Wabush Mine as a result of increased royalty rate, labor cost, shipping, stripping and transportation rate.
Bloom Lake's cash costs were $74 per ton during the quarter, higher than second quarter's cash cost of $66 per ton. The increase is primarily driven by approximately $14 per ton related to lower production in the quarter, as well as mining costs related to the Phase 2 expansion. Although higher quarter-over-quarter, we anticipate Bloom Lake's cash cost to be approximately $60 per ton by year end. While this is slightly increased from our previous expectation of $55 per ton, we believe the long-term benefit of making the investments today is the most effective way to manage the mine for the future.
Wabush Mine's cash cost per ton were $106 during the quarter, lower when compared with second quarter's cash cost primarily due to increased sales and production volumes during the quarter. Also during the quarter, the company incurred a noncash, nonrecurring expense of $11 million associated with the step-up of inventory at Bloom Lake.
Turning to the Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. Average revenue per ton in the quarter increased 33% to $170 from last year's $128. Average cash cost was up 63% to $58 per ton compared with $42 per ton last year. This was due to higher royalty expense, accelerated mining cost related to our capacity expansion and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Nonetheless, per ton sales margin continued to expand 25% to $91, up from $73 in last year's comparable quarter.
In our North American Coal segment, average revenue per ton was $99 versus $118 last year. This reflects a greater percentage of lower-priced, high-vol and thermal coals year-over-year. Based on the lack of volume from Pinnacle and Oak Grove, we reported an increase in average cash cost per ton to $135 compared with $108 last year. We estimate that approximately $47 per ton of additional cash cost realized in the third quarter were due to the production curtailment. 
Looking at the balance sheet, as I mentioned previously, during the quarter, we continued our effort to transition the company's capital structure for the longer term. We replaced our $600 million revolving credit facility with the new $1.75 billion facility. We used approximately $250 million of this to pay down a portion of our term loans. At the end of September, we held $545 million in cash and equivalents and long-term debt of $3.9 billion, including the borrowings on our revolver. The company generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations year-to-date. This is a 145% increase over the comparable 9-month period in 2010. 
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we intend to continue integrating recently acquired assets and working to bridge capacity expansion to bring capacity expansions online as expected. For our U.S. Iron Ore business, as Joe mentioned, we are lowering our full-year 2011 sales volume guidance to 24 million tons, down from 25 million tons. This reflects adjustments with customer pellet requirements and shipping vessel availability. Per ton revenue expectations have changed as a result of the full consolidation of Empire Mine, but outside of this would have remained the same. We now anticipate revenue per ton in the range of $135 to $140. Note we provided in our press release a detailed discussion of the assumption on which this pricing is based. It does include an assumption of $140 per ton for iron ore finds throughout the remainder of 2011. 
We expect pellet production volume in U.S. Iron Ore to be approximately 24 million tons in 2011, with average cash cost per ton between $60 and $65. The increase, again, attributed to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. DD&A is expected to be $4 per ton. Sales volume at our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment is expected to be approximately 8 million tons, down from our previous expectation of 9 million tons. This is driven by an adjustment to Bloom Lake's current shipping plan and pellet availability at Wabush Mines, as Joe indicated earlier. Average revenue is anticipated to be in the range of approximately $160 to $165 per ton for 2011. Average cash cost per ton for 2011 is expected to be between $90 and $95, slightly higher than the previous guidance.
Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment DD&A is anticipated to be $16 per ton. In addition, Bloom Lake's noncash inventory step-up expense is expected to be approximately $8 per ton for the year. In our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment, we're maintaining our expected sales volume of 8.8 million tons and production volume of 9 million tons. Per ton revenue is expected to be $155 to $160, and cash cost per ton between $60 and $65, with approximately $11 of DD&A.
Sales and production estimates for 2011 at our North American coal segment have been reduced to 4 million tons from 4.5 million tons, primarily as a result of adjustments to our sales volume plans from Oak Grove in December. We expect to sell approximately 1.6 million tons of low-vol met coals and 1.4 million tons of high-vol met coal with the balance seeing thermal product. Average revenue per ton for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $115 to $120 per ton. Cash cost per ton in North American Coal is projected to be between 1 ton and 1.15, with approximately $20 of noncash DD&A. 
Cliffs' 2011 full-year estimate for SG&A expense is approximately $290 million, which includes $35 million related to profit sharing at Sonoma and $25 million in nonrecurring acquisition-related cost related to the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. 
In addition, we anticipate incurring a total of $40 million for exploration activities and approximately $45 million related to our Chromite project. Based on our current expectations, we intend to generate approximately $2.2 billion in cash from operations in 2011. Our CapEx budget is being revised down from the previously anticipated $1 billion to approximately $900 million, as a result of timing and slower-than-anticipated cash outlays for our growth projects, which all remain on schedule. 
And with that, I'll turn the floor back over to Joe for a final comment before we begin the Q&A. Joe?"

We do not have any knowledge right now of blast furnaces being idled like they were in '09, to our knowledge. We have had some of the blast furnaces of our customers, the maintenance has been pulled forward with that.

This mine is still in ramp-up phase, as I've said. We're very encouraged by hitting the 8 million-ton mark with that. But at the same time, we're still adjusting some spirals and some balances there, and we're also adjusting the mine plan and putting better ore feeds. Again, we think that some of the synergies and a lot of the value that we bring to the mine from the great job the Consolidated Thompson did when they built the mine. We're just starting to smooth the edges off, if you will, and we do anticipate the cost to come down. Those learnings that we're getting right now, we're incorporating into the new design of the new plant that comes on and we expect we can stabilize these costs down into the $60 raise that Laurie talked about."

The credits squeeze is certainly tightening up the market, as you know right now, with the steel production and then on to the customers. I think there's always been a belief of -- within the industry that there is also a floor, a natural floor that Chinese production will come off. We seem to be testing that floor right now and we'll see from there. So I think the balance would be more of Chinese production coming off if indeed the industry is correct in their assumptions on the floor pricing, the floor cost, rather for the Chinese producers. And that's really where it would be made up in the first half of the year, for sure, and if credit were to ease a little bit in China, that may give it some momentum in the second half of the year."

We've got hit with 2 events this year that really didn't allow us to properly evaluate the 2 legacy coal mines that we've got. As you know the tornado, which will come out in late December, so shipments will come in January now instead of December. So we've got to get that mine up and running and give Dave and his gang a chance to see where that is. And also that new shaft that we've talked about will be in production as well, so we should get something from there. Over at Pinnacle, again, obviously, we got hit with the carbon monoxide that kept us down for well over 100 days of getting -- the ramp-up is going very nicely. The longwall and the associated systems are performing very well with that, so we've got some encouragement. But '12, it should be a clean year for us, with all of the 3 projects that we've talked about in the past being in place with where they are and we're going to have make some serious calls on that. One thing that I would like to highlight as well, and by no means is this a defense for the legacy coal mines, but our iron ore assets that we purchased a year ago are performing very well and above the plans that we had and we're quite pleased with them.

So we're quite comfortable there, both in terms of hitting the 8 million tons and where we think we'll also be. Wabush, we think the cost will maintain and will rise slightly higher with the labor cost as they always go up year in and year out. These are union contracts at Wabush, so they're already built into the projections. We do not see a dramatic drop or rise in Wabush and it's sustained at about that level of cost for quite some time with inflation in it. In the U.S., again, there is inflectionary pressure that's coming on, I think, because most of the mining companies have reported with it.

With that, we think there's still a pretty big hole in there for the iron ore businesses at stance today with that and to trade within a range for the mills to be profitable."
