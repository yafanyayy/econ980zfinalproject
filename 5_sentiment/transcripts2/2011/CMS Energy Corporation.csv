Let me welcome everyone who is joining us today on the call. 2010 was another good year for CMS, both financially and operationally. We adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 slightly exceeding our guidance and up 8% from the $1.26 in 2009. T",1171,"Thanks, Laura. Let me welcome everyone who is joining us today on the call. 2010 was another good year for CMS, both financially and operationally. We adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 slightly exceeding our guidance and up 8% from the $1.26 in 2009. The increase was driven primarily by recovery of investments and aggressively managing our O&M costs.
Our Board raised the common dividend twice last year by a combined total of 68%. This was the fourth increase since restoring the dividend in 2007 and raises the payout ratio to a more competitive 58%. With the increase in the dividend, our total shareholder return for 2010 was 23%. Customer value is one of the cornerstones of our business strategy.
Last year we enhanced customer value on several fronts. We restructured the workforce early in the year, reducing cost by $30 million on an annual basis. We spent over $55 million on energy efficiency programs. Our customers saved energy and money, and our shareholders earned an incentive for exceeding the annual energy savings targets established by the MPSC.
We also continue to improve reliability on the electric distribution system. Customer outage minutes decreased by 13% last year, and we are now down 36% over the last five years. And we improved employee safety by 20% in 2010 and 57% over the past five years. I’m very pleased with the performance of the management team over the past seven years as we restructured our business and focused on the utility. We set a high standard for performance. As the graph illustrates, it is resulted in consistent financial performance and competitive shareholder returns.
Our annualized earnings per share is up 8% over this time period and expected to be up another 6% this year. Contributing to the future growth, we signed a new contract to upgrade the Ludington Pumped Storage facility. We plan to invest approximately $400 million over 10 years to improve the plant’s efficiency and increase its generating capacity by 16% to about 2,200 megawatts.
The plant allows us to store energy, which will become even more valuable with the development of renewable energy in Michigan. All major contracts for the development of our 100 megawatt Lake Winds Energy Park have been signed and approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission. Construction will begin later this year, and the energy park will be operational by the end of 2012.
We have also completed the majority of work on two major environmental projects to further reduce emissions from our coal-fired plants. We are in the process of installing an SCR at our Campbell plant to reduce NOx, and we are also installing a pulse jet fabric filter at our current plant to comply with EPA standards. These projects continue to add value to our customers, improve the environment, add to our rate base, and help boost earnings going forward.
We’ve recognized that customer value is a critical element to continuing to deliver long-term financial results. In that regard, we have developed several areas of focus to improve the customer value proposition. We have redesigned the customer bills and our website. We have also improved the performance of our call centers. We signed a new five-year labor agreement with the union that provides for increased healthcare cost sharing and changed post-retirement health benefits. Going forward, this eliminates the legacy cost for all new salary and union employees.
We plan to continue maximizing our energy optimization programs to help our customers lower their energy consumption. So far, over 300,000 customers have taken advantage of the programs we offer, helping them to save energy and money. System reliability is an important element of customer satisfaction. As referenced earlier, we continue to make improvements to system reliability in both the electric and gas distribution areas. We plan to spend more than $400 million over the next five years to continue improvement in these areas.
And finally, the most important aspect of service is delivering reliable power at a competitive price. Over the next five years, we plan to invest over $6 billion to drive rate base and earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. However, with a sharp focus on managing our cost and achieving the benefits from our investment programs, we plan to hold customer base rate increases to about the rate of inflation. We believe this represents a good balance between price and enhance customer value.
As illustrated on this slide, over 80% of our $6 billion investment plan relates to maintaining our electric and gas distribution systems, leading environmental requirements, and achieving the 10% renewable standard in Michigan. The remaining investments are targeted at improving safety, system reliability, and providing a smart grid for our customers.
To meet Michigan 10% renewable energy standard, we are required to add at least 500 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity by 2015. To achieve this level, we have entered into purchase power agreements that will provide 300 megawatts of capacity by the end of 2012. And we have plans to develop 250 megawatts of our Lake Winds and Cross Winds Energy Parks by the end of 2014.
As a result of declining production costs, better capacity factors and the production tax credits, the cost to comply with the standard has declined significantly since our plan was approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission in 2009. Today, we will file an amended plan with the Commission that will lower the customer surcharge by $55 million or 70% from $78 million per year to $23 million per year, with no impact to our long-term earnings per share growth rate. We anticipate that this reduction will be effective by the end of the year. This does not change our plans to invest $650 million over the next five years at our two energy parks.
Turning now to the regulatory front, we are in our third year of regulation, following the passage of the 2008 Michigan Energy Law. We have completed two electric rate cases and one gas case. And by all accounts, the process has worked smoothly and efficiently. Cases were filed, rates were self-implemented, and a final order was received within 12 months of filing.
However, in the current gas rate case, the Commission has delayed our self-implementation to give parties an opportunity to respond to our process or proposed the keys from $48 million to $29.5 million. They filed the responses earlier this week, and we have until March 1st to file the reply. This will delay our self-implementation by several weeks from our original date. We will continue to work with the Commission to resolve this issue, which we believe is procedural in nature.
Our strategy has delivered proven results, both financially and operationally. We will continue to improve in all areas with an added emphasis on customer value. Safe, excellent operations coupled with competitive prices translates into value for our customers and ultimately value for our shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to review the financial performance in greater detail.

Let me add my welcome to everyone joining the call today. We certainly appreciate it. 2010 was a good year for CMS Energy. Our reported earnings were $1.28 a share, and that’s $0.37 or about 40% above last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.36, up",1538,"Thanks, John. Let me add my welcome to everyone joining the call today. We certainly appreciate it. 2010 was a good year for CMS Energy. Our reported earnings were $1.28 a share, and that’s $0.37 or about 40% above last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.36, up a $0.10 from last year and just above our guidance.
We excluded from adjusted earnings a substantially favorable insurance settlement worth $0.11 as well as unfavorable legacy cost principally $0.10 for environmental remediation at a site at Northern Michigan called Bay Harbor. We increased the remaining reserve from $58 million to $98 million to ensure adequate financial capacity. We are in the final stages of this work, and we expect that we are near the end of these costs.
Now, back to 2010 overall, we started the year by restructuring the utility when we eliminated 5% of our workforce to stay aligned with the demand and to minimize the size of rate increases to our customers. We sold non-utility assets including small renewable facilities in California and Connecticut.
We also completed $800 million of refinancing at the parent permitting us to reduce the ongoing cost of debt service, eliminate dilution overhang, and improve our liquidity. This included pre-funding parent debt maturities as well as $375 million of pension contribution for 2011 and most of 2012. We exceeded energy optimization targets that permitted us to recognize the maximum incentive payout of $8 million. This does not count in our ROE performance compared with authorized levels.
We adopted the fourth year of bonus depreciation, allowing us to sustain higher levels of investment in Michigan and to extend the use of our NOLs another two years. And last but certainly not least, we did raise our dividend by 20% last January and another 40% in August. The economy turned favorable in 2010. Industrial sales in our service territory were up 10%, with total weather-adjusted electric sales up 2%.
Residential and commercial sales lagged, as shown in the left of this slide. The recession impacted our sales less than the one that occurred in the early ‘80s when sales fell 7% over three years. The recent decline ended up with a drop of 6%, but as you can see in the yellow ovals on this slide, we are planning on a slower recovery. One at about half the pace experienced in the early ‘80s. We may be a little conservative, but as you know, we seek to plan cautiously.
Our earnings improvement in 2010 compared with 2009 reflected planned investment at the utility and continued solid growth at enterprises. We did not repeat an $0.08 gain on refinancing in 2009, and in fact, we recognized $0.04 related to the cost of prefunding debt and $0.09 of dilution to improve our position in 2011. You will see more about this in just a moment.
The key driver to our financial performance, however, continues to be the utility where we focused all of our investment resources to deliver substantially improved customer performance, from energy efficiency to environmental upgrades to additional renewable capacity and the major improvements in reliability and safety.
As you can see here, investment levels in 2009 and 2010 were higher than the previous five years to meet the substantial needs of our customers. This is a major factor in the improvement of our gross operating cash flow, and that’s cash flow before working capital, taxes and interest expense. It reflects the improving capacity of the company to meet future needs. This measure has been a weak point compared with other utilities in the past. It’s becoming a strong point, particularly when coupled with our substantial NOLs that provide a consolidated tax shelter through 2014.
Bonus depreciation enacted into law last December enhanced our tax advantage position further, effectively extending the planned use of our NOLs by about two years. Bonus depreciation helps us at the utility where all our capital investment occurs. We put this new bonus depreciation cash benefit to good use by accelerating investment and pension funding, as well as reducing debt. This, however, leaves less tax sharing with the parent, reflecting the improved shelter at the utility. Near-term, that requires more debt on a temporary basis at the parent, and of course, all this nets out on a consolidated basis.
The great news, our tax shelter is largely in the form of NOLs at the parent last longer putting off the need to issue new equity through 2015. We met all our report card targets, save one for 2010. The phase of the parent debt is higher and originally planned, as we replaced less attractive equity-related financing costing about 4.5% a year, with more attractive low-cost debt costing 2.5% a year. We exceeded all other targets, including the utility equity ratio, cash flow to debt, operating cash flow and earnings.
Now let’s look ahead into this year. We expect sales growth to accelerate with residential sales recovering behind the sharp rebound in industrial sales. Many of our industrial customers have resumed pre-recession levels of production. Commercial sales, however, likely will be flat. As you can see here, utility earnings should continue strong reflecting a healthy level of investment to meet the needs of our customers.
Costs are recovered largely in a proved rate with less than a quarter coming from new rate request. The delayed self-implementation of the gas rate case in progress likely will have a negative impact of about $0.01. We have included this in our guidance. Gas weather benefits reflect the absence of a mild weather in 2010 and a cold start in 2011.
Please note the refinancing benefit shown here at $0.09. This is the saving that I mentioned earlier. The strong operational and financial platform put in place over the last few years continues to support improving customer service as well as earnings. Here is the utility investment and gross operating cash flow slide we just looked at, with plans for 2011 added.
Both investment and cash flow continue to grow. During the 10 years prior to 2007, investment averaged a little less than $600 million, rising to an average of about $800 million in the 2004 to 2008 period and $1.1 billion this year. That drives the gross operating cash flow up at a similar pace, strengthening the capacity for future growth.
And most of you tell us that you do appreciate having a ready reckoner to assess risk and opportunities on your own. Here is the latest version. Our risk mitigation programs had helped us to substantially minimize exposure to changes in sales, fuel prices, collections, and other costs. It continues to be important that we deliver strong customer value and earn our authorized ROE levels.
We appreciate our Public Service Commission’s foresight with continuing a competitive level of authorized ROEs, sending a clear message that they understand what it takes to attract investment to the State of Michigan. And as you know, we work hard to earn about the level of authorized ROE. We consistently reinvest surpluses when they occur to help our customers knowing that earning our ROE allows us to deliver an attractive growth in earnings per share.
For 2011, here is our new report card. We set the EPS at $1.40, up another 6%. Most of you have asked us to maintain a point estimate rather than a range as provided by most companies. And we will work diligently to deliver on it. For gross operating cash flow, we picked the goal at a level up another notch reflecting the continued growth and strength of the company. All this provides metrics that reflect the next step beyond the past seven years of growth that we project to continue over the next five years.
Our planned rate base growth continues at 5% to 7%. That compares to a level of growth at 4% in the past. We are able to project EPS growth rates at 5% to 7% in part because of our ability to finance a good piece of the growth with avoided tax rather than dilutive equity. New bonus depreciation extends the value of our NOLs through 2014. Doing all this while holding down rate base related price increases at about the rate of inflation makes this plan even more practical and sustainable.
On this slide, you can see that 5% to 7% operating cash flow growth that goes along with the equivalent EPS growth. The investment that drives this growth is all focused on our customers at the utility.
We recognized the importance of earning the support of our customers and you, our investors, everyday. We completed cost restructuring last year, both at the utility and enterprises. We structured our debt portfolio, enhancing liquidity and cost. We grew our earnings and our cash flow more than planned. We substantially accelerated the plan to increase our dividend. We structured ourselves in a way to eliminate the need for new dilutive equity. We’ve vigorously employed risk mitigation. And in the future, we hope to deliver more of the same. We hope our track record speaks for itself.
And on that note, John and I would be delighted to take your questions. So, operator, could you please open the call for us?

As you know, there is a lot of complicated features of healthcare as well as the pension. And the first things what we’ve done on operational basis, and John may even want to comment on that in a moment, we worked very hard with our salaried employees and our hourly employees and made sure that we’ve done everything we can to eliminate legacy cost. So in our position where we’ve been able to move our people to define contribution programs instead of defined benefit programs when there are new employees coming in. That’s been true on the salaries side for several years and obviously that yields some nice benefits.
On the healthcare side, same kind of thing. We try to do cost sharing with our employees so that they pay a portion of what the healthcare costs are and could that save money for you as an investor. So those are some of the operational ways that we are trying to balance giving good compensation and benefits to our employees and yet keep the cost as best we can in a reasonable way. And I want to hit the second side of that and just suggest that. There are things that we don’t control so well, and the best example I have is whatever the discount rates are at the end of the year, like on the pension funds, those are going to eat our health or hurt us, and those will be recognized for the year ahead.
So, as interest rates are down a little bit and the discounting changes a little bit and when they go the other way, which they are likely to go next year, those discount rates will probably rise and we’ll probably get a little bit of help. So there is a lot of mechanics in here. But here is the bottom line financial message. We pick up whatever all those changes are and try to acknowledge those in our results and then deal with them and continue to provide for you a consistent growth in earnings per share. So they are just like - if all of a sudden we have storms, and we had one here recently, cost us some money, then they cost us more than what we’ve planned to do. We look at our business overall and we figure out what can we do to adjust to make sure we take care of our customers and we deliver the earnings per share growth.

So, no, I don’t really see that. There’s been a change of administration here in Michigan, a change of the House and Senate, more driven by the Republicans now. They are driven by the Republicans who I think will see this decline as more reasonable cost for renewable energy. But let it be stated that with all the hard work we did to reduce these costs, renewable energy is more competitive than it was, but it’s more expensive than base.

I’d tell you that there are many issues that Michigan is leading with, just like other states. I’m impressed with what the Governor is doing. He has our support. As far as energy legislation, he made a statement to us and publicly at least with a few hundred people that in my terms the energy legislation for 2010 - in 2011 as far as an issue for him is off the radar screen. So it tends not to be high on his priority. He is more worried about the budget, about employment and getting Michigan back on track. So - and the other thing too to provide comfort for you, many of the leaders, the House Chair and the Senate Chair of the Energy Committee were deeply involved in the passage of this energy legislation that sits today.

We did see residential was off of about 2% this last year and we expect it to be up 1% to 2% this year. Commercial was down about 1% last year, and we expect it to be flat this year. Industrial had a nice recovery of about 10% last year, and we expect that to continue with tougher comps of course to be about 6%. Here’s what I read. We are not completely out of the woods. The whole country is, and Michigan included, is still dealing with a slow jobs recovery that comes along with the recovery in the economy. What our customers are telling us though is a lot of them are right back up to where they were before on their production, particularly metals, in autos, in castings, a lot in the food area. So there is a lot of good news coming through.
What we see is caution in the degree of their hiring. They are trying to hold their productivity levels so the residential side stays a little soft. So we expect to see that come around and then commercial to follow that. Now, with double-dips for country ignored, I think we are on a nice deliberate recovery and our planning and our projections may be too conservative. I know they were last year when we said ’10 would be down and it turned to be up. But I really do think we’re going to see a slow, good, solid recovery, again, absent disasters in the Middle East or whatever could happen in the world. But we’re going to keep planning conservatively and hopefully let the economy come back a little bit better to our customers than what we project.

In Michigan, like in some states, but not all states, our deferred taxes are actually over on the liability side. They are not on the asset side of the balance sheet. So it really doesn’t change our rate base when we do this. But it does impact earnings and which we easily offset by taking on a little less debt than we plan. And we accelerated a little bit of our investment, including putting some money into our pension fund earlier than planned. Al those things together fully offset the earnings impact at the utility and then we did some similar things at the parent level. But there is a downside to this that I want to make sure that everybody knows.
The downside is, because we’ll take the tax benefits at the utility, we’ll have a couple years here where we’ll take on a little bit more debt at the parent until we’re able to use the NOLs which are at the parent. So you will see our parent debt come up just a little bit, but you’ll also see it go right back now, as we get back to using the NOLs. The greatest news of all, NOLs last us longer and they’ve got a life that goes out beyond 2023. So we were thrilled to have the benefit at the utility to extend the consolidated benefits of NOLs and not have the issue.

But what I like is it provides the regulator to have a snapshot of our business on an annual basis. They can see our business. They can talk to us about our business. They can also influence some of the things that they want us to do on our business.
And maybe it’s the way I grew up, but I saw one of the biggest regulatory challenges we’ve had as an industry and we had as a company is during a rate-free period, we stayed out of rate cases for many, many years. What that forced us to do is to get back with the fairly large rate increase and make the investments and the commitments to serve our customers. The Commission understands the strategy.

My guess is, in the few weeks it will take to get this resolved, it will be about $0.01 and we factored that into our guidance.

Those parties that are pushing for that, Ali, that you’re aware of, really the - probably the news today is the fact that from the Governor’s perspective, he - we had a meeting with him, several of us, the coalition for energy that we have, there were several people there, legislators, DTE was there, Jerry Anderson was there and myself and the Governor, all three of us spoke. And he made it clear that that’s not a top priority for him. So from my standpoint, I think that’s important to know. However, you may see the House and Senate go through some hearings just to see what the impact is. Just to give you a ballpark though, we’re at 10% now, which you’re aware of, and there is only about 500 customers that are taking choice today - actually 300 that are taking choice today. If we took all of the customers that are in the queue waiting, that would only be 4% more than what we have today. And that’s another about 500 customers.
So in perspective, and this is what we’ve told the legislators and told the Governor, we have 300 customers taking choice today, over 1.8 million customers. There is another 500 in the queue of our 1.8 million customers. If we open up the cap, cost shift will occur to residential customers. And as you know, we’ve worked very hard to ensure that we’re getting to the point of fair rates for all, that everybody pays their true cost of service. So I think what you’re going to see is you’ll hear about it, there will be a push for it; but my belief is that this law is good, the law is working, we’re only a few years into the implementation of the law. And as we talked about the renewable energy investment, we’re just beginning these investments now. So to change the bar right now, I believe it’s premature and I think we have support from the legislature and the administration on that.

And to the other end, we’re not adding more investment above the $6.5 billion because we think that would put too much pressure on our customer rates.

One, several things happen as a result of what our original estimates were compared to what we see now. We’ve negotiated very good contracts for the wind turbines, because as you knew, as we know a few years ago there was queue. The queue has kind of eroded. We were able to negotiate at the good time. We did not plan on production tax credits that are now - we’re able to get the production tax credits because we’re able to complete the works in time while the production tax credits are still available through 2012. The other thing too that we’ve seen is that Michigan does have a very good wind regime, which we had anticipated, but now that we’ve done the net tower studies, we’re seeing a much better capacity factor than we thought before. And it’s surprising how good it is in both the east side of the state and the west side of the state.
So those factors have caused us to be able to reduce the cost of the development. So we’ve advanced some of our own-builds. We’ve entered into purchase power agreements for the portion of our renewable energy targets that need to be provided by third parties. All that being done, call it we kind of hit the sweet spot for growing renewable energy in Michigan, and Michigan looks like they will be a very good source. But all that doesn’t affect our earnings per share. It still allows us to make the investment. It’s just we can reduce the surcharge now to be able to save our customers’ money while still growing at the same pace that we had before, actually accelerated in some cases, which will drive the earnings per share.

For 2011, we are projecting 2.0%, 2.5% growth, with residential coming back about 1.0%, 1.5%; industrial still strong at 6% over last year; and then commercial, flat. We don't expect to see commercial to grow until we get out to 2012. It will follow the industrial side of the business. Longer term, we are thinking around the numbers of 1% growth or something in that area. Nothing strong, because we find it's the best way to plan the business. Hopefully, we will be pleasantly surprised.
On the debt side, we are going to have a little bit of a bubble. Because of the bonus depreciation benefits at the utility, we won’t use our NOLs at the parent in the next year or two, and that will cause us to borrow a little bit more money. So you will see our debt rise up to $2 billion, $3 billion, maybe $2.4 billion at the most. That will automatically come back down, because then as we get the cash flow at the parent through the NOLs, we will bring that right back down to a level that will be about $2.1 billion.
Now, that's our kind of flat level that we've talked about. And again, we are not projecting the same. We are trying to pull that down substantially. But we will take opportunities where they make sense to just ease that down over time, because we would like to see a smaller debt burden at the parent. We think we are in a good place right now. If we invest our money in the utility, we make almost 11% return after taxes, and when we put it into debt reduction at the parent, we make 4% to 5% return after taxes. So it’s a pretty easy decision, but we are also very attuned to wanting to pull that down as we go through time and we will.

Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed discussion and the financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. And then as usual we will close out with Q&A.
We started the year with a good first quarter reporting adjusted earnings of $0.51 a share up $0.13 or 34% from 2010. The increase was due primarily to colder weather this year compared to 2010 and the benefit from an electric rate order received last November.
The business model we developed several years ago is working. And working well and continues to deliver consistent results. Our plan to invest over $6 billion in the utility over the next five years creates rate base and earnings per share growth of 5 to 7% and by using our NOLs we avoid the need for any new block equity during this period.
The good news for our customers is that we can grow rate base and earnings while minimizing base rate increases to levels at or below the rate of inflation and I will discuss this in more detail in a minute. I am also pleased to affirm our guidance at $1.44 a share. A good first quarter provides more flexibility to reinvest in customer reliability.
During the February call, I made reference to our plans to upgrade the Ludington pumped storage plant, to improve its efficiency and increase its role to support green energy sources in Michigan. This slide illustrates several of the operational benefits associated with the upgrade.
Due to its proximity to several proposed wind power developments including our Lake Winds Energy Park, the plant will act as a giant battery to store renewable energy produced during off-peak periods making renewable energy more affordable and reliable.
This project will increase the generating capacity of the plant by 15% to about 2,200 megawatts, plus the increased pumping efficiency will further decrease the plants operating cost resulting in reliable, low cost power for our customers.
As a reminder, Consumers Energy operates the plant and owns 51% of the facility. DTE owns the other 49%. Consumers Energy will spend approximately $400 million over the next 10 years to complete the upgrade.
About 25% of our $6 billion capital investment plan over the next five years will be spent to meet State and Federal environmental laws and regulations. The most recently proposed EPA rules on hazardous air pollutants and maximum available control technology are inline with our expectations and our plan. We will continue to closely monitor the development of these regulations to determine the potential effect on our operations.
By switching to low-sulfur coal and making significant investments in control technology, we reduced emissions at our coal-fired generating plants resulting in significant improvements in Michigan's air quality.
Since 1990, these investments have reduced sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emission by approximately 70%.
Till 2015, we plan to spend another $1.5 billion on our five largest coal-fired plants to further reduce emissions, keeping Michigan's air the cleanest it's been in decades.
We expect to fully recover the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations from our customers in our rates. The decision to upgrade our seven smaller coal-fired plants will be made after EPA regulations are final and we've had a chance to evaluate all of the economic factors. These units have a high utilization rate and generate power at a competitive price in today's market.
Let me give you a brief update on a regulatory agenda. This slide illustrates the history of our electric and gas rate cases since the passage of Michigan's energy law in 2008. In February, the Commission delayed our gas self-implementation to give parties an opportunity to respond to our proposed $29.5 million rate increase.
Since that time we have been engaged in settlement negotiations with all of the parties in the case. Yesterday we reached an agreement in principal with all of the parties and we are in the process of finalizing the settlement documentation. We expect to file the settlement with MPSC very soon. We also plan to file our next electric rate case in the second quarter, which will allow for self-implementation before the end of the year.
We recognize that to be successful we must deliver safe, reliable, competitively priced power for our customers. This slide lists the result of several cost reduction actions taken over the past few years to minimize the price to customers. The most significant benefit resulted from converting our plants to burn low-sulfur western coal. About 85% of the coal consumption is from Powder River Basin. The price differential has saved our customers about $250 million over two years in fuel costs.
We have taken a variety of actions listed on this slide that have resulted in base rate and surcharge price reductions for our customers. We made changes to our benefits plan and increased the cost sharing from our retirees and employees. We implemented a new SAP software system that reduced cost and improved efficiencies. Plus, we reduced the number of employees by 10% over the past five years to balance the workload with the workforce; and as we filed the request, and we filed the request with the MPSC to reduce the renewable energy surcharge.
Collectively, these actions have resulted in about a $150 million of cost reductions to our customers. I am pleased with the results of the 2010 benchmarking study by Oliver Wyman which placed us in the first quartile when comparing our cost per customer with 21 other utilities of similar size and operations over the past several years.
We cannot be satisfied with the cost reductions of the past. We have a number of initiatives underway across all business areas that are intended to improve productivity. Through these efforts, we plan to gain greater efficiencies, reduce cost and enhanced customer service and value in the future.
Customer value was a critical element to maintain good relationships with our customers and the regulators and deliver long-term financial results. We have a major initiative underway to improve customer value. A key element of providing value to our customers is the whole rate base increases to levels at or below the rate inflection. We plan to deliver competitively priced energy to our customers over the next five years, while maintaining base rates increases at about 1.5% for electric and 1% for gas.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results for the quarter.

First quarter results were solid with reported GAAP earnings at $0.52 a share. Excluding favorable news around the small legacy legal settlement, adjusted EPS was $0.51 a share. This is $0.13 or 34% above a year ago and it's our best first quarter EPS in nine years. Weather adjusted, the profits still were strong at $0.47 a share.
We are on track for electric sales to grow by 2.5% this year with the residential sales up 2% and commercial sales up about 1%. This follows as expected the industrial sales recovery of 10% last year and about 6% this year. Combined with the 2% sales improvement last year, with our forecast of 2.5 for this year, the post-recession recovery is clear, but it’s still below the down-spec experienced after the [bigger] recession in the early 80’s. We continue to plan conservatively.
Although the 10 years census showed Michigan’s population down by 1% much of the decline was outside of our service territory; where we do business population grew about 3%.
Now onto the results, we have first quarter results of $0.13 from last year. We’re on track to meet our target for the year and it’s our share we’ve referred our guidance. During the first quarter, almost $0.06 of the favorable year-over-year performance can be attributed to weather. That includes mild weather a year ago and colder than normal condition this year. We did, however, suffer from usually severe storm that exceeded our planned storm allowance by about $0.03 a share.
Now, looking ahead to the rest of the year, much of forecast to great relief is associated with the full year impact of raised order of last year. As most of you know we take advantage of favorable performance when we can to make incremental investment to add value for our customers.
Recently, we’ve been able to put more financial resources to work at further improving reliability and expect to do more in the rest of this year. The results are beginning to show up in customer surveys. We’re pleased to see that our score on the recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey of investor owned utilities was increased for the second year in a row. We are above the national average and we hope to be able to continue making improvements for our customers by spending even more on reliability improvements during the rest of this year.
Recently, we bolstered our liquidity further by renewing our five-year revolvers, a year in advance, $550 million for CMS and $500 million for consumers. We’re delighted that the market recovered enough to permit us to renew these revolvers for another five years. Combined with our $150 million three-year revolver, our AR and LC facilities and cash, our capacity totaled $2.3 billion at quarter end. Of that, $2 billion was available at March 31.
This coupled with a strong operating cash flow and use of substantial NOLs allows us to avoid the need for any new equity over the next five years.  We will of course continue our dividend reinvestment program and another small tools to grow equity even though at a very modest pace.  It's a nice position not to have to issue any equity avoiding dilution of our 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next five years.
Here’s our 2011 sensitivities table to allow you to independently assess our outlook.  Rate cases continue to be our primary sensitivity.  If we are wrong on our ability to earn at the authorized levels by say as much as 50 basis points our earnings could change by as much as $0.08 a share.  We earned our authorized ROEs in the electric and gas businesses last year and we expect to do so again this year.  And we are fortunate to have a public service commission that is maintained competitive authorized ROEs.  As ROEs have dropped in other states our commission has sought to send a signal that Michigan is a good place to invest.
Here is our full year report card; earnings, cash flow and capital structure matrix are all strong and on target.  Thanks for listening in and John and I will be happy to take your questions now.

But we did have some good news. We’re going to take advantage of that and invest in reliability; you may say, what do you mean; can be doing more tree-trimming than we had presently planned to do.
There can be a lot of things like that, that are healthy for our customers and if that is a capacity that we can address, we’ll do it. That allows us to live within our authorized ROEs and at the same time deliver the guidance that we’ve shared with folks.

So, that’s an important element of what we are doing to mitigate some of that. Most of the case, I expect, will be capital investment. Capital investment that we made to clean up the air, to invest in renewable energy, to provide for a safe and reliable system. The commission has historically enabled us to recover the capital investments we are making particularly since the increases for customers will not be that great.
At the end of the day, the strategy here though is to follow the law as the law was intended and as the Commission confirmed last week in the DTE case and we will move forward with that piece. It's been very transparent, very open with Commission, the staff and all parties in this case.

We've not put money in the plant for those. However today they, as I mentioned they have a very high utilization rate, so when they run they are called on for energy and not capacity.

So the good news that occurred in the first quarter was $0.04. So it’s colder than expected and that compares to first quarter a year ago where we were at $0.02. And so you get net good news there of $0.06 when you put it altogether, so that’s the gas side of the business.
And on the electric side, we do have decoupling for weather, but the scenario there is, there’s a little bit of leakage that comes through and it can come through on the good side or can come through on the bad side, because remember you’re not comparing year-to-year when you’re decoupling, you’re comparing to your authorized level and your rate case.
So it can be sometimes a little difficult for you to see how that works and the mechanism itself is such that there can be a little leakage; if it’s very let’s do electric, if it’s very hot in the summer, it’s possible that a little good news can come through.
On the other hand, it’s very mild in the summer, it’s possible a little bit of bad news can come though and that is just simply the model of the decoupling tool that works by customer class comparing to the rate case.
So you get anomalies in two ways, a little bit of leakage, because it's not a perfect model but it's easy to do the math, so it's not subjective. And two, it’s compared to the prior authorized rate case not to a prior year, so you can see some differentials in there.

The primary reason we’re doing Ludington is not the renewable energy piece, that's an ancillary benefit. The primary driver for capacity is - Ludington investment is to increase the efficiency of the plant at a very competitive rate.
Wind power, we are seeing that wind power rates with the capacity factors we have in Michigan, because of the wind regime are about $0.10 a kilowatt-hour. And what Ludington can be used for is that I think you know when the wind turbines run, they generally are must run from the MISO which means that if the wind’s blowing the energy, it's sending to the grid.
For Ludington, the nice thing is that that can help pump up the water from the lake to the pond, which then can be used later at a peak time to be able to let the water run through and generate electricity.
As far as what that would cost, since we don’t have a whole lot of operating wind turbines in that area, I can't give you a specific today on the net impact of the $0.10 minus the impact of what Ludington would provide.

In this case, I mean in gas rate cases we never settled electric at least in recent time, but we had settled some gas rate cases. I think the importance on this is the commission confirmed the self implementation in the DTE case yesterday and in our case we moved forward to reach a settlement with all the parties including the staff.
And in this case, keep in mind, our position on this of self implementation amount was $29.5 million on a $2 billion business. With the increase of those rates if that's what we self implemented the overall impact and total cost to our customers because of fuel cost, the gas cost going down would be about a 6% reduction on a year-over-year basis.
So I think the reasonableness here is it’s a relatively small case, it could be settled by the parties; it’s an indication of some cooperation of all the parties and the fact that what we are asking for or what we settled to seems reasonable.

And I am concerned about that for a couple of reason.
Our plan says as we get it done but as more and more people try to drive towards that finish line I think what you are going to see is probably an artificial increase in cost and shortage potentially of labor and raw materials.

So the minor tweaks are establish but it really provides certainty for us for making investments and for moving forward, which I like.

I’ll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before turning the call over to Tom for a more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then we will close with Q&A.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.26, the same as last year. The benefit from electric and gas rate relief was offset by higher rate base investment cost, storm restoration cost and accelerated investments in system reliability.
The first half adjusted earnings per share was $0.77, up $0.13 or 20% over last year, primarily reflecting a rate relief and favorable first quarter weather. Tom will review the details with you in a few minutes.
We remain on track to achieve our adjusted earnings per share guidance of a $1.44 a share. Let me give you an update on the Michigan Public Service Commission before I talk about our regulatory agenda.
Commissioner Monica Martinez’s term officially ended July 2. However, she has agreed to remain a Commissioner for a while. The governor has been interviewing several candidates, but I can’t comment on the timing of the appointment, it’s his decision.
Moving to the Regulatory Agenda. There are several important orders and filings during the second quarter. In June, we filed a new electric rate case requesting a $195 million increase based on a 10.7% return on equity. I’ll review the details of this filing on the next slide.
The Commission approved the reconciliation of our energy optimization plan cost for 2009 and approved a $6 million incentive for exceeding the plan targets. We also requested approval to collect an $8 million incentive for exceeding the 2010 targets.
More than 200,000 customers have participated in our energy efficiency programs. Also in June, the Commission approved our amended renewable energy plan authorizing us to reduce the surcharge by $54 million annually. This will provide headroom to minimize the customer rates going forward.
On the gas side of the business, the Commission approved a rate case settlement authorizing us to increase our natural gas rates by $31 million effective May 27th based on 10.5 return on equity.
We anticipate filing a new gas rate case in the third quarter of this year. In keeping with our plan, we filed a new electric rate case on June 10th. The request seeks to recover new investments in system reliability and environmental compliance.
We’ve lowered our O&M cost by $31 million to reflect employee benefit plan changes and increased productivity. This was partially offset by a proposed $13 million increase and forestry expense and a projected $14 million increase in uncollectable accounts due to the expected reduction in funding.
We also adjusted our sales forecast to reflect a higher level of sales to retail up and access customers. We plan to sales implement a rate increase in December with a final order in June of next year.
From our customer’s perspective, the renewable energy surcharge reduction and the DoEs settlement refund which Tom will discuss in a few minutes are expected to provide over $75 million to help offset the impact of this case.
Let me give you an update on some recent operational highlights. We received a favorable vote on our special land use permit for our first wind park, the 100 megawatt Lake Winds energy park.
Construction of this $232 million project is planned for the start - this plant is start to this fall. By the end of 2012 about 8% of our power will come from renewable energy resources developed in Michigan.
State Environmental Regulators approved an 18 month extension of our air permit for the construction of the 830 megawatt clean coal power plant in our current wet out generating complex. This extension keeps open an option to meet further future customer demand. The recent cross state air pollution rule will require us to meet a federal mandate to reduce emissions starting in 2012. Our plan includes installing FDR scrubbers and fabric filters at our large coal-fired plant as part of our $1.5 billion environmental CapEx plan.
We’re still analyzing the impact of the rule on our plan as it relates to our older, smaller coal-fired plants. We expect recovery of all environmental investments. On the operational front, our Campbell 2 coal plant set a new record for a continuous run of 325 days in counting, a notable achievement for a plant that is over 40 years old.
Safety is something that we work on every day, it’s our number one priority and I am pleased that consumers energy received the American Gas Association 2010 Safe Driving Award. Our employees drove more than 40 million miles in 2010.
Another significant safety milestone was achieved at Dearborn industrial generation complex. The employees completed five years without any recordable incidents.
We’ve incurred a significant number of storm related outages and cost during the first half of this year. Our crews have done a great job restoring service on nine different occasions to over 800,000 customers. In the first six months there were 219 severe weather warnings almost twice as much as last year.
The frequency and wide spread damage lead to a 60% increase in customer outage minutes compared to the first half of 2010. Despite our efforts to harden the system, there is little we can do to prevent damaging incurred by ice, tornadoes and wind storms.
And as you would expect the storms had an impact on earnings reducing earnings per share by $0.07 in the first half, five more than last year. Everyone has been talking about the extreme temperatures across the nation over the past couple of weeks. Although this is not a second quarter event, I do want to talk about how our electric system performed last week.
On July 21st, we set a new peak load record of 8,885 megawatts, slightly greater than our previous peak of 8,883 megawatts setback in August of 2006. As you can see on the slide, the annual peak drop during the recession.
Our generation and distribution systems performed very well last week. We had a 50% reduction in heat related customer outages, on this year’s peak day compared to 2006. And the customers who did lose power 99.5% were restored within eight hours.
The doubling of our capital investment in our electric distribution reliability systems since 2007 has made a difference. It allowed us to meet the highest level of customer demand in our history with a fewest number of interruptions.
The infrastructure investments are paying off for our customers and our investors.
Now I’d like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results further.

I’m delighted to add my welcome to everyone on the call this morning. I know it’s a very busy morning and some of you are just now dialing in, so thank you for that.Second quarter results were solid with reported GAAP earnings at $0.38",1225,"Thanks, John. I’m delighted to add my welcome to everyone on the call this morning. I know it’s a very busy morning and some of you are just now dialing in, so thank you for that.
Second quarter results were solid with reported GAAP earnings at $0.38 a share up $0.06 from last year, primarily for a one-time non-cash state income tax benefit of $0.12 offset partly by a one-time insurance benefit in 2010.
Excluding the one-time favorable news in both years, adjusted EPS was $0.26 in each year. For the first half, as John mentioned, earnings were up 20% from last year and this is our best first half result in almost a decade. In May, Governor Schneider signed in to a new Michigan Corporate Income Tax in the law to improve the attractiveness of Michigan business.
The overall future implications to us were minimal, the new law did not however continue our provision in the old Michigan business tax, that permitted the tax impacts of timing differences between cumulative book expenses and tax deductions to be recorded on balance sheet.
Specifically for us, this results in a utility liability of $134 million that will be recorded as a regulatory asset for recovery later. Outside the utility, this tax results in a $32 million tax benefit, again we recognized in this quarter.
As you can see on this slide, adjusted earnings were equivalent to last year despite unusually severe storms that John just described to you. Recall that in the first quarter results were substantially better than planned. We used some of this space to increase our efforts to further improve customer reliability, we’re still on course to do this, but with a little bit smaller step up in order to address the severity of the recent storms.
Now as many have, we’ve been seeing a bit of slowing in the economic recovery late in the second quarter, but overall growth for the year is still good. It’s clear now that some of our customers suffered from the supply issues associated with the tsunami in Japan. This in the desire by automakers to accelerate some of their model changeovers resulted in the little slower industrial electric sales growth than we anticipated.
Still, industrial sales were up 3% on top of the 12% growth in the second quarter of last year and that’s a stronger growth in the second quarter of this year than we saw in the first quarter.
Residential sales growth continued at about 1%, commercial sales, however, were down 3%. The Federal Deficit Debate in Washington and gas prices also appeared to be dampening consumer confidence, how that plays in the sales is always hard to predict.
For the year, we anticipate weather adjusted electric sales to be up about 2%, a little softer than the 2.5% that we shared in our last call.
We anticipate returning to prerecession industrial sales this year and for total sales we expect to be back to prerecession level next year. This forecast reflects a recovery at less than half the amount experienced after the big recession in the early 1980. We continue to plan in a conservative manner.
Now let’s recap the storm and weather impacts for the first half. In 2011 storms were unfavorable at our electric business impacting earnings by $0.07 of share, offset partly by favorable weather at our gas business.
Total, storms and weather were unfavorable by $0.02 so far this year. Last year however storms $0.02, mild weather was adverse was $0.04. Altogether, weather and storms hurt 2011 earnings by $0.02, we’ve managed this in our total plan.
Last year weather and storm hurt $0.06 leaving a favorable year-to-year comparison.
In July it’s been hot and it was pretty hot in July of 2010. We are over 400 Gigawatt hours ahead of the forecast so far in July. This certainly will help us continue to reinvest in actions that improve reliability.
So for first half of the year earnings were up $0.13 or 20% and that’s well ahead of our plan. With the exception of storms, our cost plans are as expected. We continue to take advantage of favorable overall results to accelerate work to make meaningful improvements in reliability for our customers.
Now looking ahead, most of our rate increases for the second half were already in place from existing orders, coupled with scheduled investments that keeps us right on plan to deliver earnings at $1.44 a share and that’s up 6% from last year.
In July, we completed settlement of Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligations with the Department of Energy.
First, we paid off loan of $44 million plus interest of $119 million to close out any obligations remaining for spent nuclear fuel prior to 1983. Second, as shown on this slide, the DoE satisfied its financial obligation for 1983 and beyond with a payment of $120 million.
This resulted in proceeds of $35 million in excess of book value. A portion of this 35 million could be provided as a refund to customers. We proposed that 23 million be shared with customers and about 12 million with investors through earnings.
This latter portion represents recovery of cost that we’ve incurred over the years.
In the near future, we’ll file this proposal with our Public Service Commission another step toward meaningful rate mitigation, we expect an order sometime in 2012.
Our 2011 cash flow metrics both for the parent and the utility are on target as well. Financing plans for the year are complete including a new continuous equity program that we initiated in June. We raised $15 million from this program and do not plan to issue more this year. This is one of the tools we said that we might use to supplement our drift in our direct stock purchase plan.
Combined these programs provided about $29 million a year. We still have no plans to issue large blocks of equity during the next five years. At the utility you can see the $44 million prepayment of our pre1983 DoE loan net of the post 1983 DoE payment to Consumers Energy.
Now stepping back you can see here on this slide that we have strong liquidity with a level well over a third of our market value, peers average about 20%. Today we have $2.5 billion of capacity with about half of this in the form of long-term revolvers and about 40% in cash. As of the end of the first half of the year $2.3 billion of this capacity was available.
Here’s list of items that provide you the opportunity to assess possible changes against our earnings in cash flow. We’re comfortable with our outlook and guidance, but like many of you we constantly measure performance in a manner to deal with issues should pay a rise.
Our earnings growth rate has been 8%. Over the last several years we continue to project future earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range along with a healthy dividend payout. Now here is our 2011 report card. Earnings, cash flow and capital structure metrics continue to be strong all on or better than target.
So thanks again on this very busy day for dialing in to our call, we appreciate your interest and support. And John and I would be happy to take your questions at this time.

So what we’ve seen for the last year and half is the industrial recovery is driving substantially the rest of the state for us, the rest of our service territory. We’re watching the first quarter with good growth particularly on top of the 12% increase a year ago, the second quarter with good growth compared to the 12% a year ago increase. And so we see the industrial side leaning the way out where consumer confidence comes back and the residential is already turning around.
So we see that being up about 2% for the year following that industrial up about 5% for the year, but the commercial side is lagging. And candidly that simply confidence people going back to the commercial sector for things that they need whether its haircuts or whatever it maybe and that part is coming around slower than the rest, I suspect we’ll see that turn up a little bit next year, not this year.

So that would be - when the mercury rule goes into effect in 2015 in Michigan that would determine the fate, if you will, of those smaller plants. And as for us what happens to the viability of the customers and so forth, if the rule goes force in 2012, I do believe that you’re going to see a quicker closure of some of the coal plants then probably what people are anticipating, which in turn of those plants are competitive could raise rates for customers.
And I know that’s the case with our seven smaller units which are competitive today, but based on the rules that the EPA has come up with, I don’t think it’s likely that we would put the controls into those plants because of their age and the ultimate cost that’s required.

Thank you for joining us today in our third quarter earnings call. I’ll start the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as we usually do we’ll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.53 per share, up $0.01 from last year. The utility performed well during the quarter despite higher storm restoration cost and accelerated reliability spending. The impact of the hot summer - hot summer weather was largely offset by sales decoupling mechanism. Year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.44 a share.
Now let me give an update on the regulatory calendar, recent operating milestones, and our plans for environmental compliance. Many of you are familiar with the Michigan Energy Law that was passed with broad bipartisan support in 2008. The specific element of the law listed on this slide provide the foundation for us to invest more than $6.5 billion over the next five years. Our investments will improve the safety and reliability of our system, further improve the environment, and provide value to our customers.
We’re able to make these investments and at the same time keep our customer base rate increases to a level at or below the rate of inflation. For those of you who do not follow us closely, I want to mention that we have a new Commissioner and Chairman of the Public Service Commission. John Quackenbush was appointed September 15th replacing Monica Martinez whose term ended in July. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the staff and the commission, seeking fair and timely recovery of investments as we strive to improve service to our customers and help support the economic recovery in Michigan.
After our third round of rate cases, it’s clear that the 2008 energy law is working smoothly and efficiently as designed. Our rate cases have become streamlined and primarily driven by capital investments on our system and in our plans. At the same time customers are benefiting from cost reduction actions that have resulted in lower O&M charges, a nice situation for both our customers and our company. In addition to the O&M reductions, customers will also see a lower renewable energy surcharge and a refund related to the settlement agreement with the DOE as we discussed last quarter. These two offsets will reduce customer charges by $80 million.
Switching to the operational update, we reached a milestone - another milestone related to the implementation of our smart metering system. In September, we signed a contract with SmartSynch to provide the advanced metering system for our electric customers. The SmartSynch system will utilize existing cellular networks for communications avoiding the cost of building a private mesh network. Meter installation is schedule to begin in August of 2012 and continue through 2019.
We received the final land use permit for our 100 megawatt Lake Winds Energy Park. Construction is expected to begin in the next few weeks for an in service date by the end of next year. After this project is completed we expect to have 8% of our energy supplied by renewable energy sources and on our way to the 10% requirement by 2015.
When we acquired the 935 megawatt Zeeland gas fired power plant in 2007, the plant was being dispatched less than 6% of the time, and has increased significantly in the four years since we took over operations. The capacity factor is now up to 19% for the first nine months of the year. The plant plays an important role in meeting MACT emission reduction targets and fits nicely with our balanced energy initiative.
Our Campbell 2 coal plant completed a record 389-day continuous run before it was removed from service for a scheduled outage, a remarkable run for a plant that is over 40 years old and a real compliment to our employees and their operational excellence.
Clean air standard is a primary topic of interest these days. We have a long history of protecting the environment in Michigan. Years ago we started converting our coal plants to burn low sulfur western coal reducing SO2 emissions by more than 70% and saving our customers over $2.5 billion in fuel costs. Over 85% of our coal consumption is currently western coal moving to 100% in 2012. Cash for mandates further emission reductions by January of 2012.
Our balanced portfolio of generating the assets will allow us to shift generation from our coal plants to our over 1,800 megawatts of gas combined cycle generation. Additionally, we are planning to switch all of our coal plants to primarily burning western coal. This will further reduce emissions and the customer costs.
The final MACT rule is expected by yearend. We already have a state mercury standard that requires a 90% reduction by 2015 comparable to the proposed federal rule. As a result, we have a head start on implementing these regulations. The bottom line, we are well positioned to comply with these new laws with the plans we have in place.
Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results for the quarter.

We appreciate your joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $0.53 a share, up $0.01 from last year and a couple of pennies from First Call. For the first nine months of the year, we earned a $1.30, up $0.14 or 12% from last year and this keeps us solidly on plan.
As we mentioned in our last earnings call storms were particularly severe in July. This year our storm restoration cost has been the most severe by far in over a decade. Even so we still had different - we had sufficient room to continue stronger than originally planned spending to further improve customer reliability. As most of you know, we take every opportunity we can to increase spending to improve performance for our customers. We’re able to do this without deviating from our plans to produce targeted earnings and cash flow growth.
We know some of you would prefer that we take opportunities to increase our earnings beyond targets. We are however committed to applying extra resource to help our customers without jeopardizing meeting our financial targets. We haven’t missed our targets for nine years. We also improved results at the parent by $0.03 a share and that’s primarily from reducing financing cost in this low interest rate environment.
For the first nine months results at $1.30 a share are up 12% from last year. These results for both in quarter and the first nine months are 10 year record highs. During the first nine months sales were up $0.14, driven by improving economy and weather. The weather improvement was in the gas business where weather changes are not addressed in the decoupling mechanism. The cost of extraordinary storms coupled with good efficiencies where within approved rates.
Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter we expect to earn $0.14 a share primarily from approved rates, partially offset by additional spending to improve customer reliability. This is below last year because of the higher reliability spending and the impact of weather on our gas business.
So let’s talk a little bit more about sales and customer rates. Our industrial sales are back to pre-recession level and at the present pace of recovery overall sales should be back in 2012. Last year’s sales were up about 2%, we anticipate growth of about 1.5% this year, I know that’s a little softer than we previously thought. It includes a strong industrial recovery of 3.5% on top of growth last year of about 10%. It also includes residential growth of 1.8% and flat commercial sales that we expect will catch up later.
Looking ahead to next year our experts see growth at well over 2%, but you know us, we like to be a little bit conservative so we are predicting closer to 2%. Candidly, many of our industrial customers are concerned about the political turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. Their production levels are strong, but they still worry about financial complications and could emerge from the political wills and battles that are going on, uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policy here in and in European Union.
Our sense is that many residential customers want to upgrade their automobiles, their homes and their lives, but uncertainties continue to dampen consumer confidence. You can see in October we were at the low levels of the recession. For example, used car prices are high and supplies are low and that’s a strong sign that new car sales should continue to grow. Accordingly, the U.S. automotive production is scheduled to be up about 30% in the fourth quarter. Customers want and need in many instances to replace their old cars and trucks. The seeds of recovery exist; it’s sort of our national recovery to lose. So in our service territory we’re seeing a good recovery but we too are planning conservatively in case political disagreements dampen future conference.
Looking to our in-process rate cases, there are two major themes we continue to follow. First, the bulk of our requests involve investments, investment for projects that are needed rather than those that we would just like to do. Second, to help keep rates down, we target to keep our O&M flat to down, we’ve requested reductions in both our gas and electric filings.
As John mentioned just a minute ago, we also identify ways to reduce the impact of increases in prices to our customers. For example, the offsets reduce the impact of our requested electric rate case by $80 million holding the customer increase to 1.6%. And on the gas side, lower fuel cost will more than offset the gas rate request of 2.2%.
Now with this next chart, you can see our passion around maintaining responsible customer base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. We could be investing almost $10 billion over the next five years, but we self imposed a limit to about $6.5 billion for the 2012 to 2016 period. More investment would increase earnings and cash flow that at a higher level of rate increases that we do not believe would be sustainable. This unwritten pact with our customers is important to us and we believe core to our successful plan to grow earnings and cash flow in a sustainable manner.
Now talking about cash flow, here is our standard summary of cash flow for consumers and the CMS parent. The small level of tax sharing reflects the large level of bonus depreciation at consumers. In total, we continue on plan with key financings complete. With equity markets and discount rates down, I suspect you are hearing from others about the cost of pension and healthcare obligations. Recall, we prefunded 2011 pension contributions in 2010 as bonus depreciation benefits provided some headroom. We fully complied with the funding requirements in the Pension Protection Act, as determined by the act, we are 80% funded. We may do some more prefunding, but that decision is yet ahead for us.
As you know, we seek to prefund our parent debt one or two years in advance. We do that in our belt and suspenders approach to minimize exposures to our non-utility debt maturities. In addition, we carry a thick level of liquidity at 40% of market cap. That’s larger than most of our peers, which is closer to 20%. This provides a further buffer to debt maturities and provides for strong risk mitigation in these interesting financial markets. Some may think of this as a belt suspenders and a sky hook level of conservatism, but it’s an approach that has served us well.
Here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity chart. You can use it for this year and also for 2012. It reflects risks mitigation measures already in place. Now please note the ROE sensitivity. The Commission recently reset to trade additions authorized ROE at 10.5%. We’ve shown here a 20 basis point drop in our authorized level, both at electric and gas, to help you assess alternatives. We’re comfortable with our ability to manage the level of change shown here. We’ve designed our plans to accommodate this, if required.
Tools include managing our level of utility - equity, capital spending, incentives not included in the authorized ROE calculation like our energy incentive performance, and modest earnings growth outside of the utility.
I hope you find that our earnings and dividend track record speaks for itself. We continue to be comfortable with our 2011 earnings guidance at a $1.44 a share, and we have an opportunity to grow our dividend further. We are on track to deliver on all of our financial targets as shown here. We feel good about our prospects for next year. John and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming EEI conference where we’ll present on Tuesday, November 8th at 8:15 AM. And on February 29th, we’re planning an investor meeting at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate our 125th anniversary as well as our 65th year of being listed on the Exchange. We look forward to seeing many of you at these events.
We’d be pleased to answer questions that you have now. So, Jeff, would you please open the line for questions.

You see our authorized levels of return at electric at 10.7 and gas at 10.5. And what we did is we provide you with a little sensitivity for 20 basis points, which is maybe consistent with what you’re seeing in other rate orders. Things that we could do, we have a chance to manage the level of equity that we have in the utility, there is always a little room to pull little bit more in there, we also have a chance to do it little bit better on our ROE performance. The incentives that we get there are actually calculated outside on top of the authorized ROE, and we plan conservatively on that.
We don’t put all of those sort of savings into our initial plans. We work our way there. There is also the chance, of course, that we can adjust our capital spending a little bit - just tune that down a little bit, deferred a little bit, do the sort of controls we have been talking to you about for some time, and that can have an impact. And then lastly, we don’t have lot of business outside of the utility, we’re the core in the ability; but we do have a little bit in our enterprise organization as an example. And we can always tune that up a little bit. We’re looking through ways - these have been soft markets, as you would imagine for ITPs. So as we begin to see that turn, that may contribute a little bit to our earnings as well. So, we see adequate flexibility and actions that we can take to do our job, earn the authorized ROE, even if it might be a little bit lower than where it is today.

As long as we have our large capital investment program going we are very happy to bring that forward each year to make sure we recover in a timely basis, the investments that we’re making and recall we are working very hard to try to go into every rate case with O&M flat to down a little bit, so we’re actually giving something back if we can bring it down to our customers and that’s our intend.
The other nice thing we’ll get to recognize the portion maybe of decoupling if that changes around the economy. So that with our annual rate cases, we’re still held neutral, we get to pickup our sales and even though we’re all a little nervous about where things are going, you can see the track record on sales it’s certainly an upside, if that’s something that’s not decoupled as we go into the future. So for us it’s an annual case. There could be conditions changing in the future, nothing that we know of formally or officially, but if we are ever to track investment for example I would admit there would be little reason for us to go in for annual rate cases, but at this point in the game that’s our plan.

What we tried to show are some of the things that are not in our $6.6 billion that are in this, I will call it, theoretical $10 billion because it’s not our plan. We have all the pipeline replacements and all the upgrades that we need to do to meet the laws. But we’d like to accelerate that sum and folks would like to help us do that. We like to do more pole replacements, just to stay ahead of the game, to help our customers.
We may need new gas generation as we go through time and we certainly would like to do our smart grid faster but these are all things that are - they are things that we want and they are not things that our customers absolutely need right now. So something like a change in the WASP or environmental, those would be things that we would need to do. All those cost that we just described for the five year period are included in our plan. So they are in the $6.6 billion already. I’d mentioned when we’ve been out on the road with folks, the timing is a little bit different because with the new rulings that came out we had to adjust forward about $100 million of timing in this period, but in the period in total we were fine.
So I would tell you that our goal is when something is foisted upon us if we can we’ll look for a way to rebalance the portfolio to keep the sorts of investments we need to do over the next five years at a level that keep the level of our customer rate increases down to a sustainable level. Now $6.6 billion is not an absolute number, that’s the other thing I think everyone should know. If that number were $6.8 billion or $6.4 billion or anything like that, it’s just not that big a deal, but being in that general range we think is important for sustainability.

First of all, on the funding side, we treated like our debt - we try on the parent debt side to stay ahead about a year or two in terms of the requirements. Although the pension is much in the utility - more in utility than it is outside, we also look at that as an obligation that we have, so we look to stay ahead of the game on that. And you remember last year we funded early, and when you do that it improves your position in terms of being funded, but it also gives you a little bit of an earnings upside, to be candid. We’ll be looking at that opportunity more towards the end of this year when we see how returns and discount rates are playing out.
Let me we shift gears to a second related but different piece, and that is; I’m sure you’re hearing from folks that with discount rates falling and interest rates falling as low as they are, that puts pressure on the size of the pension and OPEB liabilities, so therefore it’s a hurt. And it’s a hurt to us. There will be several pennies of penalty when that number is known at the end of the year and we don’t know it because it’s not determined until you have actual. But that cost us some earnings power. We built all that into our plans looking ahead and we feel very comfortable with what John said about the 5% to 7% growth as we go forward in time, even with those precious.
But, yes, those pressures are there. I know the other side of the point that I would just mention is recall that when discount rates fall, because interest rates fall, that cost companies a little bit more because of the then higher present value of their liabilities. So it hurts their earnings. But when those turnaround come back up, it’s going to help their earnings. So our view has always been, manage it. If you got bad news, figure out how to address it and continue to meet your guidance for growth and if you got good news invest that, help your customers out if you can, if you have some surplus to do that, is that helpful.

My recollection in the past was that DTE had typically been allowed a higher ROE, and they used to say partially because they served Detroit was one of the specific regions and has kind of the higher risk factor. And I don’t believe that that was included in this last order so it is kind of historic differential between your allowed ROEs and DTEs, was that in your mind a main reason it was different and thus how do you think about whether there should be a differential there going forward?

The issue with this order and we’re going to let DTE talk about the order, that’s not our business that’s theirs. But we look at the orders to see if there is some consistent application between the two companies and the one thing that came out in this commission which is - keep in mind a new Chairman in this commission looked at it and the language is pretty clear. They talked about the 10.5 being justified as a change based on the improvement of the capital markets, the economy and the Michigan Energy Law. So it looks like what they’re doing is building this from the bottom up to achieve the 10.5 rather than the top down. And I think that’s important for us because I don’t - at least I don’t sense much change in that justification and rationale from last week through our order in June. I just don’t see dramatic changes in those factors between now and then.

That’s sort of the last segment to follow. And those folks actually see the industrial side continuing to pick up and in their numbers closer to 7%, maybe 8%, because they see certain segments that usually trial in that recovery. Now we’re cautionary about the whole thing.
And I know some people think we’re just too - on conservative. But things are pretty uncertain right now in consumer confidence, and what I tried to explain, with industrial confidence. So even though companies - and many companies are doing pretty well, and some are even expanding, they are all a little bit nervous. So we rather be a little cautious and share with you our judgment that we should be looking for something closer to 2% overall next year and if we are wrong and it’s better, wonderful.

So the way I’d characterize this, this is helpful is that we have not projected even in our conservative numbers a big double dip for the nation or for the state, but we’re worried and that’s why we are being cautionary because consumer confidence has come down in the last couple of months, and when we talk to our industrial customers, John and I and coal management team partners up and talks to two or three of those customers on a regular basis.
They may be doing well, their production may be full out right now, with schedules that are full out for the rest of this year, but they still worry what’s going to come out of Europe, what’s going to happen in our election process. And so it makes them nervous and in a nervous environment that’s hard to make solid predictions. What I can tell you is that the decoupling mechanism certainly give us some insulation in the State of Michigan which is a helpful thing and on top of that we just plan conservatively so that when bad things happen we are able to deal with them, if they do.

So that’s why the 2008 law was put into place.
So that’s where we have today. I think it’s being pushed opening the cap by some customers and also because we are at the 10% cap, but also from the standpoint of some outstate suppliers that would like to get into Michigan and do some work. And my focus would be and you’ll hear it next week at the Senate hearings, we are the second largest investor in the State of Michigan and we are the seventh largest employer. We want Michigan to be successful. We are here for the long run. Our rates over a long period of time are consistently competitive with the recession that we’ve had over the past couple of years, despite Tom seeing the recovery, we’re still coming out of the recession and with the natural gas prices some of the coal fleet is not as competitive in our contracts as it used to be. But that will begin to change in the future as we see the sales come back and as we see natural gas prices increase, but not a lot and as we see the impact of the environmental rules on the fleet throughout the Midwest.

We are not giving away light bulbs, but we are offering discount on light bulbs, which is a very small impact for the whole thing. I believe personally the company believes and I think the state did with the passage of the law, the cheapest form of energy is energy efficiency. We think we can be at about the $0.02 a kilowatt hour range for energy efficiency for incentives that we provide, that’s about the impact of energy efficiency cost.
We’ve been in the program for two years now. Our customers have saved $67 million. So the payback for what we spend to incent compared to what they save is about a two year payback. In some areas it’s very effective less than a year, and in others particularly low income it takes a much longer time to make up that difference. So we are supportive of it, I think it’s good. On the benefit to the shareholders we also were incented with the current law to be able to if we hit targets, exceed targets by over 100% we are able to get a premium return for the money that we spend. So - and we’ve achieved those past two years and expect to achieve all or most of those going forward.

Thank you for joining us today in our third quarter earnings call. I’ll start the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as we usually do, we’ll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.53 per share, up $0.01 from last year. The utility performed well during the quarter despite higher storm restoration cost and accelerated reliability spending. The impact of the hot summer -- hot summer weather, was largely offset by sales decoupling mechanism. Year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.44 a share.
Now let me give an update on the regulatory calendar, recent operating milestones, and our plans for environmental compliance. Many of you are familiar with the Michigan Energy Law that was passed with broad bipartisan support in 2008. The specific elements of the law listed on this slide provide the foundation for us to invest more than $6.5 billion over the next 5 years. Our investments will improve the safety and reliability of our system, further improve the environment, and provide value to our customers.
We’re able to make these investments and at the same time keep our customer base rate increases to a level at or below the rate of inflation. For those of you who do not follow us closely, I want to mention that we have a new Commissioner and Chairman of the Public Service Commission. John Quackenbush was appointed September 15 replacing Monica Martinez whose term ended in July. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the staff and the commission, seeking fair and timely recovery of investments as we strive to improve service to our customers and help support the economic recovery in Michigan.
After our third round of rate cases, it’s clear that the 2008 energy law is working smoothly and efficiently as designed. Our rate cases have become streamlined and primarily driven by capital investments on our system and in our plans. At the same time, customers are benefiting from cost reduction actions that have resulted in lower O&M charges, a nice situation for both our customers and our company. In addition to the O&M reductions, customers will also see a lower renewable energy surcharge and a refund related to the settlement agreement with the DOE, as we discussed last quarter. These 2 offsets will reduce customer charges by $80 million.
Switching to the operational update. We reached a milestone -- another milestone, related to the implementation of our smart metering system. In September, we signed a contract with SmartSynch to provide the advanced metering system for our electric customers. The SmartSynch system will utilize existing cellular networks for communications avoiding the cost of building a private mesh network. Meter installation is schedule to begin in August of 2012 and continue through 2019.
We received the final land use permit for our 100 megawatt Lake Winds Energy Park. Construction is expected to begin in the next few weeks for an in service date by the end of next year. After this project is completed, we expect to have 8% of our energy supplied by renewable energy sources, and on our way to the 10% requirement by 2015.
When we acquired the 935 megawatt Zeeland gas-fired power plant in 2007, the plant was being dispatched less than 6% of the time, and has increased significantly in the 4 years since we took over operations. The capacity factor is now up to 19% for the first 9 months of the year. The plant plays an important role in meeting MACT emission reduction targets and fits nicely with our balanced energy initiative.
Our Campbell 2 coal plant completed a record 389-day continuous run before it was removed from service for a scheduled outage, a remarkable run for a plant that is over 40 years old and a real compliment to our employees and their operational excellence.
Clean air standards is a primary topic of interest these days. We have a long history of protecting the environment in Michigan. Years ago, we started converting our coal plants to burn low sulfur western coal reducing SO2 emissions by more than 70% and saving our customers over $2.5 billion in fuel costs. Over 85% of our coal consumption is currently western coal, moving to 100% in 2012. CSAPR mandates further emission reductions by January of 2012.
Our balanced portfolio of generating assets will allow us to shift generation from our coal plants to our over 1,800 megawatts of gas combined cycle generation. Additionally, we are planning to switch all of our coal plants to primarily burning western coal. This will further reduce emissions and customer costs.
The final MACT rule is expected by year end. We already have a state mercury standard that requires a 90% reduction by 2015 comparable to the proposed federal rule. As a result, we have a head start on implementing these regulations. The bottom line, we are well positioned to comply with these new laws with the plans we have in place.
Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results for the quarter."

And let me add my welcome to everyone on the call, especially during the busy earnings release week. We appreciate your joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $0.53 a share, up $0.01 from last year and a couple of pennies from first call. For the first 9 months of the year, we earned a $1.30, up $0.14 or 12% from last year, and this keeps us solidly on plan.
As we mentioned in our last earnings call, storms were particularly severe in July. This year our storm restoration cost has been the most severe, by far, in over a decade. Even so, we still had different -- we had sufficient room to continue stronger than originally planned spending to further improve customer reliability. As most of you know, we take every opportunity we can to increase spending to improve performance for our customers. We’re able to do this without deviating from our plans to produce targeted earnings and cash flow growth.
We know some of you would prefer that we take opportunities to increase our earnings beyond targets. We are, however, committed to applying extra resource to help our customers without jeopardizing meeting our financial targets. We haven’t missed our targets for 9 years. We also improved results at the parent by $0.03 a share, and that’s primarily from reducing financing cost in this low interest rate environment.
For the first 9 months, results at $1.30 a share are up 12% from last year. These results for both in quarter and the first 9 months are 10-year record highs. During the first 9 months, sales were up $0.14 driven by improving economy and weather. The weather improvement was in the gas business where weather changes are not addressed in the decoupling mechanism. The cost of extraordinary storms coupled with good efficiencies were within approved rates.
Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to earn $0.14 a share primarily from approved rates, partially offset by additional spending to improve customer reliability. This is below last year because of the higher reliability spending and the impact of weather on our gas business.
So let’s talk a little bit more about sales and customer rates. Our industrial sales are back to pre-recession levels, and at the present pace of recovery overall sales should be back in 2012. Last year’s sales were up about 2%. We anticipate growth of about 1.5% this year, and that’s a little softer than we previously thought. It includes a strong industrial recovery of 3.5% on top of growth last year of about 10%. It also includes residential growth of 1.8% and flat commercial sales that we expect will catch up later.
Looking ahead to next year, our experts see growth at well over 2%. But you know us, we like to be a little bit conservative, so we are predicting closer to 2%. Candidly, many of our industrial customers are concerned about the political turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. Their production levels are strong, but they still worry about financial complications and could emerge from the political wills and the battles that are going on, uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policy here and in the European Union.
Our sense is that many residential customers want to upgrade their automobiles, their homes and their lives, but uncertainties continue to dampen consumer confidence. You can see in October, we were at the low levels of the recession. For example, used car prices are high and supplies are low, and that’s a strong sign that new car sales should continue to grow. Accordingly, the U.S. automotive production is scheduled to be up about 30% in the fourth quarter. Customers want, and need in many instances, to replace their old cars and trucks. The seeds of recovery exist; it’s sort of our national recovery to lose. So in our service territory we’re seeing a good recovery, but we too are planning conservatively in case political disagreements dampen future confidence.
Looking to our in-process rate cases, there are 2 major themes we continue to follow. First, the bulk of our requests involve investment, investment for projects that are needed rather than those that we would just like to do. Second, to help keep rates down, we target to keep our O&M flat to down. We’ve requested reductions in both our gas and electric filings.
As John mentioned just a minute ago, we also identify ways to reduce the impact of increases in prices to our customers. For example, the offsets reduce the impact of our requested electric rate case by $80 million holding the customer increase to 1.6%. And on the gas side, lower fuel cost will more than offset the gas rate request of 2.2%.
Now with this next chart, you can see our passion around maintaining responsible customer base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. We could be investing almost $10 billion over the next 5 years, but we self-imposed a limit to about $6.5 billion for the 2012 to 2016 period. More investment would increase earnings and cash flow at a higher level of rate increases that we do not believe would be sustainable. This unwritten pact with our customers is important to us, and we believe core to our successful plan to grow earnings and cash flow in a sustainable manner.
Now talking about cash flow, here is our standard summary of cash flow for consumers and the CMS parent. The small level of tax sharing reflects the large level of bonus depreciation at consumers. In total, we continue on plan with key financings complete. With equity markets and discount rates down, I suspect you are hearing from others about the cost of pension and healthcare obligations. Recall, we prefunded 2011 pension contributions in 2010 as bonus depreciation benefits provided some headroom. We fully complied with the funding requirements in the Pension Protection Act. As determined by the Act, we are 80% funded. We may do some more prefunding, but that decision is yet ahead for us.
As you know, we seek to prefund our parent debt one or 2 years in advance. We do that in our belt and suspenders approach to minimize exposures to our non-utility debt maturities. In addition, we carry a thick level of liquidity at 40% of market cap. That’s larger than most of our peers, which is closer to 20%. This provides a further buffer to debt maturities and provides for strong risk mitigation in these interesting financial markets. Some may think of this as a belt, suspenders and a sky hook level of conservatism, but it’s an approach that has served us well.
Here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity chart. You can use it for this year and also for 2012. It reflects risk mitigation measures already in place. Now please note the ROE sensitivity. The Commission recently reset Detroit Edison's authorized ROE at 10.5%. We’ve shown here a 20 basis point drop in our authorized level, both in electric and gas, to help you assess alternatives. We’re comfortable with our ability to manage the level of change shown here. We’ve designed our plans to accommodate this, if required.
Tools include managing our level of utility equity, capital spending, incentives not included in the authorized ROE calculation like our energy incentive performance, and modest earnings growth outside of the utility.
I hope you find that our earnings and dividend track record speaks for itself. We continue to be comfortable with our 2011 earnings guidance at a $1.44 a share, and we have an opportunity to grow our dividend further. We are on track to deliver on all of our financial targets as shown here. We feel good about our prospects for next year. 
John and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming EEI conference where we’ll present on Tuesday, November 8 at 8:15 a.m. And on February 29, we’re planning an investor meeting at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate our 125th anniversary as well as our 65th year of being listed on the Exchange. We look forward to seeing many of you at these events.
We’d be pleased to answer questions that you have now. So, Jeff, would you please open the line for questions."

And what we did is we provide you with a little sensitivity for 20 basis points, which is maybe consistent with what you’re seeing in other rate orders. Things that we could do, we have a chance to manage the level of equity that we have in the utility, there is always a little room to put a little bit more in there. We also have a chance to do a little bit better on our EO performance. The incentives that we get there are actually calculated outside on top of the authorized ROE, and we plan conservatively on that. We don’t put all of those sort of savings into our initial plans. We work our way there. There is also the chance, of course, that we can adjust our capital spending a little bit, just tune that down a little bit, defer it a little bit, do the sort of controls we have been talking to you about for some time, and that can have an impact. And then lastly, we don’t have lot of business outside of the utility, we’re core in the ability; but we do have a little bit in our enterprise organization as an example. And we can always tune that up a little bit. We’re looking for ways -- these have been soft markets, as you would imagine, for IPPs. So as we begin to see that turn, that may contribute a little bit to our earnings as well. So we see adequate flexibility and actions that we can take to do our job, earn the authorized ROE, even if it might be a little bit lower than where it is today."

As long as we have our large capital investment program going, we are very happy to bring that forward each year to make sure we recover in a timely basis the investments that we’re making. And recall, we are working very hard to try to go into every rate case with O&M flat to down a little bit, so we’re actually giving something back if we can bring it down to our customers, and that’s our intend. The other nice thing is, we’ll get to recognize the portion maybe of decoupling if that changes around the economy. So that with our annual rate cases, we’re still held neutral, we get to pickup our sales. And even though we’re all a little nervous about where things are going, you can see the track record on sales, it’s certainly an upside, if that’s something that’s not decoupled as we go into the future. So for us it’s an annual case. There could be conditions changing in the future, nothing that we know of formally or officially, but if we are ever to track investment, for example, I would admit there would be little reason for us to go in for annual rate cases. But at this point in the game, that’s our plan."

What we tried to show are some of the things that are not in our $6.6 billion that are in this, I will call it, theoretical $10 billion because it’s not our plan. We have all the pipeline replacements and all the upgrades that we need to do to meet the laws. But we’d like to accelerate that sum, and folks would like to help us do that. We'd like to do more pole replacements, just to stay ahead of the game, to help our customers. We may need new gas generation as we go through time. And we certainly would like to do our smart grid faster, but these are all things that are -- they are things that we want and they are not things that our customers absolutely need right now. So something like a change in the laws for environmental, those would be things that we would need to do. All those costs that we just described for the 5-year period are included in our plan. So they are in the $6.6 billion already. I’ve mentioned when we’ve been out on the road with folks, that the timing is a little bit different because with the new rulings that came out we had to adjust forward about $100 million of timing in this period, but in the period in total we were fine. So I would tell you that our goal is, when something is foisted upon us, if we can, we’ll look for a way to rebalance the portfolio to keep the sorts of investments we need to do over the next 5 years at a level that keep the level of our customer rate increases down to a sustainable level. Now $6.6 billion is not an absolute number, that’s the other thing I think everyone should know.

We try on the parent debt side to stay ahead about a year or 2 in terms of the requirements. Although the pension is much in the utility, more in utility than it is outside, we also look at that as an obligation that we have. So we look to stay ahead of the game on that. And you remember last year we funded early. And when you do that it improves your position in terms of being funded, but it also gives you a little bit of an earnings upside, to be candid. We’ll be looking at that opportunity more toward the end of this year when we see how returns and discount rates are playing out. Let me we shift gears to a second related but different piece. And that is, I’m sure you’re hearing from folks, that with discount rates falling and interest rates falling as low as they are, that puts pressure on the size of the pension and OPEB liabilities. So therefore it’s a hurt. And it’s a hurt to us. There will be several pennies of penalty when that number is known at the end of the year, and we don’t know it because it’s not determined until you have actuals, but that costs us some earnings power. We've built all that into our plans looking ahead, and we feel very comfortable with what John said about the 5% to 7% growth as we go forward in time, even with those pressures. But yes, those pressures are there. Now the other side of that coin that I would just mention is, recall, that when discount rates fall, because interest rates fall, that cost companies a little bit more because of the then higher present value of their liabilities. So it hurts their earnings. But when those turn around, come back up, it’s going to help their earnings. So our view has always been, manage it. If you've got bad news, figure out how to address it and continue to meet your guidance for growth; and if you got good news, invest that, help your customers out if you can, if you have some surplus to do that. Does that help?"

And the one thing that came out in this commission which is, keep in mind, a new Chairman in this commission, looked at it and the language is pretty clear. They talked about the 10.5 being justified of the change based on the improvement of the capital markets, the economy and the Michigan Energy Law. So it looks like what they’re doing is building this from the bottom up to achieve the 10.5 rather than the top down. And I think that’s important for us because I don’t -- at least I don’t sense much change in that justification and rationale from last week through our order in June.

They may be doing well, their production may be full out right now, with schedules that are full out for the rest of this year, but they still worry what’s going to come out of Europe, what’s going to happen in our election process. And so it makes them nervous. And in a nervous environment, that’s hard to make solid predictions.

And we’ve got some unique positions that we’re going to talk about because, keep in mind, this is the second energy law that occurred in Michigan. The first one is back in 2000 when a lot of expectations were set and very little came out of it. So that’s why the 2008 law was put into place. So that’s where we are today. I think it’s being pushed, opening the cap by some customers, and also because we are at the 10% cap but also from the standpoint of some outstate suppliers that would like to get into Michigan and do some work. And my focus will be and you’ll hear it next week at the Senate hearings, we are the second largest investor in the State of Michigan and we are the seventh largest employer. We want Michigan to be successful. We are here for the long run. Our rates over a long period of time are consistently competitive with the recession that we’ve had over the past couple of years, despite Tom seeing the recovery, we’re still coming out of the recession. And with the natural gas prices, some of the coal fleet is not as competitive in our contracts as it used to be. But that will begin to change in the future as we see the sales come back and as we see natural gas prices increase, but not a lot, and as we see the impact of the environmental rules on the fleet throughout the Midwest."

We think we can be at about the $0.02 a kilowatt hour range for energy efficiency for incentives that we provide. That’s about the impact of energy efficiency cost. We’ve been in the program for 2 years now. Our customers have saved $67 million. So the payback for what we spend to incent compared to what they save is about a 2-year payback.

Thank you for joining us today in our third quarter earnings call. I’ll start the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as we usually do, we’ll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings were $0.53 per share, up $0.01 from last year. The utility performed well during the quarter despite higher storm restoration cost and accelerated reliability spending. The impact of the hot summer -- hot summer weather, was largely offset by sales decoupling mechanism. Year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.44 a share.
Now let me give an update on the regulatory calendar, recent operating milestones, and our plans for environmental compliance. Many of you are familiar with the Michigan Energy Law that was passed with broad bipartisan support in 2008. The specific elements of the law listed on this slide provide the foundation for us to invest more than $6.5 billion over the next 5 years. Our investments will improve the safety and reliability of our system, further improve the environment, and provide value to our customers.
We’re able to make these investments and at the same time keep our customer base rate increases to a level at or below the rate of inflation. For those of you who do not follow us closely, I want to mention that we have a new Commissioner and Chairman of the Public Service Commission. John Quackenbush was appointed September 15 replacing Monica Martinez whose term ended in July. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the staff and the commission, seeking fair and timely recovery of investments as we strive to improve service to our customers and help support the economic recovery in Michigan.
After our third round of rate cases, it’s clear that the 2008 energy law is working smoothly and efficiently as designed. Our rate cases have become streamlined and primarily driven by capital investments on our system and in our plans. At the same time, customers are benefiting from cost reduction actions that have resulted in lower O&M charges, a nice situation for both our customers and our company. In addition to the O&M reductions, customers will also see a lower renewable energy surcharge and a refund related to the settlement agreement with the DOE, as we discussed last quarter. These 2 offsets will reduce customer charges by $80 million.
Switching to the operational update. We reached a milestone -- another milestone, related to the implementation of our smart metering system. In September, we signed a contract with SmartSynch to provide the advanced metering system for our electric customers. The SmartSynch system will utilize existing cellular networks for communications avoiding the cost of building a private mesh network. Meter installation is schedule to begin in August of 2012 and continue through 2019.
We received the final land use permit for our 100 megawatt Lake Winds Energy Park. Construction is expected to begin in the next few weeks for an in service date by the end of next year. After this project is completed, we expect to have 8% of our energy supplied by renewable energy sources, and on our way to the 10% requirement by 2015.
When we acquired the 935 megawatt Zeeland gas-fired power plant in 2007, the plant was being dispatched less than 6% of the time, and has increased significantly in the 4 years since we took over operations. The capacity factor is now up to 19% for the first 9 months of the year. The plant plays an important role in meeting MACT emission reduction targets and fits nicely with our balanced energy initiative.
Our Campbell 2 coal plant completed a record 389-day continuous run before it was removed from service for a scheduled outage, a remarkable run for a plant that is over 40 years old and a real compliment to our employees and their operational excellence.
Clean air standards is a primary topic of interest these days. We have a long history of protecting the environment in Michigan. Years ago, we started converting our coal plants to burn low sulfur western coal reducing SO2 emissions by more than 70% and saving our customers over $2.5 billion in fuel costs. Over 85% of our coal consumption is currently western coal, moving to 100% in 2012. CSAPR mandates further emission reductions by January of 2012.
Our balanced portfolio of generating assets will allow us to shift generation from our coal plants to our over 1,800 megawatts of gas combined cycle generation. Additionally, we are planning to switch all of our coal plants to primarily burning western coal. This will further reduce emissions and customer costs.
The final MACT rule is expected by year end. We already have a state mercury standard that requires a 90% reduction by 2015 comparable to the proposed federal rule. As a result, we have a head start on implementing these regulations. The bottom line, we are well positioned to comply with these new laws with the plans we have in place.
Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results for the quarter."

And let me add my welcome to everyone on the call, especially during the busy earnings release week. We appreciate your joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $0.53 a share, up $0.01 from last year and a couple of pennies from first call. For the first 9 months of the year, we earned a $1.30, up $0.14 or 12% from last year, and this keeps us solidly on plan.
As we mentioned in our last earnings call, storms were particularly severe in July. This year our storm restoration cost has been the most severe, by far, in over a decade. Even so, we still had different -- we had sufficient room to continue stronger than originally planned spending to further improve customer reliability. As most of you know, we take every opportunity we can to increase spending to improve performance for our customers. We’re able to do this without deviating from our plans to produce targeted earnings and cash flow growth.
We know some of you would prefer that we take opportunities to increase our earnings beyond targets. We are, however, committed to applying extra resource to help our customers without jeopardizing meeting our financial targets. We haven’t missed our targets for 9 years. We also improved results at the parent by $0.03 a share, and that’s primarily from reducing financing cost in this low interest rate environment.
For the first 9 months, results at $1.30 a share are up 12% from last year. These results for both in quarter and the first 9 months are 10-year record highs. During the first 9 months, sales were up $0.14 driven by improving economy and weather. The weather improvement was in the gas business where weather changes are not addressed in the decoupling mechanism. The cost of extraordinary storms coupled with good efficiencies were within approved rates.
Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to earn $0.14 a share primarily from approved rates, partially offset by additional spending to improve customer reliability. This is below last year because of the higher reliability spending and the impact of weather on our gas business.
So let’s talk a little bit more about sales and customer rates. Our industrial sales are back to pre-recession levels, and at the present pace of recovery overall sales should be back in 2012. Last year’s sales were up about 2%. We anticipate growth of about 1.5% this year, and that’s a little softer than we previously thought. It includes a strong industrial recovery of 3.5% on top of growth last year of about 10%. It also includes residential growth of 1.8% and flat commercial sales that we expect will catch up later.
Looking ahead to next year, our experts see growth at well over 2%. But you know us, we like to be a little bit conservative, so we are predicting closer to 2%. Candidly, many of our industrial customers are concerned about the political turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. Their production levels are strong, but they still worry about financial complications and could emerge from the political wills and the battles that are going on, uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policy here and in the European Union.
Our sense is that many residential customers want to upgrade their automobiles, their homes and their lives, but uncertainties continue to dampen consumer confidence. You can see in October, we were at the low levels of the recession. For example, used car prices are high and supplies are low, and that’s a strong sign that new car sales should continue to grow. Accordingly, the U.S. automotive production is scheduled to be up about 30% in the fourth quarter. Customers want, and need in many instances, to replace their old cars and trucks. The seeds of recovery exist; it’s sort of our national recovery to lose. So in our service territory we’re seeing a good recovery, but we too are planning conservatively in case political disagreements dampen future confidence.
Looking to our in-process rate cases, there are 2 major themes we continue to follow. First, the bulk of our requests involve investment, investment for projects that are needed rather than those that we would just like to do. Second, to help keep rates down, we target to keep our O&M flat to down. We’ve requested reductions in both our gas and electric filings.
As John mentioned just a minute ago, we also identify ways to reduce the impact of increases in prices to our customers. For example, the offsets reduce the impact of our requested electric rate case by $80 million holding the customer increase to 1.6%. And on the gas side, lower fuel cost will more than offset the gas rate request of 2.2%.
Now with this next chart, you can see our passion around maintaining responsible customer base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. We could be investing almost $10 billion over the next 5 years, but we self-imposed a limit to about $6.5 billion for the 2012 to 2016 period. More investment would increase earnings and cash flow at a higher level of rate increases that we do not believe would be sustainable. This unwritten pact with our customers is important to us, and we believe core to our successful plan to grow earnings and cash flow in a sustainable manner.
Now talking about cash flow, here is our standard summary of cash flow for consumers and the CMS parent. The small level of tax sharing reflects the large level of bonus depreciation at consumers. In total, we continue on plan with key financings complete. With equity markets and discount rates down, I suspect you are hearing from others about the cost of pension and healthcare obligations. Recall, we prefunded 2011 pension contributions in 2010 as bonus depreciation benefits provided some headroom. We fully complied with the funding requirements in the Pension Protection Act. As determined by the Act, we are 80% funded. We may do some more prefunding, but that decision is yet ahead for us.
As you know, we seek to prefund our parent debt one or 2 years in advance. We do that in our belt and suspenders approach to minimize exposures to our non-utility debt maturities. In addition, we carry a thick level of liquidity at 40% of market cap. That’s larger than most of our peers, which is closer to 20%. This provides a further buffer to debt maturities and provides for strong risk mitigation in these interesting financial markets. Some may think of this as a belt, suspenders and a sky hook level of conservatism, but it’s an approach that has served us well.
Here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity chart. You can use it for this year and also for 2012. It reflects risk mitigation measures already in place. Now please note the ROE sensitivity. The Commission recently reset Detroit Edison's authorized ROE at 10.5%. We’ve shown here a 20 basis point drop in our authorized level, both in electric and gas, to help you assess alternatives. We’re comfortable with our ability to manage the level of change shown here. We’ve designed our plans to accommodate this, if required.
Tools include managing our level of utility equity, capital spending, incentives not included in the authorized ROE calculation like our energy incentive performance, and modest earnings growth outside of the utility.
I hope you find that our earnings and dividend track record speaks for itself. We continue to be comfortable with our 2011 earnings guidance at a $1.44 a share, and we have an opportunity to grow our dividend further. We are on track to deliver on all of our financial targets as shown here. We feel good about our prospects for next year. 
John and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming EEI conference where we’ll present on Tuesday, November 8 at 8:15 a.m. And on February 29, we’re planning an investor meeting at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate our 125th anniversary as well as our 65th year of being listed on the Exchange. We look forward to seeing many of you at these events.

Things that we could do, we have a chance to manage the level of equity that we have in the utility, there is always a little room to put a little bit more in there. We also have a chance to do a little bit better on our EO performance. The incentives that we get there are actually calculated outside on top of the authorized ROE, and we plan conservatively on that. We don’t put all of those sort of savings into our initial plans. We work our way there. There is also the chance, of course, that we can adjust our capital spending a little bit, just tune that down a little bit, defer it a little bit, do the sort of controls we have been talking to you about for some time, and that can have an impact. And then lastly, we don’t have lot of business outside of the utility, we’re core in the ability; but we do have a little bit in our enterprise organization as an example.

As long as we have our large capital investment program going, we are very happy to bring that forward each year to make sure we recover in a timely basis the investments that we’re making. And recall, we are working very hard to try to go into every rate case with O&M flat to down a little bit, so we’re actually giving something back if we can bring it down to our customers, and that’s our intend. The other nice thing is, we’ll get to recognize the portion maybe of decoupling if that changes around the economy. So that with our annual rate cases, we’re still held neutral, we get to pickup our sales. And even though we’re all a little nervous about where things are going, you can see the track record on sales, it’s certainly an upside, if that’s something that’s not decoupled as we go into the future. So for us it’s an annual case. There could be conditions changing in the future, nothing that we know of formally or officially, but if we are ever to track investment, for example, I would admit there would be little reason for us to go in for annual rate cases. But at this point in the game, that’s our plan."

We have all the pipeline replacements and all the upgrades that we need to do to meet the laws. But we’d like to accelerate that sum, and folks would like to help us do that. We'd like to do more pole replacements, just to stay ahead of the game, to help our customers. We may need new gas generation as we go through time. And we certainly would like to do our smart grid faster, but these are all things that are -- they are things that we want and they are not things that our customers absolutely need right now. So something like a change in the laws for environmental, those would be things that we would need to do. All those costs that we just described for the 5-year period are included in our plan. So they are in the $6.6 billion already. I’ve mentioned when we’ve been out on the road with folks, that the timing is a little bit different because with the new rulings that came out we had to adjust forward about $100 million of timing in this period, but in the period in total we were fine. So I would tell you that our goal is, when something is foisted upon us, if we can, we’ll look for a way to rebalance the portfolio to keep the sorts of investments we need to do over the next 5 years at a level that keep the level of our customer rate increases down to a sustainable level. Now $6.6 billion is not an absolute number, that’s the other thing I think everyone should know.

We try on the parent debt side to stay ahead about a year or 2 in terms of the requirements. Although the pension is much in the utility, more in utility than it is outside, we also look at that as an obligation that we have. So we look to stay ahead of the game on that. And you remember last year we funded early. And when you do that it improves your position in terms of being funded, but it also gives you a little bit of an earnings upside, to be candid. We’ll be looking at that opportunity more toward the end of this year when we see how returns and discount rates are playing out. Let me we shift gears to a second related but different piece. And that is, I’m sure you’re hearing from folks, that with discount rates falling and interest rates falling as low as they are, that puts pressure on the size of the pension and OPEB liabilities. So therefore it’s a hurt. And it’s a hurt to us. There will be several pennies of penalty when that number is known at the end of the year, and we don’t know it because it’s not determined until you have actuals, but that costs us some earnings power. We've built all that into our plans looking ahead, and we feel very comfortable with what John said about the 5% to 7% growth as we go forward in time, even with those pressures. But yes, those pressures are there. Now the other side of that coin that I would just mention is, recall, that when discount rates fall, because interest rates fall, that cost companies a little bit more because of the then higher present value of their liabilities. So it hurts their earnings. But when those turn around, come back up, it’s going to help their earnings. So our view has always been, manage it. If you've got bad news, figure out how to address it and continue to meet your guidance for growth; and if you got good news, invest that, help your customers out if you can, if you have some surplus to do that. Does that help?"

But we’re worried, and that’s why we are being cautionary, because consumer confidence has come down in the last couple of months. And when we talk to our industrial customers, and John and I and coal management team partners up and talks to 2 or 3 of those customers on a regular basis. They may be doing well, their production may be full out right now, with schedules that are full out for the rest of this year, but they still worry what’s going to come out of Europe, what’s going to happen in our election process. And so it makes them nervous. And in a nervous environment, that’s hard to make solid predictions. What I can tell you is that the decoupling mechanism certainly give us some insulation in the State of Michigan which is a helpful thing.

I’ll tell you, next week, I am presenting along with the Michigan Chamber, the Detroit Chamber of Commerce, the Michigan Manufacturers Association, DTE is going to be there also, all testifying in support of where we are today. And so we’re going to make a point to the Senate about how important this law is to Michigan, the jobs it’s created, the investments it’s created. And we’ve got some unique positions that we’re going to talk about because, keep in mind, this is the second energy law that occurred in Michigan. The first one is back in 2000 when a lot of expectations were set and very little came out of it. So that’s why the 2008 law was put into place. So that’s where we are today. I think it’s being pushed, opening the cap by some customers, and also because we are at the 10% cap but also from the standpoint of some outstate suppliers that would like to get into Michigan and do some work. And my focus will be and you’ll hear it next week at the Senate hearings, we are the second largest investor in the State of Michigan and we are the seventh largest employer. We want Michigan to be successful. We are here for the long run. Our rates over a long period of time are consistently competitive with the recession that we’ve had over the past couple of years, despite Tom seeing the recovery, we’re still coming out of the recession. And with the natural gas prices, some of the coal fleet is not as competitive in our contracts as it used to be. But that will begin to change in the future as we see the sales come back and as we see natural gas prices increase, but not a lot, and as we see the impact of the environmental rules on the fleet throughout the Midwest."

We think we can be at about the $0.02 a kilowatt hour range for energy efficiency for incentives that we provide. That’s about the impact of energy efficiency cost. We’ve been in the program for 2 years now. Our customers have saved $67 million. So the payback for what we spend to incent compared to what they save is about a 2-year payback. In some areas it’s very effective, less than a year, and in others, particularly low income, it takes a much longer time to make up that difference. So we are supportive of it, I think it’s good.
