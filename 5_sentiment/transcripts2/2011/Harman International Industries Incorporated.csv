I am joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker and our Vice President of Investor Relations, Robert Lardon.
Before we begin, on behalf of our employees and our Board of Directors, I wanted to again express our deep sadness with the sudden passing of our founder, Dr. Sidney Harman. He will be missed by the Harman International family and by our customers. And his legacy for innovation and quality will live on here at Harman. In his honor, we have established Sidney Harman Vision Scholarship and we will launch a number of limited edition products to commemorate his legacy.
Earlier today in our earnings release, we shared with you the outstanding progress we have made during the quarter. We continued building momentum with six consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement to both top and bottom line. And we are beginning to reap the rewards of investments we are making in emerging markets. We continue to deliver consistent improvement in sales growth and operating income. Quarterly sales, up 13% and operating income up 93%. Year-to-date operating income is up 105%.
We are growing rapidly in emerging markets and won multiple branded audio orders from Chinese automakers. We extended our Volkswagen Group award to $1.6 billion covering entire world including Asia. With this award our scalable platform, automotive orders, increased to $3.5 billion and our total backlog of awarded business is at solid $13 billion.
We also exceeded our $400 million step change permanent cost savings program and we’ve did that while we still have one more quarter to go in terms of recognizing full benefits. It has also driven a new era of cost consciousness into Harman’s culture and I'm very happy about that.
To meet growing automotive and professional audio demand for our products, we continue to add production capacity where our customers needed, in line with our plan to transform our global footprint. This summer, we will start production at two of our newest and largest facilities in Dandong, China and Queretaro, Mexico. We are well underway to get to our target of 50-50 balance of manufacturing footprint between high cost and best-cost countries by 2012. As we have said before these actions will improve our competitiveness and increase profitability considerably over time. I would also like to address the recent events in Japan.
We were pleased that no Harman employee nor their immediate families were directly affected by the earthquake and tsunami and Harman did not suffer any property damage. However, the widespread slowdown of Japan’s industrial infrastructure has impacted the automotive industry on a global scale. Despite widely reported part shortages across several industries, we managed to keep normal supply to our customers during this quarter even if it meant some additional cost.
We are working diligently with our Japanese part suppliers and continue to monitor the availability and the quality of components from Japan while investigating alternative supplier options in other countries or even reaching out to make parallel arrangement so that we ensure our customers have no disruptions.
Thanks to Harman Supply Management around the world working for round the clock, we believe Harman is well positioned to weather the impact of the supply disruption. Excluding the impact of lower (inaudible) in the up coming quarters as predicted by several sources, at this moment we don’t expect material impact on our business due to Japanese component availability concerns.
With that challenge, largely under control, I believe, we remain focused on executing against our four strategic pillars and are now beginning to see the pay off on our investments particularly in emerging markets. As you may have read we have just announced three automotive audio awards to grow our business in China. We’ve been awarded the Volkswagen Group Asian business that is based on our scalable platform. Our growth in Brazil is outstanding and we have just entered Russia and are setting up our business infrastructure there. So it’s been a pretty controlled yet very decisive move into the emerging markets, first China, then India, then Brazil and now Russia.
For the first time in recent history, we’ve participated in the major auto shows in Detroit and Shanghai and demonstrated our full suite of capabilities for additional - traditional, electric and hybrid vehicles. We are delighted with the high level of interest from our customers for our connected, green edge and safety systems. In particular, Aha Radio connectivity solutions that bring social media sites and a smartphone experience in the car in a safe and secure manner were the talk of media and customers alike.
It’s clear that what we observe at Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas earlier this year and the Detroit Auto Show is validating our view of convergent technologies between consumer and automotive audio for which we have been positioning the company. The mobility of digital content between your living room and your car requires the invention of new technologies. That can increase or improve the user rate experience and deliver the highest quality sound.
Just as consumers are demanding 3-D television there is a clear need to deliver 3-D sound experience in the car and in the living room. We are actively leveraging and developing new solutions for the convergence of technologies both in the car and between the car and the home. Only Harman has the brands and technology leadership to fully leverage this opportunity with our customers and consumers.
Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to transform the company culture and have delivered a sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year top and bottom line growth. Let me again touch on some of the key accomplishments in this quarter.
Q3 sales up 13%, operating income up 93%, year-to-date operating income 105%. Last 12 months, EBITDA was $320 million or 8.9% in Q3 2011 from just $14 million or 0.5% in Q1 2010. So we’ve come a long way and we are not done yet.
We have delivered on our cost savings program with $416 million in permanent savings, exceeding our target and one quarter early. Our next generation scalable platform backlog stands at $3.5 billion out of total backlog of 13 and you must be reminded that this scalable platform was launched September 2009, so not too long ago and we changed the industry the way we operate now.
And our innovation pipeline is driving double-digit growth with over 40 new products in professional and consumer divisions and connected car technologies launched at Detroit and Geneva Auto Show. Our BRIC country infrastructure investments are now capturing high growth in emerging markets as evidenced by the VW Auto and new Chinese automotive orders and outstanding growth in Brazil.
We are doubling our manufacturing capacity in Hungary, China and Mexico during this year and we’ll bring up five mega manufacturing plants by summer of 2011.
Our innovation pipeline remains rich and ahead of our competition with more than 3,500 patents. New idea generation and collaboration is at an all-time high. We're focused on executing against a very robust growth agenda supported by a growing and energized workforce.
Thank you for your attention, and I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker to provide you a closer look at our quarterly results.

(Inaudible) have the opportunity to read through our earnings release. So let me review some of the key highlights and provide some additional details related to our team at this quarter. As always most of my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which basically excludes restructuring, costs. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release, but for your convenience we took a $9.5 million charge to restructuring expense this quarter.
Okay. Let me begin with the top line of our financials. In the third quarter, our sales increased across all three divisions on a year-over-year basis. This increase was primarily a result of our continued improvement in global economic conditions but also due to our strong focus on growing our business in the emerging markets.
Our sales in the third quarter were $940 million, which translates to a 13%, increase both in nominal and local currencies. And as you know, we are heavily focused on improving our account space via our global footprint initiative. And in spite of continuous price pressure, we're still able to improve our gross profit margin by 34 basis points to 26.4%. In the controllable cost area, our SG&A expense declined by 0.8 percentage points to 21.4% of sales compared to the prior year.
The engineering cost included in our SG&A expense amounted to 8.4% of sales compared to 9.6%. From a bottom-line standpoint, we continued our profitability trend to reporting an operating profit of $63 million compared to an operating profit of $33 million last year. The operating profit for the third quarter was 6.7% as compared to 3.9% for last year. Our net income for the third quarter was $43 million or $0.60 per share compared to net income of $19 million or $0.27 per share last year.
Now I'd like to just take this moment to highlight again that the success of our STEP Change program was a very big factory in having us produce these remarkable results. And it is now part of the Harman DNA. The total [landmark] comments on the financials; our effective quality tax rate on a GAAP basis was 22% and our total liquidity which we define as cash, plus short-term investments, plus available revolving credit facility, was $1.3 billion.
Now to echo Dinesh, we're pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement, and I would like to thank you again for your attention.
Operator, we’re now ready to take your questions.

Chris as we said, no material impact was expected and it’s true. We incurred in last quarters like couple million dollars in logistics cost and making sure that we have a tax force of our source and supply management team sitting in Japan and task force sitting in North America and in Germany. A lot have traveled back and forth and working through a lot of logistics hoops and that had a little extra cost but I'm very happy we incurred that because we did not bring any disruption to our customers. And let me also add, I was in Germany just a week ago and we were complimented by two of our largest German customers saying, you’re one of those very, very few suppliers who have done such a good job.
So I'm very happy we incurred the cost and make sure that they can run their production without any disruption. What do I expect, well this problem in Japan is not going to linger forever. I had a feeling within a quarter or two perhaps we will start to see normal life. So do I expect a little less extra expense in managing extra logistic cost, yes, but that would be in a single-digit area in the next quarter or so.

As we indicated in press release and I’ll just walk you through, and we also have a pay that we have put in the queue actually that happened here. There are four items actually Himanshu, and I believe these are not recurring. They are kind of one-offs. The very first one is, the biggest one is we incurred about $6.3 million in research, development and engineering cost in this quarter and also we had quite a large number of engineering change orders in two of our German projects, which is a good news. So that means that’s a positive thing. Projects get improved profitability.
Additionally, we had some duplicate R&D cost in Germany and China as we train our people and transfer the engineering work packages to best-cost countries. (inaudible) $6.3 million and that should not be a concern at all because we controlled it, we knew it. I hope you know how diligently I hate the higher R&D or engineering cost and we have brought it down significantly down. Our long-term target of 8% is pretty solid and we will deliver on that. So this was a good reason. While we are transferring work packages as well as number of change orders, those are positive.
Number two, to ensure our German customers production lines are protected from any supply-related disruption, we encourage $2.7 million cost in parallel supply arrangements as insurance in this quarter. That’s definitely not going to happen just like R&DPs in other quarters. We did that. That was in insurance and I’m happy with it.
Third piece, I already mentioned earlier, you all know full valve of the Japan power supply has been a big challenge for all companies. We handled rather well by putting together a special task force in Japan and Europe and in America and we monitored daily. And while we are very pleased that the customer outcome and satisfaction is very high, this exercise however had a small cost of a couple of million dollar in this quarter. And that is something might happen in the next quarter as well.
Then the fourth item, Himanshu, is we incurred $1.1 million in new market development related trade shows, one in Detroit, one in Shanghai and you can relate to it, because we don’t do much business in D3. We don’t do much business in China. We had to demonstrate. Europe knows our strength very well. So this was one-off. So if you add it all together it comes out around $12 million. You take it out from $16 million. Yes, we got $4 million tailwind. So even if you adjust core back, $0.60 EPS becomes $0.55. We are still extremely happy with that. For last year it was $0.27 and even with adjustment $0.55. But that’s a net math. I hope Himanshu you have that details.

The long name, it’s a long name, but it’s a separate legal company and this is to develop jointly electric vehicle for domestic as well as international market.

Just given some of the legislation in the United States regarding backup camera and all of that, what’s kind of the interest level from OEMs for you to do something like that.

We move from premium-high, we expanded into premium-mid, and part of our strategy well before this U.S. legislation calls for camera-based car in 2014,0 we actually started development work for premium-entry. And that is actually very well underway because we recognize that even our European and American, Japanese automakers, when they start to sell more cars, the very fast growing market is mid and entry. So, we have already made demonstration of our entry-system with a number of customers and there is tremendous interest. Commercially we have not launched it, but this is just a matter of timing. So to answer your question, yes there is a lot of interest from our side and of course from automotive side, and we’re very mind full of that regulation in 2014 camera-based technology solutions are not new to us, we’re launching those. In fact we have number of camera companies working with us, and we’re integrating that in our entry mid and high, all three. So I think it would be very price competitive for entry, mid and high, at the same time we’ll have a full rich suite all in one place.

I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon.
In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results making it eighth straight quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line.
Our sales increased 26% and our earnings per share 72% up. Operating income was up 74% and our total liquidity stands at $1.2 billion. Our last 12 months EBITDA was $366 million or 9.2% of sales.
Regardless of current market dynamics, we remain laser focused on executing our growth strategy supported by four key pillars growing smart infotainment, growing car audio, growing in emerging markets, and getting our cost and capital structure right.
We are pleased to report that our infotainment and audio backlog remains at as record high $14.5 billion, with over 40% of our infotainment backlog in higher margin scalable systems.
We are winning new car audio orders and taking shares from our competitors across the world.
Building on last years momentum in BRIC countries were we grew 68% sales in last years fiscal year I’m pleased to say, we are continuing to strength and grow sales by 91% in BRIC countries in this past quarter.
To meet this rising demand, we have added capacity and expand our distribution channels were necessary, while continuing to drive cost out of our global manufacturing footprint. We have also created scalability and flexibility to deal with any significant fluctuations and demand.
Overall, we continue to promote a continuous cost management culture by launching new internal cost management initiatives following our very successful STEP Change permanent cost-savings program, which we concluded last year with astounding $434 million permanent cost reductions.
I am very excited to share with you that we have launched a marketing campaign in North America to be expanded into other key markets. This is to increase automotive audio take rates, home audio and multimedia sales. We believe that this campaign will also support growth and market share gains across our entire business. We continue to innovate and maintain a rich pipeline of technologically advanced system portfolio and we have hosted several technology days with our major customers in Europe and Asia. Many of you will be joining us next Wednesday, October 26, for our Investor and Analyst Day in Nashville, Tennessee.
At this event, you will have the opportunity to witness Harman Technology demonstration and get further insights into our innovation pipeline. In addition, we will update our mid-term 2013 guidance and also provide guidance for fiscal ’12. For those of you not attending, a press release will be issued on Monday, October 24, 2011 with call in details so that you can hear it online as well as after the call is completed.
During our last earnings call on August 10, I informed you of the $85 million cost impact identified due to the sharp rise in cost of neodymium magnets. With increased sales, the growth impact of neodymium has risen slightly to $90 million while I look forward to updating you on the progress of our cost mitigation efforts at Analyst Day next Wednesday. I’m pleased to say, we have made a lot of progress.
And it is trending in the right direction, because of our focus on operational excellence and our ability to pass on cost increases.
Ladies and gentleman, we are in a new growth phase at Harman. The strong footholds in each of our BRIC countries, further diversifying it and expanding our growth prospects. Our operation realignment will better enable us to focus and make measurable improvement on the profitability of our infotainment business and we are aggressively working on increasing our backlog of scalable system.
As I said, we are excited to have launched a global marketing campaign featuring some of the world’s most prominent music artists. To support further penetration of our five-year plan across our business lines, in particular car audio tape rates, which is a very healthy business.
We continue to invest in innovation and capacity expansion to take advantage of global opportunities as well as these economic headwinds. These initiatives executed by dedicated and committed Harman employees worldwide, about to say, have resulted in eight consecutive quarters of improvement to both our top and bottom line.
I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker to provide a closer look at our financial results.

29279,141349847,175380,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2011",2011-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We are very pleased to have begun our new fiscal year with a solid first quarter. We were able to execute well, I guess, our opportunities during the quarter despite the cost pressures that Dinesh had revie",919,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We are very pleased to have begun our new fiscal year with a solid first quarter. We were able to execute well, I guess, our opportunities during the quarter despite the cost pressures that Dinesh had reviewed and achieve very good year-over-year improvement.
Now, I will review a few of our highlights from the first quarter. And as always, note that my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring cost.
The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. But for your convenience, we took a $2 million charge to restructuring expense this quarter compared to the $3 million credit during the same quarter last year.
Okay, let’s first discuss the revenue line for the first quarter. We grew our quarterly revenues by 26% to $1.51 billion, a new first quarter record for us. If you exclude the impact of foreign currency, which did help during the quarter, we grew at a rate of 19%. Each of our segments contributed to these increases versus the prior year. Though Infotainment was particularly strong and grew 35% versus last year.
While there is certainly a good deal of sustainable growth in these numbers, we also benefited from some pent-up demand following the production disruption, caused by the tsunami earthquake in Japan. This quarter also included a short-term capture of some business from a competitor, who was not able to meet demand during the quarter.
Moving on to the gross margin; our first quarter was 27.5%, up 80 basis point from last year’s 26.7%. All of the gross margin improvement came from our Infotainment business, where we increased gross margin by more than 500 basis points. This was a result of a range of productivity improvement, which has lowered our count rate.
The impact of these initiatives was also amplified as a result of high level of sales growth in the quarter increasing the leverage effect. As Dinesh talked about earlier, gross margin in our other two segments; Professional and Lifestyle came under significant pressure from high cost of neodymium magnets. This has a net impact of $8 million or 270 basis points for the Lifestyle Division and $1 million or 70 basis points for the Professional Division.
We will continue to work to minimize the impact of this on our profitability, and as Dinesh noted, we will update you on our neodymium actions and financial projections during the Analyst Investor Day next Wednesday.
Let's move onto the SG&A area, where we can inform you that our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was very good. We added $32 million in cost to achieve the $240 million of sales growth. The STEP Change program has really helped instill ongoing cost discipline in organization and become much more efficient; organization has become much more efficient I should say. And combined with the strong revenue growth, our [push play] efficiency enabled us to reduce our expenses by 170 basis points to 20.3%. As a result of the gross margin increase and the SG&A expense rate decrease, our operating margin improved quite nicely, growing to 7.3% from the 4.8% of last year.
Now moving onto the net income for the quarter; we reported $49 million or $0.69 per share compared to net income of $25 million or $0.35 per share in the prior year's quarter. And I'll note that effective tax quality rate was 23.6%. Our cash and cash equivalent balance decreased by $231 million in the quarter, while still bringing our total liquidity to $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. The major items impacted the cash during the quarter was increased net operating capital of $182 million, which we needed to support higher sales, the acquisition of the MWM, which was about $70 million, and of course we have foreign currency translation reduction of $56 million.
I would like to point out as a percent of annualized sales (inaudible) our net operating capital was reduced by 170 basis point compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Now just to remind you, we do have a disciplined process for deploying our capital and we will continue to evaluate alternatives. What is - it is an organic growth investment and acquisition or a share buyback.
We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities, such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, where our long-term returns are the most promising. We believe as we saw with the Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in United States that strategic acquisitions can accelerate and complement this strategy.
In addition, we do remain committed to provide in those sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders and our Board of Directors continues to evaluate share buyback opportunities along other strategic options.
As I noted when I begin, this was a strong start to the new fiscal year for Harman and our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at both the top and bottom line. We maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and as a result, remain in position to take advantage of a poor range of strategic options.
Now, just briefly, I’d like to note that in addition to our quality results, we provided a full year’s work of quarterly financial data for our new segments as part of our press release. This should help you to better understand the business as we are now running it.
With that said, operator, we are now ready to take your questions.

So that’s why have step up a separate team who reports to me directly to look at such pipeline globally. And you know we will look at it, I don’t know whether I can give any timeframe, because we were to do any acquisition, it would be done. We're very comfortable, from the multiples point of view, from the governance point of view, from the management we bring in, we'll not feel any pressure to do any deal ever.
So that's where we are. Do we see something happening next six months? Maybe, but not a whole lot of deals we are looking at. At any given time probably we will be looking at five, six deals. We are very selective and we hope that maybe we can close one or two next 12 months.

So Mexico facility came online in Carretero, Mexico great industrial belt with a lot of blue-chip [American] manufacturing is happening. So very pleased with this, and this up and running. And this does have, you heard me say in my prepared comments that we have flexible and scalable manufacturing, and this is exactly that example. We can crank it up to add almost 100% more capacity without incurring any significant capital, because we have got to flexible workforce, flexible cell mechanisms to move things around.
Then it comes to China, we have two brand new facilities. They well have actually started pilot production, but full production should start by end of this month or beginning November. One facility is dedicated to our infotainment and audio business, predominantly audio. So BMW, Audi, I mean, Mercedes and Toyota, Hyundai, all of that production for Asia part would have start to come from that factory soon. That's going to be a very good leverage for us from the cost point of view.
Then second factory is dedicated to our professional business. The pro business is growing so much in Asia; it doesn't make sense to shift products around from either our facilities here in the United States or from Mexico.
So between these three factories and existing plants in Hungary, which is a very large production hub for us and Germany and United States, we have tremendous capacity, which we can turn up if we want to without incurring any significant CapEx. I mean, a pretty good position we feel that we have built flexible production increase in our footprint. And also from the cost base point of view, our 60% of our workforce for blue collar manufacturing is in best-cost countries, 40% in high-cost.
And as growth continues in the direction we are driving, I think you will see lot more manufacturing leverage to come, because we will load more capacity in these BCC plants of Hungary, China, Mexico, Brazil and other places.

And I think the current footprint will allow us to expand by adding more production sales, so we have a lot of [illustrated] in each of these plant, which means the biggest chunk of expense is already done now, all you do is to add production line and add few more ships.

So that's a very positive for the next consumers those who come and buy these cars, they can take away and then without worrying about that their infotainment system would be antiquated in two years or one-year time.
So they will have online apps related to infotainment, related to connectivity, related to multimedia and whole host of other point of interest and a smart information like Aha Mobile.

I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robe",753,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining the Harman's first quarter fiscal 2012 investor and analyst call. I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon. In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results making it eighth straight quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line. Our sales increased 26% and our earnings per share 72% up. Operating income was up 74% and our total liquidity stands at $1.2 billion. Our last 12 months EBITDA was $366 million or 9.2% of sales. Regardless of current market dynamics, we remain laser focused on executing our growth strategy supported by 4 key pillars growing smart infotainment, growing car audio, growing in emerging markets, and getting our cost and capital structure right. 
We are pleased to report that our infotainment and audio backlog remains at a record high $14.5 billion, with over 40% of our infotainment backlog in higher margin scalable systems. We are winning new car audio orders and taking shares from our competitors across the world. Building on last year’s momentum in BRIC countries where we grew 68% sales in last year’s fiscal year I’m pleased to say, we are continuing to strength and grow sales by 91% in BRIC countries in this past quarter. To meet this rising demand, we have added capacity and expanded distribution channels were necessary, while continuing to drive cost out of our global manufacturing footprint. We have also created scalability and flexibility to deal with any significant fluctuations and demand. Overall, we continue to promote a continuous cost management culture by launching new internal cost management initiatives following our very successful STEP Change permanent cost-savings program, which we concluded last year with astounding $434 million permanent cost reductions.
I am very excited to share with you that we have launched a marketing campaign in North America to be expanded into other key markets. This is to increase automotive audio take rates, home audio and multimedia sales. We believe that this campaign will also support growth and market share gains across our entire business. We continue to innovate and maintain a rich pipeline of technologically advanced system portfolio and we have hosted several technology days with our major customers in Europe and Asia. Many of you will be joining us next Wednesday, October 26, for our Investor and Analyst Day in Nashville, Tennessee. At this event, you will have the opportunity to witness Harman Technology demonstration and get further insights into our innovation pipeline. 
In addition, we will update our mid-term 2013 guidance and also provide guidance for fiscal ’12. For those of you not attending, a press release will be issued on Monday, October 24, 2011, with call in details so that you can hear it online as well as after the call is completed.
During our last earnings call on August 10, I informed you of the $85 million cost impact identified due to the sharp rise in cost of neodymium magnets. With increased sales, the growth impact of neodymium has risen slightly to $90 million. While I look forward to updating you on the progress of our cost mitigation efforts at Analyst Day next Wednesday, I’m pleased to say, we have made a lot of progress and it is trending in the right direction, because of our focus on operational excellence and our ability to pass on cost increases.
Ladies and gentleman, we are in a new growth phase at Harman. The strong footholds in each of our BRIC countries, further diversifying it and expanding our growth prospects. Our operation realignment will better enable us to focus and make measurable improvement on the profitability of our infotainment business and we are aggressively working on increasing our backlog of scalable systems. As I said, we are excited to have launched a global marketing campaign featuring some of the world’s most prominent music artists. 
To support further penetration of our five-year plan across our business lines, in particular car audio tape rates, which is a very healthy business. We continue to invest in innovation and capacity expansion to take advantage of global opportunities and weather the economic headwinds. These initiatives executed by dedicated and committed Harman employees worldwide, I’m proud to say, have resulted in 8 consecutive quarters of improvement to both our top and bottom line. I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker to provide a closer look at our financial results."
29279,141349847,207996,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2011",2011-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We are very pleased to have begun our new fiscal year with a solid first quarter. We were able to execute well against our opportunities during the quarter despite the cost pressures that Dinesh shared with",918,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We are very pleased to have begun our new fiscal year with a solid first quarter. We were able to execute well against our opportunities during the quarter despite the cost pressures that Dinesh shared with you and achieved very good year-over-year improvement. Now, I will review a few of our highlights from the first quarter. And as always, note that my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring cost. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. But for your convenience, we took a $2 million charge to restructuring expense this quarter compared to the $3 million credit during the same quarter last year. 
Okay, let’s first discuss the revenue line for the first quarter. We grew our quarterly revenues by 26% to $1.51 billion, a new first quarter record for us. If you exclude the impact of foreign currency, which did help during the quarter, we grew at a rate of 19%. Each of our segments contributed to these increases versus the prior year. Though Infotainment was particularly strong and grew 35% versus last year. While there is certainly a good deal of sustainable growth in these numbers, we also benefited from some pent-up demand following the production disruption, caused by the tsunami earthquake in Japan. This quarter also included a short-term capture of some business from a competitor, who was not able to meet demand during the quarter.
Moving on to the gross margin; our first quarter was 27.5%, up 80 basis point from last year’s 26.7%. All of the gross margin improvement came from our Infotainment business, where we increased gross margin by more than 500 basis points. This was a result of a range of productivity improvement, which has lowered our cost base. The impact of these initiatives was also amplified as a result of high level of sales growth in the quarter increasing the leverage effect. As Dinesh talked about earlier, gross margin in our other two segments; Professional and Lifestyle came under significant pressure from high cost of neodymium magnets. This has a net impact of $8 million or 270 basis points for the Lifestyle Division and $1 million or 70 basis points for the Professional Division. We will continue to work to minimize the impact of this on our profitability, and as Dinesh noted, we will update you on our neodymium actions and financial projections during the Analyst Investor Day next Wednesday. 
Let's move onto the SG&A area, where we can inform you that our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was very good. We added $32 million in cost to achieve the $240 million of sales growth. The STEP Change program has really helped instill ongoing cost discipline in organization and become much more efficient; organization has become much more efficient I should say. And combined with the strong revenue growth, our [push play] efficiency enabled us to reduce our expenses by 170 basis points to 20.3%. As a result of the gross margin increase and the SG&A expense rate decrease, our operating margin improved quite nicely, growing to 7.3% from the 4.8% of last year.
Now moving onto the net income for the quarter; we reported $49 million or $0.69 per share compared to net income of $25 million or $0.35 per share in the prior year's quarter. And I'll note that effective tax quality rate was 23.6%. Our cash and cash equivalent balance decreased by $231 million in the quarter, while still bringing our total liquidity to $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. The major items impacted the cash during the quarter was increased net operating capital of $182 million, which we needed to support higher sales, the acquisition of the MWM, which was about $70 million, and of course we have foreign currency translation reduction of $56 million. I would like to point out as a percent of annualized sales however, our net operating capital was reduced by 170 basis point compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
Now just to remind you, we do have a disciplined process for deploying our capital and we will continue to evaluate alternatives. What is - it is an organic growth investment and acquisition or a share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities, such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, where long-term returns are the most promising. We believe as we saw with the Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in United States that strategic acquisitions can accelerate and complement this strategy. In addition, we do remain committed to provide in those sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders and our Board of Directors continues to evaluate share buyback opportunities along other strategic options. 
As I noted when I begin, this was a strong start to the new fiscal year for Harman and our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at both the top and bottom line. We maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and as a result, remain in position to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. Now, just briefly, I’d like to note that in addition to our quality results, we provided a full year’s work of quarterly financial data for our new segments as part of our press release. This should help you to better understand the business as we are now running it. With that said, operator, we are now ready to take your questions."

So Mexico facility came online in Carretero, Mexico great industrial belt with a lot of blue-chip [American] manufacturing is happening. So very pleased with this, and this up and running. And this does have, you heard me say in my prepared comments that we have flexible and scalable manufacturing, and this is exactly that example. We can crank it up to add almost 100% more capacity without incurring any significant capital, because we have got flexible workforce, flexible cell mechanisms to move things around. Then it comes to China, we have two brand new facilities. They well have actually started pilot production, but full production should start by end of this month or beginning November. One facility is dedicated to our infotainment and audio business, predominantly audio. So BMW, Audi, I mean, Mercedes and Toyota, Hyundai, all of that production for Asia part would have start to come from that factory soon. That's going to be a very good leverage for us from the cost point of view. Then second factory is dedicated to our professional business. The pro business is growing so much in Asia; it doesn't make sense to shift products around from either our facilities here in the United States or from Mexico. So between these 3 factories and existing plants in Hungary, which is a very large production hub for us and Germany and United States, we have tremendous capacity, which we can turn up if we want to without incurring any significant CapEx. I mean, a pretty good position we feel that we have built flexible production increase in our footprint. And also from the cost base point of view, we have 60% of our workforce for blue collar manufacturing is in best-cost countries, 40% in high-cost. And as growth continues in the direction we are driving, I think you will see lot more manufacturing leverage to come, because we will load more capacity in these BCC plants of Hungary, China, Mexico, Brazil and other places."

And I think we are very well underway on that path with the direction we have. And I think the current footprint will allow us to expand by adding more production cells, so we have a lot of [illustrated] in each of these plant, which means the biggest chunk of expense is already done now, all you do is to add production line and add few more shifts.

So that's a very positive for the next consumers those who come and buy these cars, they can take away and then without worrying about that their infotainment system would be antiquated in two years or one-year time. So they will have online apps related to infotainment, related to connectivity, related to multimedia and whole host of other point of interest and a smart information like Aha Mobile.

I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robe",753,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining the Harman's first quarter fiscal 2012 investor and analyst call. I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon. In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results making it eighth straight quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line. Our sales increased 26% and our earnings per share 72% up. Operating income was up 74% and our total liquidity stands at $1.2 billion. Our last 12 months EBITDA was $366 million or 9.2% of sales. Regardless of current market dynamics, we remain laser focused on executing our growth strategy supported by 4 key pillars growing smart infotainment, growing car audio, growing in emerging markets, and getting our cost and capital structure right. 
We are pleased to report that our infotainment and audio backlog remains at a record high $14.5 billion, with over 40% of our infotainment backlog in higher margin scalable systems. We are winning new car audio orders and taking shares from our competitors across the world. Building on last year’s momentum in BRIC countries where we grew 68% sales in last year’s fiscal year I’m pleased to say, we are continuing to strength and grow sales by 91% in BRIC countries in this past quarter. To meet this rising demand, we have added capacity and expanded distribution channels were necessary, while continuing to drive cost out of our global manufacturing footprint. We have also created scalability and flexibility to deal with any significant fluctuations and demand. Overall, we continue to promote a continuous cost management culture by launching new internal cost management initiatives following our very successful STEP Change permanent cost-savings program, which we concluded last year with astounding $434 million permanent cost reductions.
I am very excited to share with you that we have launched a marketing campaign in North America to be expanded into other key markets. This is to increase automotive audio take rates, home audio and multimedia sales. We believe that this campaign will also support growth and market share gains across our entire business. We continue to innovate and maintain a rich pipeline of technologically advanced system portfolio and we have hosted several technology days with our major customers in Europe and Asia. Many of you will be joining us next Wednesday, October 26, for our Investor and Analyst Day in Nashville, Tennessee. At this event, you will have the opportunity to witness Harman Technology demonstration and get further insights into our innovation pipeline. 
In addition, we will update our mid-term 2013 guidance and also provide guidance for fiscal ’12. For those of you not attending, a press release will be issued on Monday, October 24, 2011, with call in details so that you can hear it online as well as after the call is completed.
During our last earnings call on August 10, I informed you of the $85 million cost impact identified due to the sharp rise in cost of neodymium magnets. With increased sales, the growth impact of neodymium has risen slightly to $90 million. While I look forward to updating you on the progress of our cost mitigation efforts at Analyst Day next Wednesday, I’m pleased to say, we have made a lot of progress and it is trending in the right direction, because of our focus on operational excellence and our ability to pass on cost increases.
Ladies and gentleman, we are in a new growth phase at Harman. The strong footholds in each of our BRIC countries, further diversifying it and expanding our growth prospects. Our operation realignment will better enable us to focus and make measurable improvement on the profitability of our infotainment business and we are aggressively working on increasing our backlog of scalable systems. As I said, we are excited to have launched a global marketing campaign featuring some of the world’s most prominent music artists. 
To support further penetration of our five-year plan across our business lines, in particular car audio tape rates, which is a very healthy business. We continue to invest in innovation and capacity expansion to take advantage of global opportunities and weather the economic headwinds. These initiatives executed by dedicated and committed Harman employees worldwide, I’m proud to say, have resulted in 8 consecutive quarters of improvement to both our top and bottom line. I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker to provide a closer look at our financial results."
29279,141349847,208639,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2011",2011-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We are very pleased to have begun our new fiscal year with a solid first quarter. We were able to execute well against our opportunities during the quarter despite the cost pressures that Dinesh shared with",918,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We are very pleased to have begun our new fiscal year with a solid first quarter. We were able to execute well against our opportunities during the quarter despite the cost pressures that Dinesh shared with you and achieved very good year-over-year improvement. Now, I will review a few of our highlights from the first quarter. And as always, note that my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring cost. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. But for your convenience, we took a $2 million charge to restructuring expense this quarter compared to the $3 million credit during the same quarter last year. 
Okay, let’s first discuss the revenue line for the first quarter. We grew our quarterly revenues by 26% to $1.51 billion, a new first quarter record for us. If you exclude the impact of foreign currency, which did help during the quarter, we grew at a rate of 19%. Each of our segments contributed to these increases versus the prior year. Though Infotainment was particularly strong and grew 35% versus last year. While there is certainly a good deal of sustainable growth in these numbers, we also benefited from some pent-up demand following the production disruption, caused by the tsunami earthquake in Japan. This quarter also included a short-term capture of some business from a competitor, who was not able to meet demand during the quarter.
Moving on to the gross margin; our first quarter was 27.5%, up 80 basis point from last year’s 26.7%. All of the gross margin improvement came from our Infotainment business, where we increased gross margin by more than 500 basis points. This was a result of a range of productivity improvement, which has lowered our cost base. The impact of these initiatives was also amplified as a result of high level of sales growth in the quarter increasing the leverage effect. As Dinesh talked about earlier, gross margin in our other two segments; Professional and Lifestyle came under significant pressure from high cost of neodymium magnets. This has a net impact of $8 million or 270 basis points for the Lifestyle Division and $1 million or 70 basis points for the Professional Division. We will continue to work to minimize the impact of this on our profitability, and as Dinesh noted, we will update you on our neodymium actions and financial projections during the Analyst Investor Day next Wednesday. 
Let's move onto the SG&A area, where we can inform you that our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was very good. We added $32 million in cost to achieve the $240 million of sales growth. The STEP Change program has really helped instill ongoing cost discipline in organization and become much more efficient; organization has become much more efficient I should say. And combined with the strong revenue growth, our [push play] efficiency enabled us to reduce our expenses by 170 basis points to 20.3%. As a result of the gross margin increase and the SG&A expense rate decrease, our operating margin improved quite nicely, growing to 7.3% from the 4.8% of last year.
Now moving onto the net income for the quarter; we reported $49 million or $0.69 per share compared to net income of $25 million or $0.35 per share in the prior year's quarter. And I'll note that effective tax quality rate was 23.6%. Our cash and cash equivalent balance decreased by $231 million in the quarter, while still bringing our total liquidity to $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. The major items impacted the cash during the quarter was increased net operating capital of $182 million, which we needed to support higher sales, the acquisition of the MWM, which was about $70 million, and of course we have foreign currency translation reduction of $56 million. I would like to point out as a percent of annualized sales however, our net operating capital was reduced by 170 basis point compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
Now just to remind you, we do have a disciplined process for deploying our capital and we will continue to evaluate alternatives. What is - it is an organic growth investment and acquisition or a share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities, such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, where long-term returns are the most promising. We believe as we saw with the Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in United States that strategic acquisitions can accelerate and complement this strategy. In addition, we do remain committed to provide in those sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders and our Board of Directors continues to evaluate share buyback opportunities along other strategic options. 
As I noted when I begin, this was a strong start to the new fiscal year for Harman and our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at both the top and bottom line. We maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and as a result, remain in position to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. Now, just briefly, I’d like to note that in addition to our quality results, we provided a full year’s work of quarterly financial data for our new segments as part of our press release. This should help you to better understand the business as we are now running it. With that said, operator, we are now ready to take your questions."

And this does have, you heard me say in my prepared comments that we have flexible and scalable manufacturing, and this is exactly that example. We can crank it up to add almost 100% more capacity without incurring any significant capital, because we have got flexible workforce, flexible cell mechanisms to move things around. Then it comes to China, we have two brand new facilities. They well have actually started pilot production, but full production should start by end of this month or beginning November. One facility is dedicated to our infotainment and audio business, predominantly audio. So BMW, Audi, I mean, Mercedes and Toyota, Hyundai, all of that production for Asia part would have start to come from that factory soon. That's going to be a very good leverage for us from the cost point of view. Then second factory is dedicated to our professional business. The pro business is growing so much in Asia; it doesn't make sense to shift products around from either our facilities here in the United States or from Mexico. So between these 3 factories and existing plants in Hungary, which is a very large production hub for us and Germany and United States, we have tremendous capacity, which we can turn up if we want to without incurring any significant CapEx. I mean, a pretty good position we feel that we have built flexible production increase in our footprint. And also from the cost base point of view, we have 60% of our workforce for blue collar manufacturing is in best-cost countries, 40% in high-cost. And as growth continues in the direction we are driving, I think you will see lot more manufacturing leverage to come, because we will load more capacity in these BCC plants of Hungary, China, Mexico, Brazil and other places."

What we are taking it that means you can upload and download some of the feature applications in the system without bringing it to dealer or in a massive upgrade of the hard disk, which used to be the case. So that's a very positive for the next consumers those who come and buy these cars, they can take away and then without worrying about that their infotainment system would be antiquated in two years or one-year time. So they will have online apps related to infotainment, related to connectivity, related to multimedia and whole host of other point of interest and a smart information like Aha Mobile. Aha Radio allows content aggregation from the social media and bring it. So all of those features it’s an engine we have put in and of course, now as consumers get more mature with this technology they will be downloading more and we will monetize."
