With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions.For the qua",540,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2011 results. With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions.
For the quarter ending February 28, 2011, total revenue was $938 million, an 8.8% increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Earnings per share were $0.41 versus $0.32 a year ago. 
As provided in our press release, we are updating our guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011. We now expect total revenues to be between $3.75 billion and $3.77 billion, and our total earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.63. This guidance takes into consideration our expectation that energy costs will pressure margins in our fourth quarter. We will not be providing guidance for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2012, until we release our fourth quarter 2011 results in mid-July. 
We are pleased to see continuing improvement in our revenues among all four of our reportable segments. As mentioned in our release, we ramped up the investment in our sales force in the last year's third quarter, because we saw signs of stabilization in the U.S. economy. We also expected a slow employment recovery. And we wanted to create revenue momentum by not only increasing our sales force, but also by having the sales force focused on added penetration at existing customers. As we look one year later, we are pleased with the momentum created and with the improvement in our sales productivity. This improved sales productivity, coupled with the stabilization of the economy, have now given Cintas four consecutive quarters of increasing total and organical revenue growth beginning with our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter.
While we continue to see a general reluctance on the part of our customers to add employees, on a positive note, they continue to replace employees and large workforce reductions are minimal. The higher revenue levels, along with ongoing cost control efforts at Cintas, have helped drive margin improvement despite the higher energy costs and the fewer workdays in our third quarter than the prior two quarters this fiscal year. These recent energy costs increases, if they continue, will pressure margins going forward. While not significantly affecting this fiscal year, continued elevated cotton costs could impact fiscal year 2012 results. We will discuss this impact further during our discussion of fiscal 2012 guidance in July.
Our balance sheet remains strong. Total net debt to capitalization is 25%. In December, we paid our annual dividend of $0.49 per share, the 28th consecutive year in which the dividend was increased dating back to 1983, the year we went public.

260725,128418354,112196,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2011",2011-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 64 in the third quarter, and there will be 66 in the fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal 20",1578,"Thank you, Bill. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 64 in the third quarter, and there will be 66 in the fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 5.5%. We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. 
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Rental revenue was $665 million for the quarter, which is up 6.8% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 4.3% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 1.9%. As mentioned earlier, our sales productivity continued to improve this quarter both in new business opportunities and in customer penetration. We have also seen our account retention improve.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $102.6 million represents an increase of 8.7% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was also 8.7%.
Our growth in this segment continued to be broad-based in which we saw rental catalog revenue, national account revenue and lodging, hospitality and gaming revenue increase nicely.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and services of First Aid products, Safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $91.2 million, an increase of 15.1% versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 9.3%, up from the second quarter organic growth rate of 8.4%. Sales productivity has continued to improve and customer spending in this space has also picked up.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 20.3% over last year's third quarter to $79.1 million with organic growth of 77.8%. Recycled paper prices remained at relatively high levels. However, we have now anniversary-ed the high paper prices. The Document Management growth rate in total now more closely resembles the impact of new customers and higher customer volume levels.
Moving on to margins. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.8%, which is in line with last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.7%. Energy-related costs were up 10 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The gross margin of 41.8% increased slightly compared to the 41.7% gross margin for the second quarter despite having one less workday in the third quarter and despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related costs compared to the second quarter. Sequentially through this third quarter, our energy-related costs did increase to fairly high levels by the end of the quarter. After being at 3% in our first two quarters this fiscal year, our third quarter energy-related costs as a percent of revenue were 3.4% and reached as high as 3.6% during the quarter. As Bill mentioned, these costs could continue to run at high levels and could negatively impact our fourth quarter earnings. The updated guidance in our press release considered this impact.
Rental gross margin of 42.8% was up 10 basis points from last year's third quarter. Material cost has increased due to the injection of new garments during this fiscal year. The injection of new garments has increased due to our higher new business levels including many new Carhartt and Flame Resistant clothing accounts. This higher material cost is more than offset though by lower production and service costs as a percent of revenue due to improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes. The rental gross margin of 42.8% was also an increase from the 42.6% in our second fiscal quarter. This improvement comes despite one less workday in the third quarter and an increase of 30 basis points in energy-related costs. As just mentioned, material cost increases were more than offset by improved capacity utilization due to higher volumes.
Other services gross margin was 39.3% for the quarter as compared to 39.2% in last year's third quarter. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection gross margin improved significantly due to a better mix of higher-margin revenue and improved capacity utilization. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was relatively flat compared to last year. And Document Management Services gross margin decreased from 52.7% in last year's third quarter to 49.4% in this year's third quarter. This decrease is mainly due to our U.S.-based Storage and Imaging business. Our Storage business had several greenfield starts this fiscal year. While these startups are operating as planned, they do generate losses in the first year of a operations. In addition, our Imaging Services business, which is primarily a project-based business began ramping up for several large fourth quarter projects. And finally, energy-related costs in this business segment increased 65 basis points compared to last year.
Selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter was 30.2% of revenue, a decrease from 32% in last year's third quarter and also a decrease from 30.8% in this year's second fiscal quarter. As we discussed, our sales force productivity has improved over the course of the past year since we increased our investment in last year's third quarter. In addition, we continue to look for ways of controlling administrative expenses. As a result, our third quarter selling and administrative expenses have only increased 2.7% year-over-year while our revenue has grown 8.8%.
Our effective tax rate was 38.9% for the quarter compared to 32.8% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $217 million at February 28, a decrease of $68 million from November 30, 2010. This decrease is mainly due to the $72 million payment of our annual dividend in December. Accounts receivable increased by $14 million since November 30, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as of November 30. 
New goods inventory at February 28 was $232 million, up $24 million from November 30.  We converted our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter, and that conversion has gone as planned. In anticipation of this conversion, we intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We expect the added inventory related to this conversion to burn off over the next six months.
Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $9 million from November 30 to February 28 due to the higher volume levels throughout the third quarter. Accrued liabilities decreased $101 million compared to November 30 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend, which was paid on December 15 and decreased accrued bond interest. Long-term debt at February 28 was $808 million. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%; while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization, was 19%.
Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $99 million for the third quarter, a decrease from $135 million in last year's third quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The third quarter cash provided by operating activities of $99 million was an increase over the second quarter's $74 million.
CapEx for the third quarter was $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $33 million in rental; $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $6 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $14 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. 
We invested $70 million in the third quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes acquisitions in our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment, our Document Management operating segment and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions.For the qua",541,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2011 results. With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions.
For the quarter ending February 28, 2011, total revenue was $938 million, an 8.8% increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Earnings per share were $0.41 versus $0.32 a year ago. 
As provided in our press release, we are updating our guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011. We now expect total revenues to be between $3.75 billion and $3.77 billion, and our total earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.63. This guidance takes into consideration our expectation that energy costs will pressure margins in our fourth quarter. We will not be providing guidance for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2012, until we release our fourth quarter 2011 results in mid-July. 
We are pleased to see continuing improvement in our revenues among all four of our reportable segments. As mentioned in our release, we ramped up the investment in our sales force in last year's third quarter because we saw signs of stabilization in the U.S. economy. We also expected a slow employment recovery. And we wanted to create revenue momentum by not only increasing our sales force, but also by having the sales force focus on added penetration at existing customers. As we look one year later, we are pleased with the momentum created and with the improvement in our sales productivity. This improved sales productivity, coupled with the stabilization of the economy, have now given Cintas four consecutive quarters of increasing total and organic revenue growth beginning with our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter.
While we continue to see a general reluctance on the part of our customers to add employees, on a positive note, they continue to replace employees and large force -- workforce reductions are minimal. The higher revenue levels, along with ongoing cost control efforts at Cintas, have helped drive margin improvement despite the higher energy costs and the fewer workdays in our third quarter than the prior two quarters this fiscal year. These recent energy cost increases, if they continue, will pressure margins going forward. While not significantly affecting this fiscal year, continued elevated cotton costs could impact fiscal year 2012 results. We will discuss this impact further during our discussion of fiscal 2012 guidance in July.
Our balance sheet remains strong. Total net debt to capitalization is 25%. In December, we paid our annual dividend of $0.49 per share, the 28th consecutive year in which the dividend was increased dating back to 1983, the year we went public.

260725,128418354,112241,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2011",2011-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 64 in the third quarter and there will be 66 in the fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal 201",1579,"Thank you, Bill. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 64 in the third quarter and there will be 66 in the fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 5.5%. We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Rental revenue was $665 million for the quarter, which is up 6.8% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 4.3% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 1.9%. As mentioned earlier, our sales productivity continued to improve this quarter, both in new business opportunities and in customer penetration. We have also seen our account retention improve.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $102.6 million represents an increase of 8.7% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was also 8.7%.
Our growth in this segment continued to be broad-based in which we saw rental catalog revenue, national account revenue, and lodging, hospitality and gaming revenue increase nicely.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $91.2 million, an increase of 15.1% versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 9.3%, up from the second quarter organic growth rate of 8.4%. Sales productivity has continued to improve and customer spending in this space has also picked up.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased to 20.3% over last year's third quarter to $79.1 million with organic growth of 7.8%. Recycled paper prices remained at relatively high levels. However, we have now anniversaried the high paper prices. The Document Management growth rate in total now more closely resembles the impact of new customers and higher customer volume levels.
Moving on to margins. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.8%, which is in line with last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.7%. Energy-related costs were up 10 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The gross margin of 41.8% increased slightly compared to the 41.7% gross margin for the second quarter despite having one less workday in the third quarter and despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related costs compared to the second quarter. Sequentially through this third quarter, our energy-related costs did increase to fairly high levels by the end of the quarter. After being at 3% in our first two quarters this fiscal year, our third quarter energy-related costs as a percent of revenue were 3.4% and reached as high as 3.6% during the quarter. As Bill mentioned, these costs could continue to run at high levels and could negatively impact our fourth quarter earnings. The updated guidance in our press release considered this impact.
Rental gross margin of 42.8% was up 10 basis points from last year's third quarter. Material cost has increased due to the injection of new garments during this fiscal year. The injection of new garments has increased due to our higher new business levels including many new Carhartt and Flame Resistant Clothing accounts. This higher material cost is more than offset though by lower production and service costs as a percent of revenue due to improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes. The rental gross margin of 42.8% was also an increase from the 42.6% in our second fiscal quarter. This improvement comes despite one less workday in the third quarter and an increase of 30 basis points in energy-related costs. As just mentioned, material cost increases were more than offset by improved capacity utilization due to higher volumes.
Other services gross margin was 39.3% for the quarter as compared to 39.2% in last year's third quarter. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection gross margin improved significantly due to a better mix of higher-margin revenue and improved capacity utilization. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was relatively flat compared to last year. And Document Management Services gross margin decreased from 52.7% in last year's third quarter to 49.4% in this year's third quarter. This decrease is mainly due to our U.S.-based storage and imaging business. Our storage business had several greenfield starts this fiscal year. While these startups are operating as planned, they do generate losses in the first year of operation. In addition, our imaging services business, which is primarily a project-based business, began ramping up for several large fourth quarter projects. And finally, energy-related costs in this business segment increased 65 basis points compared to last year.
Selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 30.2% of revenue, a decrease from 32% in last year's third quarter and also a decrease from the 30.8% in this year's second fiscal quarter. As we discussed, our sales force productivity has improved over the course of the past year since we increased our investment in last year's third quarter. In addition, we continue to look for ways of controlling administrative expenses. As a result, our third quarter selling and administrative expenses have only increased 2.7% year-over-year, while our revenue has grown 8.8%.
Our effective tax rate was 38.9% for the quarter compared to 32.8% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $217 million at February 28, a decrease of $68 million from November 30, 2010. This decrease is mainly due to the $72 million payment of our annual dividend in December. Accounts receivable increased by $14 million since November 30, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at November 30. 
New goods inventory at February 28 was $232 million, up $24 million from November 30.  We converted our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter, and that conversion has gone as planned. In anticipation of this conversion, we intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We expect the added inventory related to this conversion to burn off over the next six months.
Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $9 million from November 30 to February 28 due to the higher volume levels throughout the third quarter. Accrued liabilities decreased $101 million compared to November 30 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend, which was paid on December 15, and decreased accrued bond interest. 
Long-term debt at February 28 was $808 million. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization, was 19%.
Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $99 million for the third quarter, a decrease from $135 million in last year's third quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The third quarter cash provided by operating activities of $99 million was an increase over the second quarter's $74 million.
CapEx for the third quarter was $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $33 million in Rental; $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $6 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $14 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. 
We invested $70 million in the third quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes acquisitions in our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment, our Document Management operating segment and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions.
For the quarter ending February 28, 2011, total revenue was $938 million, an 8.8% increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Earnings per share were $0.41 versus $0.32 a year ago. 
As provided in our press release, we are updating our guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011. We now expect total revenues to be between $3.75 billion and $3.77 billion, and our total earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.63. This guidance takes into consideration our expectation that energy costs will pressure margins in our fourth quarter. We will not be providing guidance for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2012, until we release our fourth quarter 2011 results in mid-July. 
We are pleased to see continuing improvement in our revenues among all four of our reportable segments. As mentioned in our release, we ramped up the investment in our sales force in last year's third quarter because we saw signs of stabilization in the U.S. economy. We also expected a slow employment recovery. And we wanted to create revenue momentum by not only increasing our sales force, but also by having the sales force focus on added penetration at existing customers. As we look one year later, we are pleased with the momentum created and with the improvement in our sales productivity. This improved sales productivity, coupled with the stabilization of the economy, have now given Cintas four consecutive quarters of increasing total and organic revenue growth beginning with our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter.
While we continue to see a general reluctance on the part of our customers to add employees, on a positive note, they continue to replace employees and large force -- workforce reductions are minimal. The higher revenue levels, along with ongoing cost control efforts at Cintas, have helped drive margin improvement despite the higher energy costs and the fewer workdays in our third quarter than the prior two quarters this fiscal year. These recent energy cost increases, if they continue, will pressure margins going forward. While not significantly affecting this fiscal year, continued elevated cotton costs could impact fiscal year 2012 results. We will discuss this impact further during our discussion of fiscal 2012 guidance in July.
Our balance sheet remains strong. Total net debt to capitalization is 25%. In December, we paid our annual dividend of $0.49 per share, the 28th consecutive year in which the dividend was increased dating back to 1983, the year we went public.

260725,128418354,112315,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2011",2011-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 64 in the third quarter and there will be 66 in the fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal 201",1578,"Thank you, Bill. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 64 in the third quarter and there will be 66 in the fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 5.5%. We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Rental revenue was $665 million for the quarter, which is up 6.8% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 4.3% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 1.9%. As mentioned earlier, our sales productivity continued to improve this quarter, both in new business opportunities and in customer penetration. We have also seen our account retention improve.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $102.6 million represents an increase of 8.7% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was also 8.7%.
Our growth in this segment continued to be broad-based in which we saw rental catalog revenue, national account revenue, and lodging, hospitality and gaming revenue increase nicely.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety products and training and Fire Protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $91.2 million, an increase of 15.1% versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 9.3%, up from the second quarter organic growth rate of 8.4%. Sales productivity has continued to improve and customer spending in this space has also picked up.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased to 20.3% over last year's third quarter to $79.1 million with organic growth of 7.8%. Recycled paper prices remained at relatively high levels. However, we have now anniversaried the high paper prices. The Document Management growth rate in total now more closely resembles the impact of new customers and higher customer volume levels.
Moving on to margins. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.8%, which is in line with last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.7%. Energy-related costs were up 10 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The gross margin of 41.8% increased slightly compared to the 41.7% gross margin for the second quarter despite having one less workday in the third quarter and despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related costs compared to the second quarter. Sequentially through this third quarter, our energy-related costs did increase to fairly high levels by the end of the quarter. After being at 3% in our first two quarters this fiscal year, our third quarter energy-related costs as a percent of revenue were 3.4% and reached as high as 3.6% during the quarter. As Bill mentioned, these costs could continue to run at high levels and could negatively impact our fourth quarter earnings. The updated guidance in our press release considered this impact.
Rental gross margin of 42.8% was up 10 basis points from last year's third quarter. Material cost has increased due to the injection of new garments during this fiscal year. The injection of new garments has increased due to our higher new business levels including many new Carhartt and Flame Resistant Clothing accounts. This higher material cost is more than offset though by lower production and service costs as a percent of revenue due to improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes. The rental gross margin of 42.8% was also an increase from the 42.6% in our second fiscal quarter. This improvement comes despite one less workday in the third quarter and an increase of 30 basis points in energy-related costs. As just mentioned, material cost increases were more than offset by improved capacity utilization due to higher volumes.
Other services gross margin was 39.3% for the quarter as compared to 39.2% in last year's third quarter. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection gross margin improved significantly due to a better mix of higher-margin revenue and improved capacity utilization. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was relatively flat compared to last year. And Document Management Services gross margin decreased from 52.7% in last year's third quarter to 49.4% in this year's third quarter. This decrease is mainly due to our U.S.-based storage and imaging business. Our storage business had several greenfield starts this fiscal year. While these startups are operating as planned, they do generate losses in the first year of operation. In addition, our imaging services business, which is primarily a project-based business, began ramping up for several large fourth quarter projects. And finally, energy-related costs in this business segment increased 65 basis points compared to last year.
Selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 30.2% of revenue, a decrease from 32% in last year's third quarter and also a decrease from 30.8% in this year's second fiscal quarter. As we discussed, our sales force productivity has improved over the course of the past year since we increased our investment in last year's third quarter. In addition, we continue to look for ways of controlling administrative expenses. As a result, our third quarter selling and administrative expenses have only increased 2.7% year-over-year, while our revenue has grown 8.8%.
Our effective tax rate was 38.9% for the quarter compared to 32.8% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $217 million at February 28, a decrease of $68 million from November 30, 2010. This decrease is mainly due to the $72 million payment of our annual dividend in December. Accounts receivable increased by $14 million since November 30, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at November 30. 
New goods inventory at February 28 was $232 million, up $24 million from November 30.  We converted our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter, and that conversion has gone as planned. In anticipation of this conversion, we intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We expect the added inventory related to this conversion to burn off over the next six months.
Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $9 million from November 30 to February 28 due to the higher volume levels throughout the third quarter. Accrued liabilities decreased $101 million compared to November 30 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend, which was paid on December 15, and decreased accrued bond interest. 
Long-term debt at February 28 was $808 million. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization, was 19%.
Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $99 million for the third quarter, a decrease from $135 million in last year's third quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The third quarter cash provided by operating activities of $99 million was an increase over the second quarter's $74 million.
CapEx for the third quarter was $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $33 million in Rental; $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $6 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $14 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. 
We invested $70 million in the third quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes acquisitions in our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment, our Document Management operating segment and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
We are pleased to report that our revenue for the fourth quarter grew 11.3% from last year's fourth quarter to a record revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 27.6% to $70.8 million, and earnings per share were $0.49, a 36% increase over last year. As noted in the release, total year revenue of over $3.8 billion was 7.4% higher than last year, and total earnings per share of $1.68 was 20% higher. Stabilization of revenue at existing customers, excellent new business results and cost control measures, as well as improved productivity within our organization were all factors in these very good results. We want to express our sincere appreciation to all of our employees, who we call our partners, for their contribution to this successful year.
On May 18, we issued $500 million of public debt spread in 2 tranches, $250 million worth of 5-year maturity and the other at 10 years. We found the rates to be very attractive, and demand was strong for our bonds. Given the price of our stock and the positive outlook for our company's performance, our Board of Directors authorized management to use these funds to pay our short-term debt and to purchase Cintas stock under parameters established by the board. The $500 million expenditure resulted in total purchases of 15.8 million shares, of which 7.7 million shares were purchased as of May 31 and the remaining 8.1 million shares were purchased between June 1 and July 6. Coupled with the share purchases made earlier in fiscal 2011, Cintas purchased 23.4 million shares since last July. The impact of the share purchases in fiscal 2011 added about $0.05 to our earnings per share but what we would have reported with no share purchases.
Our guidance for fiscal 2012 revenue is to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share to be the range of $1.97 to $2.05. This guidance incorporates the impact of the recently completed $500 million share buyback program, which equates to about $0.12 a share when also factoring in the additional interest expense from the debt offering in May.
Let me address some assumptions used in developing this guidance. While recent economic news, including the Bureau of Labor announcements for May and June were not as bright as we would like, we expect that the North American economy and employment picture will moderately improve in the next 12 months. We expect that we and other companies and industries in which we operate could face input cost headwinds in the next 12 months, particularly related to cotton, energy and oil-related products, such as polyester. These raising input costs will add negative pressure to our industries cost. While this will create some margin pressure for Cintas and our competitors, we expect the margin pressure will also ease the extremely aggressive pricing environment that we have experienced over the last several years.
More specifically, for our guidance, we have assumed that energy-related cost would continue at our fourth quarter level of 3.5% of sales. This was the highest level we have seen since our fiscal 2009. As many of you know, the price of cotton significantly increased last fall and has remained at relatively high levels but has declined significantly in recent months. Many factors contribute to the effect that cotton has on Cintas, certainly the price of cotton, but also Cintas' fabric inventory, as well as finished goods inventory levels, sourcing decisions and manufacturing lead times, as well as amortization periods of in-service inventory and the overall uniform industry pricing environment. We have been managing and analyzing each of these areas that minimize the impact on our results. We expect that the fiscal 2012 impact will be less than $15 million on our cost of rentals and other services, and as mentioned, this impact is incorporated into our guidance. Due to the amortizing of in-service inventory, the carbon impact could be heavier in our fiscal 2013 by an amount around $5 million. However, as noted, many factors contribute to the cotton impact, and we will continue to monitor and analyze this throughout fiscal 2012.
We also believe that the improved environment will lead us to be able to obtain higher prices for our services.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hanson for more details on the fourth quarter."

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 11.3% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 8%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.8%, which is up from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.4%. Before providing you with details about Cintas' fourth quarter performance, please note there were 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter, for a total of 262 workdays in fiscal 2012.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also include restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.
Within rental, based in our fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 51% of the revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 20%. Hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning was 12%. Shop towel revenue was 6%. And Indian and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 11%. 
Rental revenue was $711.9 million for the quarter, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.2% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 4.3%. Sales productivity particularly as it relates to new accounts continued to be strong, and our new business sold during the fourth quarter was up over 20% compared to last year's fourth quarter.
We are pleased with the increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. During the fourth quarter, we noted no significant changes in the pricing environment, although pricing at contract renewal and for large national accounts remain very competitive. As Bill noted though, we expect the current input cost pressures faced by competitors and us to result in some easing of the pricing pressures and, in fact, will likely lead us and our competitors to increased prices in the coming fiscal year.
Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points than last year. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related cost and higher material costs due to the injection of in-service inventory associated with new accounts. While we are pleased with our new account performance and increases in wearers, we have yet to see impactful hiring within existing customers. The add-on wearers associated with hiring and existing customers, allows us to take advantage of our stock of inventories.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including product sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. 
Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $109.9 million represents an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.7%. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.9% for the fourth quarter, which is relatively consistent with last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 31% and an improvement from the third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The improvement from the third quarter is primarily due to better capacity utilization at our distribution centers due to the higher volumes.
Our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $99.6 million, an increase of 13.4% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9.7%. We are pleased with the revenue momentum in this business as organic growth for the last 3 quarters has been 8.4%, 9.3% and 9.7%. Sales productivity particularly in the First Aid and safety side continues to be strong in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was a 41.7% for the fourth quarter, a very solid improvement over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 39.4%. This improvement was equally strong in both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection Services, and was largely due to better capacity utilization due to higher volumes. The improvement also came despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related costs compared to last year.
Our Document Management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 9% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Within Document Management, the European business accounted for 13% of total segment revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 29.5% over last year's fourth quarter to $91.6 million with organic growth of 16.5%. Recycled paper prices increased throughout the quarter and contributed to the organic growth rate. Excluding recycled paper revenue, organic growth was 11.3% during the fourth quarter. Because the recycled paper prices are so high, pricing for service has been very competitive. Document Management's gross margin for the fourth quarter was 51.4%, a decrease from last year's 53%. Energy-related costs increased by 60 basis points compared to last year. In addition, our Storage business had several greenfield starts earlier this fiscal year. These startups are running as planned but do have a drag on overall gross margin in the early stages. The fourth quarter gross margin of 51.4% is an improvement over the 49.4% in this year's third quarter.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. The fourth quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.1% of revenue, a decrease from 31.5% in last year's fourth quarter. As expected, our selling expenses continue to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to greater productivity. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. Our effective tax rate was 39.5% for the quarter compared to 38.2% last year. For the full fiscal year 2011, our effective tax rate was 37.1%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 37.3%.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $525.3 million at May 31. As mentioned in the press release, keep in mind that $259.9 million was used in June and July to purchase shares of Cintas stock. Accounts receivable increased by $12.8 million since February 28, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 42, up from 40 at February 28, but the same as at May 31, 2010. New goods inventory at May 31 was $249.7 million, up $17.4 million from February 28. This increase is mainly due to higher demand levels particularly in our Carhartt program, our Flame Resistant Clothing line and our womenswear. The SAP system has been performing as expected, but we also took a more cautious approach to our inventory level during the quarter to ensure that all of our customer needs were met. We expect to see inventory levels decrease in fiscal 2012.
Uniforms and other rental items and service increased by $19.8 million from February 28 to May 31 due to the higher volume levels throughout the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, our improved sales productivity, particularly related to new accounts, has driven the higher injection of in-service inventory. Accrued liabilities increased $22 million compared to February 28 due to $12 million of accrued bond interest and $9 million of accrued profit sharing, which build throughout the fiscal year. Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt was 2x fiscal '11 EBITDA, and as a percentage of the total book capitalization was 36%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 25%. As discussed, $259.5 million of cash and marketable securities was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock in June and July.  If we would have completed the share buybacks by May 31, our debt to capitalization would've been 39%, while the net debt to capitalization would have been 33%. 
Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $132.9 million, which is consistent with the $132.4 million from last year's fourth quarter. The growing revenue this year has resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory levels compared to last year. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $40.3 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $25.2 million in rental, slightly less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $4.2 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection and $10.1 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be relatively consistent with the fiscal 2011 and in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
You may notice that our cash flow statement shows proceeds from issuance of debt of slightly over $1 billion and repayment of debt of $502 million. Keep in mind that accounting guidance requires us to separately show the ins and outs of commercial paper activity. The net of the 2 figures is the $500 million, which represents the financing that we completed in May. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
We are pleased to report that our revenue for the fourth quarter grew 11.3% from last year's fourth quarter to a record revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 27.6% to $70.8 million, and the earnings per share were $0.49, a 36% increase over last year. As noted in the release, total year revenue of over $3.8 billion was 7.4% higher than last year, and total earnings per share of $1.68 was 20% higher. Stabilization of revenue at existing customers, excellent new business results and cost control measures, as well as improved productivity within our organization were all factors in these very good results. We want to express our sincere appreciation to all of our employees, who we call our partners, for their contribution to this successful year.
On May 18, we issued $500 million of public debt, spread in 2 tranches, $250 million with a 5-year maturity and the other at 10 years. We found the rates to be very attractive, and demand was strong for our bonds. Given the price of our stock and the positive outlook for our company's performance, our Board of Directors authorized management to use these funds to pay our short-term debt and to purchase Cintas stock under parameters established by the board. The $500 million expenditure resulted in total purchases of 15.8 million shares, of which 7.7 million shares were purchased as of May 31, and the remaining 8.1 million shares were purchased between June 1 and July 6. Coupled with the share purchases made earlier in fiscal 2011, Cintas purchased 23.4 million shares since last July. The impact of the share purchases in fiscal 2011 added about $0.05 to our earnings per share from what we would have reported with no share purchases.
Our guidance for fiscal 2012 revenue is to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. This guidance incorporates the impact of the recently completed $500 million share buyback program, which equates to about $0.12 a share, when also factoring in the additional interest expense from the debt offering in May.
Let me address some assumptions used in developing this guidance. While recent economic news, including the Bureau of Labor announcements for May and June were not as bright as we would like, we expect that the North American economy and employment picture will moderately improve in the next 12 months. We expect that we and the other companies in industries in which we operate could face input cost headwinds in the next 12 months, particularly related to cotton, energy and oil-related products, such as polyester. These rising input costs will add negative pressure to our industries  cost. While this will create some margin pressure for Cintas and our competitors, we expect the margin pressure will also ease the extremely aggressive pricing environment that we have experienced over the last several years.
More specifically, for our guidance, we have assumed that energy-related cost would continue at our fourth quarter level of 3.5% of sales. This was the highest level we have seen since our fiscal 2009. As many of you know, the price of cotton significantly increased last fall and has remained at relatively high levels but has declined significantly in recent months. Many factors contribute to the effect that cotton has on Cintas, certainly the price of cotton, but also Cintas' fabric inventory, as well as finished goods inventory levels, sourcing decisions and manufacturing lead times, as well as amortization periods of in-service inventory and the overall uniform industry pricing environment. We have been managing and analyzing each of these areas to minimize the impact on our results. We expect that the fiscal 2012 impact will be less than $15 million on our cost of rentals and other services, and as mentioned, this impact is incorporated into our guidance. Due to the amortizing effect of in-service inventory, the cotton impact could be heavier in our fiscal 2013 by an amount around $5 million. However, as noted, many factors contribute to the cotton impact, and we will continue to monitor and analyze this throughout fiscal 2012.
We also believe that the improved environment will lead us to being able to obtain higher prices for our services.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the fourth quarter."

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 11.3% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 8%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.8%, which is up from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.4%. Before providing you with details about Cintas' fourth quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter, for a total of 262 workdays in fiscal 2012.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also include restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.
Within rental, based on our fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 51% of the revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 20%. Hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning was 12%. Shop towel revenue was 6%. And linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 11%. 
Rental revenue was $711.9 million for the quarter, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.2% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 4.3%. Sales rep productivity particularly as it relates to new accounts continued to be strong, and our new business sold during the fourth quarter was up over 20% compared to last year's fourth quarter.
We are pleased with the increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. During the fourth quarter, we noted no significant changes in the pricing environment, although pricing at contract renewal and for large national accounts remained very competitive. As Bill noted though, we expect the current input cost pressures faced by competitors and us to result in some easing of the pricing pressures and in fact, will likely lead us and our competitors to increase prices in the coming fiscal year.
Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points higher than last year. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs due to the injection of in-service inventory associated with new accounts. While we are pleased with our new account performance and increases in wearers, we have yet to see impactful hiring within existing customers. The add-on wearers associated with hiring at existing customers, allows us to take advantage of our stockroom inventories.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including product sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. 
Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.7%. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.9% for the fourth quarter, which is relatively consistent with last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 31%, and an improvement from the third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The improvement from the third quarter is primarily due to better capacity utilization at our distribution centers due to the higher volumes.
Our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $99.6 million, an increase of 13.4% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9.7%. We are pleased with the revenue momentum in this business as organic growth for the last 3 quarters has been 8.4%, 9.3% and 9.7%. Sales rep productivity particularly in the First Aid and Safety side continues to be strong in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 41.7% for the fourth quarter, a very solid improvement over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 39.4%. This improvement was equally strong in both First Aid and Safety and in Fire Protection Services, and was largely due to better capacity utilization due to higher volumes. The improvement also came despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related costs compared to last year.
Our Document Management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 9% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Within Document Management, the European business accounted for 13% of total segment revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 29.5% over last year's fourth quarter to $91.6 million with organic growth of 16.5%. Recycled paper prices increased throughout the quarter and contributed to the organic growth rate. Excluding recycled paper revenue, organic growth was 11.3% during the fourth quarter. Because the recycled paper prices are so high, pricing for service has been very competitive. 
Document Management's gross margin for the fourth quarter was 51.4%, a decrease from last year's 53%. Energy-related costs increased by 60 basis points compared to last year. In addition, our Storage business had several greenfield starts earlier this fiscal year. These startups are running as planned but do have a drag on overall gross margins in the early stages. The fourth quarter gross margin of 51.4% is an improvement over the 49.4% in this year's third quarter.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. The fourth quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.1% of revenue, a decrease from 31.5% in last year's fourth quarter. As expected, our selling expenses continue to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to greater rep productivity. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. Our effective tax rate was 39.5% for the quarter compared to 38.2% last year. For the full fiscal 2011 year, our effective tax rate was 37.1%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 37.3%.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $525.3 million at May 31. As mentioned in the press release, keep in mind that $259.9 million was used in June and July to purchase shares of Cintas stock. Accounts receivable increased by $12.8 million since February 28, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 42, up from 40 at February 28, but the same as at May 31, 2010. New goods inventory at May 31 was $249.7 million, up $17.4 million from February 28. This increase is mainly due to higher demand levels particularly in our Carhartt program, our Flame Resistant Clothing line and our womenswear. The SAP system has been performing as expected, but we also took a more cautious approach to our inventory level during the quarter to ensure that all of our customer needs were met. We expect to see inventory levels decrease in fiscal 2012.
Uniforms and other rental items in-service increased by $19.8 million from February 28 to May 31 due to the higher volume levels throughout the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, our improved sales productivity, particularly related to new accounts, has driven the higher injection of in-service inventory. Accrued liabilities increased $22 million compared to February 28 due to $12 million of accrued bond interest and $9 million of accrued profit sharing, which build throughout the fiscal year. Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt was 2x fiscal '11 EBITDA, and as a percentage of total book capitalization was 36%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 25%. As discussed, $259.5 million of cash and marketable securities was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock in June and July.  If we would have completed the share buybacks by May 31, our debt to capitalization would've been 39%, while the net debt to capitalization would have been 33%. 
Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $132.9 million, which is consistent with the $132.4 million from last year's fourth quarter. The growing revenue this year has resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory levels compared to last year. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $40.3 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $25.2 million in rental, slightly less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $4.2 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection and $10.1 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be relatively consistent with fiscal 2011 and in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
You may notice that our cash flow statement shows proceeds from issuance of debt of slightly over $1 billion and repayment of debt of $502 million. Keep in mind that accounting guidance requires us to separately show the ins and outs of commercial paper activity. The net of the 2 figures is the $500 million, which represents the financing that we completed in May. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
We are pleased to report that our revenue for the fourth quarter grew 11.3% from last year's fourth quarter to a record revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 27.6% to $70.8 million, and the earnings per share were $0.49, a 36% increase over last year. As noted in the release, total year revenue of over $3.8 billion was 7.4% higher than last year, and total earnings per share of $1.68 was 20% higher. Stabilization of revenue at existing customers, excellent new business results and cost control measures, as well as improved productivity within our organization, were all factors in these very good results. We want to express our sincere appreciation to all of our employees, who we call our partners, for their contribution to this successful year.
On May 18, we issued $500 million of public debt spread in 2 tranches, $250 million with a 5-year maturity and the other at 10 years. We found the rates to be very attractive, and demand was strong for our bonds. Given the price of our stock and the positive outlook for our company's performance, our Board of Directors authorized management to use these funds to pay off short-term debt and to purchase Cintas stock under parameters established by the board. The $500 million expenditure resulted in total purchases of 15.8 million shares, of which 7.7 million shares were purchased as of May 31, and the remaining 8.1 million shares were purchased between June 1 and July 6. Coupled with the share purchases made earlier in fiscal 2011, Cintas purchased 23.4 million shares since last July. The impact of the share purchases in fiscal 2011 added about $0.05 to our earnings per share from what we would have reported with no share purchases.
Our guidance for fiscal 2012 revenue is to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. This guidance incorporates the impact of the recently completed $500 million share buyback program, which equates to about $0.12 a share, when also factoring in the additional interest expense from the debt offering in May.
Let me address some assumptions used in developing this guidance. While recent economic news, including the Bureau of Labor announcements for May and June were not as bright as we would like, we expect that the North American economy and employment picture will moderately improve in the next 12 months. We expect that we and the other companies in industries in which we operate could face input cost headwinds in the next 12 months, particularly related to cotton, energy and oil-related products, such as polyester. These rising input costs will add negative pressure to our industry's cost. While this will create some margin pressure for Cintas and our competitors, we expect the margin pressure will also ease the extremely aggressive pricing environment that we have experienced over the last several years.
More specifically, for our guidance, we have assumed that energy-related cost would continue at our fourth quarter level of 3.5% of sales. This was the highest level we have seen since our fiscal 2009. As many of you know, the price of cotton significantly increased last fall and has remained at relatively high levels but has declined significantly in recent months. Many factors contribute to the effect that cotton has on Cintas, certainly the price of cotton, but also Cintas' fabric inventory, as well as finished goods inventory levels, sourcing decisions and manufacturing lead times, as well as amortization periods of in-service inventory and the overall uniform industry pricing environment. We have been managing and analyzing each of these areas to minimize the impact on our results. We expect that the fiscal 2012 impact will be less than $15 million on our cost of rentals and other services, and as mentioned, this impact is incorporated into our guidance. Due to the amortizing effect of in-service inventory, the cotton impact could be heavier in our fiscal 2013 by an amount around $5 million. However, as noted, many factors contribute to the cotton impact, and we will continue to monitor and analyze this throughout fiscal 2012.
We also believe that the improved environment will lead us to being able to obtain higher prices for our services.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the fourth quarter."

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 11.3% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 8%.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 11.3% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 8%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.8%, which is up from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.4%. Before providing you with details about Cintas' fourth quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter, for a total of 262 workdays in fiscal 2012.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.
Within rental, based on our fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 51% of the revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 20%. Hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning was 12%. Shop towel revenue was 6%. And linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 11%. 
Rental revenue was $711.9 million for the quarter, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.2% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 4.3%. Sales rep productivity, particularly as it relates to new accounts, continued to be strong, and our new business sold during the fourth quarter was up over 20% compared to last year's fourth quarter.
We are pleased with the increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. During the fourth quarter, we noted no significant changes in the pricing environment, although pricing at contract renewal and for large national accounts remained very competitive. As Bill noted though, we expect the current input cost pressures faced by competitors and us to result in some easing of the pricing pressures and in fact, will likely lead us and our competitors to increase prices in the coming fiscal year.
Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points higher than last year. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs due to the injection of in-service inventory associated with new accounts. While we are pleased with our new account performance and increases in wearers, we have yet to see impactful hiring within existing customers. The add-on wearers associated with hiring at existing customers allows us to take advantage of our stockroom inventories.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. 
Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.7%. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.9% for the fourth quarter, which is relatively consistent with last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 31%, and an improvement from the third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The improvement from the third quarter is primarily due to better capacity utilization at our distribution centers due to the higher volumes.
Our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $99.6 million, an increase of 13.4% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9.7%. We are pleased with the revenue momentum in this business as organic growth for the last 3 quarters has been 8.4%, 9.3% and 9.7%. Sales rep productivity, particularly in the First Aid and Safety side, continued to be strong in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 41.7% for the fourth quarter, a very solid improvement over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 39.4%. This improvement was equally strong in both First Aid and Safety and in Fire Protection Services, and was largely due to better capacity utilization due to higher volumes. The improvement also came despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related cost compared to last year.
Our Document Management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 9% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Within Document Management, the European business accounted for 13% of total segment revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 29.5% over last year's fourth quarter to $91.6 million with organic growth of 16.5%. Recycled paper prices increased throughout the quarter and contributed to the organic growth rate. Excluding recycled paper revenue, organic growth was 11.3% during the fourth quarter. Because the recycled paper prices are so high, pricing for service has been very competitive. 
Document Management's gross margin for the fourth quarter was 51.4%, a decrease from last year's 53%. Energy-related costs increased by 60 basis points compared to last year. In addition, our Storage business had several greenfield starts earlier this fiscal year. These startups are running as planned but do have a drag on overall gross margins in the early stages. The fourth quarter gross margin of 51.4% is an improvement over the 49.4% in this year's third quarter.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. The fourth quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.1% of revenue, a decrease from 31.5% in last year's fourth quarter. As expected, our selling expenses continue to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to greater rep productivity. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. Our effective tax rate was 39.5% for the quarter compared to 38.2% last year. For the full fiscal 2011 year, our effective tax rate was 37.1%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 37.3%.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $525.3 million at May 31. As mentioned in the press release, keep in mind that $259.9 million was used in June and July to purchase shares of Cintas stock. Accounts receivable increased by $12.8 million since February 28, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 42, up from 40 at February 28, but the same as at May 31, 2010. New goods inventory at May 31 was $249.7 million, up $17.4 million from February 28. This increase is mainly due to higher demand levels, particularly in our Carhartt program, our Flame Resistant Clothing line and our womenswear. The SAP system has been performing as expected, but we also took a more cautious approach to our inventory levels during the quarter to ensure that all of our customer needs were met. We expect to see inventory levels decrease in fiscal 2012.
Uniforms and other rental items in-service increased by $19.8 million from February 28 to May 31 due to the higher volume levels throughout the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, our improved sales productivity, particularly related to new accounts, has driven the higher injection of in-service inventory. Accrued liabilities increased $22 million compared to February 28 due to $12 million of accrued bond interest and $9 million of accrued profit sharing, which build throughout the fiscal year. Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt was 2x fiscal '11 EBITDA, and as a percentage of total book capitalization was 36%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 25%. As discussed, $259.5 million of cash and marketable securities was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock in June and July.  If we would have completed the share buybacks by May 31, our debt to capitalization would've been 39%, while the net debt to capitalization would have been 33%. 
Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $132.9 million, which is consistent with the $132.4 million from last year's fourth quarter. The growing revenue this year has resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory levels compared to last year. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $40.3 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $25.2 million in Rental, slightly less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $4.2 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection and $10.1 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be relatively consistent with fiscal 2011 and in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
You may notice that our cash flow statement shows proceeds from issuance of debt of slightly over $1 billion and repayment of debt of $502 million. Keep in mind that accounting guidance requires us to separately show the ins and outs of commercial paper activity. The net of the 2 figures is the $500 million, which represents the financing that we completed in May. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

Secondly, we've got the prospects being more willing to take on the new program. Third, I would say that our lost business rates have improved from what we were seeing in late fiscal '09 and '10.

260725,140442968,169462,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 22, 2011",2011-09-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you for joining us this evening to report our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. We are pleased to report",413,"Thank you for joining us this evening to report our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
We are pleased to report that our first quarter revenue grew 10.1% from last year's first quarter to a record revenue of $1,017,000,000. It was also our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Net income increased by 12% to $68.6 million and earnings per share were $0.52, a 30% increase over last year. 
As noted in the release, we are particularly pleased with the expansion of our operating margin compared to last year's first quarter. Despite increases in energy-related costs and garment material costs, our operating margin improved from 10.9% in last year's first quarter to 12.6% this year. 
We continue to focus on selling profitable business, controlling our costs and improving the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives have allowed us to improve our overall gross margin by 60 basis points over last year's first quarter, more than offsetting the headwinds of higher energy-related costs and commodity costs, and to improve our SG&A by 130 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. 
Looking forward, we reiterate our guidance for fiscal 2012, which includes revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. While we continue to be encouraged by our results, we are cautious about the state of the U.S. economy. We have now seen 4 consecutive months of employment growth under 100,000 per month. We have also seen numerous 2011 and 2012 economic forecasts being revised downward, which have generally resulted in lower employment expectations for those years.  While we have not yet seen a significant change in our business due to the state of the economy, we do, however, remain cautious.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 10.1% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.6%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 43.2%, which is up from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.6% despite a 50-basis-point increase in energy-related costs. 
Before providing you with details about our first quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in the fiscal 2012 year are 262. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management Services. Uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $719.4 million for the quarter, which is up 9.4% compared to last year's first quarter and up 7.3% organically over last year. We continue to be pleased with our increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. Our new business and customer adds through the quarter were not quite as robust as in our fourth quarter. We did, however, begin to see some easing of the pricing environment during the quarter, as expected, most likely due to the input costs headwinds facing our industry. 
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.9% for the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points over last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.5%. This was despite an increase of 40 basis points in energy-related costs. The first quarter's gross margin was a 30-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 gross margin of 43.6%. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs. Obviously, we did not see any impactful hiring at current customers during the quarter that would allow us to take advantage of existing stockroom inventories. 
Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $101.7 million represents an increase of 3% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 3%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings. Last year's first quarter, uniform direct sales revenue benefited from more of these and was a very strong quarter.  Uniform direct sales gross margin was 28.6% for the first quarter, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 30.3% and fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. These decreases are primarily due to some cotton impact on garment costs, higher freight costs on shipment from our distribution centers and higher energy-related costs associated with our rental catalog service. 
Our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $103.7 million, an increase of 10.9% versus last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 7.9%.  This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the first quarter compared to 40.9% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher this year compared to last year. More than offsetting the higher energy-related costs was improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on our routes. The first quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was also an improvement over the 41.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Again, higher volumes helped with capacity utilization. 
Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 9% of first quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 24.7% over last year's first quarter to $92.3 million, with organic growth of 15.9%. Recycled paper prices continued to be at historically high levels and contributed positively to the segment's organic growth. Document management's gross margin for the first quarter was 53.2%, the same as last year's first quarter. However, energy-related costs were 80 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. Offsetting these higher costs were improvements in the efficiency of both facilities and routes, mainly due to higher volumes. The first quarter gross margin of 53.2% was also better than the 51.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. First quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.5% of revenue, a decrease from 31.8% in last year's first quarter. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and greater rep productivity than a year ago. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased, due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. The SG&A of 30.5% of revenue was slightly higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of 30.1%, primarily due to higher bad debt expense in the first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 38.5% for the quarter compared to 30.8% last year. Keep in mind that last year's first quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37.3%. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $277 million at August 31. This is down from the $525.3 million at May 31, but $259.5 million of that balance was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock during June and July. Accounts receivable increased by $10 million since May 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, down slightly from 42 at May 31, but the same as of August 31 of last year. New goods inventory at August 31 was $280.2 million, up $30.6 million from May 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing right line and some build for fall seasonal wear. We expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012. Accrued liabilities decreased $17.3 million compared to May 31 due to the timing of bond interest payments and the payment of fiscal 2011 profit-sharing accruals. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1 of 2012. Our current expectation is to pay off this maturity with cash. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 38%; while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities, as a percentage of total capitalization was 32%. 
Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $56.6 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $35.3 million. CapEx for the first quarter was $44.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $28.2 million in rental; $1.1 million in uniform direct sales; $4.8 million in first aid safety and fire protection; and $10.3 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

One of the issues you run into often in the storage acquisition is that the seller is selling because he doesn't want to invest in the additional capacity he needs to continue to grow. So one of the first things that happens, it typically is that when you buy a storage operation, you've got to invest a lot of capital right away in order to continue to grow. This tends to drive down the price we're willing to pay for the operations because we want to demand certain return on our investment. So I think that, that has been part of the issue. The other part of the issue, or the other part of the strategy that Cintas has had, is that we believe there's an awful lot of core competencies that we have at route-based businesses that we can apply and have applied to the shredding business. So we look at that as a better return for our shareholders. It's a business that has grown very, very nicely both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. And so that's why our focus has continued to be more in the shredding side because of the returns and the growth potential."

One is we still have capacity in our facilities that we can leverage off of. But even more importantly, I would say, is the opportunities that still exist at some point for increased volume at existing customers. Much of our growth over the last several quarters has come from new business as opposed to growth in existing customers. And as we've talked in numerous occasions, when you can get a customer to add an employee, which at this point we haven't really seen yet, that is very profitable business and that would contribute to margin expansion. So hopefully at one, at some point here in the not-too-distant future, we'll begin to see customers increasing the size of the workforce. At least, what we've seen for the last year has been that they are maintaining their workforces. So the next step will be when confidence comes into the economy, these businesses will start increasing, and we will see additional profitability from those wearers."

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. We are pleased to report",413,"Thank you for joining us this evening to report our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
We are pleased to report that our first quarter revenue grew 10.1% from last year's first quarter to a record revenue of $1,017,000,000. It was also our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Net income increased by 12% to $68.6 million, and earnings per share were $0.52, a 30% increase over last year. 
As noted in the release, we are particularly pleased with the expansion of our operating margin compared to last year's first quarter. Despite increases in energy-related costs and garment material costs, our operating margin improved from 10.9% in last year's first quarter to 12.6% this year. 
We continue to focus on selling profitable business, controlling our costs and improving the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives have allowed us to improve our overall gross margin by 60 basis points over last year's first quarter, more than offsetting the headwinds of higher energy-related costs and commodity costs, and to improve our SG&A by 130 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. 
Looking forward, we reiterate our guidance for fiscal 2012, which includes revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. While we continue to be encouraged by our results, we are cautious about the state of the U.S. economy. We have now seen 4 consecutive months of employment growth under 100,000 per month. We have also seen numerous 2011 and 2012 economic forecasts being revised downward, which have generally resulted in lower employment expectations for those years.  While we have not yet seen a significant change in our business due to the state of the economy, we do, however, remain cautious.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 10.1% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.6%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 43.2%, which is up from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.6% despite a 50-basis-point increase in energy-related costs. 
Before providing you with details about our first quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in the fiscal 2012 year are 262. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. 
The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $719.4 million for the quarter, which is up 9.4% compared to last year's first quarter and up 7.3% organically over last year. 
We continue to be pleased with our increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. Our new business and customer adds through the quarter were not quite as robust as in our fourth quarter. We did, however, begin to see some easing of the pricing environment during the quarter as expected, most likely due to the input costs headwinds facing our industry. 
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.9% for the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points over last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.5%. This was despite an increase of 40 basis points in energy-related costs. The first quarter's gross margin was a 30-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 gross margin of 43.6%. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs. Obviously, we did not see any impact from hiring at current customers during the quarter that would allow us to take advantage of existing stockroom inventories. 
Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. 
First quarter revenue of $101.7 million represents an increase of 3% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 3%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings. Last year's first quarter, uniform direct sales revenue benefited from more of these and was a very strong quarter.  
Uniform direct sales gross margin was 28.6% for the first quarter, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 30.3% and fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. These decreases are primarily due to some cotton impact on garment costs, higher freight costs on shipment from our distribution centers and higher energy-related costs associated with our rental catalog service. 
Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $103.7 million, an increase of 10.9% versus last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 7.9%. 
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the first quarter compared to 40.9% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher this year compared to last year. More than offsetting the higher energy-related costs was improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on our routes. The first quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was also an improvement over the 41.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Again, higher volumes helped with capacity utilization. 
Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 9% of first quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 24.7% over last year's first quarter to $92.3 million, with organic growth of 15.9%. Recycled paper prices continued to be at historically high levels and contributed positively to the segment's organic growth. 
Document management's gross margin for the first quarter was 53.2%, the same as last year's first quarter. However, energy-related costs were 80 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. Offsetting these higher costs were improvements in the efficiency of both facilities and routes, mainly due to higher volumes. The first quarter gross margin of 53.2% was also better than the 51.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. First quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.5% of revenue, a decrease from 31.8% in last year's first quarter. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and greater rep productivity than a year ago. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. The SG&A of 30.5% of revenue was slightly higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of 30.1%, primarily due to higher bad debt expense in the first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 38.5% for the quarter compared to 30.8% last year. Keep in mind that last year's first quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37.3%. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $277 million at August 31. This is down from the $525.3 million at May 31, but $259.5 million of that balance was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock during June and July. Accounts receivable increased by $10 million since May 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, down slightly from 42 at May 31, but the same as at August 31 of last year. 
New goods inventory at August 31 was $280.2 million, up $30.6 million from May 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, and some build for fall seasonal wear. We expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Accrued liabilities decreased $17.3 million compared to May 31 due to the timing of bond interest payments and the payment of fiscal 2011 profit-sharing accruals. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1 of 2012. Our current expectation is to pay off this maturity with cash. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 38%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities, as a percentage of total capitalization was 32%. 
Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $56.6 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $35.3 million. CapEx for the first quarter was $44.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $28.2 million in rental; $1.1 million in uniform direct sales; $4.8 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $10.3 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

One of the issues you run into often in the storage acquisition is that the seller is selling because he doesn't want to invest in the additional capacity he needs to continue to grow. So one of the first things that happens typically is that when you buy a storage operation, you've got to invest a lot of capital right away in order to continue to grow. This tends to drive down the price we're willing to pay for the operation because we want to demand a certain return on our investment. So I think that, that has been part of the issue. The other part of the issue or the other part of the strategy that Cintas has had, is that we believe there's an awful lot of core competency that we have at route-based businesses that we can apply and have applied to the shredding business. So we look at that as a better return for our shareholders. It's a business that has grown very, very nicely both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. And so that's why our focus has continued to be more in the shredding side because of the returns and the growth potential."

One is we still have capacity in our facilities that we can leverage off of. But even more importantly, I would say, is the opportunities that still exist at some point for increased volume at existing customers. Much of our growth over the last several quarters has come from new business as opposed to growth in existing customers. And as we've talked on numerous occasions, when you can get a customer to add an employee, which at this point we haven't really seen yet, that is very profitable business and that would contribute to margin expansion. So hopefully at one -- at some point here in the not-too-distant future we'll begin to see customers increasing the size of the workforce at least. What we've seen for the last year has been that they're maintaining their workforces. So the next step would be when confidence comes into the economy, these businesses will start increasing, and we'll see additional profitability from those wearers."

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. We are pleased to report",413,"Thank you for joining us this evening to report our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
We are pleased to report that our first quarter revenue grew 10.1% from last year's first quarter to a record revenue of $1,017,000,000. It was also our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Net income increased by 12% to $68.6 million, and earnings per share were $0.52, a 30% increase over last year. 
As noted in the release, we are particularly pleased with the expansion of our operating margin compared to last year's first quarter. Despite increases in energy-related costs and garment material costs, our operating margin improved from 10.9% in last year's first quarter to 12.6% this year. 
We continue to focus on selling profitable business, controlling our costs and improving the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives have allowed us to improve our overall gross margin by 60 basis points over last year's first quarter, more than offsetting the headwinds of higher energy-related costs and commodity costs, and to improve our SG&A by 130 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. 
Looking forward, we reiterate our guidance for fiscal 2012, which includes revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. While we continue to be encouraged by our results, we are cautious about the state of the U.S. economy. We have now seen 4 consecutive months of employment growth under 100,000 per month. We have also seen numerous 2011 and 2012 economic forecasts being revised downward, which have generally resulted in lower employment expectations for those years.  While we have not yet seen a significant change in our business due to the state of the economy, we do, however, remain cautious.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 10.1% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.6%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 43.2%, which is up from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.6% despite a 50-basis-point increase in energy-related costs. 
Before providing you with details about our first quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in the fiscal 2012 year are 262. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. 
The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $719.4 million for the quarter, which is up 9.4% compared to last year's first quarter and up 7.3% organically over last year. 
We continue to be pleased with our increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. Our new business and customer adds through the quarter were not quite as robust as in our fourth quarter. We did, however, begin to see some easing of the pricing environment during the quarter as expected, most likely due to the input costs headwinds facing our industry. 
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.9% for the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points over last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.5%. This was despite an increase of 40 basis points in energy-related costs. The first quarter's gross margin was a 30-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 gross margin of 43.6%. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs. Obviously, we did not see any impact from hiring at current customers during the quarter that would allow us to take advantage of existing stockroom inventories. 
Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. 
First quarter revenue of $101.7 million represents an increase of 3% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 3%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings. Last year's first quarter, uniform direct sales revenue benefited from more of these and was a very strong quarter.  
Uniform direct sales gross margin was 28.6% for the first quarter, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 30.3% and fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. These decreases are primarily due to some cotton impact on garment costs, higher freight costs on shipment from our distribution centers and higher energy-related costs associated with our rental catalog service. 
Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $103.7 million, an increase of 10.9% versus last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 7.9%. 
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the first quarter compared to 40.9% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher this year compared to last year. More than offsetting the higher energy-related costs was improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on our routes. The first quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was also an improvement over the 41.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Again, higher volumes helped with capacity utilization. 
Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 9% of first quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 24.7% over last year's first quarter to $92.3 million, with organic growth of 15.9%. Recycled paper prices continued to be at historically high levels and contributed positively to the segment's organic growth. 
Document management's gross margin for the first quarter was 53.2%, the same as last year's first quarter. However, energy-related costs were 80 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. Offsetting these higher costs were improvements in the efficiency of both facilities and routes, mainly due to higher volumes. The first quarter gross margin of 53.2% was also better than the 51.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. First quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.5% of revenue, a decrease from 31.8% in last year's first quarter. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and greater rep productivity than a year ago. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. The SG&A of 30.5% of revenue was slightly higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of 30.1%, primarily due to higher bad debt expense in the first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 38.5% for the quarter compared to 30.8% last year. Keep in mind that last year's first quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37.3%. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $277 million at August 31. This is down from the $525.3 million at May 31, but $259.5 million of that balance was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock during June and July. Accounts receivable increased by $10 million since May 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, down slightly from 42 at May 31, but the same as at August 31 of last year. 
New goods inventory at August 31 was $280.2 million, up $30.6 million from May 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, and some build for fall seasonal wear. We expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Accrued liabilities decreased $17.3 million compared to May 31 due to the timing of bond interest payments and the payment of fiscal 2011 profit-sharing accruals. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1 of 2012. Our current expectation is to pay off this maturity with cash. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 38%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities, as a percentage of total capitalization was 32%. 
Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $56.6 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $35.3 million. CapEx for the first quarter was $44.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $28.2 million in rental; $1.1 million in uniform direct sales; $4.8 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $10.3 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

One of the issues you run into often in a storage acquisition is that the seller is selling because he doesn't want to invest in the additional capacity he needs to continue to grow. So one of the first things that happens, typically, is that when you buy a storage operation, you've got to invest a lot of capital right away in order to continue to grow. This tends to drive down the price we're willing to pay for the operation because we want to demand a certain return on our investment. So I think that, that has been part of the issue. The other part of the issue, or the other part of the strategy that Cintas has had, is that we believe there's an awful lot of core competency that we have and route-based businesses that we can apply and have applied to the shredding business. So we look at that as a better return for our shareholders. It's a business that has grown very, very nicely, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. And so that's why our focus has continued to be more in the shredding side, because of the returns and the growth potential."

One is we still have capacity in our facilities that we can leverage off of. But even more importantly, I would say, is the opportunities that still exist at some point for increased volume at existing customers. Much of our growth over the last several quarters has come from new business as opposed to growth in existing customers. And as we've talked on numerous occasions, when you can get a customer to add an employee, which at this point we haven't really seen yet, that is very profitable business and that would contribute to margin expansion. So hopefully at one -- at some point here in the not-too-distant future we'll begin to see customers increasing the sizes of the workforce. At least what we've seen for the last year has been that they're maintaining their workforces. So the next step would be when confidence comes into the economy, these businesses will start increasing, and we'll see additional profitability from those wearers."

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. We are pleased to report",413,"Thank you for joining us this evening to report our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
We are pleased to report that our first quarter revenue grew 10.1% from last year's first quarter to a record revenue of $1,017,000,000. It was also our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Net income increased by 12% to $68.6 million, and earnings per share were $0.52, a 30% increase over last year. 
As noted in the release, we are particularly pleased with the expansion of our operating margin compared to last year's first quarter. Despite increases in energy-related costs and garment material costs, our operating margin improved from 10.9% in last year's first quarter to 12.6% this year. 
We continue to focus on selling profitable business, controlling our costs and improving the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives have allowed us to improve our overall gross margin by 60 basis points over last year's first quarter, more than offsetting the headwinds of higher energy-related costs and commodity costs, and to improve our SG&A by 130 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. 
Looking forward, we reiterate our guidance for fiscal 2012, which includes revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. While we continue to be encouraged by our results, we are cautious about the state of the U.S. economy. We have now seen 4 consecutive months of employment growth under 100,000 per month. We have also seen numerous 2011 and 2012 economic forecasts being revised downward, which have generally resulted in lower employment expectations for those years.  While we have not yet seen a significant change in our business due to the state of the economy, we do, however, remain cautious.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 10.1% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.6%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 43.2%, which is up from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.6% despite a 50-basis-point increase in energy-related costs. 
Before providing you with details about our first quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in the fiscal 2012 year are 262. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. 
The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $719.4 million for the quarter, which is up 9.4% compared to last year's first quarter and up 7.3% organically over last year. 
We continue to be pleased with our increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. Our new business and customer adds through the quarter were not quite as robust as in our fourth quarter. We did, however, begin to see some easing of the pricing environment during the quarter as expected, most likely due to the input costs headwinds facing our industry. 
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.9% for the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points over last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.5%. This was despite an increase of 40 basis points in energy-related costs. The first quarter's gross margin was a 30-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 gross margin of 43.6%. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs. Obviously, we did not see any impact from hiring at current customers during the quarter that would allow us to take advantage of existing stockroom inventories. 
Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. 
First quarter revenue of $101.7 million represents an increase of 3% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 3%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings. Last year's first quarter, uniform direct sales revenue benefited from more of these and was a very strong quarter.  
Uniform direct sales gross margin was 28.6% for the first quarter, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 30.3% and fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. These decreases are primarily due to some cotton impact on garment costs, higher freight costs on shipment from our distribution centers and higher energy-related costs associated with our rental catalog service. 
Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $103.7 million, an increase of 10.9% versus last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 7.9%. 
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the first quarter compared to 40.9% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher this year compared to last year. More than offsetting the higher energy-related costs was improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on our routes. The first quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was also an improvement over the 41.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Again, higher volumes helped with capacity utilization. 
Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 9% of first quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 24.7% over last year's first quarter to $92.3 million, with organic growth of 15.9%. Recycled paper prices continued to be at historically high levels and contributed positively to the segment's organic growth. 
Document management's gross margin for the first quarter was 53.2%, the same as last year's first quarter. However, energy-related costs were 80 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. Offsetting these higher costs were improvements in the efficiency of both facilities and routes, mainly due to higher volumes. The first quarter gross margin of 53.2% was also better than the 51.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. 
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. First quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.5% of revenue, a decrease from 31.8% in last year's first quarter. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and greater rep productivity than a year ago. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. The SG&A of 30.5% of revenue was slightly higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of 30.1%, primarily due to higher bad debt expense in the first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 38.5% for the quarter compared to 30.8% last year. Keep in mind that last year's first quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37.3%. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $277 million at August 31. This is down from the $525.3 million at May 31, but $259.5 million of that balance was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock during June and July. Accounts receivable increased by $10 million since May 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, down slightly from 42 at May 31, but the same as at August 31 of last year. 
New goods inventory at August 31 was $280.2 million, up $30.6 million from May 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, and some build for fall seasonal wear. We expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Accrued liabilities decreased $17.3 million compared to May 31 due to the timing of bond interest payments and the payment of fiscal 2011 profit-sharing accruals. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1 of 2012. Our current expectation is to pay off this maturity with cash. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 38%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities, as a percentage of total capitalization was 32%. 
Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $56.6 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $35.3 million. CapEx for the first quarter was $44.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $28.2 million in rental; $1.1 million in uniform direct sales; $4.8 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $10.3 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

One of the issues you run into often in a storage acquisition is that the seller is selling because he doesn't want to invest in the additional capacity he needs to continue to grow. So one of the first things that happens, typically, is that when you buy a storage operation, you've got to invest a lot of capital right away in order to continue to grow. This tends to drive down the price we're willing to pay for the operation because we want to demand a certain return on our investment. So I think that, that has been part of the issue. The other part of the issue, or the other part of the strategy that Cintas has had, is that we believe there's an awful lot of core competency that we have and route-based businesses that we can apply and have applied to the shredding business. So we look at that as a better return for our shareholders. It's a business that has grown very, very nicely, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. And so that's why our focus has continued to be more in the shredding side, because of the returns and the growth potential."

One is we still have capacity in our facilities that we can leverage off of. But even more importantly, I would say, is the opportunities that still exist at some point for increased volume at existing customers. Much of our growth over the last several quarters has come from new business as opposed to growth in existing customers. And as we've talked on numerous occasions, when you can get a customer to add an employee, which at this point we haven't really seen yet, that is very profitable business and that would contribute to margin expansion. So hopefully at one -- at some point here in the not-too-distant future we'll begin to see customers increasing the sizes of the workforce. At least what we've seen for the last year has been that they're maintaining their workforces. So the next step would be when confidence comes into the economy, these businesses will start increasing, and we'll see additional profitability from those wearers."

Because in the rental business, of course, we're amortizing that over a longer period of time. So the high cotton prices that we were experiencing in the fall have pretty much entered the product cost. We have a mix in the distribution centers. But they have entered and they come in much quicker on the direct sale business. So I'd say you're probably not going to see it getting worse in direct sales, and we'll start to hopefully offset a little bit of that too with higher pricing going forward."

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions.We are pleased to r",457,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us to report our Second Quarter Results for Fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions.
We are pleased to report that our second quarter revenue grew 8.8% from last year's second quarter to a record revenue of $1,019,000,000. Net income increased by 33.1% to $74.4 million, and earnings per share were $0.57, a 50% increase over last year.
Our operating margin continued to expand as our second quarter operating margin of 13% was an improvement over both last year's second quarter operating margin of 10.9% and this year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. This improvement came despite significantly lower recycled paper prices. This margin expansion continues to be driven by better capacity utilization, our focus on selling profitable business and controlling our costs, particularly in our general and administrative area.
At our last earnings call in mid-September, we spoke of our cautiousness towards the U.S. economy. Only about 100,000 jobs have been created during our first fiscal quarter, and 2011 and 2012 economic forecast were worsening while the stock market was declining. 
Despite our strong first quarter results, we were uncertain about how our business would be affected by the macro environment. Obviously, given this backdrop heading into our second quarter, we have been very pleased to see that our business continued to be strong throughout this quarter. While we continue to be cautious regarding the U.S. economy, we do have more confidence about our ability to execute in this less than robust environment. As a result, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of $4.075 billion to $4.125 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.16 to $2.20.
This guidance assumes no significant changes in the U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, assumes recycled paper prices to be approximately $150 per ton, which is our price for November and December, and energy related cost to be approximately 3.5% of revenue.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on our second quarter."
260725,144457328,203052,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2011",2011-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the second quarter of last year while total company organic growth was 7%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 42.2%, which is up from last year's second quarter gross",1634,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the second quarter of last year while total company organic growth was 7%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 42.2%, which is up from last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.7% despite a 20 basis point increase in energy-related costs and a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.
Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, we will have 65 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2012 are 262.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, house and other related items. This segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued for our rental business. Second quarter rental revenue was $722.8 million, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's second quarter, and up 7.9% organically over last year.
The organic growth rate of 7.9% for the second quarter is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth rate of 7.3% and a very good improvement over last year's second quarter organic growth rate of 1.9%. All areas of our rental business grew in the second quarter. The less aggressive pricing environment that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter.
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.2% for the second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.6%. Energy-related costs, as a percent of revenue, were consistent with last year's second quarter. Capacity utilization from higher volumes was the main driver of the improvement. The second quarter gross margin of 43.2% was slightly lower than the first quarter gross margin of 43.9%, but keep in mind that our second quarter had 1 one less work day than the first quarter. As a result, we have 1 less revenue day to cover costs that are expense on a monthly schedule such as material costs, depreciation and amortization. One last comment on the rental gross margin, the impact on cotton on material costs equaled our expectation.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter.
Second quarter revenue of $111.9 million represent an increase of 2.9% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was also 2.9%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.6% for the quarter, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.9%. The decrease is mainly due to the expected cotton impacts. The gross margin of 29.6% was an improvement over the first quarter gross margin of 28.6%, mainly due to higher volumes in the second quarter.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products and Training and Fire Protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued in this operating segment as he had another good quarter. Revenues were $101.7 million, an increase of 9% versus last year's second quarter. And organic growth was 7.8%.
This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the second quarter compared to 41.1% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points higher this year compared to last year. Improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on balance continue to drive the gross margin expansion. The second quarter is a gross margin of 43.1% was roughly consistent with the first quarter gross margin of 43.2%.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 7.9% over last year's second quarter with organic growth of 4.6%. As we mentioned in the press release, our second quarter Document Management business was adversely affected by 2 things: First, there was a steep decrease in recycled paper prices after experiencing a fairly long stretch of prices in excess of $200 per ton, the prices quickly dropped to $150 per ton during the quarter. Although the average paper price for the quarter was relatively consistent with last year's second quarter, it was 15% below the first quarter average. As a result, growth of Document Management revenue and operating income slowed when comparing sequentially. While it is difficult to predict this price for the second half of our fiscal year, our updated guidance assumes that prices will stay at $150 per ton.
The second item that adversely affected our Document Management results was the difficult economic environment in Europe. We experienced weakness in all locations of our European business. As a result, we turned the focus of our European business to rightsizing the organizations and improving operating margins. This resulted in added costs this quarter, which should provide benefit moving forward. Our European businesses revenue run rate continues to be about $40 million annually, and in this quarter, we operated at a loss. To give more perspective on the North American Document Management business, its organic growth for the second quarter was 7%. Its operating margin was 9.9%, which was a 70 basis points over last year's second quarter. The North American operating margin is lower than the first quarter operating margin due to the drop in the recycled paper prices.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. We are very pleased to see second quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses decrease to 29.2% of revenue. This is a decrease of 160 basis points from last year's second quarter of 30.8%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to ongoing cost control initiatives. Our efforts of controlling costs have allowed us to increase revenue by 8.8% while only increasing SG&A by 3.1%.
Our effective tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter compared to 38.3% last year. This year's second quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $338 million at November 30, up $61 million from the $277 million at August 31. While our Board of Directors approved a new $500 million share buyback authorization in October, we did not make any purchases under the program during the second quarter. Keep in mind that in early December, we made our annual dividend payment of $71 million and a semiannual bond interest payment of $25 million.
Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, which is the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $288 million, up $8 million from August 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, healthcare items and some build-for-winter seasonal wear. We continued to expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012.
Accrued liabilities increased $94 million compared to August 31, primarily due to the $71 million accrual of the annual dividend and accrual of bond interest payments. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt to EBITDA is 2x.
Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $119.4 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $73.9 million. In addition to higher net income, the rate of growth for working capital needs came down as we expected.
CapEx for the second quarter was $35.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $21 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $4.3 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9.5 million in Document Management.

And while we continue to be very disciplined with our pricing, with the competitive environment improving, which continued into this quarter, we saw a little bit of more pricing power. So that pricing has not returned to where it was, but it certainly has become more of a possibility of getting better pricing to what we were seeing a year or so ago. And I would say that's most pronounced in the rental business, and especially in the garment business because that was -- our garment competitors who were really driving prices down for a while."

I mean we're continuing to the work with various fabric suppliers and looking at alternatives, but nothing has really entered the chain yet. Keep in mind that the cotton prices, while they have come down this year, are still above historical levels. And while they are significantly below where they were last fall, all of that cotton that came into the supply chain last fall really didn't get into the garments and the distribution centers until the spring and now are really starting to be injected into the rental programs both for our competitors as well as ourselves. And as he said, we have some high cotton prices remain we do for a while because of the amortization and the period of time it takes for the cotton at the farm until it gets into the garment. The lower prices, if they are sustained, will certainly help lessen the impact of cotton into the future. But we are kind of stuck with those higher prices, at least through this fiscal year and into part of fiscal '13. And then, as I said, even the prices today are still above historical level. So they don't seem to be coming down as quickly as they did from fall to the first of the summer."

And so, the strategy we have is that they were really not going to be very aggressive for a period of time in Europe. We have to work with what we have, and that is what we are doing. We have not lost interest in Europe. We still think it's a very good market for the Document Management business. They have obviously have their economic issues over there, and we are taking appropriate action on those businesses to make sure that they will regain profitability and then, we can position ourselves for growth. Regarding your question on maintaining a cash balance, I don't think that will have anything to do with that for what it would look like for purposes of appealing to a bank or to financing. Most of our a financing will be public financings anyway. I think the whole use of cash, whether we use it for share repurchases, whether we use it for M&A, whether we do pay off of our debt is all going to be taken into consideration based on the environment, looking out what happens with our share price, what happens with our business. And we'll continue to assess that month by month as conditions warrant.

Our economists believe GDP is growing above 3% quarter to date and so expect 2% GDP growth going forward. So this is a very choppy macro environment. I'm just trying to understand, is your guidance just factoring in recent, as in just the past 2 months trends or slightly longer trends?"

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer.

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions.
We are pleased to report that our second quarter revenue grew 8.8% from last year's second quarter to a record revenue of $1,019,000,000. Net income increased by 33.1% to $74.4 million, and earnings per share were $0.57, a 50% increase over last year.
Our operating margin continued to expand as our second quarter operating margin of 13% was an improvement over both last year's second quarter operating margin of 10.9% and this year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. This improvement came despite significantly lower recycled paper prices. This margin expansion continues to be driven by better capacity utilization, our focus on selling profitable business and controlling our cost, particularly in our general and administrative area.
At our last earnings call in mid-September, we spoke of our cautiousness towards the U.S. economy. Only about 100,000 jobs have been created during our first fiscal quarter, and 2011 and 2012 economic forecast were worsening while the stock market was declining. 
Despite our strong first quarter results, we were uncertain about how our business would be affected by the macro environment. Obviously, given this backdrop heading into our second quarter, we have been very pleased to see that our business continued to be strong throughout this quarter. While we continue to be cautious regarding the U.S. economy, we do have more confidence about our ability to execute in this less than robust environment. As a result, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of $4.075 billion to $4.125 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.16 to $2.20.
This guidance assumes no significant changes in the U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, assumes recycled paper prices to be approximately $150 per ton, which is our price for November and December, and energy-related cost to be approximately 3.5% of revenue.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on our second quarter."
260725,144457328,203075,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2011",2011-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the second quarter of last year while total company organic growth was 7%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 42.2%, which is up from last year's second quarter gross",1630,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the second quarter of last year while total company organic growth was 7%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 42.2%, which is up from last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.7% despite a 20 basis-point increase in energy-related costs and a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.
Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, we will have 65 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2012 are 262.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. 
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mask, house and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued for our rental business. Second quarter rental revenue was $722.8 million, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's second quarter, and up 7.9% organically over last year.
The organic growth rate of 7.9% for the second quarter is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth rate of 7.3% and a very good improvement over last year's second quarter organic growth rate of 1.9%. All areas of our Rental business grew in the second quarter. The less-aggressive pricing environment that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter.
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.2% for the second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.6%. Energy-related costs, as a percent of revenue, were consistent with last year's second quarter. Capacity utilization from higher volumes was the main driver of the improvement. The second quarter gross margin of 43.2% was slightly lower than the first quarter gross margin of 43.9%, but keep in mind that our second quarter had 1 one less work day than the first quarter. As a result, we have 1 less revenue day to cover costs that are expense on a monthly schedule such as material cost, depreciation and amortization. One last comment on the rental gross margin, the impact of cotton on material costs equaled our expectation.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter.
Second quarter revenue of $111.9 million represent an increase of 2.9% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was also 2.9%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.6% for the quarter, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.9%. The decrease is mainly due to the expected cotton impacts. The gross margin of 29.6% was an improvement over the first quarter gross margin of 28.6%, mainly due to higher volumes in the second quarter.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products and Training and Fire Protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued in this operating segment as we had another good quarter. Revenues were $101.7 million, an increase of 9% versus last year's second quarter. And organic growth was 7.8%.
This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the second quarter compared to 41.1% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points higher this year compared to last year. Improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on balance continue to drive the gross margin expansion. The second quarter's gross margin of 43.1% was roughly consistent with the first quarter gross margin of 43.2%.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 7.9% over last year's second quarter with organic growth of 4.6%. As we mentioned in the press release, our second quarter Document Management business was adversely affected by 2 things: First, there was a steep decrease in recycled paper prices after experiencing a fairly long stretch of prices in excess of $200 per ton, the prices quickly dropped to $150 per ton during the quarter. Although the average paper price for the quarter was relatively consistent with last year's second quarter, it was 15% below the first quarter average. As a result, growth of Document Management revenue and operating income slowed when comparing sequentially. While it is difficult to predict this price for the second half of our fiscal year, our updated guidance assumes that prices will stay at $150 per ton.
The second item that adversely affected our Document Management results was the difficult economic environment in Europe. We experienced weakness in all locations of our European business. As a result, we turned the focus of our European business to rightsizing the organizations and improving operating margins. This resulted in added cost to this quarter, which should provide benefit moving forward. Our European businesses revenue run rate continues to be about $40 million annually, and in this quarter, we operated at a loss. To give more perspective on the North American Document Management business, its organic growth for the second quarter was 7%. Its operating margin was 9.9%, which was a 70 basis-point improvement over last year's second quarter. The North American operating margin is lower than the first quarter operating margin due to the drop in the recycled paper prices.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. We are very pleased to see second quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses decrease to 29.2% of revenue. This is a decrease of 160 basis points from last year's second quarter of 30.8%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to ongoing cost control initiatives. Our efforts of controlling costs have allowed us to increase revenue by 8.8% while only increasing SG&A by 3.1%.
Our effective tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter compared to 38.3% last year. This year's second quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $338 million at November 30, up $61 million from the $277 million at August 31. While our Board of Directors approved a new $500 million share buyback authorization in October, we did not make any purchases under the program during the second quarter. Keep in mind that in early December, we made our annual dividend payment of $71 million and a semiannual bond interest payment of $25 million.
Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, which is the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $288 million, up $8 million from August 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high-demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, healthcare items and some build-for-winter seasonal wear. We continue to expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012.
Accrued liabilities increased $94 million compared to August 31, primarily due to the $71 million accrual of the annual dividend and accrual of bond interest payments. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt to EBITDA is 2x.
Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $119.4 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $73.9 million. In addition to higher net income, the rate of growth for working capital needs came down as we expected.
CapEx for the second quarter was $35.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $21 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $4.3 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9.5 million in Document Management. We continue to expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

And as we said, you have high cotton prices remain with you for a while because of the amortization and the period of time it takes from the cotton at the farm until it gets into the garment.

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer.

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions.
We are pleased to report that our second quarter revenue grew 8.8% from last year's second quarter to a record revenue of $1,019,000,000. Net income increased by 33.1% to $74.4 million, and earnings per share were $0.57, a 50% increase over last year.
Our operating margin continued to expand as our second quarter operating margin of 13% was an improvement over both last year's second quarter operating margin of 10.9% and this year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. This improvement came despite significantly lower recycled paper prices. This margin expansion continues to be driven by better capacity utilization, our focus on selling profitable business and controlling our cost, particularly in our general and administrative area.
At our last earnings call in mid-September, we spoke of our cautiousness toward the U.S. economy. Only about 100,000 jobs have been created during our first fiscal quarter, and 2011 and 2012 economic forecast were worsening while the stock market was declining. Despite our strong first quarter results, we were uncertain about how our business would be affected by the macro environment. Obviously, given this backdrop heading into our second quarter, we have been very pleased to see that our business continued to be strong throughout this quarter. 
While we continue to be cautious regarding the U.S. economy, we do have more confidence about our ability to execute in this less than robust environment. As a result, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of $4.075 billion to $4.125 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.16 to $2.20. This guidance assumes no significant changes in the U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, assumes recycled paper prices to be approximately $150 per ton, which is our price for November and December, and energy-related cost to be approximately 3.5% of revenue.

260725,144457328,203112,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2011",2011-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the second quarter of last year while total company organic growth was 7%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 42.2%, which is up from last year's second quarter gross",1631,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the second quarter of last year while total company organic growth was 7%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 42.2%, which is up from last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.7% despite a 20 basis-point increase in energy-related costs and a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.
Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, we will have 65 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2012 are 262.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. 
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels [ph] and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued for our rental business. Second quarter rental revenue was $722.8 million, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's second quarter, and up 7.9% organically over last year.
The organic growth rate of 7.9% for the second quarter is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth rate of 7.3% and a very good improvement over last year's second quarter organic growth rate of 1.9%. All areas of our Rental business grew in the second quarter. The less-aggressive pricing environment that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter.
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.2% for the second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.6%. Energy-related costs, as a percent of revenue, were consistent with last year's second quarter. Capacity utilization from higher volumes was the main driver of the improvement. The second quarter gross margin of 43.2% was slightly lower than the first quarter gross margin of 43.9%, but keep in mind that our second quarter had 1 one less work day than the first quarter. As a result, we have 1 less revenue day to cover costs that are expensed on a monthly schedule such as material cost, depreciation and amortization. One last comment on the rental gross margin, the impact of cotton on material costs equaled our expectation.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter.
Second quarter revenue of $111.9 million represent an increase of 2.9% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was also 2.9%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.6% for the quarter, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.9%. The decrease is mainly due to the expected cotton impacts. The gross margin of 29.6% was an improvement over the first quarter gross margin of 28.6%, mainly due to higher volumes in the second quarter.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products and Training and Fire Protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued in this operating segment as we had another good quarter. Revenues were $101.7 million, an increase of 9% versus last year's second quarter. And organic growth was 7.8%.
This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the second quarter, compared to 41.1% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points higher this year compared to last year. Improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on routes continue to drive the gross margin expansion. The second quarter's gross margin of 43.1% was roughly consistent with the first quarter gross margin of 43.2%.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 7.9% over last year's second quarter with organic growth of 4.6%. As we mentioned in the press release, our second quarter Document Management business was adversely affected by 2 things: First, there was a steep decrease in recycled paper prices after experiencing a fairly long stretch of prices in excess of $200 per ton, the prices quickly dropped to $150 per ton during the quarter. Although the average paper price for the quarter was relatively consistent with last year's second quarter, it was 15% below the first quarter average. As a result, growth of Document Management revenue and operating income slowed when comparing sequentially. While it is difficult to predict this price for the second half of our fiscal year, our updated guidance assumes that prices will stay at $150 per ton.
The second item that adversely affected our Document Management results was the difficult economic environment in Europe. We experienced weakness in all locations of our European business. As a result, we turned the focus of our European business to rightsizing the organizations and improving operating margins. This resulted in added cost to this quarter, which should provide benefit moving forward. Our European businesses revenue run rate continues to be about $40 million annually, and in this quarter, we operated at a loss. To give more perspective on the North American Document Management business, its organic growth for the second quarter was 7%. Its operating margin was 9.9%, which was a 70 basis-point improvement over last year's second quarter. The North American operating margin is lower than the first quarter operating margin, due to the drop in the recycled paper prices.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses. We are very pleased to see second quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses decrease to 29.2% of revenue. This is a decrease of 160 basis points from last year's second quarter of 30.8%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased, due to ongoing cost control initiatives. Our efforts of controlling costs have allowed us to increase revenue by 8.8% while only increasing SG&A by 3.1%.
Our effective tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter compared to 38.3% last year. This year's second quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $338 million at November 30, up $61 million from the $277 million at August 31. While our Board of Directors approved a new $500 million share buyback authorization in October, we did not make any purchases under the program during the second quarter. Keep in mind that in early December, we made our annual dividend payment of $71 million and a semiannual bond interest payment of $25 million.
Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, which is the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $288 million, up $8 million from August 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high-demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, healthcare items and some build-for-winter seasonal wear. We continue to expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012.
Accrued liabilities increased $94 million compared to August 31, primarily due to the $71 million accrual of the annual dividend and accrual of bond interest payments. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt to EBITDA is 2x.
Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $119.4 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $73.9 million. In addition to higher net income, the rate of growth for working capital needs came down as we expected.
CapEx for the second quarter was $35.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $21 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $4.3 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9.5 million in Document Management. We continue to expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

From a fire perspective, fire protection perspective, in our production facilities, we recharge portable fire extinguishers and do some other work, so that as we continue to add revenue on the fire side, we will continue to get leverage from those facilities. From a route standpoint, going back again to First Aid, we are adding more revenue to every customer because we are expanding product lines. We're adding training services. And as jobs get added, that, it results in more hands in the cabinet. So our routes are certainly becoming more efficient by more sales at each customer. We're also selling new business and adding new customers, but we're also expanding each customer. And from a fire standpoint, we're doing a lot of the same things.

And while we had continued to be very disciplined on our pricing, with the competitive environment improving, which continued into this quarter, we saw a little bit of more pricing power.

I mean we're continuing to work with various fabric suppliers and looking at alternatives, but nothing has really entered the chain yet. Keep in mind that the cotton prices, while they have come down this year, are still above historical levels. And while they are significantly below where they were last fall, all of that cotton that came into the supply chain last fall really didn't get into the garments and the distribution centers until the spring and now are really starting to be injected into the rental programs, both for our competitors as well as ourselves. And as we said, you have those high cotton prices remain with you for a while because of the amortization and the period of time it takes from the cotton at the farm until it gets into the garment. The lower prices, if they are sustained, will certainly help lessen the impact of cotton into the future. But we are kind of stuck with those higher prices, at least through this fiscal year and into part of fiscal '13. And then, as I said, even the prices today are still above historical level.

And we are taking appropriate action on those businesses to make sure that they will regain profitability and then we can position ourselves for growth. Regarding your question on maintaining a cash balance, I don't think that would have anything to do with that for what it would look like for purposes of appealing to a bank or to the financing. Most of our financing will be public financings anyway. I think the whole use of cash, whether we use it for share purchases, whether we use it for M&A, whether we do pay off of our debt, is all going to be taken into consideration based on the environment, looking out what happens with our share price, what happens with our business.

And we’re  continue to be very excited about the opportunities there."

Now a 2- or 3-person auto repair shop is not a good candidate for Document Management, nor are they a good candidate probably for the First Aid and Safety business. But we have a lot of -- let's take a car dealership. A car dealership has the need for uniform rental, facility services, document management, first aid and safety, fire services. So it depends on the size of the customer and the specific business they're in. Now if you go to the emerging businesses, document management has primarily been used in financial institution and healthcare facilities. They are outstanding candidates for a lot of our Facility Services business and our First Aid Safety and Fire Services business. So we look at every customer that we have in each of the different businesses and the sales teams work together to determine are they good candidates for some of the other products and services? And if so, then we begin to work on selling those products and services into that customer."

Obviously, I have thousands and thousands of routes out there. I can tell you that generally speaking, when we hit the recession, our management teams did a lot to right-size the routes and do rerouting to keep the capacity relatively full there. So as we see volume coming back, especially as it relates to new customers, we tend to need to add back that capacity by putting a truck back to the service, putting the driver back in the service. Now if the volume comes back from an existing customer, normally that can be handled on the route that, that customer is currently being serviced.
