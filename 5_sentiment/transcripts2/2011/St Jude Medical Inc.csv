Sales for the quarter totaled $1,350,000,000, up approximately 12% over the $1,203,000,000 reported in the fourth quarter of last year. On a constant-currency basis, fourth quarter sales increased 13% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus last year's fourth quarter decreased this quarter sales by about $14 million.
For the full year 2010, net sales were $5,165,000,000, up 10.3% over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations versus those used in 2009 increased 2010's net sales by approximately $23 million, resulting in constant-currency sales growth for the year of approximately 9.8%.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items. In total, the net impact of all of these items reduced the fourth quarter EPS by $0.13. Each of these items is described in the footnotes to the condensed consolidated statements of earnings that accompanies our press release this morning. Let me take a moment here to briefly explain each item.
First, we recorded after-tax charges of $22 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of AGA Medical. Also in connection with the acquisition of AGA Medical, as required under generally accepted accounting principles, we increased the value of AGA Medical's inventory on hand at the date of the acquisition by approximately $30 million. 
During the fourth quarter, approximately $7 million of this increase in inventory value was absorbed in cost of sales.  This item reduced earnings per share in the fourth quarter by approximately one penny. We expect the remaining $23 million will be absorbed into cost of goods sold over the first six months of 2011.
During the fourth quarter, we reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston to resolve the previously disclosed 2005 industry-wide investigation of post-market clinical studies and registries. In connection with this settlement, we recorded after-tax charges of $15 million or $0.05 per share.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax inventory obsolescence charge of approximately $18 million or $0.05 per share, primarily related to excess ICD inventory. The overwhelming success of our 2010 launch of the fortify and unify high-voltage product line in the United States resulted in an unprecedented shift in customer preference from older models of ICDs, which necessitated the obsolescence charge. By the end of 2010, approximately 95% of our mix of ICD and CRTD devices in the United States was fortify and unify.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded a write down of $5 million or $0.01 per share, reflecting a decline in the fair market value of an investment. Also during the fourth quarter, the federal research and development tax credit was extended for both 2010 and 2011, retroactive to the beginning of 2010. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $20 million benefit to income tax expense, which increased earnings per share by $0.06, representing the cumulative catch up adjustment of this credit for the first three quarters of 2010. 
The net impact of all of these items reduced the fourth quarter EPS by $0.13. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items.
Earnings per share were $0.75 for the fourth quarter of 2010, a 17% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.64 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.72 to $0.74. For the full year 2010, adjusted earnings per share were $3.01, a 24% increase over adjusted EPS of $2.43 for the full year 2009.
Before we discuss our financial results for 2010 and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2011, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates and the assumptions we are using at our outlook for this year. 
The two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.32 to $1.37. And for the yen, each YEN 80 to YEN 85 will translate into USD $1.
I will now turn our discussion to the sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which include revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product line were $762 million, up 9% from last year's fourth quarter, including $10 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. 
On a constant-currency basis, total CRM product sales for the fourth quarter increased 11%. Total CRM product sales for the full year 2010 were $3,040,000,000, representing a 10% increase over 2009. 
Favorable foreign currency translation increased 2009 CRM sales by approximately $6 million. On a constant-currency basis, total CRM product sales for the full year 2010 increased 10%.
For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $458 million, up 16% from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $273 million, a 15% increase and international ICD sales were $185 million, a 17% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009, including $7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, total ICD sales for the fourth quarter increased 18%. 
For the year 2010, ICD sales were $1,820,000,000, up 15% versus 2009. The impact of foreign currency translations on reported ICD sales for 2010 versus rates used for 2009 was not material.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $304 million, consistent with last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $124 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $180 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. 
For the year 2010, pacemaker sales were $1,220,000,000, up 2% over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations versus those used in 2009 increased 2010's pacemaker sales by approximately $7 million. On a constant-currency basis, the total pacemaker product sales for the full year 2010 increased 2%.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million. For the full year 2011, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. 
As you are evaluating our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, keep in mind that during 2010, we reported additional CRM sales of approximately $40 million related to a competitor being off the ICD market in the U.S. We estimate approximately $25 million of these additional sales were included in our first quarter 2010 results. If you eliminate the onetime competitive sales windfall from the first quarter of 2010, the upper end of our first quarter 2011 a CRM guidance range represents about 7% currency neutral growth over the prior-year period.
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF product sales, for the fourth quarter totaled $193 million, up 13% over the fourth quarter of last year, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. For the year 2010, AF product sales were $708 million, an increase of 13% over 2009, including a $5 million increase due to favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, AF product sales increased 12% in 2010. 
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $175 million to $190 million. We expect full year 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $287 million, up 20% over the fourth quarter of 2009, including a $25 million contribution from the recently acquired AGA Medical. Total cardiovascular product sales for full year 2010 were $1,037,000,000, up 9% over 2009, including an $11 million increase due to favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, cardiovascular product sales increased 8% in 2010.
Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $92 million. Total vascular closure products sales for 2010 were $375 million. Sales of heart valve products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $87 million. Total sales of heart valve products for 2010 were $337 million. 
Please note that with the acquisition of AGA Medical, this is the last quarter that we we'll be breaking out of vascular closure products and heart valve products sales separately. Going forward, we will be breaking out our sales of cardiovascular products into two categories: structural heart products and vascular products. 
Sales of heart valve products, along with the occlude or product and late left atrial appendage plug will be incorporated into our structural heart category. Sales of vascular closure products will be incorporated into our vascular products category, which will also include the FFR pressure wire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $310 million to $325 million. We expect full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,350,000,000. 
St. Jude Medical closed on its acquisition of AGA Medical on November 18, 2010. AGA Medical sales for the 2010 period prior to the acquisition were approximately $185 million. The benefit of the acquired sales is incorporated into our full year guidance for cardiovascular product sales.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $108 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, neuromodulation products sales were $380 million, up 15% over 2009. 
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. We expect full year 2011 neuromodulation sales of $410 million to $435 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2011 sales guidance.
For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2011 in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,150,000,000. sales of our AF product for 2011 are expected to reach $770 million to $800 million. For cardiovascular products, we expect 2011 sales in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,350,000,000, and we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be $410 million to $435 million. 
If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2011 are expected to be $5,670,000,000 to $5,835,000,000. This guidance results in consolidated sales growth in the range of 10% to 15%.
The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 is now part of our press release. We you would refer you to this detail. In total, 49% of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter came from United States, while 51% came from international markets.
The gross profit margin during the fourth quarter was 72.7%, consistent with the third quarter of 2010 and representing a decline as expected, compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 due to the impact of absorbing costs associated with remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. For the full year 2010, the gross profit margin was 73.4%. For the full year 2011, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.5% to 74.0%. 
This full year 2011 gross profit margin guidance does not take into account the nonrecurring cost of sales related to the inventory valuation adjustment recorded for GAAP purposes at the time of the AGA Medical acquisition. We expect this item will increase reported cost of sales by approximately $15 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $8 million in the second quarter. We expect gross profit margins to continue to improve in future years as we ramp-up manufacturing volumes in our new facilities in Costa Rica and in Malaysia.
Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 34.3% of net sales, representing a 100 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter 2009. For the full year 2010, SG&A expenses were 34.5% of net sales compared with 36.3% in 2009. For 2011, exclusive of the impact related to AGA Medical, we plan to continue leveraging our core SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
The AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points in 2011. However, given the fixed nature of a portion of these expenses, we expect to leverage these costs in future periods. As a result of all these factors, for the full year 2011, we expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.0%.
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were 12.9% of net sales, representing 80 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2009 due to be AGA acquisition and timing of certain development activity. For the full year 2010, R&D expenses were 12.2% of net sales consistent with 2009. For the full year 2011, we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of net sales as we expand funding for our new initiatives to accelerate sales growth long term.
Other expense was $12 million in the fourth quarter, and for the first quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $20 million. For the full year 2011, we expect other expense of approximately $70 million to $75 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For 2010, our effective income tax rate was 24.5%. For 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 24.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,512,000,000 in total debt. During the fourth quarter, we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The new agreement provides $1.5 billion of unsecured credit with the maturity in 2015. There were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at year end.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 326 million to 328 million shares, with a weighted-average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 estimated at $329 million to $331 million. 
This guidance on outstanding shares takes into account that during the fourth quarter and through mid-January 2011, we completed a $900 million share repurchase, which was designed to offset the 13.6 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of AGA Medical and shares expected to be issued under the company's stock compensation plans.
The company expects consolidated EPS for the first quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.79, and for the full year 2011, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. This expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 8% to 10% over the 2010 adjusted EPS of $3.01. 
Keep in mind that we expect to expand investment in R&D during 2011 to between 12.5% and 13.5% of sales compared with the full year investment in 2010 of 12.2% of sales. This effectively reallocates approximately 300 basis points of potential EPS growth to expand investment in R&D during 2011. And I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

St. Jude Medical places high priority on returning to a position, where we can deliver double-digit constant-currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. We're making good progress delivering on this goal as reflected by sales gr",1972,"Thank you, John. St. Jude Medical places high priority on returning to a position, where we can deliver double-digit constant-currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. We're making good progress delivering on this goal as reflected by sales growth in the fourth quarter based on a strong cycle of new products. 
During our earnings call one quarter ago, I outlined more than 14 initiatives that either have been completed or are underway to increase our sales growth longer term. We will talk about all of these growth initiatives in more detail at our annual investors meeting next week, but I would like to briefly review the list on this call.
Funding for these initiatives is reflected in our guidance if we expect to increase R&D as a percent of sales in 2011. First, with respect to our CRM business, we are focused on two initiatives designed to accelerate CRM sales growth. The first one is complete. We have made all of the leadership and other changes we needed to restore competitive effectiveness to our U.S. CRM sales organization and return to gaining CRM's share in our U.S. business in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in our International business.
We are supporting our restored competitive effectiveness with a strong pipeline of new ICD products scheduled to launch in the United States in 2011, which includes our quadripolar CRT system. As a leading indicator for our likely success with these new products, international ICD sales that included these products were up 21% constant currency during the fourth quarter. 
In addition to continuing to gain share with de novo implants of ICDs based on the strength of our new products and our overall competitive effectiveness, we are on track to gain approximately four points of ICD market share in the United States over the next four to six years due to the tailwind created by replacement product market dynamics as set forth in more detail on prior calls.
The second new growth initiative in our CRM business is that we are in the process of adding a major new growth driver in the form of CardioMEMS technology. The champion trial already has demonstrated that heart failure patients, whose medical therapy has guided by an implanted CardioMEMS device, are hospitalized for heart failure 39% less in the first 15 months following device implant than heart failure patients who have managed conventionally. 
This is exactly the kind of technology that will be a high-profile winner in an environment of health care reform and increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of available technology for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. This target patient population includes heart failure patients who already are indicated for an ICD or CRT therapy as well as heart failure patients who are not currently indicated for a St. Jude Medical device.
In addition to becoming an independent new growth driver for St. Jude Medical, we expect CardioMEMS technology to help St. Jude Medical develop the CRM market and influence CRM market share gains. CardioMEMS technology is scheduled for limited launch in Europe in 2011 and is scheduled for full launch in the United States in 2012.
With respect to our Cardiovascular business, we have begun of the year with seven new growth initiatives that are expected to impact sales in 2011. First is our entry into the $500 million market for pericardial-stented issue valves with our Trifecta product line. 
As a reminder, we just began full commercial launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial-stented tissue valves in Europe during the fourth quarter. clinical response continues to be favorable and consistent with our expectation that our Trifecta line of stented tissue valves can become a major new growth driver for our Cardiovascular business. We expect full commercial launch in the United States by the middle of 2011.
Our second new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is our leadership in the emerging market for fractional flow reserve, or FFR-guided therapy for stenting patients who have a hold of vessel coronary artery disease. Our landmark fame trial demonstrated that FFR guided therapy reduce the cost of medical care by 14%, while at the same time reducing patient mortality and morbidity by at least 30%. 
Like CardioMEMS, this is another example of the kind of technology that will be a high-profile winner in an environment of health care reform and increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology for the millions of patients who suffer from coronary artery disease. We have approximately 60% share of the FFR market and expect FFR therapy to become standard of care as we continue to develop the market. 
Our third new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is our entry into the $500 million market for intravascular imaging with the first and only optical coherence tomography, or OCT, product line already on the market in the United States, Europe and Japan. Since we are to market with OCT, we have a 100% share in our focus on developing this market in the right way for the long term.
During 2011, we are investing significantly in new clinical trials, education and in integrating our FFR technology into our OCT hardware platform. OCT technology will be a critical component of every clinical trial studying observable stents. We think OCT technology has a credible opportunity to become standard of care or at least the leading technology for intravascular imaging as we continue to develop the market.
Our fourth new growth driver within our Cardiovascular business is our left atrial appendage, or LAA, closure technology designed to protect Atrial Fibrillation patients from stroke due to that the that tend to form or collect in the left atrial appendage. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the U.K. issued guidance in 2010 supporting the comparative effectiveness of LAA occlusion in AF patients. 
LAA closure procedures may be performed on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with AF ablation for patients who suffer from Atrial Fibrillation. Although this market still is in its infancy, full commercial launch of our LAA closure technology is underway in Europe with encouraging clinical response.
A fifth new growth driver within our Cardiovascular business is our PFO closure technology for patients who suffer from cryptogenic stroke. In Europe, we currently have full commercial release significant product advantage and clear leadership in this emerging market. 
In the United States, our U.S. pivotal trial is well advanced with over 800 patients enrolled in an event-driven trial design. Although a competitor's PFO closure trial was unsuccessful, we are optimistic that our respect PFO closure trial will be successful due to differences in trial design, patient selection and reliability of device performance.
A six new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is that through our acquisition of AGA, we have become the clear leader in the market for repairing atrial set of defects, ventricular set of defects and other structural heart defects with minimally invasive catheter technology. Although this market is relatively mature in the United States and Europe, we expect to generate significant new market growth through our global reach in Brazil, China, India and other large potential markets that are dramatically under penetrated.
A seventh new technology within our Cardiovascular business that will impact our sales growth in 2011 is our next-generation technology that blocks or redirects blood flow through peripheral vessels with vascular plug instead of with surgical clips or embolic coils. Doing 2011, we expect to launch our fourth-generation implants or vascular plug into the United States basked market and clarify the level of growth we should expect from this new product platform going forward into 2012 and beyond. 
In addition to the seven growth initiatives within our Cardiovascular business, I have just reviewed, are expected to impact sales in 2011, we previously identified additional growth initiatives that are expected to impact sales in Europe beginning in 2013. These include our transcatheter aortic valve implant, or TAVI program, and hard core asset aortic aneurysm, or TAA program. 
With respect to the TAVI program, we expect to launch both our transfer models and brands TAVI systems in Europe by the first half of 2013. We will provide additional updates on these programs at our investor meeting next week.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation business, we have entered 2011 with three new growth initiatives that are expected to impact our business in the near term. First is the launch of our Eon Mini line of spinal cord stimulators in Japan, which began last quarter. The success of our Eon Mini product line in the United States and in Europe gives us confidence we can gain a significant share of the spinal cords stimulation market in Japan. 
The second new growth initiative within our Neuromodulation business is our entry into the market for deep brain stimulation, or DBS, for patients who suffer from Parkinson's disease. Beginning last quarter, we are rolling out full commercial launch in Europe of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
Brio is a rechargeable and constant-currency system and is the smallest, lightest and longest-lasting system on the market. We expect to support this launch with publication of favorable data from our U.S. pivotal clinical trial during the first half of this year. We are second to enter this market and expect to gain meaningful share with a superior product line.
The third new growth driver within our Neuromodulation business is that we expect to receive CE Mark for a migraine indication in Europe during 2011. This puts us on track for our Migraine business in Europe to become a meaningful new growth driver for St. Jude Medical in 2012 and beyond.
Finally, moving on to our AF growth franchise, our results reflect that international sales of AF are products increased approximately 15% constant currency during Q4. These results are a leading indicator for the growth we expect as we launch products in the United States, which already are in the market in Europe. This includes our compact line of ablation catheters, our cool flex line of ablation catheters and the emergence of MediGuide enabled. cath leads. 
We remain convinced that our MediGuide technology will be a key differentiator for multiple St. Jude Medical growth programs based on its ability to improve both the clinical effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures in a wide variety of clinicals settings. We look forward to providing an update on all of these technologies at our annual investor meeting next week.
While extensive, the list I have just reviewed of initiatives that either have been completed or are underway to accelerate our sales growth longer term is not exhaustive. At our annual investor meeting next week, we also update you on our neuromodulation program for patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, our program for percutaneous mitral valve repair and an advanced program we have underway targeting Reno in hypertensive patients who do not respond to medical therapy. 
We are not offering guidance today to the level of sales growth we expect in 2012 and beyond, but when we take into account that the dynamics of our core business, together with the impact of all of the initiatives I have just reviewed that are designed to tolerate our sales growth longer term, we are optimistic that St. Jude Medical is making good progress, returning to a position where we can deliver double-digit, constant-currency, organic sales growth on a sustainable basis.
As always, we are committed to doing so in a disciplined and cost-effective way that does not squander our cash and earnings growth by chasing highly dilutive or speculative acquisitions. 
We are now ready to open it up for questions. I'd like to turn it over to you, Celeste, to moderate the questions."

Well, first, let me put these in perspective. So the recent JAMA article was recently in the popular press, and it may have been news as well to others who do not particularly followed CRM market. But the JAMA article, or Journal of the American Medi",486,"Yes. Well, first, let me put these in perspective. So the recent JAMA article was recently in the popular press, and it may have been news as well to others who do not particularly followed CRM market. But the JAMA article, or Journal of the American Medical Association article, presented data that was already published back in May of 2010 at the annual HRS Scientific Sessions. So the publication itself offered nothing new either to the industry over to the clinical community. And then secondly, the site's the fact that this news was really old news. The data itself was really very limited, and people would want to take into account the nature of our registry and the limitations of our registry. So for those who really don't understand what a registry or haven't worked with them, person like with the wrong idea. We run a number of registries and have managed a number of registries. Registries are notorious for having incomplete data. And so, a well-run registry has to be very actively managed. you need active oversight. You need significant active auditing, significant active fact checking. With a registry just as with really kind of more managed, randomized clinical trials, whoever the sponsor of the registry is have to do a lot of going back to the clinicians who are submitting data to complete the data that they submitted. So it's really again a registry data is notoriously incomplete. So I think with a relatively unmanaged registry, which was the type of registry that was reported in the JAMA article, it's really not good for answering questions. It does serve a useful role, however, in raising questions. And so, I think that the type of questions that would be raise would be first, are there, with respect to the HRS guidelines for implanting ICDs, the guidelines themselves explicitly are not all inclusive. The guidelines specifically provide that it may be appropriate for impact outside the guidelines. So to the extent that a registry would suggest that there are implants that are outside the guidelines, which are specifically called out as appropriate in those guidelines, one would want to revisit one of those implants and how did they match up with the guidelines. The guidelines themselves are relatively new, should the guidelines be modified to include additional implants that are being done for a good medical reasons that are well documented in the complete medical record or not. That would be one good question. And there'd be other good questions that could be raised from registry data as well. And so, in answering your question, did we take this into account in setting our guidance for first quarter of 2011 and for full year 2011? We certainly did. there was not new news here. This is information that we took into account with our guidance in market modeling dating back to the middle of last year."

If I went back to the R&D teams and ask that if there was anything else they could use money for, they're going to say that they could use more funding. So I'll stop short to saying that they're fully funded. But they're all very strongly and adequately funded. And the funding for each of these programs is consistent with the timelines that we have offered for when we expect products to come to market. And we will continue to provide more detail about these timelines at our longer meeting next week, where really the whole purpose of next weeks meeting is to review the product flow, to review these new growth drivers and to give you whatever update is appropriate with respect to timelines. So there is a complete connection between the level of funding, the scale of the undertaking and the time we expect to bring these products to market. And keep in mind, there a lot of these products are coming to market in 2011. So there's very little -- there is also a significant development oriented toward longer-term projects. But a lot of this, the heavy lifting, has been completed in the product development itself. And now it's a question of regulatory path. And with respect to regulatory path, the majority of these new products are either already beginning to come to the market in Europe or they will come to the market here in 2011. So it is -- we do have a robust program. We tended to keep a low profile with some of our investment in new growth drivers. These new growth drivers are close enough to market that we're now providing additional information about them. But one will notice that on a sustainable basis, we've kept a very strong level of R&D, dating back to least far back as 2004 and beyond. so what we're getting year is a lot of these new programs, we're just getting products coming out of extended pipeline. And in some instances, we've accelerated growth through acquisition. In other instances we've been through started new investment and new growth drivers during the last few years.

Next thing we have to do here is wait for the other two companies to report their Q4 numbers for us to see where 2010 actually came in. It may have come in. I mean, and then until then, it's really speculative. It may have come in other less than 3%, the global CRM market, for 2010. But we need to see their numbers to know that.

And on the ASP pressure, as we said in the past, we expect across all franchises, we expect ongoing ASP pressures historically here in the CRM size been somewhere in the range of 2% to 3%.

Let me start. So on the SG&A side, if you look at the legacy AGA business and the St. Jude Medical business before we closed our acquisition of AGA, you would see that AGA's SG&A as a percent of sales was quite a little bit higher than St. Jude Medical's. And as we've been, so that's a starting the, and then the next thing is as we talk about our approach to our strategic approach to integrating an acquisition and integrate our acquisition with AGA, it's not at all a priority for us to focus on taking out cost from the new combined organizations. The priority for us is to make sure that we fully capture the talent and the growth opportunity of the combined organizations. Over time, there will, there undoubtedly be opportunities for continuous improvement that we can bring to bear on the SG&A side. And there undoubtedly will be synergies that will make sense to capture in the right way at the right time. And then also on the AGA side, there are a number of new growth drivers that are now part of our program as a result of the acquisition that are really in their infancy. And so, they take a disproportionate percentage of investment at the front end to get the products launched. That will include the vascular plug technology here that I mentioned. We really have a significant effort to have a good sales force focused on that new product line, a good sales force focused on creating more of a presence in the international radiology lab. we think long term, that's a good goods additional space for us. So in the short term, that's inefficient SG&A as that program become successful. You'll see a very meaningful leverage of that component for SG&A. And that's just one example. You get the same phenomenon would respect to that they drill appendage closure, where it's really immaterial sales right now. But we're going to really invest in the right sales marketing and education programs to turn that into a major growth driver. And so, at the front end is innovation with respect to SG&A. But as that program starts to get traction, it'll become as efficient on the SG&A side as with any other programs we have. With as many new growth drivers as we are bringing into the market in 2011, that leads to the -- that's reflected in the higher SG&A and that's what we're talking about with respect to leverage."

Does this mean that we can expect fewer acquisitions because the higher R&D, you're more internally focused on the next 12 to 18 months? Or are these platforms that are going to actually maybe potentially help you accelerate outside investment?"

The way we think about acquisitions is first, we start with our internal development programs. And our idea is that we don't really want to be in a position where we think we have to do an acquisition. We really want to be very much in control of our growth program, and that those means that we want to have our growth program covered with investment and internal R&D. So that's the one. The way we think about acquisition is we see an opportunity to accelerate a new growth driver that we're invested in on the R&D side, the acquisition, then it's kind of a comparative effectiveness assessment we do on this. It makes sense to accelerate that growth program through acquisition or does it make sense to fully devote the investment on an internal basis and pass on the acquisition. and so, it's that kind of analysis that we go through in deciding whether to grow with internal development or grow accelerating our growth within acquisition. So I don't think of it as internal pipeline's full. therefore, acquisitions are either more or less likely. We just always look at acquisitions on the perspective of it can we benefit our internal growth program about acquisition or not. if we can, and if all the stars going up, we'll the lead to do it. And if you can't, we'll pass on it. That's Vista was passing on acquisition opportunities. We haven't done that many acquisitions. We did the AGA and LightLab in 2010. And you're challenging me a little bit to go back and remember our whole history. We didn't do much in 2009. We did MediGuide in 2008. We did some other smaller investments in 2008 as well."

However, just give me the flexibility to comment for the benefit of others on the line who may not be so close to this. The first thing that is important in our minds with respect to the DOJ investigation is that, as you've said, it's not new. It dates back to at least March of 2010. So I mean, in our experience, customers in the United States have been aware of their hospitals undergoing audits of reimbursement and appropriateness of reimbursement here versus this entire last year. So I don't think there's as much news here. I think more of just that the issues freshen up a bit of it and there are good people who are likely involved in the business who have didn't have any reason to pay attention to the announcements earlier last year about the DOJ investigation. But a lot of people have been living with these investigations, and certainly, have been well aware of them and they talk to their colleagues about their institution being audited and compare experiences. And so, I think the big scheme of things in the clinical community, I think there's a lot less news here and a lot less new awareness that just kind of the late press might suggest. I what I take out of the editorial, what I take out of the HRS involvement, I take that as really being a very favorable indicator. So if you think about the Department of Justice conducting an investigation dating back at least March of 2010, here we are in January of 2011. And now nine or 10 months into the investigation, the Department of Justice is bringing in additional expertise to help it sort through the information that it's collected. That's what I get out of the announcement that HRS is advising the Department of Justice. And HRS is exactly the same people that we're talking about here in the clinical community. The HRS leadership is a luminaries in the electrophysiology community. and So, this is now the -- there's a lot of overlap here between leadership and HRS and the resources HRS draws on and the investigation has taken place since March of 2010. And the fact that the DOJ is asking for some input and advice from HRS on the investigation, I think is being very positive. If there was something that would be, in my mind I think a smoking gun, if there was something that's a smoking gun or a scandal that have been uncovered after 10 months of investigation, there wouldn't be a reason to go to HRS to ask for help sorting through the data. So I think there's a lot less here. I think there's to some headline shock, and the headline shock is not in the clinical community."

Timing-wise, keep in mind, for purposes of others who are listening to this part of the discussion, that the competitive trial that was unsuccessful results were published prior to our acquisition of AGA. So there was nothing that would be a new development for us with respect to our PFO business. So we were well aware of the competitive trial and the limitations of it at the time that we did our due diligence on the AGA trial and the significance of the differences in our PFO pivotal trial and the competitive pivotal trial that was not successful. So that probably mostly answers your question. And then with respect to the U.S. here, we think we have -- we are optimistic we'll be in a positive result on the PFO closure trial here for the cryptogenic stroke in the United States. Keep in mind that in Europe, this is already a robust business. And then keep in mind also that on the stroke side of PFO, there have been documented confirmation of drivers traveling from the right side to the left atrium drive burying about. I mean, there isn't really a question whether that happened. It's a question about identifying the right risk and benefits of which patients ought to get that PFO closed and which patients ought to just leave the PFO alone. But there's clearly a connection. it's been well documented and not little bit smarter in which patients benefit from that procedure."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,350,000,000, up approximately 12% over the $1,203,000,000 reported in the fourth quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter sales increased 13% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus last year's fourth quarter decreased this quarter sales by about $14 million.
For the full year 2010, net sales were $5,165,000,000, up 10.3% over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations versus those used in 2009 increased 2010's net sales by approximately $23 million, resulting in constant currency sales growth for the year of approximately 9.8%.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items. In total, the net impact of all of these items reduced the fourth quarter EPS by $0.13. Each of these items is described in the footnotes to the condensed consolidated statements of earnings that accompanies our press release this morning. Let me take a moment here to briefly explain each item.
First, we recorded after-tax charges of $22 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of AGA Medical. Also in connection with the acquisition of AGA Medical, as required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we increased the value of AGA Medical's inventory on hand at the date of the acquisition by approximately $30 million. 
During the fourth quarter, approximately $7 million of this increase in inventory value was absorbed in cost of sales.  This item reduced earnings per share in the fourth quarter by approximately one penny. We expect the remaining $23 million will be absorbed into cost of goods sold over the first six months of 2011.
During the fourth quarter, we reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston to resolve the previously disclosed 2005 industry-wide investigation of post-market clinical studies and registries. In connection with this settlement, we recorded after-tax charges of $15 million or $0.05 per share.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax inventory obsolescence charge of approximately $18 million or $0.05 per share, primarily related to excess ICD [implantable cardioverter defibrillator] inventory. The overwhelming success of our 2010 launch of the Fortify and Unify high-voltage product line in the United States resulted in an unprecedented shift in customer preference from older models of ICDs, which necessitated the obsolescence charge. By the end of 2010, approximately 95% of our mix of ICD and CRT-D devices in the United States was Fortify and Unify.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded a write-down of $5 million or $0.01 per share, reflecting a decline in the fair market value of an investment. Also during the fourth quarter, the federal research and development tax credit was extended for both 2010 and 2011, retroactive to the beginning of 2010. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $20 million benefit to income tax expense, which increased earnings per share by $0.06, representing the cumulative catch-up adjustment of this credit for the first three quarters of 2010. 
The net impact of all of these items reduced the fourth quarter EPS by $0.13. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items.
Earnings per share were $0.75 for the fourth quarter of 2010, a 17% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.64 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.72 to $0.74. For the full year 2010, adjusted earnings per share were $3.01, a 24% increase over adjusted EPS of $2.43 for the full year 2009.
Before we discuss our financial results for 2010 and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2011, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates and the assumptions we are using in our outlook for this year. The two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.32 to $1.37. And for the yen, each JPY 80 to JPY 85 will translate into USD $1.
I will now turn our discussion to the sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which include revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $762 million, up 9% from last year's fourth quarter, including $10 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, total CRM product sales for the fourth quarter increased 11%. Total CRM product sales for the full year 2010 were $3,040,000,000, representing a 10% increase over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations increased 2009 CRM sales by approximately $6 million. On a constant currency basis, total CRM product sales for the full year 2010 increased 10%.
For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $458 million, up 16% from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $273 million, a 15% increase and international ICD sales were $185 million, a 17% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009, including $7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, total ICD sales for the fourth quarter increased 18%. For the year 2010, ICD sales were $1,820,000,000, up 15% versus 2009. The impact of foreign currency translations on reported ICD sales for 2010 versus rates used for 2009 was not material.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $304 million, consistent with last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $124 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $180 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. For the year 2010, pacemaker sales were $1,220,000,000, up 2% over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations versus those used in 2009 increased 2010's pacemaker sales by approximately $7 million. On a constant currency basis, total pacemaker product sales for the full year 2010 increased 2%.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million. For the full year 2011, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. As you are evaluating our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, keep in mind that during 2010, we reported additional CRM sales of approximately $40 million related to a competitor being off the ICD market in the U.S. We estimate approximately $25 million of these additional sales were included in our first quarter 2010 results. If you eliminate the one-time competitive sales windfall from the first quarter of 2010, the upper end of our first quarter 2011 CRM guidance range represents about 7% currency neutral growth over the prior-year period.
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $193 million, up 13% over the fourth quarter of last year, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. For the year 2010, AF product sales were $708 million, an increase of 13% over 2009, including a $5 million increase due to favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, AF product sales increased 12% in 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $175 million to $190 million. We expect full year 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million.
Total sales of Cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $287 million, up 20% over the fourth quarter of 2009, including a $25 million contribution from the recently acquired AGA Medical. Total cardiovascular product sales for full year 2010 were $1,037,000,000, up 9% over 2009, including an $11 million increase due to favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, Cardiovascular product sales increased 8% in 2010.
Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $92 million. Total vascular closure product sales for 2010 were $375 million. Sales of heart valve products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $87 million. Total sales of heart valve products for 2010 were $337 million. 
Please note that with the acquisition of AGA Medical, this is the last quarter that we will be breaking out vascular closure products and heart valve products sales separately. Going forward, we will be breaking out our sales of Cardiovascular products into two categories: structural heart products and vascular products. 
Sales of heart valve products, along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug will be incorporated into our structural heart category. Sales of vascular closure products will be incorporated into our vascular products category, which will also include the FFR pressure wire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect Cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $310 million to $325 million. We expect full year 2011 Cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,350,000,000. 
St. Jude Medical closed on its acquisition of AGA Medical on November 18, 2010. AGA Medical sales for the 2010 period prior to the acquisition were approximately $185 million. The benefit of these acquired sales is incorporated into our full year guidance for Cardiovascular product sales.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $108 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, Neuromodulation products sales were $380 million, up 15% over 2009. For the first quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. We expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales of $410 million to $435 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2011 sales guidance.
For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2011 in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. Sales of our AF products for 2011 are expected to reach $770 million to $800 million. For Cardiovascular products, we expect 2011 sales in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,350,000,000, and we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be $410 million to $435 million. If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2011 are expected to be $5,670,000,000 to $5,835,000,000. This guidance results in consolidated sales growth in the range of 10% to 15%.
The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 is now part of our press release. We you would refer you to this detail. In total, 49% of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter came from the United States, while 51% came from international markets.
The gross profit margin during the fourth quarter was 72.7%, consistent with the third quarter of 2010 and representing a decline as expected compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, due to the impact of absorbing costs associated with remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. For the full year 2010, the gross profit margin was 73.4%. For the full year 2011, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.5% to 74.0%. 
This full year 2011 gross profit margin guidance does not take into account the non-recurring cost of sales related to the inventory valuation adjustment recorded for GAAP purposes at the time of the AGA Medical acquisition. We expect this item will increase reported cost of sales by approximately $15 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $8 million in the second quarter. We expect gross profit margins to continue to improve in future years as we ramp-up manufacturing volumes in our new facilities in Costa Rica and in Malaysia.
Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 34.3% of net sales, representing a 100 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, SG&A expenses were 34.5% of net sales compared with 36.3% in 2009. For 2011, exclusive of the impact related to AGA Medical, we plan to continue leveraging our core SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
The AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points in 2011. However, given the fixed nature of a portion of these expenses, we expect to leverage these costs in future periods. As a result of all these factors, for the full year 2011, we expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.0%.
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were 12.9% of net sales, representing an 80 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2009, due to the AGA acquisition and timing of certain development activities. For the full year 2010, R&D expenses were 12.2% of net sales consistent with 2009. For the full year of 2011, we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of net sales as we expand funding for our new initiatives to accelerate sales growth long term.
Other expense was $12 million in the fourth quarter, and for the first quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $20 million. For the full year 2011, we expect other expense of approximately $70 million to $75 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. For 2010, our effective income tax rate was 24.5%. For 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 24.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,512,000,000 in total debt. During the fourth quarter, we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The new agreement provides $1.5 billion of unsecured credit with the maturity in 2015. There were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at year end.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 326 million to 328 million shares, with a weighted-average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 estimated at $329 million to $331 million. This guidance on outstanding shares takes into account that during the fourth quarter and through mid-January 2011, we completed a $900 million share repurchase, which was designed to offset the 13.6 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of AGA Medical and shares expected to be issued under the company's stock compensation plans.
The company expects consolidated EPS for the first quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.79, and for the full year 2011, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. This expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 8% to 10% over the 2010 adjusted EPS of $3.01. Keep in mind that we expect to expand investment in R&D during 2011 to between 12.5% and 13.5% of sales compared with the full year investment in 2010 of 12.2% of sales. This effectively reallocates approximately 300 basis points of potential EPS growth to expand investment in R&D during 2011. 
And I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

St. Jude Medical places high priority on returning to a position where we can deliver double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. We are making good progress delivering on this goal as reflected by sales gr",1972,"Thank you, John. St. Jude Medical places high priority on returning to a position where we can deliver double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. We are making good progress delivering on this goal as reflected by sales growth in the fourth quarter based on a strong cycle of new products. 
During our earnings call one quarter ago, I outlined more than 14 initiatives that either have been completed or are underway to increase our sales growth longer term. We will talk about all of these growth initiatives in more detail at our annual investors meeting next week, but I would like to briefly review the list on this call.
Funding for these initiatives is reflected in our guidance, that we expect to increase R&D as a percent of sales in 2011. First, with respect to our CRM business, we have focused on two initiatives designed to accelerate CRM sales growth. The first one is complete. We have made all of the leadership and other changes we needed to restore competitive effectiveness to our U.S. CRM sales organization and return to gaining CRM's share in our U.S. business in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in our International business.
We are supporting our restored competitive effectiveness with a strong pipeline of new ICD products scheduled to launch in the United States in 2011, which includes our quadripolar CRT systems. As a leading indicator for our likely success with these new products, international ICD sales that included these products were up 21% constant currency during the fourth quarter. 
In addition to continuing to gain share with de novo implants of ICDs based on the strength of our new products and our overall competitive effectiveness, we are on track to gain approximately four points of ICD market share in the United States over the next four to six years, due to the tailwind created by replacement product market dynamics as set forth in more detail on prior calls.
The second new growth initiative in our CRM business is that we are in the process of adding a major new growth driver in the form of CardioMEMS technology. The champion trial already has demonstrated that heart failure patients, whose medical therapy has guided by an implanted CardioMEMS device, are hospitalized for heart failure 39% less in the first 15 months following device implant than heart failure patients who are managed conventionally. 
This is exactly the kind of technology that will be a high-profile winner in an environment of health care reform and increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of available technology for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. This target patient population includes heart failure patients who already are indicated for an ICD or CRT therapy, as well as heart failure patients who are not currently indicated for a St. Jude Medical device.
In addition to becoming an independent new growth driver for St. Jude Medical, we expect CardioMEMS technology to help St. Jude Medical develop the CRM market and influence CRM market share gains. CardioMEMS technology is scheduled for a limited launch in Europe in 2011 and is scheduled for full launch in the United States in 2012.
With respect to our Cardiovascular business, we have begun the year with seven new growth initiatives that are expected to impact sales in 2011. First is our entry into the $500 million market for pericardial stented tissue valves with our Trifecta product line. 
As a reminder, we just began full commercial launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in Europe during the fourth quarter. Clinical response continues to be favorable and consistent with our expectation that our Trifecta line of stented tissue valves can become a major new growth driver for our Cardiovascular business. We expect full commercial launch in the United States by the middle of 2011.
Our second new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is our leadership in the emerging market for fractional flow reserve, or FFR-guided therapy for stenting patients who have multivessel coronary artery disease. Our landmark FAME trial demonstrated that FFR-guided therapy reduces the cost of medical care by 14%, while at the same time reducing patient mortality and morbidity by at least 30%. 
Like CardioMEMS, this is another example of the kind of technology that will be a high-profile winner in an environment of health care reform and increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology for the millions of patients who suffer from coronary artery disease. We have approximately 60% share of the FFR market and expect FFR therapy to become standard of care as we continue to develop the market. 
Our third new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is our entry into the $500 million market for intravascular imaging, with the first and only Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT, product line already on the market in the United States, Europe and Japan. Since we are first to market with OCT, we have a 100% share and are focused on developing this market in the right way for the long term.
During 2011, we are investing significantly in new clinical trials, education and in integrating our FFR technology into our OCT hardware platform. OCT technology will be a critical component of every clinical trial studying absorbable stents. We think OCT technology has a credible opportunity to become standard of care or at least the leading technology for intravascular imaging as we continue to develop the market.
A fourth new growth driver within our Cardiovascular business is our left atrial appendage, or LAA, closure technology designed to protect Atrial Fibrillation patients from stroke, due to emboli that tend to form or collect in the left atrial appendage. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the U.K. issued guidance in 2010 supporting the comparative effectiveness of LAA occlusion in AF patients. 
LAA closure procedures may be performed on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with AF ablation for patients who suffer from Atrial Fibrillation. Although this market still is in its infancy, full commercial launch of our LAA closure technology is underway in Europe with encouraging clinical response.
A fifth new growth driver within our Cardiovascular business is our PFO closure technology for patients who suffer from cryptogenic stroke. In Europe, we currently have full commercial release, significant product advantage and clear leadership in this emerging market. In the United States, our U.S. pivotal trial is well advanced with over 800 patients enrolled in an event driven trial design. Although a competitor's PFO closure trial was unsuccessful, we are optimistic that our RESPECT PFO closure trial will be successful due to differences in trial design, patient selection and reliability of device performance.
A sixth new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is that through our acquisition of AGA, we have become the clear leader in the market for repairing atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects and other structural heart defects with minimally invasive catheter technology. Although this market is relatively mature in the United States and Europe, we expect to generate significant new market growth through our global reach in Brazil, China, India and other large potential markets that are dramatically underpenetrated.
A seventh new technology within our Cardiovascular business that will impact our sales growth in 2011 is our next-generation technology that blocks or redirects blood flow through peripheral vessels with a vascular plug instead of with surgical clips or embolic coils. Doing 2011, we expect to launch our fourth-generation AMPLATZER vascular plug into the United States basked market and clarify the level of growth we should expect from this new product platform going forward into 2012 and beyond. 
In addition to the seven growth initiatives within our Cardiovascular business, I have just reviewed, that are expected to impact sales in 2011, we previously identified additional growth initiatives that are expected to impact sales in Europe beginning in 2013. These include our transcatheter aortic valve implant, or TAVI, program and our thoracic aortic aneurysm, or TAA program. With respect to the TAVI program, we expect to launch both our transfemoral and our transapical TAVI systems in Europe by the first half of 2013. We will provide additional updates on these programs at our investor meeting next week.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation business. We have entered 2011 with three new growth initiatives that are expected to impact our business in the near term. First is the launch of our Eon-mini line of spinal cord stimulators in Japan, which began last quarter. The success of our Eon-mini product line in the United States and in Europe gives us confidence we can gain a significant share of the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan. 
The second new growth initiative within our Neuromodulation business is our entry into the market for deep brain stimulation, or DBS, for patients who suffer from Parkinson's disease. Beginning last quarter, we are rolling out full commercial launch in Europe of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
Brio is a rechargeable on constant currency system and is the smallest, lightest and longest-lasting system on the market. We expect to support this launch with publication of favorable data from our U.S. pivotal clinical trial during the first half of this year. We are second to enter this market and expect to gain meaningful share with a superior product line.
The third new growth driver within our Neuromodulation business is that we expect to receive CE Mark for a migraine indication in Europe during 2011. This puts us on track for our Migraine business in Europe to become a meaningful new growth driver for St. Jude Medical in 2012 and beyond.
Finally, moving on to our AF growth franchise. Our results reflect that international sales of AF products increased approximately 15% constant currency during Q4. These results are a leading indicator for the growth we expect as we launch products in the United States, which already are on the market in Europe. This includes our Contact line of ablation catheters, our Cool Flex line of ablation catheters and the emergence of MediGuide enabled cath labs. 
We remain convinced that our MediGuide technology will be a key differentiator for multiple St. Jude Medical growth programs based on its ability to improve both the clinical effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures in a wide variety of clinical settings. We look forward to providing you an update on all of these technologies at our annual investor meeting next week.
While extensive, the list I have just reviewed of initiatives that either have been completed or are underway to accelerate our sales growth longer term is not exhaustive. At our annual investor meeting next week, we also update you on our Neuromodulation program for patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, our program for percutaneous mitral valve repair and an advanced program we have underway targeting renal denervation in hypertensive patients who do not respond to medical therapy. 
We are not offering guidance today for the level of sales growth we expect in 2012 and beyond, but when we take into account the dynamics of our core business, together with the impact of all of the initiatives I have just reviewed, that are designed to accelerate our sales growth long term, we are optimistic that St. Jude Medical is making good progress returning to a position where we can deliver double digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. As always, we are committed to doing so in a disciplined and cost effective way, that does not squander our cash and earnings growth by chasing highly dilutive or speculative acquisitions. 
We are now ready to open it up for questions. I'd like to turn it over to you, Celeste, to moderate the questions."

And we've made enough progress in each of these new growth drivers to be convinced that the viability and ultimate success of the new initiatives. So we're increasing funding to accelerate the development programs with the idea that in addition to maintaining the highest quality products and in addition to maintaining our operations at the highest level of ethical compliance, our next highest priority is for us to return ourselves to the position where we can really deliver double-digit sales growth on a sustainable basis. So with that in mind, we have committed to significantly increase R&D to accelerate all of our new growth programs."

Well, first, let me put these in perspective. So the recent JAMA article was recently only in the popular press, and it may have been news as well to others who do not particularly follow the CRM market. But the JAMA article, or Journal of the Americ",490,"Yes. Well, first, let me put these in perspective. So the recent JAMA article was recently only in the popular press, and it may have been news as well to others who do not particularly follow the CRM market. But the JAMA article, or Journal of the American Medical Association article, presented data that was already published back in May of 2010 at the Annual HRS Scientific Sessions. So the publication itself offered nothing new either to industry or to the clinical community. And then secondly, besides the fact that this news was really old news. The data itself was really very limited, and people would want to take into account the nature of a registry and the limitations of a registry. So for those who really don't understand what a registry is or haven't worked with them, a person might get the wrong idea. We run a number of registries and have managed a number of registries. Registries are notorious for having incomplete data. And so, a well-run registry has to be very actively managed. You need active oversight. You need significant active auditing, significant active fact checking. With a registry just as with, really, kind of more managed randomized clinical trials, whoever the sponsor of the registry is have to do a lot of going back to the clinicians who are submitting data to complete the data that they submitted. So it's really, again, registry data is notoriously incomplete. So I think with a relatively unmanaged registry, which was the type of registry that was reported in the JAMA article, it's really not good for answering questions. It does serve a useful role, however, in raising questions. And so I think that the type of questions that would be raised would be first, are there -- with respect to the HRS guidelines for implanting ICDs, the guidelines themselves explicitly are not all inclusive. The guidelines specifically provide that it may be appropriate for implants outside the guidelines. So to the extent that a registry would suggest that there are implants that are outside the guidelines, which are specifically called out as appropriate in those guidelines, one would want to revisit what are those implants and how do they match up with the guidelines. The guidelines themselves are relatively new. Should the guidelines be modified to include additional implants that are being done for good medical reasons that are well documented in a complete medical record or not, that would be one good question, and there'd be other good questions that could be raised from registry data as well. And so in answer to your question of, did we take this into account in setting our guidance for the first quarter of 2011 and for full year 2011? We certainly did. There was not new news here. This is information that we took into account with our guidance and market modeling dating back to the middle of last year."

So all of these programs are funded and are nicely funded. If I went back to the R&D teams and asked them, if there was anything else they could use money for, they're going to say that they could use more funding. So I'll stop short of saying that they're fully funded, but they're all very strongly and adequately funded, and that the funding -- and for each of these programs is consistent with the timelines that we have offered for when we expect products to come to market. And we will continue to provide more detail about these timelines at our longer meeting next week where really the whole purpose of next week's meeting is to review this product flow, to review these new growth drivers, and to give you whatever update is appropriate with respect to timelines. So there is a complete connection between the level of funding, the scale of the undertaking and the time we expect to bring these products to market. And keep in mind that a lot of these products are coming to market in 2011. So there is very little -- there is also a significant development oriented toward longer-term projects, but a lot of this -- the heavy lifting has been completed in the product development itself, and now it's a question of regulatory path and with respect to regulatory path, the majority of these new products are either already beginning to come to the market in Europe or they will come to the market here in 2011. So it is -- we do have a robust program. We've tended to keep a low profile with some of our investment in new growth drivers. These new growth drivers are close enough to market that we're now providing additional information about them, but one will notice that on a sustainable basis, we've kept a very strong level of R&D, dating back at least as far back as 2004 and beyond. And so what we're getting year is, in a lot of these new programs we're just getting products coming up the other end of an extended pipeline. And in some instances, we've accelerated growth through acquisition. And in other instances, we've started new investment and new growth drivers during the last few years and just kept it confidential until this year."

Nothing's changed in our outlook for a CRM market model. So we need to -- first thing would be -- so the last update that we gave was, we estimated that the global CRM market was growing at about 3% and so we said that we'll just assume that the current growth rate remains, and if the current growth rate increases, that will be upside to any of our expectations for just as a starting point to answer your question. So the next thing we have to do here is wait for the other two companies to report their Q4 numbers for us to see where 2010 actually came in. It may have come in -- I mean, and until then it's really speculative. It may have come in a little less than 3%, the global CRM market for 2010, but we need to see their numbers to know that. And then, we're just assuming, I mean, whether it's 3% or whether it's 2.5% or whether it's 2%, we're just assuming, whatever the current growth rate is, we consider this to be the new normal and with respect to really everything, with respect to the impact of healthcare reform, with respect to macroeconomic issues, with respect to ASP pressures, with respect to austerity measures, we consider 2010 to be the new normal and we accept these kind of tough market conditions as what we will continue to compete in going forward in 2011 and beyond. It seems to us that over time, we will get some relief on some of these market pressures and see some recovery in global markets, including in the CRM market, but we're not assuming any of that recovery. We're just assuming whatever the conditions are here in 2010, we expect to remain through 2011. So we're probably at about, we think we're in about 3% on the CRM side. If it's something a little bit different than that, it's not terribly material to our outlook. And on the ASP pressure, as we've said in the past, we expect across all franchises, we expect ongoing ASP pressures historically here on the CRM side, it's been somewhere in the range of 2% to 3%. I think of that as low single digit. And there are no dynamics we see in our business to change our expectation that we will continue to see low single-digit pressure on ASPs in the CRM business on a total global basis taking everything into account, ranging from new technology launches to changes in geographic mix to ongoing competitive pressures."

Let me -- John and I are looking at each other, Rick, and either one of us are happy to take your question. Let me start. So on the SG&A side, if you look at the legacy AGA business and the St. Jude Medical business before we closed our acquisition of AGA, you would see that AGA's SG&A as a percent of sales was quite a little bit higher than St. Jude Medical's. And then as we've been -- so that's the starting point, then the next thing is that as we talk about our strategic approach to integrating an acquisition and integrate our acquisition with AGA, it's not at all a priority for us to focus on taking out costs from the new combined organizations. The priority for us is to make sure that we fully capture the talent and the growth opportunity of the combined organizations. Over time, there undoubtedly will be opportunities for continuous improvement that we can bring to bear on the SG&A side, and there undoubtedly will be synergies that it will make sense to capture in the right way at the right time. And then also on the AGA side, there are a number of new growth drivers that are now part of our program as a result of the acquisition that are really in their infancy and so they take a disproportionate percentage of investment at the front end to get the products launched. That would include the vascular plug technology here for -- that I mentioned that we really have a significant effort to have a good sales force focus on that new product line and a good sales force focus on creating more of a presence in the interventional radiology lab. We think long term that's a good additional space for us. So that's in -- short term that's inefficient SG&A. As that program becomes successful, you'll see a very meaningful leverage of that component of our SG&A and that's just one example, you get the same phenomenon would respect to that the left atrial appendage closure, where it's really immaterial sales right now, but we're going to really invest in the right sales, marketing and education programs to turn that into a major growth driver. And so at the front end it's inefficient with respect to SG&A, but as that program starts to get traction it will become as efficient on the SG&A side as any other programs we have. And so we've got with as many new growth drivers as we are bringing into the market in 2011 that leads to the -- that's reflected in the higher SG&A and that's what we're talking about with respect to leverage."

We really want to be very much in control of our growth program, and that to us means that we want to have our growth program covered with investment in internal R&D. That's number one. Then, the way we think about acquisitions is, if we see an opportunity to accelerate a new growth driver that we're invested in on the R&D side via acquisition, then it's kind of a comparative effectiveness assessment we do and does it make sense to accelerate that growth program through acquisition or does it make sense to fully devote the investment on an internal basis and pass on the acquisition. And so it's that kind of analysis that we go through in deciding whether to grow with internal development or grow -- accelerate our growth with an acquisition. So I don't think of it as, internal pipelines full therefore acquisitions are either more or less likely. We just always look at acquisitions from the perspective of does it, can we benefit our internal growth program with that acquisition or not. If we can and if all the stars line up, we go ahead and do it, and if we can't, we pass on it, and that leads to us usually passing on acquisition opportunities. We haven't done that many acquisitions. We did AGA and LightLab in 2010, and you've challenged me a little bit to go back and remember our whole history. We didn't do much in 2009. We did Radi and MediGuide in 2008. We did some other smaller investments in 2008 as well."

However, just give me the flexibility to comment for the benefit of others on the line who may not be so close to this. The first thing that is important in our minds with respect to the DOJ investigation is that, as you've said, it's not new. It dates back at least to March of 2010. So I mean, I don't -- in our experience, customers in the United States have been aware of their hospitals' undergoing audits of reimbursement and appropriateness of reimbursement here during this entire -- virtually this entire last year. So there's really, I don't think there's much news here. I think it's more just that the issues freshened up a little bit and there are, again, people who aren't really involved in the business who didn't have any reason to pay attention to the announcements earlier last year about the DOJ investigations. But a lot of people have been living with these investigations and certainly have been well aware of them, and they talk to their colleagues about their institution being audited and compare experiences. And so I think that in the big scheme of things in the clinical community, I think there's a lot less news here and a lot less new awareness that just kind of the late press might suggest. I think what I take out of the editorialize, what I take out of the HRS involvement, I take that as really being a very favorable indicator. So if you think about the Department of Justice conducting an investigation dating back at least to March of 2010, here we are in January of 2011, and now nine or 10 months into the investigation the Department of Justice is bringing in additional expertise to help it sort through the information that it's collected. That's what I get out of the announcement that HRS is advising the Department of Justice and HRS is exactly the same people that we're talking about here in the clinical community. The HRS leadership is luminaries in the electrophysiology community. And so this is now the -- there's a lot of overlap here between the leadership in HRS and the resources HRS draws on and the investigation that's been taking place since March of 2010, and the fact that the DOJ is asking for some input and advice from HRS on the investigation I take as being very positive. If there was something that would be a -- in my mind, I think of it as a smoking gun. If there was something that was a smoking gun or a scandal that had been uncovered after 10 months of investigation, there wouldn't be a reason to go to HRS to ask for help sorting through the data. So I think there's a lot less here. I think there's just some headline shock and the headline shock is not in the clinical community."

Keep in mind that in Europe, this is already a robust business, and then keep in mind also that on the stroke side of PFO, there have been documented confirmations of emboli traveling from the right side of the -- from the right atrium into the left atrium, and open to a patent foramen ovale, I mean, so there isn't really a question about whether that happens, it's a question about identifying the right risks and benefits of which patients ought to get that PFO closed, and which patients ought to -- we ought to just leave the PFO alone, but there's clearly a connection that's been well documented and now it's a question of just getting a little bit smarter about which patient's benefit from that procedure."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,350,000,000, up approximately 12% over the $1,203,000,000 reported in the fourth quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter sales increased 13% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus last year's fourth quarter decreased this quarter sales by about $14 million.
For the full year 2010, net sales were $5,165,000,000, up 10.3% over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations versus those used in 2009 increased 2010's net sales by approximately $23 million, resulting in constant currency sales growth for the year of approximately 9.8%.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items. In total, the net impact of all of these items reduced the fourth quarter EPS by $0.13. Each of these items is described in the footnotes to the condensed consolidated statements of earnings that accompanies our press release this morning. Let me take a moment here to briefly explain each item.
First, we recorded after-tax charges of $22 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of AGA Medical. Also in connection with the acquisition of AGA Medical, as required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we increased the value of AGA Medical's inventory on hand at the date of the acquisition by approximately $30 million. 
During the fourth quarter, approximately $7 million of this increase in inventory value was absorbed in cost of sales.  This item reduced earnings per share in the fourth quarter by approximately one penny. We expect the remaining $23 million will be absorbed into cost of goods sold over the first six months of 2011.
During the fourth quarter, we reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston to resolve the previously disclosed 2005 industry-wide investigation of post-market clinical studies and registries. In connection with this settlement, we recorded after-tax charges of $15 million or $0.05 per share.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax inventory obsolescence charge of approximately $18 million or $0.05 per share, primarily related to excess ICD [implantable cardioverter defibrillator] inventory. The overwhelming success of our 2010 launch of the Fortify and Unify high-voltage product line in the United States resulted in an unprecedented shift in customer preference from older models of ICDs, which necessitated the obsolescence charge. By the end of 2010, approximately 95% of our mix of ICD and CRT-D devices in the United States was Fortify and Unify.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded a write-down of $5 million or $0.01 per share, reflecting a decline in the fair market value of an investment. Also during the fourth quarter, the federal research and development tax credit was extended for both 2010 and 2011, retroactive to the beginning of 2010. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $20 million benefit to income tax expense, which increased earnings per share by $0.06, representing the cumulative catch-up adjustment of this credit for the first three quarters of 2010. 
The net impact of all of these items reduced the fourth quarter EPS by $0.13. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items.
Earnings per share were $0.75 for the fourth quarter of 2010, a 17% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.64 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.72 to $0.74. For the full year 2010, adjusted earnings per share were $3.01, a 24% increase over adjusted EPS of $2.43 for the full year 2009.
Before we discuss our financial results for 2010 and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2011, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates and the assumptions we are using in our outlook for this year. The two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.32 to $1.37. And for the yen, each JPY 80 to JPY 85 will translate into USD $1.
I will now turn our discussion to the sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which include revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $762 million, up 9% from last year's fourth quarter, including $10 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, total CRM product sales for the fourth quarter increased 11%. Total CRM product sales for the full year 2010 were $3,040,000,000, representing a 10% increase over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations increased 2009 CRM sales by approximately $6 million. On a constant currency basis, total CRM product sales for the full year 2010 increased 10%.
For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $458 million, up 16% from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $273 million, a 15% increase and international ICD sales were $185 million, a 17% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009, including $7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, total ICD sales for the fourth quarter increased 18%. For the year 2010, ICD sales were $1,820,000,000, up 15% versus 2009. The impact of foreign currency translations on reported ICD sales for 2010 versus rates used for 2009 was not material.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $304 million, consistent with last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $124 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $180 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. For the year 2010, pacemaker sales were $1,220,000,000, up 2% over 2009. Favorable foreign currency translations versus those used in 2009 increased 2010's pacemaker sales by approximately $7 million. On a constant currency basis, total pacemaker product sales for the full year 2010 increased 2%.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million. For the full year 2011, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. As you are evaluating our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, keep in mind that during 2010, we reported additional CRM sales of approximately $40 million related to a competitor being off the ICD market in the U.S. We estimate approximately $25 million of these additional sales were included in our first quarter 2010 results. If you eliminate the one-time competitive sales windfall from the first quarter of 2010, the upper end of our first quarter 2011 CRM guidance range represents about 7% currency neutral growth over the prior-year period.
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $193 million, up 13% over the fourth quarter of last year, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. For the year 2010, AF product sales were $708 million, an increase of 13% over 2009, including a $5 million increase due to favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, AF product sales increased 12% in 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $175 million to $190 million. We expect full year 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million.
Total sales of Cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $287 million, up 20% over the fourth quarter of 2009, including a $25 million contribution from the recently acquired AGA Medical. Total cardiovascular product sales for full year 2010 were $1,037,000,000, up 9% over 2009, including an $11 million increase due to favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, Cardiovascular product sales increased 8% in 2010.
Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $92 million. Total vascular closure product sales for 2010 were $375 million. Sales of heart valve products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $87 million. Total sales of heart valve products for 2010 were $337 million. 
Please note that with the acquisition of AGA Medical, this is the last quarter that we will be breaking out vascular closure products and heart valve products sales separately. Going forward, we will be breaking out our sales of cardiovascular products into two categories, structural heart products and vascular products. 
Sales of heart valve products, along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and [ph] left atrial appendage plug will be incorporated into our structural heart category. Sales of vascular closure products will be incorporated into our vascular products category, which will also include the FFR pressure wire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories.
For the first quarter of 2011, we expect Cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $310 million to $325 million. We expect full year 2011 Cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,350,000,000. 
St. Jude Medical closed on its acquisition of AGA Medical on November 18, 2010. AGA Medical sales for the 2010 period prior to the acquisition were approximately $185 million. The benefit of these acquired sales is incorporated into our full year guidance for Cardiovascular product sales.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $108 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, Neuromodulation products sales were $380 million, up 15% over 2009. For the first quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. We expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales of $410 million to $435 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2011 sales guidance.
For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2011 in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. Sales of our AF products for 2011 are expected to reach $770 million to $800 million. For Cardiovascular products, we expect 2011 sales in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,350,000,000, and we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be $410 million to $435 million. If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2011 are expected to be $5,670,000,000 to $5,835,000,000. This guidance results in consolidated sales growth in the range of 10% to 13%.
The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 is now part of our press release. We would refer you to this detail. In total, 49% of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter came from the United States, while 51% came from international markets.
The gross profit margin during the fourth quarter was 72.7%, consistent with the third quarter of 2010 and representing a decline as expected compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, due to the impact of absorbing costs associated with remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. For the full year 2010, the gross profit margin was 73.4%. For the full year 2011, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.5% to 74.0%. 
This full year 2011 gross profit margin guidance does not take into account the non-recurring cost of sales related to the inventory valuation adjustment recorded for GAAP purposes at the time of the AGA Medical acquisition. We expect this item will increase reported cost of sales by approximately $15 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $8 million in the second quarter. We expect gross profit margins to continue to improve in future years as we ramp-up manufacturing volumes in our new facilities in Costa Rica and in Malaysia.
Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 34.3% of net sales, representing a 100 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, SG&A expenses were 34.5% of net sales compared with 36.3% in 2009. For 2011, exclusive of the impact related to AGA Medical, we plan to continue leveraging our core SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
The AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points in 2011. However, given the fixed nature of a portion of these expenses, we expect to leverage these costs in future periods. As a result of all these factors, for the full year 2011, we expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.0%.
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were 12.9% of net sales, representing an 80 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2009, due to the AGA acquisition and timing of certain development activities. For the full year 2010, R&D expenses were 12.2% of net sales consistent with 2009. For the full year of 2011, we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of net sales as we expand funding for our new initiatives to accelerate sales growth long term.
Other expense was $12 million in the fourth quarter, and for the first quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $20 million. For the full year 2011, we expect other expense of approximately $70 million to $75 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. For 2010, our effective income tax rate was 24.5%. For 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 24.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,512,000,000 in total debt. During the fourth quarter, we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The new agreement provides $1.5 billion of unsecured credit with the maturity in 2015. There were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at year end.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 326 million to 328 million shares, with a weighted-average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 estimated at 329 million to 331 million. This guidance on outstanding shares takes into account that during the fourth quarter and through mid-January 2011, we completed a $900 million share repurchase, which was designed to offset the 13.6 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of AGA Medical and shares expected to be issued under the company's stock compensation plans.
The company expects consolidated EPS for the first quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.79, and for the full year 2011, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. This expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 8% to 10% over the 2010 adjusted EPS of $3.01. Keep in mind that we expect to expand investment in R&D during 2011 to between 12.5% and 13.5% of sales compared with the full year investment in 2010 of 12.2% of sales. This effectively reallocates approximately 300 basis points of potential EPS growth to expand investment in R&D during 2011. 
And I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

St. Jude Medical places high priority on returning to a position where we can deliver double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. We are making good progress delivering on this goal as reflected by sales growth in the fourth quarter based on a strong cycle of new products. 
During our earnings call one quarter ago, I outlined more than 14 initiatives that either had been completed or are underway to increase our sales growth longer term. We will talk about all of these growth initiatives in more detail at our annual investors meeting next week, but I would like to briefly review the list on this call.
Funding for these initiatives is reflected in our guidance, that we expect to increase R&D as a percent of sales in 2011. First, with respect to our CRM business, we have focused on two initiatives designed to accelerate CRM sales growth. The first one is complete. We have made all of the leadership and other changes we needed to restore competitive effectiveness to our U.S. CRM sales organization and return to gaining CRM's share in our U.S. business in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in our International business.
We are supporting our restored competitive effectiveness with a strong pipeline of new ICD products scheduled to launch in the United States in 2011, which includes our quadripolar CRT systems. As a leading indicator for our likely success with these new products, international ICD sales that included these products were up 21% constant currency during the fourth quarter. 
In addition to continuing to gain share with de novo implants of ICDs based on the strength of our new products and our overall competitive effectiveness, we are on track to gain approximately four points of ICD market share in the United States over the next four to six years, due to the tailwind created by replacement product market dynamics as set forth in more detail on prior calls.
The second new growth initiative in our CRM business is that we are in the process of adding a major new growth driver in the form of CardioMEMS technology. The champion trial already has demonstrated that heart failure patients, whose medical therapy is guided by an implanted CardioMEMS device, are hospitalized for heart failure 39% less in the first 15 months following device implant than heart failure patients who are managed conventionally. 
This is exactly the kind of technology that will be a high-profile winner in an environment of health care reform and increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of available technology for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. This target patient population includes heart failure patients who already are indicated for an ICD or CRT therapy, as well as heart failure patients who are not currently indicated for a St. Jude Medical device.
In addition to becoming an independent new growth driver for St. Jude Medical, we expect CardioMEMS technology to help St. Jude Medical develop the CRM market and influence CRM market share gains. CardioMEMS technology is scheduled for a limited launch in Europe in 2011 and is scheduled for full launch in the United States in 2012.
With respect to our Cardiovascular business, we have begun the year with seven new growth initiatives that are expected to impact sales in 2011. First is our entry into the $500 million market for pericardial stented tissue valves with our Trifecta product line. 
As a reminder, we just began full commercial launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in Europe during the fourth quarter. Clinical response continues to be favorable and consistent with our expectation that our Trifecta line of stented tissue valves can become a major new growth driver for our Cardiovascular business. We expect full commercial launch in the United States by the middle of 2011.
Our second new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is our leadership in the emerging market for fractional flow reserve, or FFR-guided therapy for stenting patients who have multivessel coronary artery disease. Our landmark FAME trial demonstrated that FFR-guided therapy reduces the cost of medical care by 14%, while at the same time reducing patient mortality and morbidity by at least 30%. 
Like CardioMEMS, this is another example of the kind of technology that will be a high-profile winner in an environment of health care reform and increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology for the millions of patients who suffer from coronary artery disease. We have approximately 60% share of the FFR market and expect FFR therapy to become standard of care as we continue to develop the market. 
Our third new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is our entry into the $500 million market for intravascular imaging, with the first and only Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT, product line already on the market in the United States, Europe and Japan. Since we are first to market with OCT, we have a 100% share and are focused on developing this market in the right way for the long term.
During 2011, we are investing significantly in new clinical trials, education and in integrating our FFR technology into our OCT hardware platform. OCT technology will be a critical component of every clinical trial studying absorbable stents. We think OCT technology has a credible opportunity to become standard of care or at least the leading technology for intravascular imaging as we continue to develop the market.
A fourth new growth driver within our Cardiovascular business is our left atrial appendage, or LAA, closure technology designed to protect Atrial Fibrillation patients from stroke, due to emboli that tend to form or collect in the left atrial appendage. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the U.K. issued guidance in 2010 supporting the comparative effectiveness of LAA occlusion in AF patients. 
LAA closure procedures may be performed on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with AF ablation for patients who suffer from Atrial Fibrillation. Although this market still is in its infancy, full commercial launch of our LAA closure technology is underway in Europe with encouraging clinical response.
A fifth new growth driver within our Cardiovascular business is our PFO closure technology for patients who suffer from cryptogenic stroke. In Europe, we currently have full commercial release, significant product advantage and clear leadership in this emerging market. In the United States, our U.S. pivotal trial is well advanced with over 800 patients enrolled in an event driven trial design. Although a competitor's PFO closure trial was unsuccessful, we are optimistic that our RESPECT PFO closure trial will be successful due to differences in trial design, patient selection and reliability of device performance.
A sixth new growth initiative within our Cardiovascular business is that through our acquisition of AGA, we have become the clear leader in the market for repairing atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects and other structural heart defects with minimally invasive catheter technology. Although this market is relatively mature in the United States and Europe, we expect to generate significant new market growth through our global reach in Brazil, China, India and other large potential markets that are dramatically underpenetrated.
A seventh new technology within our Cardiovascular business that will impact our sales growth in 2011 is our next-generation technology that blocks or redirects blood flow through peripheral vessels with a vascular plug instead of with surgical clips or embolic coils. During 2011, we expect to launch our fourth-generation AMPLATZER vascular plug into the United States market and clarify the level of growth we should expect from this new product platform going forward into 2012 and beyond. 
In addition to the seven growth initiatives within our Cardiovascular business, I have just reviewed, that are expected to impact sales in 2011, we previously identified additional growth initiatives that are expected to impact sales in Europe beginning in 2013. These include our transcatheter aortic valve implant, or TAVI, program and our thoracic aortic aneurysm, or TAA program. With respect to the TAVI program, we expect to launch both our transfemoral and our transapical TAVI systems in Europe by the first half of 2013. We will provide additional updates on these programs at our investor meeting next week.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation business. We have entered 2011 with three new growth initiatives that are expected to impact our business in the near term. First is the launch of our Eon-mini line of spinal cord stimulators in Japan, which began last quarter. The success of our Eon-mini product line in the United States and in Europe gives us confidence we can gain a significant share of the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan. 
The second new growth initiative within our Neuromodulation business is our entry into the market for deep brain stimulation, or DBS, for patients who suffer from Parkinson's disease. Beginning last quarter, we are rolling out full commercial launch in Europe of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
Brio is a rechargeable and constant current system and is the smallest, lightest and longest-lasting system on the market. We expect to support this launch with publication of favorable data from our U.S. pivotal clinical trial during the first half of this year. We are second to enter this market and expect to gain meaningful share with a superior product line.
The third new growth driver within our Neuromodulation business is that we expect to receive CE Mark for a migraine indication in Europe during 2011. This puts us on track for our Migraine business in Europe to become a meaningful new growth driver for St. Jude Medical in 2012 and beyond.
Finally, moving on to our AF growth franchise. Our results reflect that international sales of AF products increased approximately 15% constant currency during Q4. These results are a leading indicator for the growth we expect as we launch products in the United States, which already are on the market in Europe. This includes our Contact line of ablation catheters, our Cool Flex line of ablation catheters and the emergence of MediGuide enabled cath labs. 
We remain convinced that our MediGuide technology will be a key differentiator for multiple St. Jude Medical growth programs based on its ability to improve both the clinical effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures in a wide variety of clinical settings. We look forward to providing you an update on all of these technologies at our annual investor meeting next week.
While extensive, the list I have just reviewed of initiatives that either have been completed or are underway to accelerate our sales growth longer term is not exhaustive. At our annual investor meeting next week, we also will update you on our Neuromodulation program for patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, our program for percutaneous mitral valve repair and an advanced program we have underway targeting renal denervation in hypertensive patients who do not respond to medical therapy. 
We are not offering guidance today for the level of sales growth we expect in 2012 and beyond, but when we take into account the dynamics of our core business, together with the impact of all of the initiatives I have just reviewed, that are designed to accelerate our sales growth long term, we are optimistic that St. Jude Medical is making good progress returning to a position where we can deliver double digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. As always, we are committed to doing so in a disciplined and cost effective way, that does not squander our cash and earnings growth by chasing highly dilutive or speculative acquisitions. 
We are now ready to open it up for questions. I'd like to turn it over to you, Celeste, to moderate the questions."

Well, first, let me put these in perspective. So the recent JAMA article was recent only in the popular press, and it may have been news as well to others who do not particularly follow the CRM market. But the JAMA article, or Journal of the American",489,"Yes. Well, first, let me put these in perspective. So the recent JAMA article was recent only in the popular press, and it may have been news as well to others who do not particularly follow the CRM market. But the JAMA article, or Journal of the American Medical Association article, presented data that was already published back in May of 2010 at the Annual HRS Scientific Sessions. So the publication itself offered nothing new either to industry or to the clinical community. And then secondly, besides the fact that this news was really old news, the data itself was really very limited, and people would want to take into account the nature of a registry and the limitations of a registry. So for those who really don't understand what a registry is or haven't worked with them, a person might get the wrong idea. We run a number of registries and have managed a number of registries. Registries are notorious for having incomplete data. And so, a well-run registry has to be very actively managed. You need active oversight. You need significant active auditing, significant active fact checking. With a registry just as with, really, kind of more managed randomized clinical trials, whoever the sponsor of the registry is have to do a lot of going back to the clinicians who are submitting data to complete the data that they submitted. So it's really, again, registry data is notoriously incomplete. So I think with a relatively unmanaged registry, which was the type of registry that was reported in the JAMA article, it's really not good for answering questions. It does serve a useful role, however, in raising questions. And so I think that the type of questions that would be raised would be first, are there -- with respect to the HRS guidelines for implanting ICDs, the guidelines themselves explicitly are not all inclusive. The guidelines specifically provide that it may be appropriate for implants outside the guidelines. So to the extent that a registry would suggest that there are implants that are outside the guidelines, which are specifically culled out as appropriate in those guidelines, one would want to revisit what are those implants and how do they match up with the guidelines. The guidelines themselves are relatively new. Should the guidelines be modified to include additional implants that are being done for good medical reasons that are well documented in a complete medical record or not, that would be one good question, and there'd be other good questions that could be raised from registry data as well. And so in answer to your question of, did we take this into account in setting our guidance for the first quarter of 2011 and for full year 2011? We certainly did. There was not news here. This is information that we took into account with our guidance and market modeling dating back to the middle of last year."

So all of these programs are funded and are nicely funded. If I went back to the R&D teams and asked them, if there was anything else they could use money for, they're going to say that they could use more funding. So I'll stop short of saying that they're fully funded, but they're all very strongly and adequately funded, and that the funding -- and for each of these programs is consistent with the timelines that we have offered for when we expect products to come to market. And we will continue to provide more detail about these timelines at our longer meeting next week where really the whole purpose of next week's meeting is to review this product flow, to review these new growth drivers, and to give you whatever update is appropriate with respect to timelines. So there is a complete connection between the level of funding, the scale of the undertaking and the time we expect to bring these products to market. And keep in mind that a lot of these products are coming to market in 2011. So there is very little -- there is also a significant development oriented toward longer-term projects, but a lot of this -- the heavy lifting has been completed in the product development itself, and now it's a question of regulatory path and with respect to regulatory path, the majority of these new products are either already beginning to come to the market in Europe or they will come to the market here in 2011. So it is -- we do have a robust program. We've tended to keep a low profile with some of our investment in new growth drivers. These new growth drivers are close enough to market that we're now providing additional information about them, but one will notice that on a sustainable basis, we've kept a very strong level of R&D, dating back at least as far back as 2004 and beyond. And so what we're getting here is, in a lot of these new programs we're just getting products coming up the other end of an extended pipeline. And in some instances, we've accelerated growth through acquisition. And in other instances, we've started new investment and new growth drivers during the last few years and just kept it confidential until this year."

So the next thing we have to do here is wait for the other two companies to report their Q4 numbers for us to see where 2010 actually came in. It may have come in -- I mean, and until then it's really speculative. It may have come in a little less than 3%, the global CRM market for 2010, but we need to see their numbers to know that. And then, we're just assuming, I mean, whether it's 3% or whether it's 2.5% or whether it's 2%, we're just assuming, whatever the current growth rate is, we consider this to be the new normal and with respect to really everything, with respect to the impact of health care reform, with respect to macroeconomic issues, with respect to ASP pressures, with respect to austerity measures, we consider 2010 to be the new normal and we accept these kind of tough market conditions as what we will continue to compete in going forward in 2011 and beyond. It seems to us that over time, we will get some relief on some of these market pressures and see some recovery in global markets, including in the CRM market, but we're not assuming any of that recovery. We're just assuming whatever the conditions are here in 2010, we expect to remain through 2011. So we're probably at about, we think we're in about 3% on the CRM side. If it's something a little bit different than that, it's not terribly material to our outlook. And on the ASP pressure, as we've said in the past, we expect across all franchises, we expect ongoing ASP pressures historically here on the CRM side, it's been somewhere in the range of 2% to 3%. I think of that as low single digit.

Let me -- John and I are looking at each other, Rick, and either one of us are happy to take your question. Let me start. So on the SG&A side, if you look at the legacy AGA business and the St. Jude Medical business before we closed our acquisition",451,"Sure. Let me -- John and I are looking at each other, Rick, and either one of us are happy to take your question. Let me start. So on the SG&A side, if you look at the legacy AGA business and the St. Jude Medical business before we closed our acquisition of AGA, you would see that AGA's SG&A as a percent of sales was quite a little bit higher than St. Jude Medical's. And then as we've been -- so that's the starting point, then the next thing is that as we talk about our strategic approach to integrating an acquisition and integrate our acquisition with AGA, it's not at all a priority for us to focus on taking out costs from the new combined organizations. The priority for us is to make sure that we fully capture the talent and the growth opportunity of the combined organizations. Over time, there undoubtedly will be opportunities for continuous improvement that we can bring to bear on the SG&A side, and there undoubtedly will be synergies that it will make sense to capture in the right way at the right time. And then also on the AGA side, there are a number of new growth drivers that are now part of our program as a result of the acquisition that are really in their infancy and so they take a disproportionate percentage of investment at the front end to get the products launched. That would include the vascular plug technology here for -- that I mentioned that we really have a significant effort to have a good sales force focus on that new product line and a good sales force focus on creating more of a presence in the interventional radiology lab. We think long term that's a good additional space for us. So that's in -- short term that's inefficient SG&A. As that program becomes successful, you'll see a very meaningful leverage of that component of our SG&A and that's just one example, you get the same phenomenon with respect to the left atrial appendage closure, where it's really immaterial to sales right now, but we're going to really invest in the right sales, marketing and education programs to turn that into a major growth driver. And so at the front end it's inefficient with respect to SG&A, but as that program starts to get traction it will become as efficient on the SG&A side as any other programs we have. And so we've got with as many new growth drivers as we are bringing into the market in 2011 that leads to the -- that's reflected in the higher SG&A and that's what we're talking about with respect to leverage."

The way that we think about acquisitions is first, we start with our internal development programs, and our idea is that we don't really -- I don't want to be in a position where we think we have to do an acquisition. We really want to be very much in control of our growth program, and that to us means that we want to have our growth program covered with investment in internal R&D. That's number one. Then, the way we think about acquisitions is, if we see an opportunity to accelerate a new growth driver that we're invested in on the R&D side via acquisition, then it's kind of a comparative effectiveness assessment we do and does it make sense to accelerate that growth program through acquisition or does it make sense to fully devote the investment on an internal basis and pass on the acquisition. And so it's that kind of analysis that we go through in deciding whether to grow with internal development or grow -- accelerate our growth with an acquisition. So I don't think of it as, internal pipelines full therefore acquisitions are either more or less likely. We just always look at acquisitions from the perspective of does it, can we benefit our internal growth program with that acquisition or not. If we can and if all the stars line up, we go ahead and do it, and if we can't, we pass on it, and that leads to us usually passing on acquisition opportunities. We haven't done that many acquisitions. We did AGA and LightLab in 2010, and you've challenged me a little bit to go back and remember our whole history. We didn't do much in 2009. We did Radi and MediGuide in 2008. We did some other smaller investments in 2008 as well."

However, just give me the flexibility to comment for the benefit of others on the line who may not be so close to this. The first thing that is important in our minds with respect to the DOJ investigation is that, as you've said, it's not new. It dates back at least to March of 2010. So I mean, I don't -- in our experience, customers in the United States have been aware of their hospitals undergoing audits of reimbursement and appropriateness of reimbursement here during this entire -- virtually this entire last year. So there's really, I don't think there's much news here. I think it's more just that the issues freshened up a little bit and there are, again, people who aren't really involved in the business who didn't have any reason to pay attention to the announcements earlier last year about the DOJ investigation. But a lot of people have been living with these investigations and certainly have been well aware of them, and they talk to their colleagues about their institution being audited and compare experiences. And so I think that in the big scheme of things in the clinical community, I think there's a lot less news here and a lot less new awareness that just kind of the lay press might suggest. I think what I take out of -- to editorialize, what I take out of the HRS involvement, I take that as really being a very favorable indicator. So if you think about the Department of Justice conducting an investigation dating back at least to March of 2010, here we are in January of 2011, and now nine or 10 months into the investigation the Department of Justice is bringing in additional expertise to help it sort through the information that it's collected. That's what I get out of the announcement that HRS is advising the Department of Justice and HRS is exactly the same people that we're talking about here in the clinical community. The HRS leadership is luminaries in the electrophysiology community. And so this is now the -- there's a lot of overlap here between the leadership in HRS and the resources HRS draws on and the investigation that's been taking place since March of 2010, and the fact that the DOJ is asking for some input and advice from HRS on the investigation I take as being very positive. If there was something that would be a -- in my mind, I think of it as a smoking gun. If there was something that was a smoking gun or a scandal that had been uncovered after 10 months of investigation, there wouldn't be a reason to go to HRS to ask for help sorting through the data. So I think there's a lot less here. I think there's just some headline shock and the headline shock is not in the clinical community."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,376,000,000, up approximately 9% over the $1,262,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year, and at the upper end of our total sales guidance range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,385,000,000.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,376,000,000, up approximately 9% over the $1,262,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year, and at the upper end of our total sales guidance range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,385,000,000. 
Favorable foreign currency translation versus last year's first quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $17 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment, but the actual average exchange rates during the first quarter were within our previous guidance range. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter sales increased approximately 8% versus last year. And first quarter sales increased approximately 5% on an organic basis.
Also as you may recall, during the first quarter of 2010, a competitor announced the suspension of all sales of their ICD products in the United States. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our first quarter 2010 U.S. ICD sales by approximately $25 million. If we adjust to reflect this one-time benefit, our first quarter 2011 sales were up approximately 10% on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, we estimate that the impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami on our international sales was approximately $5 million in the quarter, primarily in our CRM business.
During the first quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $19 million or $0.06 per share, primarily related to AGA Medical integration expenses associated with contract termination costs in international locations. 
Also in connection with the AGA Medical acquisition, we continue to amortize the acquired inventory step up to cost of sales. 
In the first quarter, we recognized $15 million in cost of sales related to this item and we expect the remaining $15 million will be absorbed in the cost of sales during the second quarter of 2011.
Comments during this call referencing first quarter results and guidance for full year 2011 results including EPS amounts will be exclusive of these items. 
One additional item to note in the first quarter of 2011 was the inclusion of a $7 million expense from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico, that is included in the other expense line item. 
This additional expenses is almost entirely offset by a corresponding $6 million tax benefit reflecting the tax credit available in the United States related to the Puerto Rico excise tax. 
The net effect of which reduced our income tax rate to 22%. Taken together, these two items therefore, did not affect earnings per share.
Earnings per share were $0.80 for the first quarter of 2011, a 7% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010 and above our guidance range of $0.77 to $0.79. 
On a currency neutral basis, and excluding the impact of a competitor's suspension of ICD sales in the first quarter of 2010, we estimate earnings per share increased approximately 8%. 
Before we discuss our first quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2011, let me comment on foreign currency.
As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rate which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.32 to $1.37 and for the yen, 80 to 85 yen would translate into one U.S. dollar. 
For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these assumptions. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2011, we are taking into account the recent strength in the euro and are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.39 to $1.44. 
The U.S. dollar, however, has strengthened relative to the yen and as a result, we now expect each 82 to 87 yen to translate into one U.S. dollar. 
These changes in assumptions regarding currency exchange rates add approximately $25 million to $30 million to our total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2011. However, we believe the impact of recent unfortunate events in Japan on the remainder of 2011 will essentially offset the favorable impact of currency.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the first quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenues from both our ICD and pacemakers product lines, were $762 million, up 1% from last year's first quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter's CRM sales were essentially flat versus a strong first quarter from last year. Excluding the $25 million impact from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, total first quarter 2011 CRM sales increased 5% versus last year's first quarter. 
For the first quarter, ICD sales were $465 million, up 3% from last year's first quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter ICD sales increased 2% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $280 million, flat versus last year's first quarter and international ICD sales were $185 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations.
Excluding the $25 million impact from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, first quarter 2011 ICD sales increased 9% versus last year's first quarter and U.S. first quarter 2011 ICD sales also increased 9% versus the same time period. 
For low-voltage devices, sales for the first quarter totaled $297 million, down 1% from last year's first quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter low-voltage devices sales decreased 2% versus last year. 
In the United States, pacemaker sales were $131 million, up 2% from last year's first quarter. 
In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $166 million, down 3% from the first quarter of 2010, principally in Japan, including $4 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
As I mentioned earlier, we saw an impact on the sales in the quarter due to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. 
In addition, the prior year period included certain pacemaker sales in Japan that were sold through a distributor in 2010, which we are in the process of transitioning to our direct sales force. While we believe this transition will ultimately be beneficial to our business, the timing of the transition negatively impacted the first quarter.
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $790 million to $820 million. 
And for the full year 2011, we continue to expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. 
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the first quarter totaled $195 million, up 15% over the first quarter of last year, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, first quarter AF product sales increased 13% versus last year. 
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $190 million to $205 million and we are increasing our full year 2011 AF product sales guidance to now be in the range of $780 million to $810 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2011 were $327 million, up 28% over the first quarter of 2010, including $6 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 25% versus last year. 
Organic cardiovascular product sales growth was approximately 7%. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, with the acquisition of AGA Medical, we will now be breaking out our sales of cardiovascular products into two categories; structural heart product and vascular products. 
Sales of heart valve products along with the amplaster occluder products and left atrial appendage block are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, FFR PressureWire, OCD products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories. 
Within this category of products, sales of structural products in the first quarter of 2011 were $143 million, an increase of 66% over the first quarter of 2010 or a 65% on a constant currency basis. 
Sales of vascular products in the first quarter of 2011 were $184 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2010 or 5% on a constant currency basis.
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $325 million to $340 million, and we are raising our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales guidance to now be in the range of $1,325 000,000 to $1,355,000,000.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2011 were $92 million, up 10% from the first quarter of 2010, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. 
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million and we continue to expect full year 2011 neuromodulation sales in the range of $410 million to $435 million.
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 49% of St. Jude Medical sales in the first quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 51% came from international markets. 
As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the first quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
If you review our updated sales guidance for 2011, you will note that we have increased both the lower and upper end of our sales outlook by $15 million, due to the strength of our results in our AF and cardiovascular product lines. 
In addition, as a result of a more favorable currency assumption, we now expect 2011 sales to benefit approximately $25 million to $30 million. However, we are taking a reduction in our 2011 sales expectation that offsets this currency impact tied with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We estimate that approximately $12 million to $70 million of the reduction in Japan sales will occur in the second quarter.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.6%, up slightly from the first quarter of 2010. We were encouraged by the gross profit margin this quarter, which primarily reflects improved manufacturing efficiencies along with a favorable product mix. 
As a result, we are increasing our outlook for 2011 and now expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.8% to 74.3%, up 30 basis points from our outlook one quarter ago.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 35.5% of net sales, an increase of 40 basis points over the first quarter of 2010. 
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the AGA Medical operations including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points in 2011. 
For the full year 2011, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.7% to 35.2%. Given the fixed nature of a portion of these expenses, our full year 2011 guidance includes the expectations that we will leverage these costs in future periods.
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were 12.8% of net sales, compared with 12.0% of sales in the first quarter of 2010. 
We estimate that this 80 basis point increase in R&D as a percentage of sales reduced EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.03. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect R&D expense to stay in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of net sales as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $26 million in the first quarter, which includes $7 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico year. For the second quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $25 million, and for the full year 2011, we expect other expense of approximately $100 million to $110 million. 
For the first quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0%. This includes a $6 million benefit reflecting the credit available in the U.S. related to the Puerto Rico excise tax as mentioned, the Puerto Rico excise tax is reported in other expense while the offsetting federal income tax credit is reflected as a reduction to income tax expense. 
For 2011, we now expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%, which reflects the financial statement presentation reporting the Puerto Rico excise tax in other expense
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter of 2011, we had $664 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,637,000,000 in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with the group of banks. 
Before I move on to our EPS outlook, I would like to comment on our cash dividend, which we initiated this quarter. The initial quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on April 29, 2011, to stock holders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2011. 
This dividend reflects our commitment to rewarding shareholders through value creation and demonstrates our confidence in our growth profile, earnings power and future cash flow generation. We believe we are at a scale where we can commit to a quarterly dividend program while continuing to invest in research and development, perform periodic share repurchases and make acquisitions where appropriate and cost-effective.
Next I want to offer some comment regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 332 million to 334 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 also at 332 million to 334 million. 
The weighted average outstanding share guidance for the full year is up from our previously stated full year guidance of $329 million to $331 million. 
The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. And for the full year 2011, we now expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.33. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."
301667,129591793,115839,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. During the first quarter, we continue to make good progress developing the new growth drivers we need to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. For those of you who are new to the St. Jude Me",1037,"Thank you, John. During the first quarter, we continue to make good progress developing the new growth drivers we need to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. For those of you who are new to the St. Jude Medical story, we reviewed all of these new growth drivers in detail during our annual investor conference held on February 4. I'm not going to repeat that review on this call but I would like to offer updates on a few of our key near-term priorities.
The three new growth drivers that are most important the St. Jude Medical in the near term are: First, the U.S. launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves; second, the U.S. launch of our unified Quadra Poler CRT-D systems; and third, our progress with respect to cargo. 
First Trifecta. We expect FDA approval of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves before the end of this quarter. Sales training in the United States already has been completed. The inventory needed to support the strong product launch in the United States already is in place. We are fully prepared to begin launching our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valve in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval.
In Europe, where we began to fully launch Trifecta during the fourth quarter of 2010, tissue valves sales exceeded expectations and increased over 30% on a year-over-year basis during the first quarter of 2011. We are optimistic that we can achieve a similar rate of growth in the United States within a comparable period of time.
Second, is our Unified quadripolar CRT-D system. We are awaiting FDA response to our completed CMA supplement submission. Although the timing of regulatory approvals can never be predicted, we are optimistic that we will receive FDA approval for our unified Quadra product line around the middle of this year. Just as with Trifecta, we are ready to hit the ground running. Our field organization has already been trained, inventories are in place to support a strong launch of our unified quadripolar product line in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval. Our experience in Europe with a quadripolar CRT-D system makes us optimistic that our unified Quadra product line will help us gain meaningful share in the United States once we have approval to bring it to market.
Third, CardioMEMS. CardioMEMS has informed us that the FDA has granted expedited review status to the CardioMEMS PMA application. Expedited PMA review reflects a rare level of priority for the CardioMEMS technology from a public policy perspective. Keep in mind that the CardioMEMS Champion trial showed a 39% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared with best standard of care during an average follow-up duration of 15 months. This is exactly the kind of technology that is demanded by Health Care Reform and by increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology available for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. 
Also, the patient population targeted by the CardioMEMS technology includes heart failure patients who already are indicated for an ICD or CRT therapy as well as heart failure patients who are not currently indicated for St. Jude Medical device. We, therefore, expect CardioMEMS technology to help St. Jude Medical develop the CRM market and influence CRM market share gains as well as become an independent new growth driver for St. Jude Medical. The CardioMEMS technology remains on track for full launch in the United States in 2012.
Moving beyond these top three new growth drivers, we have continued to make substantial progress on our entire portfolio of other new growth drivers since our last update to you on February 4. We received FDA approval for our new ablation catheters for our AF business, FDA approval of our ShockGuard technology designed to reduce inappropriate and unnecessary shocks for patients in need of the defibrillation therapy and we announced this week that we have received CE Mark approval for our Accent MRI pacemaker. 
We also recently received regulatory approval in Japan for our unified and fortified lines of ICDs and for epic line of stented tissue valves. With respect our transcatheter aortic valve implant or TADI program, we expect the first human implant of our TADI products within the next few weeks. Although these first implants will be occurring slightly later than first predicted, this does not delay our expected time to market. We still are on track to enter the TADI market in Europe by the first half of 2013.
With respect our deep brain stimulation or DBS program, sales results during the first quarter with our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator slightly exceeded our expectations. DBS sales still represent a small portion of our business, but we are beginning to gain the traction we need with our DBS program in Europe to validate that DBS will truly be a significant new growth driver for St. Jude Medical. 
Sequential quarter sales growth for our new line of left atrial appendage or LAA closure devices in Europe and for our new Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT products was similarly encouraging during Q1. We will offer more specific updates about these in all of our new growth drivers as we pass major milestones or as otherwise appropriate during the remainder of this year.
While these are just a portion of the numerous growth drivers St. Jude Medical has in placed, we would like to open it up for questions to be sure we are addressing the topics that are most interest to those of you who are active on this call. 
Before we do so, however, I would like to note that in the three months that have been lapsed since our last quarterly earnings call, our gross margin has strengthened. We have continued to invest in R&D at an elevated rate. We initiated a quarterly dividend and our sales growth and earnings growth outlook have both improved. We're off to a good start, making 2011 another very successful year for St. Jude Medical. 
With that, I will stop and turn it over to the moderator to open the call for questions. Sir, would you please moderate the questions."

As we've mentioned, partly in the last call and partly at the February 4 conference, when you look closely at the percent of the available population that is potentially impacted by the JAMA article, it amounted to just a very small percent of the total opportunity and really was not material at the total global basis when we look at the anticipated growth rate of the global CRM market. And our conviction that way  was further reinforced by the HRS editorial that was published to a recently pointing the many limitations of the JAMA article. For a little more color, let me pass it over the President of our U.S. Group President and acting President of our U.S. division, Mike Rousseau, offering more color on what we are seeing in the U.S. here during the first quarter with respect to the impact of the JAMA article.

And so please just give me that flexibility. With respect to Japan, I don't think that anybody can really appreciate the severity and consequences of the earthquake and particularly the tsunami and then the nuclear events that have happened in Japan, unless someone is really closely talking to a number of people who are living to those experiences. and I am just absolutely amazed at what our team in Japan has gone through and is continuing to go through. We've got about 650 employees there. We have a lot more family members in the total St. Jude Medical group there in Japan. And we've got people who have been sleeping in offices. We have people with all kinds of adaptation on communications, the commuter lines have been shut down and otherwise, disrupted. The rolling power outages continue to this day and have just kind of impacted, people couldn't imagine. We have at least one hospital where we have enjoyed a very high market share that is just gone as a result of the tsunami. The level of disruption to people's lives into their families, into their emotions and to their focus and concentration is something that people just cannot imagine based on the limited media coverage that we see here in the United States, but when we are having our multiple daily communications directly with people on the ground there, we have just so much empathy and sorrow and respect for everything that our group has gone through and has stepped up to overcome and is continuing to step up to overcome. And having said all of that, the people's priority is just put into perspective. The modest significance of our business versus other events in people's lives. As so people's priority appropriately are towards the families and towards working to help others who were impacted by this devastation, rather than focusing with the normal level of priority in our business. So that's a little bit of a personal observation. I wanted to pass along. And then on the topic of more of a business process, as we work to model what's the impact here for the remainder of this year, we have no modeling algorithm. So we haven't had this experience. We can't look at what happened last time obviously. And the highest priority is not the people who are you about forecast what the impact of the remainder of this year. So having said all of that, the most that we thought was productive, Bob here, was to estimate the volume total dollar amount impacting Q1. It was really what is up about $5 million. An estimate that we expect that if I billion dollars to $30 million of the additional impact for the rest of this year. But as far as I said thing it finer, it isn't something that we want our team in Japan to distract themselves with first. And secondly, nobody really has history to use to fine-tune their forecast. So I'm not going to, I can't offer any more insight other than to say that this is clearly a negative across-the-board to our business in Japan and with biggest part of our business being our CRM business, it's clearly a negative to the CRM business, but on the other hand, as you look, you see that we maintained our guidance for the year. The Q1 results toward the upper end of the guidance even with a hole in our results from the late quarter impact of events in Japan. So all in all, taking into account everything that people would ask about, whether it's rate of market growth, whether it's ASP pressure, whether it's impact of Japan, whether it's competitive pressures, all in all, our CRM business is really performing very solidly up towards the upper end of our expectations and really the issue that is, the big issue in our mind for outlook in our CRM business is when will we get FDA approval for our unified Quadra line. That's really the issue. The rest of the things that people focus on are solidly on track where there really relatively insignificant. It's really all about FDA approval, timing of FDA approval of our quadripolar CRT-D system."

The enrollment rates are continuing except to say that the enrollment rates are continuing as expected. So there's really nothing remarkable there and no change to the update that was provided in our annual investor conference. with respect to the AGA integration generally, this has been a great acquisition and a great integration experience. I mean and we knew it was going to be. So when you start off with AGA team that really is just a top team and then remember that our integration strategy was basically to both on AGA to our Cardiovascular Division and to make the investment on the additional SG&A to facilitate that. You could anticipate that this would be seamless and it really has been seamless. The additional parts of the integration that are kind of at the margins, but you'll see play through our results and play through our income statement in our international markets during the first quarter, we did negotiate some changes and distributor arrangements. You'll notice that the total dollar amount of the inventory step up this quarter versus what we talked about last quarter has increased. That's the function of the inventory impact of some of our distributor buyouts. You could anticipate with the changes in distribution as we buyout distributors where it make sense and where it's mutually agreeable and work to convert to our direct St. Jude Medical organization. You could anticipate that there would be some short-term disruptions to sales growth as part of that process, as well as you see some fluctuations in inventory step up amount. But all of that is -- and then with the distributor buyouts that puts additional training burden into our program plans to transition the distributor business from our direct people, so you see some SG&A impact from our expanding our direct group where we need to and doing our internal training, and internal launch plans as we transition to product line. So you'll see some the implications of that in our results, but what I think what we're  really focused on is making sure that we're starting to get traction from our direct organization on the left atrial appendage occlusion in particular, we are very encouraged by that level of traction. It's not a material increase yet, but it's a positive indicator. But what we want to see is we need to see those kinds of leading indicators in the AGA business continue to encourage us during this year, setting up meaningful additional organic sales growth from of the AGA portfolio for 2012. So we're  one quarter in the year and so far so good and I would now just got to get the same kinds of results and build on these leading indicators in the next three quarters and we'll be positioned for a very strong 2012 with organic sales growth on the cardiovascular side of our business."

The warning letter has had a huge impact of release of products to the U.S. As you know, during throughout 2010, one could see depressed growth rates in our U.S. AF business, and that was very much affected by the warning letter. So that's first. Second, the impact of the warning letter is and has been fully taking into account with our initial guidance and with our revised guidance her e. For some additional color, maybe what I point out is when you're looking at -- when people are looking at our AF results, the consolidated sales growth on a reported basis was 15%, and that was certainly decent. But if you break it out into international  and U.S., international growth is 18%, the U.S. growth was 10%. And keep in mind that then international side of the business, we really do have a full line of ablation catheters. On the U.S. side of the business, we've been operating without a competitive line of ablation catheters. And so the takeaway might have in that, that we continue to gain share internationally and in the U.S. where we have, where we are competing. But in the U.S., we have a whole on the ablation side of the business and we really have not been competing with ablation catheters in the U.S. in any meaningful way. So if you were to take the market size, the market growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. out of our numbers and say that's a special issue, it counts but that's a special issue. Then you'd see that where we have products and where we are competing in the U.S. we're continuing to take share, then raising the question of when do we get start to have competitive product offerings and really start to compete in the U.S. with ablation catheters. We just issued a press release on April 4 announcing FDA approval for our sapphire blue and therapy cool platform ablation catheters. So they didn't help us at all in Q1. They will help us now for the remainder of this year. Those are our first competitive product offerings on the ablation segment of the U.S. market. And so that's kind of how I would dissect it. When you say that our original guidance was a little over old to you in may be some others and now what's happening come I think you've just seen a reflecting of our philosophy that if were going to air, we're  going to air on the site of being conservative. And we've all read spin well rewarded for under promising and over delivering. And we're  happy to be patient in offering guidance that we have a very high confidence, we can meet or exceed. And if are able to raise our guidance from quarter to quarter, we take that as all positive indications of the health and future and growth profile of the business."

Can you maybe talk us through the Delta from 8% to 10%, is that mostly an improvement in end markets that they to do such as neuromodulation which you referenced negatively impacted by the economy?

And so I mean the there's a lot going on there for -- we mentioned that although this wasn't, we always flagged that our quadripolar CRT-D system and was one of the most important growth drivers in the nearer term. We've flagged it in the near term, that the Trifecta pericardial and tissue valve's, growth driver in the U.S. here is a big deal in the term. We flagged that beginning in 2012, we think quite a bit of the arguments technology and think it deserves a good priority in people's attention, but there's -- everything had its own characteristics with out of those 18 new growth drivers, plus the additional quadripolar CRT-D system.

I apologize that we can't offer that information to you, but the best thing I can say about Trifecta, I remember that International business, just offered some additional color with some details in our February 4 meeting in response to a similar question. My memory isn't good enough to remember exactly what that additional detail was that Demi offered. What I am prepared for is that I think the best indicator would be to say that we began full launch, full commercial release of Trifecta in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, our total tissue valve business in Europe grew faster than 30%. And so there's an indicator. And we are confident enough -- I mean, our field organizations is already trained the launch material is completely prepared, positioned, to implement the inventory is completely staged. So we are ready to go literally within days of FDA approval of Trifecta. And we're really on a daily basis, awaiting FDA approval of Trifecta. Our sense is, there always is some inefficiency in the initial steps of the launch. There always is the need to schedule meetings, the need to schedule basis. The need to schedule meetings with multiple people in customer accounts that -- so it's never like best case out of the chute in the real world. We don't expect it to be best case out of the chute in the United States. But we think that a couple of quarters into full commercial release that we would expect to see our U.S. tissue business growing above 30% in the same way that we see it growing above 30% in our International business. So the total size of this opportunity is smaller than some of the other major new growth drivers that we're working to capture, but the degree of assurance and the small level of risk to our upside and our confidence that we're going to fully capture this upside here with Trifecta is very high. So as soon as we've got that approval, we're going to start launching. And we're  optimistic here that is going to make a difference to our sales growth rate in the U.S. in the cardiovascular business in the second half of 2011 and again, in 2012."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,376,000,000, up approximately 9% over the $1,262,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year and at the upper end of our total sales guidance range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,385,000,000. Favorable fo",2400,"Thank you, Dan. Sales for the quarter totaled $1,376,000,000, up approximately 9% over the $1,262,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year and at the upper end of our total sales guidance range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,385,000,000. 
Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased to this quarter's sales by about $17 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment, but the actual average exchange rates during the first quarter were within our previous guidance range. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter sales increased approximately 8% versus last year, and first quarter sales increased approximately 5% on an organic basis. Also, as you may recall, during the first quarter of 2010, a competitor announced the suspension of all sales of their ICD products in the United States. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our first quarter 2010 U.S. ICD sales by approximately $25 million. If we adjust to reflect this one-time benefit, our first quarter 2011 sales were up approximately 10% on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, we estimate that the impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami on our international sales was approximately $5 million in the quarter, primarily in our CRM business.
During the first quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $19 million, or $0.06 per share, primarily related to AGA Medical integration expenses associated with contract termination costs in international locations. Also, in connection with the AGA Medical acquisition, we continued to amortize the acquired inventory step up to cost of sales. 
In the first quarter, we recognized $15 million in cost of sales related to this item, and we expect the remaining $15 million will be absorbed in the cost of sales during the second quarter of 2011. Comments during this call referencing first quarter results and guidance for full year 2011 results, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
One additional item to note in the first quarter of 2011 was the inclusion of a $7 million expense from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico that is included in the other expense line item. This additional expenses is almost entirely offset by a corresponding $6 million tax benefit reflecting the tax credit available in the United States related to the Puerto Rico excise tax, the net effect of which reduced our income tax rate to 22%. Taken together, these two items, therefore, did not affect earnings per share.
Earnings per share were $0.80 for the first quarter of 2011, a 7% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010 and above our guidance range of $0.77 to $0.79. On a currency neutral basis, and excluding the impact of a competitor's suspension of ICD sales in the first quarter of 2010, we estimate earnings per share increased approximately 8%. 
Before we discuss our first quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2011, let me comment on foreign currency.
As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.32 to $1.37; and for the yen, each JPY 80 to JPY 85 would translate into USD $1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these assumptions. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2011, we are taking into account the recent strength in the euro and are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.39 to $1.44. 
The U.S. dollar, however, has strengthened relative to the yen, and as a result, we now expect each JPY 82 to JPY 87 to translate into USD $1. These changes in assumptions regarding currency exchange rates add approximately $25 million to $30 million to our total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2011. However, we believe the impact of recent unfortunate events in Japan on the remainder of 2011 will essentially offset the favorable impact of currency.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the first quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM sales, which includes revenues from both our ICD and pacemakers product lines, were $762 million, up 1% from last year's first quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter CRM sales were essentially flat versus a strong first quarter from last year. Excluding the $25 million impact from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, total first quarter 2011 CRM sales increased 5% versus last year's first quarter. 
For the first quarter, ICD sales were $465 million, up 3% from last year's first quarter. On a currency basis, first quarter ICD sales increased 2% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $280 million, flat versus last year's first quarter. And international ICD sales were $185 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations.
Excluding the $25 million impact from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, first quarter 2011 ICD sales increased 9% versus last year's first quarter. And U.S. first quarter 2011 ICD sales also increased 9% versus the same time period. 
For low voltage devices, sales for the first quarter totaled $297 million, down 1% from last year's first quarter. On a constant currency basis, first quarter low voltage device sales decreased 2% versus last year.  
In the United States, pacemaker sales were $131 million, up 2% from last year's first quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $166 million, down 3% from the first quarter of 2010, principally in Japan, including $4 million of favorable foreign currency translations. As I mentioned earlier, we saw an impact on the sales in the quarter due to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. 
In addition, the prior year period included certain pacemaker sales in Japan that were sold through a distributor in 2010, which we are in the process of transitioning to our direct sales force. While we believe this transition will ultimately be beneficial to our business, the timing of the transition negatively impacted the first quarter.
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $790 million to $820 million. And for the full year 2011, we continue to expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. 
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the first quarter, totaled $195 million, up 15% over the first quarter of last year, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, first quarter AF product sales increased 13% versus last year. 
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $190 million to $205 million, and we are increasing our full year 2011 AF product sales guidance to now be in the range of $780 million to $810 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2011 were $327 million, up 28% over the first quarter of 2010, including $6 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, first quarter cardiovascular product sales increased to 25% versus last year. Organic cardiovascular product sales growth was approximately 7%. 
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, with the acquisition of AGA Medical, we will now be breaking out our sales of cardiovascular products in two categories: structural heart products and vascular products. 
Sales of heart valve products along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories. 
Within this category of products, sales of structural products in the first quarter of 2011 were $143 million, an increase of 66% over the first quarter of 2010, or 65% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the first quarter of 2011 were $184 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2010, or 5% on a constant currency basis.
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $325 million to $340 million, and we are raising our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales guidance to now be in the range of $1,325,000,000 to $1,355,000,000.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2011 were $92 million, up 10% from the first quarter of 2010, including $1 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the second quarter of 2011, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million, and we continue to expect full year 2011 neuromodulation sales in the range of $410 million to $435 million.
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 49% of St. Jude Medical sales in the first quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 51% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the first quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
If you review our updated sales guidance for 2011, you will note that we have increased both the lower and upper end of our sales outlook by $15 million due to the strength of our results in the AF and cardiovascular product lines. 
In addition, as a result of a more favorable currency assumption, we now expect 2011 sales to benefit approximately $25 million to $30 million. However, we are taking a reduction in our 2011 sales expectation that offsets this currency impact tied to the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We estimate that approximately $12 million to $17 million of the reduction in Japan sales will occur in the second quarter.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.6%, up slightly from the first quarter of 2010. We were encouraged by the gross profit margin this quarter, which primarily reflects improved manufacturing efficiencies along with a favorable product mix. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for 2011 and now expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.8% to 74.3%, up 30 basis points from our outlook one quarter ago.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 35.5% of net sales, an increase of 40 basis points over the first quarter of 2010. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points in 2011. 
For the full year 2011, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.7% to 35.2%. Given the fixed nature of a portion of these expenses, our full year 2011 guidance includes the expectation that we will leverage these costs in future periods.
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were 12.8% of net sales compared with 12.0% of sales in the first quarter of 2010. We estimate that this 80 basis point increase in R&D as a percentage of sales reduced EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.03. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect R&D expense to stay in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of net sales as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $26 million in the first quarter, which includes $7 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. For the second quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $25 million. And for the full year 2011, we expect other expense of approximately $100 million to $110 million. 
For the first quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0%. This includes a $6 million benefit reflecting the credit available in the U.S. related to the Puerto Rico excise tax. As mentioned, the Puerto Rico excise tax is reported in other expense while the offsetting federal income tax credit is reflected as a reduction to income tax expense. For 2011, we now expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%, which reflects the financial statement presentation reporting the Puerto Rico excise tax in other expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter 2011, we had $664 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,637,000,000 in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. 
Before I move on to our EPS outlook, I would like to comment on our cash dividend which we initiated this quarter. The initial quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on April 29, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2011. This dividend reflects our commitment to rewarding shareholders through value creation and demonstrates our confidence in our growth profile, earnings power and future cash flow generation. 
We believe we are at a scale where we can commit to a quarterly dividend program while continuing to invest in research and development, perform periodic share repurchases and make acquisitions where appropriate and cost-effective.
Next I want to offer some comment regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 332 million to 334 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 also at 332 million to 334 million. The weighted average outstanding share guidance for the full year is up from our previously stated full year guidance of 329 million to 331 million. 
The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. And for the full year 2011, we now expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.33. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."
301667,129591793,115955,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2011",2011-04-20,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. During the first quarter, we continued to make good progress developing the new growth drivers we need to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. For those of you who are new to the St. Jude",1046,"Thank you, John. During the first quarter, we continued to make good progress developing the new growth drivers we need to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. 
For those of you who are new to the St. Jude Medical story, we reviewed all of these new growth drivers in detail during our Annual Investor Conference held on February 4. I'm not going to repeat that review on this call, but I would like to offer updates on a few of our key near-term priorities.
The three new growth drivers that are most important to St. Jude Medical in the near term are first, the U.S. launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves; second, the U.S. launch of our Unify Quadra, quadripolar CRT-D system; and third, our progress with respect to CardioMEMS. 
First, Trifecta. We expect FDA approval of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves before the end of this quarter. Sales training in the United States already has been completed. The inventory needed to support a strong product launch in the United States already is in place. We are fully prepared to begin launching our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval.
In Europe, where we began to fully launch Trifecta during the fourth quarter of 2010, tissue valve sales exceeded expectations and increased over 30% on a year-over-year basis during the first quarter of 2011. We are optimistic that we can achieve a similar rate of growth in the United States within a comparable period of time.
Second is our Unify Quadra, quadripolar CRT-D system. We are awaiting FDA response to our completed PMA supplement submission. Although the timing of regulatory approvals can never be predicted, we are optimistic that we will receive FDA approval for our Unify Quadra product line around the middle of this year. Just as with Trifecta, we are ready to hit the ground running. Our field organization has already been trained. Inventory is in place to support a strong launch of our Unify quadripolar product line in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval. Our experience in Europe with our quadripolar CRT-D system makes us optimistic that our Unify Quadra product line will help us gain meaningful share in the United States once we have approval to bring it to market.
Third, CardioMEMS. CardioMEMS has informed us that the FDA has granted expedited review status to the CardioMEMS PMA application. Expedited PMA review reflects a rare level of priority for the CardioMEMS technology from a public policy perspective. Keep in mind that the CardioMEMS CHAMPION trial showed a 39% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared with best standard of care during an average follow-up duration of 15 months. This is exactly the kind of technology that is demanded by health care reform and by increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology available for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. 
Also, the patient population targeted by the CardioMEMS technology includes heart failure patients who already are indicated for an ICD or CRT therapy, as well as heart failure patients who are not currently indicated for a St. Jude Medical device. We therefore expect CardioMEMS technology to help St. Jude Medical develop the CRM market and influence CRM market share gains, as well as become an independent new growth driver for St. Jude Medical. The CardioMEMS technology remains on track for full launch in the United States in 2012.
Moving beyond these top three new growth drivers, we have continued to make substantial progress on our entire portfolio of other new growth drivers since our last update to you on February 4. We received FDA approval for our new ablation catheters for our AF business, FDA approval of our ShockGuard technology designed to reduce inappropriate and unnecessary shocks for patients in need of the defibrillation therapy. And we announced this week that we have received CE Mark approval for our Accent MRI pacemaker. 
We also recently received regulatory approval in Japan for our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs and for our Epic line of stented tissue valves. With respect to our transcatheter aortic valve implant, or TAVI program, we expect the first human implant of our new TAVI products within the next few weeks. Although these first implants will be occurring slightly later than first predicted, this does not delay our expected time to market. We still are on track to enter the TAVI market in Europe by the first half of 2013.
With respect to our deep brain stimulation, or DBS program, sales results during the first quarter with our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator slightly exceeded our expectations. DBS sales still represent a small portion of our business, but we are beginning to gain the traction we need with our DBS program in Europe to validate that DBS will truly be a significant new growth driver for St. Jude Medical. 
Sequential quarter sales growth for our new line of left atrial appendage, or LAA, closure devices in Europe and for our new Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT products, was similarly encouraging during Q1. We will offer more specific updates about these and all of our other new growth drivers as we pass major milestones, or as is otherwise appropriate, during the remainder of this year.
While these are just a portion of the numerous growth drivers St. Jude Medical currently has in place, we would like to open it up for questions to be sure we are addressing the topics that are of most interest to those of you who are active on this call. 
Before we do so, however, I would like to note that in the three months that have elapsed since our last quarterly earnings call, our gross margin has strengthened, we have continued to invest in R&D at an elevated rate, we initiated a quarterly dividend and our sales growth and earnings growth outlook have both improved. We're off to a good start, making 2011 another very successful year for St. Jude Medical. 
With that, I will stop and turn it over to the moderator to open the call for questions. Sarah, would you please moderate the questions?"

The short answer is that those issues are very small issues, Michael, with little impact on the global CRM market. As we've mentioned, partly in the last call and partly at the February 4 conference, when you look closely at the percent of the available population that is potentially impacted by the JAMA article, it amounted to just a very small percent of the total opportunity and really was not material on a total global basis when we look at the anticipated growth rate of the global CRM market. And our conviction that way was further reinforced by the HRS editorial that was published here recently, pointing out the many limitations of the JAMA article. For a little more color, let me pass it over to the President of our U.S. -- Group President and Acting President of our U.S. division, Mike Rousseau, to offer any more color on what we are seeing in the U.S. here during the first quarter with respect to the impact of the JAMA article.

And so please just give me that flexibility. With respect to Japan, I don't think that anybody can really appreciate the severity and consequences of the earthquake, particularly the tsunami and then the nuclear events that have happened in Japan, unless someone is really closely talking with a number of people who are living through those experiences. And I am just absolutely amazed at what our team in Japan has gone through and is continuing to go through. We've got about 650 employees there. We have a lot more family members in the total St. Jude Medical group there in Japan. And we've got people who have been sleeping in offices. We have people with all kinds of adaptation on communications. The commuter lines have been shut down and otherwise, disrupted. The rolling power outages continue to this day and have just the kind of impact that people couldn't imagine. We have at least one hospital where we have enjoyed a very high market share that is just gone as a result of the tsunami. The level of disruption to people's lives and to their families and to their emotions and to their focus and concentration is something that people just cannot imagine based on the limited media coverage that we see here in the United States. But when we are having our multiple daily communications directly with people on the ground there, we have just so much empathy and sorrow and respect for everything that our group has gone through and has stepped up to overcome and is continuing to step up to overcome. And having said all of that, the people's priority is -- this puts into perspective the modest significance of our business versus other events in people's lives. And so people's priority appropriately are toward their families and toward working to help others who were impacted by this devastation, rather than focusing with the normal level of priority and our business. And that's a little bit of a personal observation I wanted to pass along. And then on the topic of more of a business process, as we work to model what's the impact here for the remainder of this year, it's that we have no modeling algorithm. So we haven't had this experience. We can't look at what happened last time, obviously. And so we are -- and the highest priority is not for people to argue about the nits in a forecast for what the impact will be for the remainder of this year. So having said all of that, the most that we thought was productive, Bob, here, was to estimate the total dollar amount impacting Q1. It was really very modest at about $5 million, and then to estimate that we expect $25 million to $30 million of additional impact for the rest of this year. But as far dissecting it finer, it isn't something that we want our team in Japan to distract themselves with first. And secondly, nobody really has a history to use to fine-tune their forecast. So I'm not going to -- so I can't offer any more insight other than to say that this is clearly a negative across-the-board to our business in Japan. And with biggest part of our business being our CRM business, it's clearly a negative to the CRM business. But on the other hand, as you look, you see that we have maintained our guidance for the year. The Q1 results were toward the upper end of the guidance, even with a hole in our results from the late quarter impact of events in Japan. So all in all, taking into account everything that people would ask about, whether it's a rate of total market growth, whether it's ASP pressure, whether it's impact of Japan, whether it's competitive pressures, all in all, our CRM business is really performing very solidly, up toward the upper end of our expectations. And really, the issue that is -- the big issue in our mind for outlook in our CRM business is when will we get FDA approval for our Unify Quadra line. That's really the issue. And the rest of the things that people focus on are solidly on track, or they're really relatively insignificant. It's really all about FDA approval, timing of FDA approval of our quadripolar CRT-D system."

The enrollment rates are continuing, except to say that the enrollment rates are continuing as expected. So there's really nothing remarkable there and no change to the update that was provided at our Annual Investor Conference. With respect to the AGA integration generally, this has been just a great acquisition and a great integration experience, and we knew it was going to be. So when you start off with an AGA team, that really is just a top team. And then remember that our integration strategy was basically to bolt on AGA to our Cardiovascular Division and to make the investment on the additional SG&A to facilitate that. You could anticipate that this would be seamless, and it really has been seamless. The additional parts of the integration that are kind of at the margin but that you'll see play through our results and play through our income statement are -- in our international markets there during the first quarter, we did negotiate some changes and distributor arrangements. You'll notice that the total dollar amount of the inventory step up this quarter versus what we talked about last quarter has increased. That's a function of the inventory impact of some of our distributor buyouts. You could anticipate with the changes in distribution as we buyout distributors where it make sense and where it's mutually agreeable and work to convert to our direct St. Jude Medical organization. You could anticipate that there would be some short-term disruptions to sales growth as part of that process, as well as you see some fluctuations in the inventory step up amount. But all of that is -- an then, with the distributor buyouts, that puts additional training burden into our program plans to transition the distributor business to our direct people. So you see some SG&A impact from our expanding our direct group where we need to and doing our internal training and internal launch plans as we transition the product line to us. So you'll see the implications of that in our results. But what I think what we're really focused on is making sure that we're starting to get traction from our direct organization on the left atrial appendage occlusion in particular, which I mentioned we are very encouraged by that level of traction. It's not a material increase in sales yet, but it's a positive leading indicator. What we want to see is we want to see those kinds of leading indicators in the AGA business continue to encourage us during this year, setting up meaningful additional organic sales growth from the AGA portfolio for 2012. So we're one quarter into the year, and so far, so good. And now, we've just got to get the same kinds of results and build on these leading indicators in the next three quarters and we'll be positioned for a very strong 2012, with organic sales growth on the cardiovascular side of our business."

So you see in our results, only 3% growth in our U.S. spinal cord stimulation business here in the first quarter. And so that's a pure insight into the SCS market in the U.S. And it's clearly slowed. And it's clearly slowed due to kind of macroeconomics and recession and loss of medical coverage and expiration of COBRA coverage and reluctance of patients indicated for a spinal stimulation system to make the copay. So no question that it slowed. This is the part of our business that has been most impacted by negative macroeconomics. And you didn't ask, but I know you see it. And I'll just point out for others that on the International side, where we delivered 38% growth in international neuromodulation businesses, is continuing to go as we'd like to see it. The spinal cord stimulation market has plenty of opportunity in it. It hasn't had the same depression that we see from the U.S. spinal cord stimulation market and in the international market. That 38% growth number reflects what I referred to previously when I said that the Deep Brain Stimulation sales with our Brio rechargeable system have modestly exceeded expectations. So we're looking forward to bringing more new growth drivers into the International business with the idea that, that gives people some advanced insight into the growth rate that we'll see restored to the U.S. as these same technologies come into the U.S. And with respect to the spinal cord stimulation market generally in the U.S., we do expect that market to recover as the economy recovers and as unemployment rates drop here in the U.S."

And now having the benefit of those -- and I mentioned that our methodology would be to say that now, here's the new normal for the CRM market growth. And we'll expect the CRM market to continue growing in 2011 at about the rate that it grew in 2010. So that's just a reminder to folks on how we said we were looking at the CRM market. We now calculate that the global CRM market in 2010 grew in round numbers, grew about 2%. And so we are expecting -- and I'm just going to call that low single-digit. So we're expecting the CRM market -- we think the CRM market is growing at a low single-digit rate. We expect the global CRM market to continue growing at a low single-digit rate here in 2011. On the ASP pressure side, we see nothing unusual on ASP pressures. And that means that the environment continues to be an environment of significant ASP pressure but offset by continuing innovation and the value of continuing innovation and the mix that results from new products, new technologies. They get a price premium added to the older generation devices where price pressure is severe. All of that calculates to about a low single-digit pressure on ASPs here on a total global basis in our CRM business. And that's what we've historically seen, and that's what we continue to see.

The warning letter has had a huge impact on release of products to the U.S. And as you know, throughout 2010, one could see depressed growth rates in",508,"Sure. Derrick, I'll start with the last part of your question here, on the impact of the warning letter. The warning letter has had a huge impact on release of products to the U.S. And as you know, throughout 2010, one could see depressed growth rates in our U.S. AF business. And that was very, very much affected by the warning letter. So that's first. Second, the impact of the warning letter is and has been fully taken into account with our initial guidance and with our revised guidance here. For some additional color, maybe what I point out is when you're looking at -- when people are looking at our AF results, the consolidated sales growth on a reported basis were 15%, and that was certainly decent. But if you break it out into International  and U.S., the International growth is 18%, the U.S. growth was 10%. And keep in mind then that on the international side of the business, we really do have a full line of ablation catheters. On the U.S. side of the business, we've been operating without a competitive line of ablation catheters. And so a takeaway that one might have from that is that we continue to gain share internationally and in the U.S. where we are competing. But in the U.S., we have a whole on the ablation side of the business, and we really have not been competing with ablation catheters in the U.S. in any meaningful way. So if you were to take the market size and market growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. out of our numbers and say that's a special issue, it counts but that's a special issue. Then you'd see that where we have products and where we are competing in the U.S., we're continuing to take share. Then raising the question of when do we get -- start to have competitive product offerings and really start to compete in the U.S. with ablation catheters, we just issued a press release on April 4 announcing FDA approval for our Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path ablation catheters. So they didn't help us at all in Q1. They will help us now for the remainder of this year. Those are our first competitive product offerings in the ablation segment of the U.S. market. And so that's kind of how I would dissect it. When you say that our original guidance look a little low to you and maybe to some others and now what's happened, I think you've just seen a reflection of our philosophy that if we're going to err, we're going to err on the side of being conservative. And we've always been well rewarded for under promising and over delivering. And we're happy to be patient in offering guidance that we have a very high confidence we can meet or exceed. And if we are able to raise our guidance from quarter to quarter, we take that as all positive indications for the health and future and growth profile of the business."

I apologize that we can't offer that information to you. And the best thing I could say about Trifecta -- I remember that our President of our International business, Denis Gestin, offered some additional color with some detail in our February 4 meeting in response to a similar question. My memory isn't good enough to remember exactly what that additional detail was that Denis offered, but what I am prepared for is -- I think the best indicator would be to say that we began full launch, full commercial release of Trifecta in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, our total tissue valve business in Europe grew faster than 30%. And so there is an indicator. And we are confident enough, I mean, our field organization is already trained. The launch material is completely prepared, positioned to implement. The inventory is completely staged. So we are ready to go literally within days of FDA approval of Trifecta. And we're really, on a daily basis, awaiting FDA approval of Trifecta. Our sense is, there always is some inefficiency in the initial steps of a launch. There always is the need to schedule meetings, the need to schedule cases, the need to schedule meetings with multiple people in customer accounts that -- so it's never like best case out of the chute in the real world. So we don't expect it to be best case out of the chute in the United States. But we think that a couple of quarters into full commercial release, that we would expect to see our U.S. tissue business growing above 30% in the same way that we see it growing above 30% in our International business. So the total size of this opportunity is smaller than some of the other major new growth drivers that we're working to capture, but the degree of assurance and the small level of risk to our upside and our confidence that we're going to fully capture this upside here with Trifecta is very high. So as soon as we've got that approval, we're going to start launching. And we're  optimistic here that this is going to make a difference to our sales growth rate in the U.S. in the Cardiovascular business in the second half of 2011 and again, in 2012."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,376,000,000, up approximately 9% over the $1,262,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year and at the upper end of our total sales guidance range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,385,000,000. Favorable fo",2400,"Thank you, Dan. Sales for the quarter totaled $1,376,000,000, up approximately 9% over the $1,262,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year and at the upper end of our total sales guidance range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,385,000,000. 
Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased to this quarter's sales by about $17 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment, but the actual average exchange rates during the first quarter were within our previous guidance range. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter sales increased approximately 8% versus last year, and first quarter sales increased approximately 5% on an organic basis. Also, as you may recall, during the first quarter of 2010, a competitor announced the suspension of all sales of their ICD products in the United States. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our first quarter 2010 U.S. ICD sales by approximately $25 million. If we adjust to reflect this one-time benefit, our first quarter 2011 sales were up approximately 10% on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, we estimate that the impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami on our international sales was approximately $5 million in the quarter, primarily in our CRM business.
During the first quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $19 million, or $0.06 per share, primarily related to AGA Medical integration expenses associated with contract termination costs in international locations. Also, in connection with the AGA Medical acquisition, we continued to amortize the acquired inventory step up to cost of sales. 
In the first quarter, we recognized $15 million in cost of sales related to this item, and we expect the remaining $15 million will be absorbed into cost of sales during the second quarter of 2011. Comments during this call referencing first quarter results and guidance for full year 2011 results, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
One additional item to note in the first quarter of 2011 was the inclusion of a $7 million expense from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico that is included in the other expense line item. This additional expense is almost entirely offset by a corresponding $6 million tax benefit reflecting the tax credit available in the United States related to the Puerto Rico excise tax, the net effect of which reduced our income tax rate to 22%. Taken together, these two items, therefore, did not affect earnings per share.
Earnings per share were $0.80 for the first quarter of 2011, a 7% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010 and above our guidance range of $0.77 to $0.79. On a currency neutral basis, and excluding the impact of a competitor's suspension of ICD sales in the first quarter of 2010, we estimate earnings per share increased approximately 8%. 
Before we discuss our first quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2011, let me comment on foreign currency.
As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.32 to $1.37; and for the yen, each JPY 80 to JPY 85 would translate into USD $1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these assumptions. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2011, we are taking into account the recent strength in the euro and are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.39 to $1.44. 
The U.S. dollar, however, has strengthened relative to the yen, and as a result, we now expect each JPY 82 to JPY 87 to translate into USD $1. These changes in assumptions regarding currency exchange rates add approximately $25 million to $30 million to our total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2011. However, we believe the impact of recent unfortunate events in Japan on the remainder of 2011 will essentially offset the favorable impact of currency.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the first quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM sales, which includes revenues from both our ICD and pacemakers product lines, were $762 million, up 1% from last year's first quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, first quarter CRM sales were essentially flat versus a strong first quarter from last year. Excluding the $25 million impact from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, total first quarter 2011 CRM sales increased 5% versus last year's first quarter. 
For the first quarter, ICD sales were $465 million, up 3% from last year's first quarter. On a currency basis, first quarter ICD sales increased 2% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $280 million, flat versus last year's first quarter. And international ICD sales were $185 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations.
Excluding the $25 million impact from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, first quarter 2011 ICD sales increased 9% versus last year's first quarter. And U.S. first quarter 2011 ICD sales also increased 9% versus the same time period. 
For low voltage devices, sales for the first quarter totaled $297 million, down 1% from last year's first quarter. On a constant currency basis, first quarter low voltage device sales decreased 2% versus last year.  
In the United States, pacemaker sales were $131 million, up 2% from last year's first quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $166 million, down 3% from the first quarter of 2010, principally in Japan, including $4 million of favorable foreign currency translations. As I mentioned earlier, we saw an impact on the sales in the quarter due to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. 
In addition, the prior year period included certain pacemaker sales in Japan that were sold through a distributor in 2010, which we are in the process of transitioning to our direct sales force. While we believe this transition will ultimately be beneficial to our business, the timing of the transition negatively impacted the first quarter.
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $790 million to $820 million. And for the full year 2011, we continue to expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,170,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. 
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the first quarter, totaled $195 million, up 15% over the first quarter of last year, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, first quarter AF product sales increased 13% versus last year. 
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $190 million to $205 million, and we are increasing our full year 2011 AF product sales guidance to now be in the range of $780 million to $810 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2011 were $327 million, up 28% over the first quarter of 2010, including $6 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, first quarter cardiovascular product sales increased to 25% versus last year. Organic cardiovascular product sales growth was approximately 7%. 
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, with the acquisition of AGA Medical, we will now be breaking out our sales of cardiovascular products in two categories: structural heart products and vascular products. 
Sales of heart valve products along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories. 
Within this category of products, sales of structural products in the first quarter of 2011 were $143 million, an increase of 66% over the first quarter of 2010, or 65% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the first quarter of 2011 were $184 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2010, or 5% on a constant currency basis.
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $325 million to $340 million, and we are raising our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales guidance to now be in the range of $1,325,000,000 to $1,355,000,000.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2011 were $92 million, up 10% from the first quarter of 2010, including $1 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the second quarter of 2011, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million, and we continue to expect full year 2011 neuromodulation sales in the range of $410 million to $435 million.
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 49% of St. Jude Medical sales in the first quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 51% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the first quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
If you review our updated sales guidance for 2011, you will note that we have increased both the lower and upper end of our sales outlook by $15 million due to the strength of our results in the AF and cardiovascular product lines. 
In addition, as a result of a more favorable currency assumption, we now expect 2011 sales to benefit approximately $25 million to $30 million. However, we are taking a reduction in our 2011 sales expectation that offsets this currency impact tied to the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We estimate that approximately $12 million to $17 million of the reduction in Japan sales will occur in the second quarter.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.6%, up slightly from the first quarter of 2010. We were encouraged by the gross profit margin this quarter, which primarily reflects improved manufacturing efficiencies along with a favorable product mix. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for 2011 and now expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.8% to 74.3%, up 30 basis points from our outlook one quarter ago.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were at 35.5% of net sales, an increase of 40 basis points over the first quarter of 2010. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points in 2011. 
For the full year 2011, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.7% to 35.2%. Given the fixed nature of a portion of these expenses, our full year 2011 guidance includes the expectation that we will leverage these costs in future periods.
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were 12.8% of net sales compared with 12.0% of sales in the first quarter of 2010. We estimate that this 80 basis point increase in R&D as a percentage of sales reduced EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.03. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect R&D expense to stay in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of net sales as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $26 million in the first quarter, which includes $7 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. For the second quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $25 million. And for the full year 2011, we expect other expense of approximately $100 million to $110 million. 
For the first quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0%. This includes a $6 million benefit reflecting the credit available in the U.S. related to the Puerto Rico excise tax. As mentioned, the Puerto Rico excise tax is reported in other expense while the offsetting federal income tax credit is reflected as a reduction to income tax expense. For 2011, we now expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%, which reflects the financial statement presentation reporting the Puerto Rico excise tax in other expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter 2011, we had $664 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,637,000,000 in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. 
Before I move on to our EPS outlook, I would like to comment on our cash dividend which we initiated this quarter. The initial quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on April 29, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2011. This dividend reflects our commitment to rewarding shareholders through value creation and demonstrates our confidence in our growth profile, earnings power and future cash flow generation. 
We believe we are at a scale where we can commit to a quarterly dividend program while continuing to invest in research and development, perform periodic share repurchases and make acquisitions where appropriate and cost-effective.
Next I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 332 million to 334 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 also at 332 million to 334 million. The weighted average outstanding share guidance for the full year is up from our previously stated full year guidance of 329 million to 331 million. 
The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. And for the full year 2011, we now expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.33. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

During the first quarter, we continued to make good progress developing the new growth drivers we need to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. For those of you who are new to the St. Jude",1046,"Thank you, John. During the first quarter, we continued to make good progress developing the new growth drivers we need to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis. 
For those of you who are new to the St. Jude Medical story, we reviewed all of these new growth drivers in detail during our Annual Investor Conference held on February 4. I'm not going to repeat that review on this call, but I would like to offer updates on a few of our key near-term priorities.
The three new growth drivers that are most important to St. Jude Medical in the near term are first, the U.S. launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves; second, the U.S. launch of our Unify Quadra, quadripolar CRT-D system; and third, our progress with respect to CardioMEMS. 
First, Trifecta. We expect FDA approval of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves before the end of this quarter. Sales training in the United States already has been completed. The inventory needed to support a strong product launch in the United States already is in place. We are fully prepared to begin launching our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval.
In Europe, where we began to fully launch Trifecta during the fourth quarter of 2010, tissue valve sales exceeded expectations and increased over 30% on a year-over-year basis during the first quarter of 2011. We are optimistic that we can achieve a similar rate of growth in the United States within a comparable period of time.
Second is our Unify Quadra, quadripolar CRT-D system. We are awaiting FDA response to our completed PMA supplement submission. Although the timing of regulatory approvals can never be predicted, we are optimistic that we will receive FDA approval for our Unify Quadra product line around the middle of this year. Just as with Trifecta, we are ready to hit the ground running. Our field organization has already been trained. Inventory is in place to support a strong launch of our Unify quadripolar product line in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval. Our experience in Europe with our quadripolar CRT-D system makes us optimistic that our Unify Quadra product line will help us gain meaningful share in the United States once we have approval to bring it to market.
Third, CardioMEMS. CardioMEMS has informed us that the FDA has granted expedited review status to the CardioMEMS PMA application. Expedited PMA review reflects a rare level of priority for the CardioMEMS technology from a public policy perspective. Keep in mind that the CardioMEMS CHAMPION trial showed a 39% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared with best standard of care during an average follow-up duration of 15 months. This is exactly the kind of technology that is demanded by health care reform and by increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology available for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. 
Also, the patient population targeted by the CardioMEMS technology includes heart failure patients who already are indicated for an ICD or CRT therapy, as well as heart failure patients who are not currently indicated for a St. Jude Medical device. We therefore expect CardioMEMS technology to help St. Jude Medical develop the CRM market and influence CRM market share gains, as well as become an independent new growth driver for St. Jude Medical. The CardioMEMS technology remains on track for full launch in the United States in 2012.
Moving beyond these top three new growth drivers, we have continued to make substantial progress on our entire portfolio of other new growth drivers since our last update to you on February 4. We received FDA approval for our new ablation catheters for our AF business, FDA approval of our ShockGuard technology designed to reduce inappropriate and unnecessary shocks for patients in need of the defibrillation therapy. And we announced this week that we have received CE Mark approval for our Accent MRI pacemaker. 
We also recently received regulatory approval in Japan for our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs and for our Epic line of stented tissue valves. With respect to our transcatheter aortic valve implant, or TAVI program, we expect the first human implants of our new TAVI products within the next few weeks. Although these first implants will be occurring slightly later than first predicted, this does not delay our expected time to market. We still are on track to enter the TAVI market in Europe by the first half of 2013.
With respect to our deep brain stimulation, or DBS program, sales results during the first quarter with our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator slightly exceeded our expectations. DBS sales still represent a small portion of our business, but we are beginning to gain the traction we need with our DBS program in Europe to validate that DBS will truly be a significant new growth driver for St. Jude Medical. 
Sequential quarter sales growth for our new line of left atrial appendage, or LAA, closure devices in Europe and for our new Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT products, was similarly encouraging during Q1. We will offer more specific updates about these and all of our other new growth drivers as we pass major milestones, or as is otherwise appropriate, during the remainder of this year.
While these are just a portion of the numerous growth drivers St. Jude Medical currently has in place, we would like to open it up for questions to be sure we are addressing the topics that are of most interest to those of you who are active on this call. 
Before we do so, however, I would like to note that in the three months that have elapsed since our last quarterly earnings call, our gross margin has strengthened, we have continued to invest in R&D at an elevated rate, we initiated a quarterly dividend and our sales growth and earnings growth outlook have both improved. We're off to a good start, making 2011 another very successful year for St. Jude Medical. 
With that, I will stop and turn it over to the moderator to open the call for questions. Sarah, would you please moderate the questions?"

The short answer is that those issues are very small issues, Michael, with little impact on the global CRM market. As we've mentioned, partly in the last call and partly at the February 4 conference, when you look closely at the percent of the available population that is potentially impacted by the JAMA article, it amounted to just a very small percent of the total opportunity and really was not material on a total global basis when we look at the anticipated growth rate of the global CRM market. And our conviction that way was further reinforced by the HRS editorial that was published here recently, pointing out the many limitations of the JAMA article. For a little more color, let me pass it over to the President of our U.S. -- Group President and Acting President of our U.S. division, Mike Rousseau, to offer any more color on what we are seeing in the U.S. here during the first quarter with respect to the impact of the JAMA article.

And so please just give me that flexibility. With respect to Japan, I don't think that anybody can really appreciate the severity and consequences of the earthquake, particularly the tsunami and then the nuclear events that have happened in Japan, unless someone is really closely talking with a number of people who are living through those experiences. And I am just absolutely amazed at what our team in Japan has gone through and is continuing to go through. We've got about 650 employees there. We have a lot more family members in the total St. Jude Medical group there in Japan. And we've got people who have been sleeping in offices. We have people with all kinds of adaptation on communications. The commuter lines have been shut down and otherwise, disrupted. The rolling power outages continue to this day and have just the kind of impact that people couldn't imagine. We have at least one hospital where we have enjoyed a very high market share that is just gone as a result of the tsunami. The level of disruption to people's lives and to their families and to their emotions and to their focus and concentration is something that people just cannot imagine based on the limited media coverage that we see here in the United States. But when we are having our multiple daily communications directly with people on the ground there, we have just so much empathy and sorrow and respect for everything that our group has gone through and has stepped up to overcome and is continuing to step up to overcome. And having said all of that, the people's priority is -- this puts into perspective the modest significance of our business versus other events in people's lives. And so people's priority appropriately are toward their families and toward working to help others who were impacted by this devastation, rather than focusing with the normal level of priority and our business. And that's a little bit of a personal observation I wanted to pass along. And then on the topic of more of a business process, as we work to model what's the impact here for the remainder of this year, it's that we have no modeling algorithm. So we haven't had this experience. We can't look at what happened last time, obviously. And so we are -- and the highest priority is not for people to argue about the nits in a forecast for what the impact will be for the remainder of this year. So having said all of that, the most that we thought was productive, Bob, here, was to estimate the total dollar amount impacting Q1. It was really very modest at about $5 million, and then to estimate that we expect $25 million to $30 million of additional impact for the rest of this year. But as far dissecting it finer, it isn't something that we want our team in Japan to distract themselves with first. And secondly, nobody really has a history to use to fine-tune their forecast. So I'm not going to -- so I can't offer any more insight other than to say that this is clearly a negative across-the-board to our business in Japan. And with the biggest part of our business being our CRM business, it's clearly a negative to the CRM business. But on the other hand, as you look, you see that we have maintained our guidance for the year. The Q1 results were toward the upper end of the guidance, even with a hole in our results from the late quarter impact of events in Japan. So all in all, taking into account everything that people would ask about, whether it's a rate of total market growth, whether it's ASP pressure, whether it's impact of Japan, whether it's competitive pressures, all in all, our CRM business is really performing very solidly, up toward the upper end of our expectations. And really, the issue that is -- the big issue in our mind for outlook in our CRM business is when will we get FDA approval for our Unify Quadra line. That's really the issue. And the rest of the things that people focus on are solidly on track, or they're really relatively insignificant. It's really all about FDA approval, timing of FDA approval of our quadripolar CRT-D system."

The enrollment rates are continuing, except to say that the enrollment rates are continuing as expected. So there's really nothing remarkable there and no change to the update that was provided at our Annual Investor Conference. With respect to the AGA integration generally, this has been just a great acquisition and a great integration experience, and we knew it was going to be. So when you start out with an AGA team, that really is just a top team. And then remember that our integration strategy was basically to bolt on AGA to our Cardiovascular Division and to make the investment on the additional SG&A to facilitate that. You could anticipate that this would be seamless, and it really has been seamless. The additional parts of the integration that are kind of at the margin but that you'll see play through our results and play through our income statement are -- in our international markets there during the first quarter, we did negotiate some changes and distributor arrangements. You'll notice that the total dollar amount of the inventory step up this quarter versus what we talked about last quarter has increased. That's a function of the inventory impact of some of our distributor buyouts. You could anticipate with the changes in distribution as we buyout distributors where it makes sense and where it's mutually agreeable and work to convert to our direct St. Jude Medical organization. You could anticipate that there would be some short-term disruptions to sales growth as part of that process, as well as you see some fluctuations in the inventory step up amount. But all of that is -- and then, with the distributor buyouts, that puts additional training burden into our program plans to transition the distributor business to our direct people. So you see some SG&A impact from our expanding our direct group where we need to and doing our internal training and internal launch plans as we transition the product line to us. So you'll see the implications of that in our results. But what I think what we're really focused on is making sure that we're starting to get traction from our direct organization on the left atrial appendage occlusion in particular, which I mentioned we are very encouraged by that level of traction. It's not a material increase in sales yet, but it's a positive leading indicator. What we want to see is we want to see those kinds of leading indicators in the AGA business continue to encourage us during this year, setting up meaningful additional organic sales growth from the AGA portfolio for 2012. So we're one quarter into the year, and so far, so good. And now, we've just got to get the same kinds of results and build on these leading indicators in the next three quarters and we'll be positioned for a very strong 2012, with organic sales growth on the cardiovascular side of our business."

So you see in our results, only 3% growth in our U.S. spinal cord stimulation business here in the first quarter. And so that's a pure insight into the SCS market in the U.S. And it's clearly slowed. And it's clearly slowed due to kind of macroeconomics and recession and loss of medical coverage and expiration of COBRA coverage and reluctance of patients indicated for a spinal cord stimulation system to make the copay. So no question that it slowed. This is the part of our business that has been most impacted by negative macroeconomics. And you didn't ask, but I know you see it. And I'll just point out for others that on the International side, where we delivered 38% growth in international neuromodulation businesses, is continuing to go as we'd like to see it. The spinal cord stimulation market has plenty of opportunity in it. It hasn't had the same depression that we see from the U.S. spinal cord stimulation market and in the International market. That 38% growth number reflects what I referred to previously when I said that the Deep Brain Stimulation sales with our Brio rechargeable system have modestly exceeded expectations.

We now calculate that the global CRM market in 2010 grew in round numbers, grew about 2%. And so we are expecting -- and I'm just going to call that low single-digit. So we're expecting the CRM market -- we think the CRM market is growing at a low single-digit rate. We expect the global CRM market to continue growing at a low single-digit rate here in 2011. On the ASP pressure side, we see nothing unusual on ASP pressures. And that means that the environment continues to be an environment of significant ASP pressure but offset by continuing innovation and the value of continuing innovation and the mix that results from new products, new technologies. They get a price premium added to the older generation devices where price pressure is severe. All of that calculates to about a low single-digit pressure on ASPs here on a total global basis in our CRM business. And that's what we've historically seen, and that's what we continue to see. So I rambled a little bit, Larry, but I think I answered that part of your question there. On the topic of the Unify Quadra in Europe, let me ask Eric Fain for his comments."

I think as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's really a combination of improvements to our existing manufacturing operations where we're getting the benefit of some efficiencies as well as the value of the new technologies that are in our product line that tend to really drive what we characterize as kind of a mix benefit. And so the combination of those things, really, were very encouraging and stronger than what we expected this quarter and really motivated us then to raise the guidance in the gross profit margin here for the rest of the year. With respect to the impact of our recently opened facilities in Malaysia and Costa Rica, we really are yet to get benefit in the gross profit margin from those activities. And so that really is a positive trend that we'll develop here overtime, but is not yet reflected in our results."

The warning letter has had a huge impact on release of products to the U.S. And as you know, throughout 2010, one could see depressed growth rates in",508,"Sure. Derrick, I'll start with the last part of your question here, on the impact of the warning letter. The warning letter has had a huge impact on release of products to the U.S. And as you know, throughout 2010, one could see depressed growth rates in our U.S. AF business. And that was very, very much affected by the warning letter. So that's first. Second, the impact of the warning letter is and has been fully taken into account with our initial guidance and with our revised guidance here. For some additional color, maybe what I point out is when you're looking at -- when people are looking at our AF results, the consolidated sales growth on a reported basis were 15%, and that was certainly decent. But if you break it out into International  and U.S., the International growth is 18%, the U.S. growth was 10%. And keep in mind then that on the international side of the business, we really do have a full line of ablation catheters. On the U.S. side of the business, we've been operating without a competitive line of ablation catheters. And so a takeaway that one might have from that is that we continue to gain share internationally and in the U.S. where we are competing. But in the U.S., we have a hole on the ablation side of the business, and we really have not been competing with ablation catheters in the U.S. in any meaningful way. So if you were to take the market size and market growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. out of our numbers and say that's a special issue, it counts but that's a special issue. Then you'd see that where we have products and where we are competing in the U.S., we're continuing to take share. Then raising the question of when do we get -- start to have competitive product offerings and really start to compete in the U.S. with ablation catheters, we just issued a press release on April 4 announcing FDA approval for our Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path ablation catheters. So they didn't help us at all in Q1. They will help us now for the remainder of this year. Those are our first competitive product offerings in the ablation segment of the U.S. market. And so that's kind of how I would dissect it. When you say that our original guidance looked a little low to you and maybe to some others and now what's happened, I think you've just seein a reflection of our philosophy that if we're going to err, we're going to err on the side of being conservative. And we've always been well rewarded for under promising and over delivering. And we're happy to be patient in offering guidance that we have a very high confidence we can meet or exceed. And if we are able to raise our guidance from quarter to quarter, we take that as all positive indications for the health and future and growth profile of the business."

We've flagged it in the near term, the Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve growth driver in the U.S. here is a big deal in the nearest term. We flagged that beginning in 2012, we think quite a bit of the CardioMEMS technology and think it deserves a good priority in people's attention.

I apologize that we can't offer that information to you. And the best thing I could say about Trifecta -- I remember that our President of our International business, Denis Gestin, offered some additional color with some detail in our February 4 meeting in response to a similar question. My memory isn't good enough to remember exactly what that additional detail was that Denis offered, but what I am prepared for is -- I think the best indicator would be to say that we began full launch, full commercial release of Trifecta in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, our total tissue valve business in Europe grew faster than 30%. And so there is an indicator. And we are confident enough, I mean, our field organization is already trained. The launch material is completely prepared, positioned to implement. The inventory is completely staged. So we are ready to go literally within days of FDA approval of Trifecta. And we're really, on a daily basis, awaiting FDA approval of Trifecta. Our sense is, there always is some inefficiency in the initial steps of a launch. There always is the need to schedule meetings, the need to schedule cases, the need to schedule meetings with multiple people in customer accounts that -- so it's never like best case out of the chute in the real world. So we don't expect it to be best case out of the chute in the United States. But we think that a couple of quarters into full commercial release, that we would expect to see our U.S. tissue business growing above 30% in the same way that we see it growing above 30% in our International business. So the total size of this opportunity is smaller than some of the other major new growth drivers that we're working to capture, but the degree of assurance and the small level of risk to our upside and our confidence that we're going to fully capture this upside here with Trifecta is very high. So as soon as we've got that approval, we're going to start launching. And we're  optimistic here that this is going to make a difference to our sales growth rate in the U.S. in the Cardiovascular business in the second half of 2011 and again, in 2012."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, up approximately 10% over the $1,313,000,000 reported in the second quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, up approximately 10% over the $1,313,000,000 reported in the second quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year second quarter increased this quarter sales by about $75 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment, but the actual average exchange rates during the second quarter were within our previous guidance range.
On a constant currency basis, second quarter sales increased approximately 4% versus last year. Also as you may recall, for the first 2 selling weeks of the second quarter of 2010, a competitor had suspended all sales of their ICD products in the United states. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our second quarter 2010 U.S. ICD sales by approximately $15 million. If we adjust to reflect this onetime benefit from our second quarter 2011 sales were up approximately 11% on an as reported basis, and 6% on a constant currency basis.
During the second quarter, in connection with the AGA Medical acquisition, we continued to amortize the acquired inventory step up to cost of sales. In this quarter, we recognized the remaining after-tax charges of $10 million or $0.03 per share in cost of sales related to this item. 
In addition, we recognized $32 million or $0.10 per share in other after-tax charges, primarily related to restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within our CRM business. This relates to our May 12, 2011, press release and announcement in Sweden that we are transitioning CRM manufacturing to a more cost advantage locations.
In addition to the cost recognized this quarter, we expect future costs associated with this transition to be approximately $60 million to $80 million or $45 million to $60 million in after-tax charges, which will be recognized over the next several quarters. We estimate that when fully implemented, the transition of CRM manufacturing to more cost advantaged locations will generate approximately an addition of $40 million to $50 million in annual savings.
Additional information about these charges can be found in today's press release.
Comments during this call referencing second quarter results and guidance for our full year 2011 results including earnings per share will be exclusive of these items. Earnings per share were $0.85 for the second quarter of 2011, an 8% increase over adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 in the second quarter of 2010. 
Before we discuss our second quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the third quarter and the remainder of 2011, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year -- the third quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.39 to $1.44 and that each JPY 82 to JPY 87 would translate into USD $1. 
For the second quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these assumptions. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and remainder of 2011, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.37 to $1.42 and that each JPY 78 to JPY 83 will translate into USD $1.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the second quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $793 million, up 1% from last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter CRM sales were down 4% versus the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $50 million benefit from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, total second quarter 2011 CRM sales increased 3% versus last year's second quarter.
For the second quarter, ICD sales were $477 million, up 1% from last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter ICD sales decreased 3% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $272 million, down 9% versus last year second quarter. International ICD sales were $205 million, a 20% increase over the second quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Excluding the $50 million impact from a competitor being off the market for ICD products a year ago, total second quarter 2011 ICD sales increased 5% versus last year's second quarter, and U.S. second quarter 2011 ICD sales decreased 5% versus the same time period a year ago.
For a low-voltage devices, sales for the second quarter totaled $360 million, essentially equal to last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter low-voltage device sales decreased 6% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $129 million, down 8% from last year's second quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $187 million, up 6% from the second quarter of 2010, including $18 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million. For the full year 2011, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,060,000,000 to $3,120,000,000.
At the midpoint of this guidance range, our 2011 CRM sales would be up approximately 3% versus 2010. After adjusting our 2010 sales for the onetime benefit of a competitor being off the market in the U.S. This revised 2011 guidance range for St. Jude Medical is primarily the result of a slowdown in the CRM market and does not change our continued expectation that we will increase our global CRM market share in 2011. Our revised CRM sales guidance for 2011 also takes into account our updated expectation that we will have our unified quadripolar CRT-D system available in the United States by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $208 million, slightly exceeding the top end of our guidance range and up 18% over the second quarter of last year, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, second quarter AF product sales increased 11% versus last year. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $185 million to $200 million. As a result of the strong performance in the first half of 2011, we are raising the top end of our full year 2011 AF product sales guidance range by $15 million. We now expect our 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $800 million to $825 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2011 were $342 million, slightly exceeding the top end of our guidance range for the quarter and up 35% over the second quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, second-order cardiovascular product sales increased 26% versus last year. As discussed on prior calls, we now breakout our sales of cardiovascular products into 2 categories, structural heart and vascular. Sales of heart valve products along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage club are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories. 
For the second quarter of 2011, sales of structural heart products were $153 million, an increase of 74% over the second quarter of 2010 or 65% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the second quarter of 2011 were $189 million, a 14% increase over the second quarter of 2010 or 6% on a constant currency basis.
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $315 million to $330 million. We are raising our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales guidance to be in the range of $1,335,000,000 to $1,360,000,000.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2011 were $104 million, up 9% from the second quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $98 million to $103 million and we expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales in the range of $410 million to $425 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 47% of St. Jude Medical sales in the second quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 53% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical's sales for the second quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.5%, up 80 basis points from the second quarter of 2010. We continue to be encouraged by our strong gross margin, which primarily reflects improved manufacturing efficiencies along with a favorable product mix. As a result, we are raising our gross profit margin outlook for 2011 to now be in the range of 74.0% to 74.5%. Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 35.5% of net sales, an increase of 140 basis points over the second quarter of 2010. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points during 2011. 
For the full year 2011, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 35.0% to 35.5%.
Research and development expenses or R&D in the second quarter of 2011 was 12.2% of net sales, compared with 11.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we expect R&D as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $25 million in the second quarter, which includes $8 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. 
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will again be a net expense of approximately $25 million. For the full year 2011, we expect another of the other expense of approximately $100 million to $105 million.
For the second quarter, the company's effective tax rate was 22.0% and for 2011, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet, at the end of the second quarter of 2011, we had $833 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,566,000,000 in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with the group of banks. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the third quarter and full year 2011.
In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the third quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 334 million to 336 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 at $332 million to $334 million. 
For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.76 and for the full year 2011, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

The data that became available after our Q1 earnings conference call shows that the global CRM market contracted between 1% and 2% during Q1 on a year-over-year basis.

The data that became available after our Q1 earnings conference call shows that the global CRM market contracted between 1% and 2% during Q1 on a year-over-year basis. As a conservative measure until we see results to the contrary, we will assume that the global CRM market will contract approximately 2% for full year 2011. This change in assumption means we expect the global CRM market to be approximately $11.4 billion for full year 2011, instead of the $11.9 billion size we assumed on our earnings conference call last quarter.
Since our share of the global CRM market is approximately 26% or 27%, this market model changed effectively reduces the CRM sales revenue we expect for 2011 by approximately $130 million to $135 million. 
Although the CRM market contracted during the first quarter and may continue to contract on a year-over-year basis throughout the remainder of 2011, we continue to believe that for us, the CRM market glass is half-full, not half empty. We see $8.5 billion of global CRM market held by vulnerable competitors. We took share from both of our major competitors in the CRM market in 2010 and expect to do so again in 2011 and again in 2012.
With our current market share momentum, our pipeline of highly visible product advantages and the favorable tailwind created by replacement market dynamics, we are optimistic that our CRM business will grow at a level that allow St. Jude Medical to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis in future periods.
The most important variable impacting the growth of our CRM franchise for the remainder of this year is the timing of FDA approval for our unified Quadra and Quartet quadripolar CRT-D products. Our guidance assumes we will have these products available in the United States by the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, where our quadripolar CRT-D products are fully launched, CRT-D units and revenue grew more than 20% during the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
In the United States, our quadripolar CRT-D sales training for our field organization is complete. Product launch inventory is ready, and we are prepared to initiate a full launch of these products within days of receiving FDA approval.
I would like to devote the remainder of my prepared remarks to review in highlight of the progress we are making in implementing the 18 new growth drivers we discussed during our 2011 annual investor conference in February. We have said previously that in the near term, 2 of our most important new growth drivers are Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program and our CardioMEMS program. With respect to our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program, we began to launch this product line in the United States toward the end of April. Early sales results are fully meeting our expectations. We are not going to start breaking out this number separately, but as an indication of the success of this new growth driver, we will disclose that during the second quarter global tissue valves sales grew over 30% on a year-over-year basis.
We expect our tissue valve franchise to continue growing at an elevated levels during the remainder of this year as we deliver full quarter results for our Trifecta valve launch in the United States and for our epic valve launch in Japan. 
A second major growth driver, we applied for special attention in the near term relates to our program with CardioMEMS. As a reminder, the CardioMEMS Champion trial reported a 39% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared with best standard of care during an average follow-up duration of 15 months in patients suffering from class 3 heart failure. As we have said previously, this is exactly the kind of technology that will be favored under Health Care Reform and by increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology available for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. The FDA has granted expedited review status to the CardioMEMS PMA application, reflecting a high level of priority for this technology from a public policy perspective.
CMS reimbursement is already in place. We expect the CardioMEMS PMA to be reviewed by an FDA panel this fall followed by FDA approval and full U.S. launch in 2012. 
Moving beyond Trifecta and CardioMEMS, we are encouraged by the development of our entire portfolio of new growth drivers, which continues to meet or exceed the expectations we established earlier this year. In our transcatheter aortic valve implant or TAVI program, we already have multiple implants and are on track to begin our pivotal clinical trial for CE Mark purposes in the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate launching our Portico line of Pati valves in Europe by the first half of 2013.
With respect to our Left Atrial Appendage or LAA closure program, LAA closure revenue in Europe grew over 30% sequentially in Q2. Although the absolute revenue is still modest, we are making strong progress integrating LAA closure into the larger St. Jude Medical program in Europe and are just beginning to capture St. Jude Medical synergies. We fully expect our LAA closure revenue to contribute significant growth to our structural heart and AF programs in 2012 and beyond.
In the United States, we are finishing the feasibility portion of the IDE. We are submitting to FDA this month for permission to begin the pivotal phase of our LAA closure IDE clinical trial. 
Next, I'd like to transition from the structural heart component of our Cardiovascular Division our CVD business to the Vascular Component of our CVD business. The most important new growth drivers in our Vascular business in the near term are our Fractional Flow Reserve or FFR product lines and our Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT product lines. Taken together, we are using these product lines to compete for our share of the $600 million market for FFR and intravascular imaging and to expand this market with evidence of comparative effectiveness both from a cost perspective and from a clinical perspective. We are just beginning to launch our illimium line of integrated FFR OCT technology in Europe and expect to launch this product soon in the United States as well.
We estimate that we are on track to exit 2011 with approximately a 33% share of the relevant market and that our market share will continue to grow in 2012 due to the strength of our integrated FFR and OCT program. We are continuing to expand the breadth of these product lines and develop the clinical evidence, reimbursement and customer acceptance needed to transform our first to market vascular technologies into major new growth drivers longer-term.
Moving onto to substantial progress we are making with our emerging renal business. We continue to keep details of our technology confidential for competitive reasons, but as we have previously stated, we view the renal market as a major new growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical and a resource of robust develop and program to capture this opportunity. Our program has progressed to the point where we now expect CE Mark and a limited launch in Europe before the end of 2012. We will continue to provide updates on this major new growth program as appropriate.
Next, I would like to review the most significant new growth drivers we have resource within our Neuromodulation business or NMD. Q2 was a productive quarter for our Neuromodulation business. We are especially focused on the progress we are making with our Deep Brain Stimulation or DBS business in Europe for Parkinson's disease with our Brio line of DBS products and our Athena position programmer. Our DBS products grew approximately 30% sequentially in Q2 and helped our international Neuromodulation sales grow 50% on a year-over-year basis. Similar to what we have said about our LAA closure business, our DBS business in Europe is still a small part of our total sales, but is showing the right early indicators of becoming a significant contributor to help accelerate our sales growth in 2012 and beyond.
We are making good progress expanding our DBS business beyond the indication for Parkinson's disease as reflected last week in our press release announcing that FDA has approved expansion of our broaden pivotal trials investigating this, extent to which stimulating an area of the brain known as brod, an area 25 is a safe and effective method for treating severe depression.
In the second quarter, we also reported the initial results of our Neuromodulation pivotal trial for peripheral or occipital nerve stimulation for patients suffering from treatment resistant migraine. The feedback on the clinical experts we work with in this program is that our clinical trial results were highly favorable and convincing for the proposition that our Neuromodulation system for treatment resistant migraine is both safe and effective and deserves to be available to patients on a commercial basis. We expect to receive CE Mark approval and begin to launch this product in Europe for the end of this year. We will provide an update with respect to migraine as a potential new growth driver in the United States after we have adequate visibility in the current FDA requirements for approval of this indication.
With respect to the business managed by our AF division or AFD, revenue growth during the second quarter was 18% on a year-over-year basis and confirms that our AF growth program is on track. The international component of our AF business grew 24% on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter. We view this result as an early indicator of the growth we expect to see with our AF franchise in the United States as we continue to bring new technologies to the U.S. that already are available and gaining market share in Europe. This includes our cool flex and CompactFlash of ablation catheters, as well as the MediGuide technology we are beginning to roll out in Europe on a limited basis.
To conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to refer back to the main points and conclusions we offered during our annual investor conference in February of this year. First, we have a balanced portfolio of major new growth drivers to support our goal of returning to sustained double-digit growth of sales. Second, we have clear visibility into ongoing EPS leverage from our strategy of expanding manufacturing in cost advantaged locations. Third, we have a strong balance sheet and cash flow to continue to repurchase stock and fund discipline acquisitions as appropriate. And finally, St. Jude Medical's overall program for superior long-term growth is both robust and on track. Our guidance tells you that we expect to see our constant currency organic sales growth accelerate in the fourth quarter, setting up expectations for encouraging growth in 2012. The midpoint of our sales guidance implies constant currency organic sales growth of approximately 6% in the second quarter.
We now like to open it up for your questions, and I'll turn it back to our operator to monitor."

This is, I think this is just an example of the uncertainty associated with any regulatory process, and I would not read anything else into it. And with respect to the timing of -- the new timing where you've said that our guidance assumes that we will have the quadripolar system approved here for the fourth quarter, that's different than saying that we are confident about that. What we're seeing is that based on our ongoing communications with FDA, that's our current expectation. We may beat that expectation. We may miss that expectation, but we're  giving you the data so that if we announce approval sooner, you can anticipate upside to our guidance. If we announce approval later, you could anticipate some negative impact on our guidance. So we're just working to make our thinking completely visible. On the topic of exact market share tied to quadripolar, we don't offer our guidance with that level of specificity. Instead, what one would have to do is look at what we've said for market growth assumption, which is a year-over-year minus 2% for full year 2011. And look at what we've indicated for our total CRM sales here on a global basis, neither of which directly answers your question, but I'm sorry, that's the best that we're going to do here on this call. I can tell you, there's a little more to your point and is working to get a sense of what's our confidence that quadripolar will be a vehicle for very meaningful share gains. Our confidence there is really very high. And for all of the reasons that physicians have responded so favorably to the quadripolar system in Europe, and you can get an indicator of that from their comment in our prepared remarks that where the systems already are in the market, we've got 20%, over 20% year-over-year increase, both on the unit and on a revenue basis. So that would be maybe a good proof point that we will gain meaningful share with this technology in the United States and a supporting  comment might be that the impact of new technologies in Europe typically is slower than the impact of new technologies in the United States for a lot of different reasons, that includes that CE Mark doesn't get us into all parts of the European market, #1. For example, we only launch the quadripolar CRT-D system in France during the second quarter, just as one example. And then secondly, the impact of tenders in Europe is significant and tends to have -- tends to cause a bit of a lag in the uptake of new technology versus the dynamics that we work here in the United States. So you and others have commented on here in the past and we certainly commented on the past, Eric Fain spelled out in some significant amount in February investors conference, the reasons that, that quadripolar CRT-D system was expected to have such a good impact on market share shift and our experience to date is that it does have that kind of impact on market share shift and when we get us here in the United States, we would have a lot of confidence and a lot of optimism that, that will have every meaningful impact on share shift here in the United States."

Rick, you're not reading too much subtlety in our  comments. We do a lot of work to get it exactly right on what we say, and between the lines, the message was the former, not the later of your 2 propositions. And so we see that the CRM market based on everybody's reported numbers, contracted between 1% and 2%, and really, is less than 2%, but between 1% and 2% in this first quarter, and so we're airing on the side, if we're  going to air, we're going to air in the side of being conservative to say okay, then let's just pull in expectations. This is the right time to do it, let's do it all at once, pull in expectations, leave ourselves with the possibility of upside and announce as we have this morning then that as a conservative measure, we're just going to assume that the global CRM market will contract 2%, which is more than it contracted in Q1, but 2% for full year. Clearly, there's upside to that. What we see here in the market is that the U.S. CRM market fell into a pothole during the second quarter. It's 28% of our sales. I mean, so it's a meaningful percent, but on the other hand, it's 28% that fell into a pothole. It's not clear to us yet how much of that was timing and how much of that was something else. We're going to need the benefit of hindsight to finalize our analysis. Some of the data that we get lags in the conference call, so we're again adapting a conservative view, pulling in expectations all at once to a very conservative baseline, leaving ourselves with the possibility of upside. The factors that couple of factors that are clear to us that bear on -- it did bear on the U.S. CRM market during the second quarter and it helped create this pothole, some of it is general malaise into macroeconomics, unemployment, soft hospital admissions and some of it, you can see that and you can see some additional validation of that comment in our U.S. Neuromodulation sales, because you saw we're really flat in our U.S. Neuromodulation sales year-over-year. It tends not to draw that much attention because of the lesser-known Neuromodulation sales grew 50% in the total sales was okay, but in the U.S., the market is just weak and it's bearing on more than one product last that we have. And so it certainly is bearing on our largest product class, the CRM products. Another aspect here is it has become clear to us, we again, we get the anecdotal information, we don't get access to the information at its source, but we have customers who are not previously directly impacted by the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into reimbursement submissions here for ICDs. We have more customers who were contacted by the Department of Justice during the second quarter than in previous times. And so that's not something that we could predict and again, that's not something where we know the kind of the big picture activities are of the Department of Justice. We only find at about it when our customers get directly impacted and then they tell us that here, this is having an impact on their practice in the short term. That's hard to model on what's going to -- what the implications of that are in Q3 or in Q4. So again, we're just being conservative in saying, let's pullback expectations on a total global basis. Another there's also some soft factors that are difficult for us to model, but we have -- and we noticed that a number of positions have been very high-volume in planters in prior times and working particularly long hours, are taking a lot more time off as they transition from private practice into - becoming hospital employees, they get guaranteed vacation and they take it. So that's a soft factor and not want to make too much of, but it's enough of the factor that it is in our radar screen and it didn't it of timing, please the timing of implants here in the second quarter. So those are the main things. The other thing I'd say, Rick, would be that we're always very careful and we always caution ourselves and remind observers not to make too much of a single quarter in the CRM space. There are variations in inventory at the customer level, so you inventory loads, you get inventory de-stocking, the ASPs are relatively high versus other product we work with, so it doesn't take that many units on a total market basis to really cause changes and results during a single 90-day period. We think it's a little bit better, we've said for years here, that it's more meaningful to combine the results a couple of quarters look back at market share trends and market growth trends in the CRM space. So we do points of difference between sales numbers and implant numbers. And when we're looking at year-over-year here, we've got the complexity of Boston Scientific being off the market in the U.S. for a portion of the quarter a year ago. So there's just a lot of compounding factors and we've netted them all out to offer conservative guidance all at once and pullback all at once here for expectations for the remainder of the year."

One of them and this come back to some of the early questions that I was a little bit vague around, but the first thing is our fourth quarter assumes that we have our quadripolar CRT-D product launch at the beginning of -- by the beginning of the quarter. And so if we beat that, we've got upside, if we get that exactly, then our guidance holds. If we miss that date, then there is -- people off to start to factor in sales reductions for the fourth quarter. So that's the first thing. Second thing is that we -- let's take, for example, the Trifecta launch here. We already showed over 30% increase total global tissue valves sales in the second quarter. And we're just getting started with Trifecta, it was not a full quarter launch. The natural trends of uptake even with a full launch are that there is a selling cycle and that successful product line gains traction over some time. You don't get the full traction in the first full quarter of its launch. So we're going to have first full quarter here in Q3. We'll get higher run rate. We'll get additional confidence, enthusiasm of the Trifecta and our tissue valve program for the fourth quarter, so you see that. We've got trajectories. We've pointed to a number of these factors here, we've got trajectories that are very strong sequential quarter growth with our LAA closure product line. And then more importantly, with our FFR and OCT product lines. So then also with our deep brain stimulation product lines, so when we are talking about 30% sequential quarter growth and you start to run rate that and extrapolate that and then add to it that on our FFR OCT product line, we just started to launch our first integrated FFR OCT system in Europe, and we are optimistic that we will begin to launch that same system in the United States before the end of this quarter. And Then extrapolate that to fourth quarter implications and extrapolate that to -- we're not offering guidance for 2012, but the same kinds of things that gives us at the midpoint of our guidance about a 6% constant currency organic sales growth guidance for Q4, think about that. So how do those factors extend into 2012 and what about indications of CardioMEMS in 2012 and then certainly, we've had -- we would anticipate having strong full year benefits of our quadripolar CRT program in 2012. You can really see that we have a little bit of a mismatch and timing of our CRM market pothole and update of our numerous growth drivers here drivers and for constant currency organic sales here in Q2 and modest guidance here for Q3, but none of that should be with a sense that of anything other than our long-term growth program with numerous new growth drivers to continue significantly diversifying our portfolio and get us back to double-digit constant currency organic sustainable sales growth, but that's fully on track and not just by way of blowing smoke and waving arms, but you see it in our guidance for Q4, you see us recovering from what we are reporting today to about 6% sales growth there by those -- with those other qualifications in the fourth quarter and a person can start to think well, got to be better than in 2012, because everything is going to help in the fourth quarter is going to be even stronger in 2012 and 2012 is going to have other significant growth drivers that are not yet bearing on Q4."

The other part though, I realize this is no your question , I want to say it anyway though, just because others might be thinking along those lines. The competition here over the last period has talked about integrating their sales force as a strategy. And there, nobody's asked us about it, but you given me an excuse to throw it in anyway,  there all that competition is done is copy what we announced in the middle of 2001 where we established our U.S. division with integrated, with a lot of integration in our U.S. division and with specialty sales focus, where that is most helpful to the customer and with common management and common contract being a lot of common infrastructure where that is most helpful to optimizing our cost structure.

And the actual exchange rates during the quarter really fell within those assumptions.

And then we exceeded our sales on AF and CBD and then at the top end on our neurological business. And that all translated into strong margins and we actually had $0.85 of our earnings per share. So I think that the currency is all baked in there and really, if you look at on a year-over-year basis, you keep in mind that we've got the AGA Medical business now consolidated in with St. Jude Medical. That influences our SG&A spending. We've made specific investments in R&D that are really accelerating our R&D spending versus a year ago.

If a person goes back to fundamentals and talks about penetration into the indicated patient population, one would think back to the publication during this last quarter of UCLA's Duke Northwest group, that published data on the under penetration of the indicated technologies for heart failure patients, including the other penetration of ICD and CRT therapy for heart failure patients. And so that data was the lead author there was and I hope you will forgive me at by mispronounces name. But that publication really did a good job of indicating the range of patients whose lives are being lost every year because they're not getting therapy. We know they have on the highest was something like 68,000 patients at the mid point who are needlessly dying every year because they're not getting the known established indicated therapy that they ought to be getting. And on the ICD and CRT side, that was about almost 1/3 of the total, so it was something like at the midpoint, about 20,000 lives in the United States being lost needlessly every single year because patients aren't getting ICDs or CRT therapy that there indicated for. So that's a given and how what happens next, we could convince ourselves that we ought to see that this ought to be characterized as a pothole, which is how we characterize it. And the pothole by definition is finite and we'll climb out of a pothole, but we are humbled by the fact that we have a lot of analysis and a wide margin of error."

But more seriously, the first thing that one ought to think about on pricing is what is the premium going to be, what's the appropriate premium going to be for the new technology that we are about to put into the market here in the U.S. That would be the first significant factor that one would want to think about. And so historically, and I'm not going to tell you anything new, I'll still I can't resist, I'll just say, historically, exact apples to apples mature technology to mature technology, pricing pressure is severe. And it has been 4 years. The reason that the Pareto doesn't come to reality on what's going to happen to pricing is because of the offset of meaningful valuable new technology and resetting premium ASPs on the back of that valuable premium new technology. So and we used the example that in the past it used to be just going to have the picture pricing and what happened was high-voltage shock technology got added into a pacer and we call it an ICD. And then what happened to that, it became new ICD and then it became CRT technology and now we've got in Europe, we've got our ICD technology with ST segment monitoring we've got our ICD technology with LAP, sensor monitoring we've got quadripolar on the market in Europe, we're  about to bring quadripolar to the market in the United states, so those new technologies, of when we run dry on innovation, our discussion on ASP trends will change, but as long as we maintain a good pipeline of meaningful cost effective and clinically effective innovation, I would expect our thesis on total global ASPs to remain the same, which is yes, we continue to be under a lot of pressure. It's a topic of a lot of very active management. Everything doesn't go our way. But it all nets out to something that does limited to low single-digit decrease on a year-over-year basis.
With that, I apologize, to whoever is in the queue that we haven't able to get to, and I'd like to thank everyone for staying us longer than our normal time and I will now turn the call back to our moderator, Sarah, to read concluding comments, and we'll sign off. Thank you, everybody."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, up approximately 10% over the $1,313,000,000 reported in the second quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, up approximately 10% over the $1,313,000,000 reported in the second quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year second quarter increased this quarter sales by about $75 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment, but the actual average exchange rates during the second quarter were within our previous guidance range.
On a constant currency basis, second quarter sales increased approximately 4% versus last year. Also as you may recall, for the first 2 selling weeks of the second quarter of 2010, a competitor had suspended all sales of their ICD products in the United states. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our second quarter 2010 U.S. ICD sales by approximately $15 million. If we adjust to reflect this onetime benefit, our second quarter 2011 sales were up approximately 11% on an as reported basis, and 6% on a constant currency basis.
During the second quarter, in connection with the AGA Medical acquisition, we continued to amortize the acquired inventory step up to cost of sales. In this quarter, we recognized the remaining after-tax charges of $10 million or $0.03 per share in cost of sales related to this item. 
In addition, we recognized $32 million or $0.10 per share in other after-tax charges, primarily related to restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within our CRM business. This relates to our May 12, 2011, press release and announcement in Sweden that we are transitioning CRM manufacturing to a more cost advantage locations.
In addition to the cost recognized this quarter, we expect future costs associated with this transition to be approximately $60 million to $80 million or $45 million to $60 million in after-tax charges, which will be recognized over the next several quarters. We estimate that when fully implemented, the transition of CRM manufacturing to more cost advantaged locations will generate approximately an additional of $40 million to $50 million in annual savings.
Additional information about these charges can be found in today's press release.
Comments during this call referencing second quarter results and guidance for our full year 2011 results including earnings per share will be exclusive of these items. Earnings per share were $0.85 for the second quarter of 2011, an 8% increase over adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 in the second quarter of 2010. 
Before we discuss our second quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the third quarter and the remainder of 2011, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year -- the third quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.39 to $1.44 and that each JPY 82 to JPY 87 would translate into USD $1. 
For the second quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these assumptions. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and remainder of 2011, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.37 to $1.42 and that each JPY 78 to JPY 83 will translate into USD $1.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the second quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $793 million, up 1% from last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter CRM sales were down 4% versus the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $15 million benefit from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, total second quarter 2011 CRM sales increased 3% versus last year's second quarter.
For the second quarter, ICD sales were $477 million, up 1% from last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter ICD sales decreased 3% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $272 million, down 9% versus last year's second quarter. International ICD sales were $205 million, a 20% increase over the second quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Excluding the $15 million impact from a competitor being off the market for ICD products a year ago, total second quarter 2011 ICD sales increased 5% versus last year's second quarter, and U.S. second quarter 2011 ICD sales decreased 5% versus the same time period a year ago.
For a low-voltage devices, sales for the second quarter totaled $316 million, essentially equal to last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter low-voltage device sales decreased 6% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $129 million, down 8% from last year's second quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $187 million, up 6% from the second quarter of 2010, including $18 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million. For the full year 2011, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,060,000,000 to $3,120,000,000.
At the midpoint of this guidance range, our 2011 CRM sales would be up approximately 3% versus 2010. After adjusting our 2010 sales for the onetime benefit of a competitor being off the market in the U.S. This revised 2011 guidance range for St. Jude Medical is primarily the result of a slowdown in the CRM market and does not change our continued expectation that we will increase our global CRM market share in 2011. Our revised CRM sales guidance for 2011 also takes into account our updated expectation that we will have our unified quadripolar CRT-D system available in the United States by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $208 million, slightly exceeding the top end of our guidance range and up 18% over the second quarter of last year, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, second quarter AF product sales increased 11% versus last year. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $185 million to $200 million. As a result of the strong performance in the first half of 2011, we are raising the top end of our full year 2011 AF product sales guidance range by $15 million. We now expect our 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $800 million to $825 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2011 were $342 million, slightly exceeding the top end of our guidance range for the quarter and up 35% over the second quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, second quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 26% versus last year. As discussed on prior calls, we now breakout our sales of cardiovascular products into 2 categories, structural heart and vascular. Sales of heart valve products along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories. 
For the second quarter of 2011, sales of structural heart products were $153 million, an increase of 74% over the second quarter of 2010 or 65% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the second quarter of 2011 were $189 million, a 14% increase over the second quarter of 2010 or 6% on a constant currency basis.
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $315 million to $330 million. We are raising our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales guidance to be in the range of $1,335,000,000 to $1,360,000,000.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2011 were $104 million, up 9% from the second quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $98 million to $103 million, and we expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales in the range of $410 million to $425 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 47% of St. Jude Medical sales in the second quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 53% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical's sales for the second quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.5%, up 80 basis points from the second quarter of 2010. We continue to be encouraged by our strong gross margin, which primarily reflects improved manufacturing efficiencies along with a favorable product mix. As a result, we are raising our gross profit margin outlook for 2011 to now be in the range of 74.0% to 74.5%. Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 35.5% of net sales, an increase of 140 basis points over the second quarter of 2010. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points during 2011. 
For the full year 2011, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 35.0% to 35.5%.
Research and development expenses or R&D in the second quarter of 2011 was 12.2% of net sales, compared with 11.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we expect R&D as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $25 million in the second quarter, which includes $8 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. 
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will again be a net expense of approximately $25 million. For the full year 2011, we expect another of the other expense of approximately $100 million to $105 million.
For the second quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0% and for 2011, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter of 2011, we had $833 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,566,000,000 in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with the group of banks. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the third quarter and full year 2011.
In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the third quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 334 million to 336 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 at $332 million to $334 million. 
For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.76 and for the full year 2011, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

The data that became available after our Q1 earnings conference call shows that the global CRM market contracted between 1% and 2% during Q1 on a year-over-year basis. As a conservative measure until we see results to the contrary, we will assume that the global CRM market will contract approximately 2% for full year 2011. This change in assumption means we expect the global CRM market to be approximately $11.4 billion for full year 2011, instead of the $11.9 billion size we assumed on our earnings conference call last quarter.
Since our share of the global CRM market is approximately 26% or 27%, this market model changed effectively reduces the CRM sales revenue we expect for 2011 by approximately $130 million to $135 million. 
Although the CRM market contracted during the first quarter and may continue to contract on a year-over-year basis throughout the remainder of 2011, we continue to believe that for us, the CRM market glass is half-full, not half empty. We see $8.5 billion of global CRM market held by vulnerable competitors. We took share from both of our major competitors in the CRM market in 2010 and expect to do so again in 2011 and again in 2012.
With our current market share momentum, our pipeline of highly visible product advantages and the favorable tailwind created by replacement market dynamics, we are optimistic that our CRM business will grow at a level that allow St. Jude Medical to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis in future periods.
The most important variable impacting the growth of our CRM franchise for the remainder of this year is the timing of FDA approval for our Unify Quadra and Quartet, quadripolar CRT-D products. Our guidance assumes we will have these products available in the United States by the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, where our quadripolar CRT-D products are fully launched, CRT-D units and revenue grew more than 20% during the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
In the United States, our quadripolar CRT-D sales training for our field organization is complete. Product launch inventory is ready, and we are prepared to initiate a full launch of these products within days of receiving FDA approval.
I would like to devote the remainder of my prepared remarks to review in highlight of the progress we are making in implementing the 18 new growth drivers we discussed during our 2011 annual investor conference in February. We have said previously that in the near term, 2 of our most important new growth drivers are our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program and our CardioMEMS program. With respect to our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program, we began to launch this product line in the United States toward the end of April. Early sales results are fully meeting our expectations. We are not going to start breaking out this number separately, but as an indication of the success of this new growth driver, we will disclose that during the second quarter global tissue valves sales grew over 30% on a year-over-year basis.
We expect our tissue valve franchise to continue growing at an elevated levels during the remainder of this year as we deliver full quarter results for our Trifecta valve launch in the United States and for our Epic valve launch in Japan. 
A second major growth driver, we applied for special attention in the near term relates to our program with CardioMEMS. As a reminder, the CardioMEMS CHAMPION trial reported a 39% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared with best standard of care during an average follow-up duration of 15 months in patients suffering from Class III heart failure. As we have said previously, this is exactly the kind of technology that will be favored under Health Care Reform and by increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology available for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. The FDA has granted expedited review status to the CardioMEMS PMA application, reflecting a high level of priority for this technology from a public policy perspective.
CMS reimbursement is already in place. We expect the CardioMEMS PMA to be reviewed by an FDA panel this fall followed by FDA approval and full U.S. launch in 2012. 
Moving beyond Trifecta and CardioMEMS, we are encouraged by the development of our entire portfolio of new growth drivers, which continues to meet or exceed the expectations we established earlier this year. In our transcatheter aortic valve implant or TAVI program, we already have multiple implants and are on track to begin our pivotal clinical trial for CE Mark purposes in the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate launching our Portico line of TAVI valves in Europe by the first half of 2013.
With respect to our left atrial appendage or LAA closure program, LAA closure revenue in Europe grew over 30% sequentially in Q2. Although the absolute revenue is still modest, we are making strong progress integrating LAA closure into the larger St. Jude Medical program in Europe and are just beginning to capture St. Jude Medical synergies. We fully expect our LAA closure revenue to contribute significant growth to our structural heart and AF programs in 2012 and beyond.
In the United States, we are finishing the feasibility portion of the IDE. We are submitting to FDA this month for permission to begin the pivotal phase of our LAA closure IDE clinical trial. 
Next, I'd like to transition from the structural heart component of our Cardiovascular Division or CVD business to the Vascular component of our CVD business. The most important new growth drivers in our Vascular business in the near term are our fractional flow reserve or FFR product lines and our Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT product lines. Taken together, we are using these product lines to compete for our share of the $600 million market for FFR and intravascular imaging and to expand this market with evidence of comparative effectiveness both from a cost perspective and from a clinical perspective. We are just beginning to launch our Ilumien line of integrated FFR OCT technology in Europe and expect to launch this product soon in the United States as well.
We estimate that we are on track to exit 2011 with approximately a 33% share of the relevant market and that our market share will continue to grow in 2012 due to the strength of our integrated FFR and OCT program. We are continuing to expand the breadth of these product lines and develop the clinical evidence, reimbursement and customer acceptance needed to transform our first to market vascular technologies into major new growth drivers longer term.
Moving on to the substantial progress we are making with our emerging Renal Denervation business. We continue to keep details of our technology confidential for competitive reasons, but as we have previously stated, we view the renal denervation market as a major new growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical and of resource they robust development program to capture this opportunity. Our program has progressed to the point where we now expect CE Mark and a limited launch in Europe before the end of 2012. We will continue to provide updates on this major new growth program as appropriate.
Next, I would like to review the most significant new growth drivers we have resource within our Neuromodulation business or NMD. Q2 was a productive quarter for our Neuromodulation business. We are especially focused on the progress we are making with our Deep Brain Stimulation or DBS business in Europe for Parkinson's disease with our Brio line of DBS products and our Athena physician programmer. Our DBS products grew approximately 30% sequentially in Q2 and helped our international Neuromodulation sales grow 50% on a year-over-year basis. Similar to what we have said about our LAA closure business, our DBS business in Europe is still a small part of our total sales, but is showing the right early indicators of becoming a significant contributor to help accelerate our sales growth in 2012 and beyond.
We are making good progress expanding our DBS business beyond the indication for Parkinson's disease as reflected last week in our press release announcing that FDA has approved expansion of our broaden pivotal trial investigating this, extent to which stimulating an area of the brain known as Brodmann Area 25 is a safe and effective method for treating severe depression.
In the second quarter, we also reported the initial results of our Neuromodulation pivotal trial for peripheral or occipital nerve stimulation for patients suffering from treatment resistant migraine. The feedback on the clinical experts we work with in this program is that our clinical trial results were highly favorable and convincing for the proposition that our Neuromodulation system for treatment resistant migraine is both safe and effective and deserves to be available to patients on a commercial basis. We expect to receive CE Mark approval and begin to launch this product in Europe for the end of this year. We will provide an update with respect to migraine as a potential new growth driver in the United States after we have adequate visibility in the current FDA requirements for approval of this indication.
With respect to the business managed by our AF division or AFD, revenue growth during the second quarter was 18% on a year-over-year basis and confirms that our AF growth program is on track. The international component of our AF business grew 24% on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter. We view this result as an early indicator of the growth we expect to see with our AF franchise in the United States as we continue to bring new technologies to the U.S. that already are available and gaining market share in Europe. This includes our Cool Flex and contact lines of ablation catheters, as well as the MediGuide technology we are beginning to roll out in Europe on a limited basis.
To conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to refer back to the main points and conclusions we offered during our annual investor conference in February of this year. First, we have a balanced portfolio of major new growth drivers to support our goal of returning to sustained double-digit growth in sales. Second, we have clear visibility into ongoing EPS leverage from our strategy of expanding manufacturing in cost advantaged locations. Third, we have a strong balance sheet and cash flow to continue to repurchase stock and fund discipline acquisitions as appropriate. And finally, St. Jude Medical's overall program for superior long-term growth is both robust and on track. Our guidance tells you that we expect to see our constant currency organic sales growth accelerate in the fourth quarter, setting up expectations for encouraging growth in 2012. The midpoint of our sales guidance implies constant currency organic sales growth of approximately 6% in the second quarter.
We'd now like to open it up for your questions, and I'll turn it back to our operator to monitor."

This is, I think this is just an example of the uncertainty associated with any regulatory process, and I would not read anything else into it. And with respect to the timing of -- the new timing where you've said that our guidance assumes that we will have the quadripolar system approved here for the fourth quarter, that's different than saying that we are confident about that. What we're saying is that based on our ongoing communications with FDA, that's our current expectation. We may beat that expectation. We may miss that expectation, but we're  giving you the data so that if we announce approval sooner, you could anticipate upside to our guidance. If we announce approval later, you could anticipate some negative impact on our guidance. So we're just working to make our thinking completely visible. On the topic of exact market share tied to quadripolar, we don't offer our guidance with that level of specificity. Instead, what one would have to do is look at what we've said for market growth assumption, which is a year-over-year minus 2% for full year 2011. And look at what we've indicated for our total CRM sales here on a global basis, neither of which directly answers your question, but I'm sorry, that's the best that we're going to do here on this call. I can tell you a little more to your point and just working to get a sense of what's our confidence that quadripolar will be a vehicle for very meaningful share gains. Our confidence there is really very high. And for all of the reasons that physicians have responded so favorably to the quadripolar system in Europe, and you can get an indicator of that from their comment in our prepared remarks that where the systems already are in the market, we've got 20%, over 20% year-over-year increase, both on a unit and on a revenue basis. So that would be maybe a good proof point that we will gain meaningful share with this technology in the United States and a supporting comment might be that the impact of new technologies in Europe typically is slower than the impact of new technologies in the United States for a lot of different reasons, that includes that CE Mark doesn't get us into all parts of the European market, #1. For example, we only launch the quadripolar CRT-D system in France during the second quarter, just as one example. And then secondly, the impact of tenders in Europe is significant and tends to have -- tends to cause a bit of a lag in the uptake of new technology versus the dynamics that we work here in the United States. So you and others have commented on here in the past and we certainly commented on the past, Eric Fain spelled out in some significant amount in our February investors conference, the reasons that, that quadripolar CRT-D system was expected to have such a good impact on market share shift and our experience to date is that it does have that kind of impact on market share shift and when we get it here in the United States, we would have a lot of confidence and a lot of optimism that, that will have every meaningful impact on share shift here in the United States."

Rick, you're not reading too much subtlety into our comments. We do a lot of work to get it exactly right on what we say, and between the lines, the message was the former, not the latter of your 2 propositions. And so we see that the CRM market based on everybody's reported numbers, contracted between 1% and 2%, and really, is less than 2%, but between 1% and 2% in this first quarter, and so we're airing on the side, if we're  going to air, we're going to air on the side of being conservative to say okay, then let's just pull in expectations. This is the right time to do it, let's do it all at once, pull in expectations, leave ourselves with the possibility of upside and announce as we have this morning then that as a conservative measure, we're just going to assume that the global CRM market will contract 2%, which is more than it contracted in Q1, but 2% for full year. Clearly, there's upside to that. What we see here in the market is that the U.S. CRM market fell into a pothole during the second quarter. It's 28% of our sales. I mean, so it's a meaningful percent, but on the other hand, it's 28% that fell into a pothole. It's not clear to us yet how much of that was timing and how much of that was something else. We're going to need the benefit of hindsight to finalize our analysis. Some of the data that we get lags in the conference call, so we're again adapting a conservative view, pulling in expectations all at once to a very conservative baseline, leaving ourselves with the possibility of upside. The factors that couple of factors that are clear to us that bear on -- it did bear on the U.S. CRM market during the second quarter and it helped create this pothole, some of it is general malaise in the macroeconomics, unemployment, soft hospital admissions and some of it, you can see that and you can see some additional validation of that comment in our U.S. Neuromodulation sales, because you saw we're really flat in our U.S. Neuromodulation sales year-over-year. It tends not to draw that much attention because international Neuromodulation sales grew 50%, and the total sales was okay. But in the U.S., the market is just weak and it's bearing on more than one product class that we have. And so it certainly is bearing on our largest product class, the CRM products. Another aspect here is it has become clear to us, we again, we get the anecdotal information, we don't get access to the information at its source, but we have customers who are not previously directly impacted by the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into reimbursement submissions here for ICDs. We have more customers who were contacted by the Department of Justice during the second quarter than in previous times. And so that's not something that we could predict and again, that's not something where we know what kind of the big picture activities are of the Department of Justice. We only find at about it when our customers get directly impacted and then they tell us that here, this is having an impact on their practice in the short term. That's hard to model on what's going to -- what the implications of that are in Q3 or in Q4. So again, we're just being conservative in saying, let's pullback expectations on a total global basis. Another there's also some soft factors that are difficult for us to model, but we have -- and we noticed that a number of physicians who have been very high-volume implanters in prior times and working particularly long hours, are taking a lot more time off as they transition from private practice into becoming hospital employees, and they get guaranteed vacation and they take it. So that's a soft factor and not want to make too much of, but it's enough of the factor that it is on our radar screen and it didn't affect the timing, at least the timing of implants here in the second quarter. So those are the main things. The other thing I'd say, Rick, would be that we're always very careful and we always caution ourselves and remind observers not to make too much of a single quarter in the CRM space. There are variations in inventory at the customer level, so you get inventory loads, you get inventory de-stocking, the ASPs are relatively high versus other product we work with, so it doesn't take that many units on a total market basis to really cause changes and results during a single 90-day period. We think it's a little bit better, we've said for years here, that it's more meaningful to combine the results of a couple of quarters to look both at market share trends and at market growth trends in the CRM space. So we do find some difference between sales numbers and implant numbers. And when we're looking at year-over-year here, we've got the complexity of Boston Scientific being off the market in the U.S. for a portion of the quarter a year ago. So there's just a lot of compounding factors and we've netted them all out to offer conservative guidance all at once and pullback all at once here for expectations for the remainder of the year."

One of them and this come back to some of the early questions that I was a little bit vague around, but the first thing is our fourth quarter assumes that we have our quadripolar CRT-D product launch at the beginning of -- by the beginning of the quarter. And so if we beat that, we've got upside, if we get that exactly, then our guidance holds. If we miss that date, then there is -- people off to start to factor in sales reductions for the fourth quarter. So that's the first thing. Second thing is that we -- let's take, for example, the Trifecta launch here. We already showed over 30% increase total global tissue valves sales in the second quarter. And we're just getting started with Trifecta, it was not a full quarter launch. The natural trends of uptake even with a full launch are that there is a selling cycle and there's a successful product line that gains traction over some time. You don't get the full traction in the first full quarter of its launch. So we're going to have first full quarter here in Q3. We'll get a higher run rate. We'll get additional confidence, enthusiasm on the Trifecta and in our pool of tissue valve program for the fourth quarter, so you see that. We've got trajectories. We've pointed to a number of these factors here, we've got trajectories that are very strong sequential quarter growth with our LAA closure product line. And then more importantly, with our FFR and OCT product lines. So then also with our deep brain stimulation product lines, so when we are talking about 30% sequential quarter growth and you start to run rate that and extrapolate that and then add to it that on our FFR OCT product line, we just started to launch our first integrated FFR OCT system in Europe, and we are optimistic that we will begin to launch that same system in the United States before the end of this quarter. And then extrapolate that to fourth quarter implications and extrapolate that to -- we're not offering guidance for 2012, but the same kinds of things that gives us at the midpoint of our guidance about a 6% constant currency organic sales growth guidance for Q4, think about that. So how do those factors extend into 2012 and what about the implications of CardioMEMS in 2012 and then certainly, we've had -- we would anticipate having strong full year benefits of our quadripolar CRT program in 2012. You can really see that we have a little bit of a mismatch and timing of our CRM market pothole and update of our numerous new growth drivers here and for constant currency organic sales here in Q2 and modest guidance here for Q3, but none of that should be with a sense that of anything other than our long-term growth program with numerous new growth drivers to continue significantly diversifying our portfolio and get us back to double-digit constant currency organic sustainable sales growth, but that's fully on track and not just by way of blowing smoke and waving arms, but you see it in our guidance for Q4, you see us recovering from what we are reporting today to about 6% sales growth there by those -- with those other qualifications in the fourth quarter and a person can start to think well, it got to be better than in 2012, because everything is going to help in the fourth quarter is going to be even stronger in 2012, and 2012 is going to have other significant growth drivers that are not yet bearing on Q4."

So I think that the currency is all baked in there and really, if you look at on a year-over-year basis, you keep in mind that we've got the AGA Medical business now consolidated in with St. Jude Medical. That influences our SG&A spending. We've made specific investments in R&D that are really accelerating our R&D spending versus a year ago. So there's so many different factors now in the current period that it's really hard to isolate the currency just as one topic."

I mean and so we -- #1, we respond to that by being conservative. And then #2, we know that it has not been predictable, and so we've got a lot of people as others do, we have a lot of people spending a lot of time analyzing everything that one could imagine for factors bearing on the CRM market. The fact that it is has been unpredictable is not due to our lack of attention, it seems to be the nature of the beast in spite of how much focus we give it. So when you ask me to offer any kind of assurance here on what's going to happen next, the best assurance I can offer to you is that it will continue to be unpredictable. And so that's why we work to err on the side of being conservative. If we erred and we work to set up upside. If a person goes back to fundamentals and talks about penetration into the indicated patient population, one would think back to the publication during this last quarter of UCLA Duke Northwestern Group, that published the data on the under penetration of the indicated technologies for heart failure patients, including the other penetration of ICD and CRT therapy for heart failure patients. And so that data was the lead author there was Onno Roe [ph] and I hope you will forgive me if I've mispronounced his name. But that publication really did a good job of indicating the range of patients whose lives are being lost every year because of not getting therapy, we know they're going to have. On the heart failure side, it was something like 68,000 patients at the mid point who are needlessly dying every year because they're not getting the known established indicated therapy that they ought to be getting. And on the ICD and CRT side, that was about almost 1/3 of the total, so it was something like at the midpoint, about 20,000 lives in the United States being lost needlessly every single year because patients aren't getting ICDs or CRT therapy that their indicated for. So that's a given and now what ought to happens next, we could convince ourselves that we ought to see that this ought to be characterized as a pothole, which is how we characterize it. And the pothole by definition is finite and we'll climb out of a pothole, but we are humbled by the fact that we have a lot of analysis and a wide margin of error."

But more seriously, the first thing that one ought to think about on pricing is what is the premium going to be, what's the appropriate premium going to be for the new technology that we are about to put into the market here in the U.S. That would be the first significant factor that one would want to think about. And so historically, and I'm not going to tell you anything new, I'll still I can't resist, I'll just say, historically, exact apples to apples, mature technology to mature technology, pricing pressure is severe. And it has been 4 years. The reason that the parade of horribles doesn't come to reality on what's going to happen to pricing is because of the offset of meaningful valuable new technology and resetting premium ASPs on the back of that valuable premium new technology. So and we used the example that in the past it used to be just what's going to happen to pacer pricing and what happened was high-voltage shock technology got added into a pacer and we call it an ICD. And then what happened to that, it became dual chamber ICD and then it became CRT technology and now we've got in Europe, we've got our ICD technology with ST segment monitoring, we've got our ICD technology with LAP, direct left atrial pressure. Sensor monitoring we've got quadripolar on the market in Europe, we're  about to bring quadripolar to the market in the United states, and so those new technologies, of when we run dry on innovation, our discussion on ASP trends will change, but as long as we maintain a good pipeline of meaningful cost effective and clinically effective innovation, I would expect our thesis on total global ASPs to remain the same, which is yes, we continue to be under a lot of pressure. It's a topic of a lot of very active management. Everything doesn't go our way. But it all nets out to something that does limited to low single-digit decrease on a year-over-year basis.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, up approximately 10% over the $1,313,000,000 reported in the second quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year second quarter increased this quarter sales by about $75 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment, but the actual average exchange rates during the second quarter were within our previous guidance range.
On a constant currency basis, second quarter sales increased approximately 4% versus last year. Also, as you may recall, for the first 2 selling weeks of the second quarter of 2010, a competitor had suspended all sales of their ICD products in the United states. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our second quarter 2010 U.S. ICD sales by approximately $15 million. If we adjust to reflect this onetime benefit, our second quarter 2011 sales were up approximately 11% on an as reported basis, and 6% on a constant currency basis.
During the second quarter, in connection with the AGA Medical acquisition, we continued to amortize the acquired inventory step up to cost of sales. In this quarter, we recognized the remaining after-tax charges of $10 million or $0.03 per share in cost of sales related to this item. 
In addition, we recognized $32 million or $0.10 per share in other after-tax charges, primarily related to restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within our CRM business. This relates to our May 12, 2011, press release and announcement in Sweden that we are transitioning CRM manufacturing to a more cost advantaged locations.
In addition to the cost recognized this quarter, we expect future costs associated with this transition to be approximately $60 million to $80 million or $45 million to $60 million in after-tax charges, which will be recognized over the next several quarters. We estimate that when fully implemented, the transition of CRM manufacturing to more cost advantaged locations will generate approximately an additional $40 million to $50 million in annual savings.
Additional information about these charges can be found in today's press release.
Comments during this call referencing second quarter results and guidance for our full year 2011 results, including earnings per share, will be exclusive of these items. Earnings per share were $0.85 for the second quarter of 2011, an 8% increase over adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 in the second quarter of 2010. 
Before we discuss our second quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the third quarter and the remainder of 2011, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year -- the third quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.39 to $1.44 and that each JPY 82 to JPY 87 would translate into USD $1. 
For the second quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these assumptions. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and remainder of 2011, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.37 to $1.42 and that each JPY 78 to JPY 83 will translate into USD $1.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the second quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $793 million, up 1% from last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter CRM sales were down 4% versus the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $15 million benefit from a competitor being out of the market for ICD products a year ago, total second quarter 2011 CRM sales increased 3% versus last year's second quarter.
For the second quarter, ICD sales were $477 million, up 1% from last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter ICD sales decreased 3% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $272 million, down 9% versus last year's second quarter. International ICD sales were $205 million, a 20% increase over the second quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Excluding the $15 million impact from a competitor being off the markets for ICD products a year ago, total second quarter 2011 ICD sales increased 5% versus last year's second quarter, and U.S. second quarter 2011 ICD sales decreased 5% versus the same time period a year ago.
For a low-voltage devices, sales for the second quarter totaled $316 million, essentially equal to last year's second quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter low-voltage device sales decreased 6% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $129 million, down 8% from last year's second quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $187 million, up 6% from the second quarter of 2010, including $18 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million. For the full year 2011, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,060,000,000 to $3,120,000,000.
At the midpoint of this guidance range, our 2011 CRM sales would be up approximately 3% versus 2010. After adjusting our 2010 sales for the onetime benefit of a competitor being off the market in the U.S. This revised 2011 guidance range for St. Jude Medical is primarily the result of a slowdown in the CRM market and does not change our continued expectation that we will increase our global CRM market share in 2011. Our revised CRM sales guidance for 2011 also takes into account our updated expectation that we will have our unified quadripolar CRT-D system available in the United States by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $208 million, slightly exceeding the top end of our guidance range and up 18% over the second quarter of last year, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, second quarter AF product sales increased 11% versus last year. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $185 million to $200 million. As a result of the strong performance in the first half of 2011, we are raising the top end of our full year 2011 AF product sales guidance range by $15 million. We now expect our 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $800 million to $825 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2011 were $342 million, slightly exceeding the top end of our guidance range for the quarter, and up 35% over the second quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, second quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 26% versus last year. As discussed on prior calls, we now breakout our sales of cardiovascular products into 2 categories, structural heart and vascular. Sales of heart valve products along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories. 
For the second quarter of 2011, sales of structural heart products were $153 million, an increase of 74% over the second quarter of 2010 or 65% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the second quarter of 2011 were $189 million, a 14% increase over the second quarter of 2010 or 6% on a constant currency basis.
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $315 million to $330 million. We are raising our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales guidance to be in the range of $1,335,000,000 to $1,360,000,000.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2011 were $104 million, up 9% from the second quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $98 million to $103 million, and we expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales in the range of $410 million to $425 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 47% of St. Jude Medical sales in the second quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 53% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical's sales for the second quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.5%, up 80 basis points from the second quarter of 2010. We continue to be encouraged by our strong gross margin, which primarily reflects improved manufacturing efficiencies along with a favorable product mix. As a result, we are raising our gross profit margin outlook for 2011 to now be in the range of 74.0% to 74.5%. Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 35.5% of net sales, an increase of 140 basis points over the second quarter of 2010. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points during 2011. 
For the full year 2011, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 35.0% to 35.5%.
Research and development expenses or R&D in the second quarter of 2011 was 12.2% of net sales, compared with 11.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we expect R&D as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $25 million in the second quarter, which includes $8 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. 
For the third quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will again be a net expense of approximately $25 million. For the full year 2011, we expect another of the other expense of approximately $100 million to $105 million.
For the second quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0% and for 2011, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter of 2011, we had $833 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,566,000,000 in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with the group of banks. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the third quarter and full year 2011.
In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the third quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 334 million to 336 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 at 332 million to 334 million. 
For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.76 and for the full year 2011, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."
301667,137042482,143320,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2011",2011-07-20,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The data that became available after our Q1 earnings conference call shows that the global CRM market contracted between 1% and 2% during Q1 on a year-over-year basis.

The data that became available after our Q1 earnings conference call shows that the global CRM market contracted between 1% and 2% during Q1 on a year-over-year basis. As a conservative measure until we see results to the contrary, we will assume that the global CRM market will contract approximately 2% for full year 2011. This change in assumption means we expect the global CRM market to be approximately $11.4 billion for full year 2011, instead of the $11.9 billion size we assumed on our earnings conference call last quarter.
Since our share of the global CRM market is approximately 26% or 27%, this market model change effectively reduces the CRM sales revenue we expect for 2011 by approximately $130 million to $135 million. 
Although the CRM market contracted during the first quarter and may continue to contract on a year-over-year basis throughout the remainder of 2011, we continue to believe that for us, the CRM market glass is half-full, not half empty. We see $8.5 billion of global CRM market held by vulnerable competitors. We took share from both of our major competitors in the CRM market in 2010 and expect to do so again in 2011 and again in 2012.
With our current market share momentum, our pipeline of highly visible product advantages and the favorable tailwind created by replacement market dynamics, we are optimistic that our CRM business will grow at a level that allow St. Jude Medical to return to double-digit constant currency organic sales growth on a sustainable basis in future periods.
The most important variable impacting the growth of our CRM franchise for the remainder of this year is the timing of FDA approval for our Unify Quadra and Quartet, quadripolar CRT-D products. Our guidance assumes we will have these products available in the United States by the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, where our quadripolar CRT-D products are fully launched, CRT-D units and revenue grew more than 20% during the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
In the United States, our quadripolar CRT-D sales training for our field organization is complete. Product launch inventory is ready, and we are prepared to initiate a full launch of these products within days of receiving FDA approval.
I would like to devote the remainder of my prepared remarks to reviewing highlights of the progress we are making in implementing the 18 new growth drivers we discussed during our 2011 annual investor conference in February. We have said previously that in the near term, 2 of our most important new growth drivers are our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program and our CardioMEMS program. With respect to our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program, we began to launch this product line in the United States toward the end of April. Early sales results are fully meeting our expectations. We are not going to start breaking out this number separately, but as an indication of the success of this new growth driver, we will disclose that during the second quarter global tissue valves sales grew over 30% on a year-over-year basis.
We expect our tissue valve franchise to continue growing at an elevated level during the remainder of this year as we deliver full quarter results for our Trifecta valve launch in the United States and for our Epic valve launch in Japan. 
A second major growth driver, we applied for special attention in the near term relates to our program with CardioMEMS. As a reminder, the CardioMEMS CHAMPION trial reported a 39% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared with best standard of care during an average follow-up duration of 15 months in patients suffering from Class III heart failure. As we have said previously, this is exactly the kind of technology that will be favored under Health Care Reform and by increased attention to the comparative effectiveness of technology available for the millions of patients who suffer from heart failure. The FDA has granted expedited review status to the CardioMEMS PMA application, reflecting a high level of priority for this technology from a public policy perspective.
CMS reimbursement is already in place. We expect the CardioMEMS PMA to be reviewed by an FDA panel this fall followed by FDA approval and full U.S. launch in 2012. 
Moving beyond Trifecta and CardioMEMS, we are encouraged by the development of our entire portfolio of new growth drivers, which continues to meet or exceed the expectations we established earlier this year. In our transcatheter aortic valve implant or TAVI program, we already have multiple implants and are on track to begin our pivotal clinical trial for CE Mark purposes in the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate launching our Portico line of TAVI valves in Europe by the first half of 2013.
With respect to our left atrial appendage or LAA closure program, LAA closure revenue in Europe grew over 30% sequentially in Q2. Although the absolute revenue is still modest, we are making strong progress integrating LAA closure into the larger St. Jude Medical program in Europe and are just beginning to capture St. Jude Medical synergies. We fully expect our LAA closure revenue to contribute significant growth to our structural heart and AF programs in 2012 and beyond.
In the United States, we are finishing the feasibility portion of the IDE trial. We are submitting to FDA this month for permission to begin the pivotal phase of our LAA closure IDE clinical trial. 
Next, I'd like to transition from the structural heart component of our Cardiovascular Division or CVD business to the Vascular component of our CVD business. The most important new growth drivers in our Vascular business in the near term are our fractional flow reserve or FFR product lines and our Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT product lines. Taken together, we are using these product lines to compete for our share of the $600 million market for FFR and intravascular imaging and to expand this market with evidence of comparative effectiveness both from a cost perspective and from a clinical perspective. We are just beginning to launch our Ilumien line of integrated FFR OCT technology in Europe and expect to launch this product soon in the United States as well.
We estimate that we are on track to exit 2011 with approximately a 33% share of the relevant market and that our market share will continue to grow in 2012 due to the strength of our integrated FFR and OCT program. We are continuing to expand the breadth of these product lines and develop the clinical evidence, reimbursement and customer acceptance needed to transform our first to market vascular technologies into major new growth drivers longer term.
Moving on to the substantial progress we are making with our emerging Renal Denervation business. We continue to keep details of our technology confidential for competitive reasons, but as we have previously stated, we view the renal denervation market as a major new growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical and of resource they robust development program to capture this opportunity. Our program has progressed to the point where we now expect CE Mark and a limited launch in Europe before the end of 2012. We will continue to provide updates on this major new growth program as appropriate.
Next, I would like to review the most significant new growth drivers we have resourced within our Neuromodulation business or NMD. Q2 was a productive quarter for our Neuromodulation business. We are especially focused on the progress we are making with our Deep Brain Stimulation or DBS business in Europe for Parkinson's disease with our Brio line of DBS products and our Athena physician programmer. Our DBS products grew approximately 30% sequentially in Q2 and helped our international Neuromodulation sales grow 50% on a year-over-year basis. Similar to what we have said about our LAA closure business, our DBS business in Europe is still a small part of our total sales, but is showing the right early indicators of becoming a significant contributor to help accelerate our sales growth in 2012 and beyond.
We are making good progress expanding our DBS business beyond the indication for Parkinson's disease as reflected last week in our press release announcing that FDA has approved expansion of our broaden pivotal trial investigating this, extent to which stimulating an area of the brain known as Brodmann Area 25 is a safe and effective method for treating severe depression.
In the second quarter, we also reported the initial results of our Neuromodulation pivotal trial for peripheral or occipital nerve stimulation for patients suffering from treatment resistant migraine. The feedback on the clinical experts we work with in this program is that our clinical trial results were highly favorable and convincing for the proposition that our Neuromodulation system for treatment resistant migraine is both safe and effective and deserves to be available to patients on a commercial basis. We expect to receive CE Mark approval and begin to launch this product in Europe for the end of this year. We will provide an update with respect to migraine as a potential new growth driver in the United States after we have adequate visibility in the current FDA requirements for approval of this indication.
With respect to the business managed by our AF division or AFD, revenue growth during the second quarter was 18% on a year-over-year basis and confirms that our AF growth program is on track. The international component of our AF business grew 24% on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter. We view this result as an early indicator of the growth we expect to see with our AF franchise in the United States as we continue to bring new technologies to the U.S. that already are available and gaining market share in Europe. This includes our Cool Flex and contact lines of ablation catheters, as well as the MediGuide technology we are beginning to roll out in Europe on a limited basis.
To conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to refer back to the main points and conclusions we offered during our annual investor conference in February of this year. First, we have a balanced portfolio of major new growth drivers to support our goal of returning to sustained double-digit growth in sales. Second, we have clear visibility into ongoing EPS leverage from our strategy of expanding manufacturing in cost advantaged locations. Third, we have a strong balance sheet and cash flow to continue to repurchase stock and fund disciplined acquisitions as appropriate. And finally, St. Jude Medical's overall program for superior long-term growth is both robust and on track. Our guidance tells you that we expect to see our constant currency organic sales growth accelerate in the fourth quarter, setting up expectations for encouraging growth in 2012. The midpoint of our sales guidance implies constant currency organic sales growth of approximately 6% in the second quarter.
We'd now like to open it up for your questions, and I'll turn it back to our operator to monitor."

This is, I think this is just an example of the uncertainty associated with any regulatory process, and I would not read anything else into it. And with respect to the timing of -- the new timing where you've said that our guidance assumes that we will have the quadripolar system approved here for the fourth quarter, that's different than saying that we are confident about that. What we're saying is that based on our ongoing communications with FDA, that's our current expectation. We may beat that expectation. We may miss that expectation, but we're  giving you the data so that if we announce approval sooner, you could anticipate upside to our guidance. If we announce approval later, you could anticipate some negative impact on our guidance. So we're just working to make our thinking completely visible. On the topic of exact market share tied to quadripolar, we don't offer our guidance with that level of specificity. Instead, what one would have to do is look at what we've said for market growth assumption, which is a year-over-year minus 2% for full year 2011. And look at what we've indicated for our total CRM sales here on a global basis, neither of which directly answers your question, but I'm sorry, that's the best that we're going to do here on this call. I can tell you a little more to your point and just working to get a sense of what's our confidence that quadripolar will be a vehicle for very meaningful share gain. Our confidence there is really very high. And for all of the reasons that physicians have responded so favorably to the quadripolar system in Europe, and you can get an indicator of that from the comment in our prepared remarks that where the system's already on the market, we've got 20%, over 20% year-over-year increase, both on a unit and on a revenue basis. So that would be maybe a good proof point that we will gain meaningful share with this technology in the United States and then a supporting comment might be that the impact of new technologies in Europe typically is slower than the impact of new technologies in the United States for a lot of different reasons, that includes that CE Mark doesn't get us into all parts of the European market, #1. For example, we only launch the quadripolar CRT-D system in France during the second quarter, just as one example. And then secondly, the impact of tenders in Europe is significant and tends to have -- tends to cause a bit of a lag in the uptake of new technology versus the dynamics that we work with here in the United States. So you and others have commented on here in the past and we certainly commented on the past, Eric Fain spelled out in some significant amount in our February investors conference, the reasons that, that quadripolar CRT-D system was expected to have such a good impact on market share shift and our experience to date is that it does have that kind of impact on market share shift and when we get it here in the United States, we would have a lot of confidence and a lot of optimism that, that will have every meaningful impact on share shift here in the United States."

Rick, you're not reading too much subtlety into our comments. We do a lot of wordsmithing to work to get it exactly right on what we say, and between the lines, the message was the former, not the latter of your 2 propositions.

This is the right time to do it, let's do it all at once, pull in expectations, leave ourselves with the possibility of upside and announce as we have this morning then that as a conservative measure, we're just going to assume that the global CRM market will contract 2%, which is more than it contracted in Q1, but 2% for full year. Clearly, there's upside to that. What we see here in the market is that the U.S. CRM market fell into a pothole during the second quarter. It's 28% of our sales. I mean, so it's a meaningful percent, but on the other hand, it's 28% that fell into a pothole. It's not clear to us yet how much of that was timing and how much of that was something else.

Some of the data that we get lags in the conference call, so we're again adapting a conservative view, pulling in expectations all at once to a very conservative baseline, leaving ourselves with the possibility of upside. The factors that couple of factors that are clear to us that bear on -- it did bear on the U.S. CRM market during the second quarter and it helped create this pothole, some of it is general malaise in the macroeconomics, unemployment, soft hospital admissions, that's some of it, you can see that and you can see some additional validation of that comment in our U.S. Neuromodulation sales, because you saw we're really flat in our U.S. Neuromodulation sales year-over-year. It tends not to draw that much attention because international Neuromodulation sales grew 50%, and the total sales was okay. But in the U.S., the market is just weak and it's bearing on more than one product class that we have. And so it certainly is bearing on our largest product class, the CRM products. Another aspect here is it has become clear to us, we again, we get the anecdotal information, we don't get access to the information at its source, but we have customers who were not previously directly impacted by the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into reimbursement submissions here for ICDs. We have more customers who were contacted by the Department of Justice during the second quarter than in previous times. And so that's not something that we could predict and again, that's not something where we know what kind of the big picture activities are of the Department of Justice. We only find at about it when our customers get directly impacted and then they tell us that here, this is having an impact on their practice in the short term. That's hard to model on what's going to -- what the implications of that are in Q3 or in Q4. So again, we're just being conservative in saying, let's pull back expectations on a total global basis. Another there's also some soft factors that are difficult for us to model, but we have -- and we noticed that a number of physicians who have been very high-volume implanters in prior times and working particularly long hours, are taking a lot more time off as they transition from private practice into becoming hospital employees, and they get guaranteed vacation and they take it. So that's a soft factor and not want to make too much of, but it's enough of the factor that it is on our radar screen and it didn't affect the timing, at least the timing of implants here in the second quarter. So those are the main things. The other thing I'd say, Rick, would be that we're always very careful and we always caution ourselves and remind observers not to make too much of a single quarter in the CRM space. There are variations in inventory at the customer level, so you get inventory loads, you get inventory de-stocking, the ASPs are relatively high versus other products we work with, so it doesn't take that many units on a total market basis to really cause changes and results during a single 90-day period. We think it's a little bit better, we've said for years here, that it's more meaningful to combine the results of a couple of quarters to look both at market share trends and at market growth trends in the CRM space. So we do find some difference between sales numbers and implant numbers. And then when we're looking at year-over-year here, we've got the complexity of Boston Scientific being off the market in the U.S. for a portion of the quarter a year ago. So there's just a lot of compounding factors and we've netted them all out to offer conservative guidance all at once and pull back all at once here for expectations for the remainder of the year."

One of them and this comes back to some of the early questions that I was a little bit vague around, but the first thing is our fourth quarter assumes that we have our quadripolar CRT-D product launch at the beginning of -- by the beginning of the quarter. And so if we beat that, we've got upside, if we get that exactly, then our guidance holds. If we miss that date, then there is -- people off to start to factor in sales reductions for the fourth quarter. So that's the first thing. Second thing is that we -- let's take, for example, the Trifecta launch here. We already showed over 30% increase total global tissue valve sales in the second quarter. And we're just getting started with Trifecta, it was not a full quarter launch. The natural trends of uptake even with a full launch are that there is a selling cycle and there's a successful product line that gains traction over some time. You don't get the full traction in the first full quarter of its launch. So we're going to have first full quarter here in Q3. We'll get a higher run rate. We'll get additional confidence, enthusiasm on the Trifecta and in our pool of tissue valve program for the fourth quarter, so you see that. We've got trajectories. We've pointed to a number of these factors here, we've got trajectories that are very strong sequential quarter growth with our LAA closure product line. And then more importantly, with our FFR and OCT product lines. So then also with our deep brain stimulation product lines, so when we're talking about 30% sequential quarter growth and you start to run rate that and extrapolate that and then add to it that on our FFR OCT product line, we just started to launch our first integrated FFR OCT system in Europe, and we are optimistic that we will begin to launch that same system in the United States before the end of this quarter. And then extrapolate that to fourth quarter implications and extrapolate that to -- we're not offering guidance for 2012, but the same kinds of things that give us at the midpoint of our guidance about a 6% constant currency organic sales growth guidance for Q4, think about that. So how do those factors extend into 2012 and what about the implications of CardioMEMS in 2012 and then certainly, we've had -- we would anticipate having strong full year benefits of our quadripolar CRT-D program in 2012. You can really see that we have a little bit of a mismatch and timing of our CRM market pothole and update of our numerous new growth drivers here and for constant currency organic sales here in Q2 and modest guidance here for Q3, but none of that should be with a sense that of anything other than our long-term growth program with numerous new growth drivers to continue significantly diversifying our portfolio and get us back to double-digit constant currency organic sustainable sales growth, but that's fully on track, and not just by way of blowing smoke and waving arms, but you see it in our guidance for Q4, you see us recovering from what we are reporting today to about 6% sales growth there by those -- with all those other qualifications in the fourth quarter and a person can start to think well, it got to be better than in 2012, because everything that's going to help in the fourth quarter is going to be even stronger in 2012, and 2012 is going to have other significant growth drivers that are not yet bearing on Q4."

And then we exceeded our sales on AF and CVD, and then we're at the top end on our neuro business. And then that will translate into strong margins and we actually had $0.85 of earnings per share. So I think that the currency is all baked in there and really, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, you keep in mind that we've got the AGA Medical business now consolidated in with St. Jude Medical.

The fact that it is has been unpredictable is not due to our lack of attention, it seems to be the nature of the beast in spite of how much focus we give it. So when you ask me to offer any kind of assurance here on what's going to happen next, the best assurance I can offer to you is that it will continue to be unpredictable. And so that's why we work to err on the side of being conservative. If we erred and we work to set up upside. If a person goes back to fundamentals and talks about penetration into the indicated patient population, one would think back to the publication during this last quarter of the UCLA Duke Northwestern Group, that published the data on the under penetration of the indicated technologies for heart failure patients, including the under penetration of ICD and CRT therapy for heart failure patients. And so that data was the lead author there was Onno Roe [ph] and I hope you will forgive me if I've mispronounced his name. But that publication really did a good job of indicating the range of patients whose lives are being lost every year because of not getting therapy we know they ought to have. On the heart failure side, it was something like 68,000 patients at the mid point who are needlessly dying every year because they're not getting the known established indicated therapy that they ought to be getting. And on the ICD and CRT side, that was about almost 1/3 of the total, so it was something like at the midpoint, about 20,000 lives in the United States being lost needlessly every single year because patients aren't getting ICDs or CRT therapy that they're indicated for. So that's a given and now what ought to happen next, we could convince ourselves that we ought to see that this ought to be characterized as a pothole, which is how I characterized it. And the pothole by definition is finite and we'll climb out of the pothole, but we are humbled by the fact that we have a lot of analysis and a wide margin of error."

And so historically, and I know I'm not going to tell you anything new, I'll still I can't resist, I'll just say, historically, exact apples to apples, mature technology to mature technology, pricing pressure is severe. And it has been 4 years. The reason that the parade of horribles doesn't come to reality on what's going to happen to pricing is because of the offset of meaningful valuable new technology and resetting premium ASPs on the back of that valuable premium new technology. So and we used the example that in the past it used to be just what's going to happen to pacer pricing, and what happened was high-voltage shock technology got added into a pacer and we called it an ICD.

Sensor monitoring we've got quadripolar on the market in Europe, we're  about to bring quadripolar to the market in the United states, and so those new technologies, when we run dry on innovation, our discussion on ASP trends will change, but as long as we maintain a good pipeline of meaningful cost effective and clinically effective innovation, I would expect our thesis on total global ASPs to remain the same, which is yes, we continue to be under a lot of pressure. It's a topic of a lot of very active management. Everything doesn't go our way. But it all nets out to something that does limit it to low single-digit decrease on a year-over-year basis.
With that, I apologize to whoever is in the queue that we haven't able to get to, and I'd like to thank everyone for staying with us longer than our normal time, and I'll now turn the call back over to our moderator, Sarah, to read concluding comments, and we'll sign off. Thank you, everybody."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,383,000,000, up approximately 12% over the,240,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's third quarter increased this quarter sales by about $73 million. 
On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased approximately 6% versus last year. 
During the third quarter, we recognized $21 million or $0.06 per share in after-tax special charges, primarily in connection with our previously announced restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within our CRM business, as well as cost associated with our continuing efforts to improve our international sales and sales support organization. 
In addition, we recognized $9 million or $0.03 per share in after-tax charges related to increased collection risk for accounts receivable related to one customer in Europe.
Additional information about these charges can be found in today's press release. Comments during this conference call referencing third quarter results and guidance for our full year 2011 results, including earnings per share, will be exclusive of these items.
Earnings per share were $0.78 for the third quarter of 2011, an 8% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.72 in the third quarter of 2010. 
During the third quarter, we completed our $500 million share repurchases program that was announced in August. This reduced the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the third quarter by approximately 6 million shares, which provided $0.01 of benefit to our adjusted EPS.
Before we discuss our third quarter 2011 sales results by product category, with guidance for the fourth quarter, let me comment on foreign currency. 
As discussed on prior calls, the 2 main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.37 to $1.42 and each JPY 78 to JPY 83 would translate into USD $1. 
For the third quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter, we have updated the currency rates used in our model. We are now assuming that for the fourth quarter of 2011, each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38 and that each JPY 76 -- each JPY 76 to JPY 81 will translate into USD $1.
This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates decreases total forecasted sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 by about $20 million to $25 million, which we estimate will reduce fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the third quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $751 million, up 2% from last year's third quarter. 
On a constant currency basis, third quarter CRM sales were down 3% versus the third quarter of last year. 
For the third quarter, ICD sales were $445 million, up 1% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales decreased 3% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $257 million, down 10% versus last year's third quarter. International ICD sales were $188 million, a 21% increase over the third quarter of 2010, including $20 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For low-voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $306 million, an increase of 2% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter low-voltage device sales decreased 4% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $126 million, down 6% from last year's third quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $180 million, up 9% from the third quarter of 2010, including $18 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $714 million to $754 million. And for the full year 2011, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,020,000,000 to $3,060,000,000. Our revised CRM sales guidance for 2011 takes into account the expected negative impact of currency in the fourth quarter and the fact that our Unify Quadripolar CRT-D system was not approved by FDA within our previously assumed time line.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $202 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range and up 20% over the third quarter of last year, including $11 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter AF product sales increased 13% versus last year. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million. As a result of the strong performance in the first 3 quarters of 2011, and despite a weakening currency environment, we now expect our 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $810 million to $825 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2011 were $328 million, up 37% over the third quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 28% versus last year. 
As discussed on prior calls, we now breakout our sales of cardiovascular products into 2 categories, structural heart and vascular. Sales of heart valve product along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, the FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories.
For the third quarter of 2011, sales of structural heart products were $151 million, an increase of 91% over the third quarter of 2010 or 80% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the third quarter of 2011 were $177 million, a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2010 or 2% on a constant currency basis.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $323 million to $338 million. We now expect our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,335,000,000. This revised 2011 guidance range is primarily the result of the anticipated negative impact of currency on our business in the fourth quarter.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2011 were $102 million, up 10% from the third quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $102 million to $112 million. We now expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales to be in the range of $400 million to $410 million, due to challenging market conditions and the elective nature of Neuromodulation therapy.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 48% of St. Jude Medical sales in the third quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 52% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the third quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.7%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 74.0% to 74.5%. Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 35.9% of net sales, an increase of 160 basis points over the third quarter of 2010. As we have mentioned on previous earnings calls, the AGA Medical operations including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points during 2011.
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 35.0% to 35.5%.
Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2011 were 12.8% of net sales compared with 12.1% of sales in the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $20 million in the third quarter, which includes $7 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense in the range of $20 million to $25 million and for the full year 2011, we now expect other expense of approximately $91 million to $96 million. 
For the third quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0%. For 2011, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%.
Moving onto the balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $960 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $3 billion in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 322 million to 324 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 at $327 million to $329 million. This revised guidance on outstanding shares reflects the impact of our $500 million share repurchase program, which we completed in the third quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, the company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85 and for the full year 2011, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.28. 
I'd now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

Virtually, everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics will have on MedTech",3078,"Thank you, John. Virtually, everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics will have on MedTech market growth rates. 
These are legitimate concerns and continue to draw significant attention from the St. Jude Medical leadership team. It is more important, however, to realize that St. Jude Medical has set itself apart from other companies by preparing to accelerate its growth in spite of these concerns.
During our Annual Investor Conference in February of this year, we talked about 18 new growth drivers that support our confidence that we will accelerate our organic sales growth over the long-term. The remainder of my comments will update you on our progress and accomplishments implementing these new growth drivers. 
Let me start with our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program. We reported today that revenue for our structural heart program increased over 90% on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter. Although much of this growth was due to the benefit of our acquisition of AGA in November 2010, this growth also was due to the success of our Trifecta pericardial tissue valves in Europe and in the United States and our Epic stented tissue valve program in Japan.
Keep in mind that the pericardial stented tissue valve market represents a new growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical of approximately $500 million annually. Revenue for our stented tissue valve products grew over 50% globally during the third quarter and is expected to continue growing at a strong double-digit rate for the foreseeable future. We are just beginning to capture our share of this new $500 million segment of the heart valve market.
Our second new growth driver, we are implementing to help accelerate our long-term organic sales growth is our Portico transcatheter valve implant or TAVI program. Our first inhuman series of implants at 3 centers in Canada and in Europe has been highly successful. We will begin enrolling in our pivotal trial for CE Mark purposes this quarter and are on track to begin a limited launch of our Portico line of TAVI heart valves in Europe before the end of 2012. We are optimistic that our Portico line of TAVI heart valves will offer key competitive advantages due to ease of use, deployment accuracy, repositioning, capability and retrievability in a way that will support meaningful gain of market share once this product line is fully launched.
In addition to our TAVI line of heart valve and our new lines of stented tissue valves, a third major growth driver that we are implementing within our structural heart program is our percutaneous mitral valve repair or PMVR product line. Although we still are not disclosing details of our PMVR technology due to patent protection activities, I would like to say a little more about our PMVR program. 
Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common form of valvular heart disease and is a significant public health problem that leads to dilation of the heart, Atrial Fibrillation, pulmonary congestion and heart failure. Like the other major disease states, St. Jude Medical addresses with its technology mitral valve regurgitation is both an epidemic and expensive disease for healthcare budgets in the United States and globally. We estimate that if our PMVR technology can help even 5% of the patients in developed markets who already have been diagnosed with symptomatic mitral valve regurgitation, we will have a new $2 billion growth driver, at the same time we save money for global healthcare budgets. We are starting our first inhuman series of PMVR procedures this quarter.
We estimate that we will receive CE Mark and begin launching this technology in Europe before the end of 2013. We expect to capture good synergies in Europe from the investment we will make to launch both our Portico line of TAVI heart valves before the end of 2012 and our PMVR technology before the end of 2013.
A fourth new growth driver within our structural heart franchise is our left atrial appendage or LAA closure system. 
In 2010, LAA closure technology was recognized by the Cleveland Clinic as one of the most important MedTech innovations of the year. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence or NICE in the U.K. issued guidance in 2010 supporting the comparative effectiveness of LAA closure in patients with Atrial Fibrillation. At least one commentator estimates that with reasonable assumption, the LAA closure market will be a new $400 million growth market by 2015.
St. Jude Medical's AMPLATZER cardiac plug LAA closure system currently enjoys a leading market share in Europe and is growing at a strong double-digit rate. 
In the United States, the feasibility phase of our IDE clinical trial has been completed. We expect to begin enrolling in the pivotal phase of our IDE clinical trial in the near future. With favorable comparative effectiveness data, the endorsement of major key opinion leaders and the normal, but time-consuming work of market development initiatives, we think our LAA Closure Program has the realistic potential to become a winner in an environment of health care reform and budget cuts and become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the long-term.
Before I move away from the topic of new growth drivers within our structural heart program, I would like to touch on the topic of PFO closure for stroke and migraine. 
Enthusiasm for PFO closure for emerging indications has been dampened by the unsuccessful closure one and mistrials conducted by NMT. Although reservations are understandable and St. Jude Medical models no revenue tied to emerging indications for PFO closure, NMT's closure one and mistrials compared to St. Jude Medical's respect and premium trials in the same way that a leaky both compares to the Nina, Penta and the Santa Maria of the Columbus expedition. 
Compared with the NMT PFO closure system, which was reported to leak, we expect our AMPLATZER PFO closure device to show better procedural success, a better closure rate, less device and less Atrial Fibrillation. 
In addition to the superiority of our product design, St. Jude Medical clinical trials also are designed differently from the NMT trials in favorable way. We have different inclusion and exclusion criteria and different clinical endpoints. 
Although we do not know whether our RESPECT or PREMIUM clinical trials will be successful, these trials deserve continued attention as serious initiatives, which ahs the potential to generate new growth.
The PFO closure trial furthest alone is our RESPECT trials which evaluates the benefit of PFO closure for certain patients who have a high risk of stroke. We currently have approximately 950 patients enrolled in this event-driven trial. We are blinded to the data and therefore cannot comment further, but we expect the clinical data defining the end point of this trial to become available during 2012.
Moving onto our Neuromodulation growth franchise. We announced last month that we have received industry's first and only regulatory approval for use of an implanted neurostimulation device for patients who suffer from intractable chronic migraine. Data from our pivotal clinical trial were presented at the International Headache Congress in Berlin in June. And considering this data, it is important to note that the patients we studied were so-called worst of the worst. The inclusion criteria required failure of at least 3 drugs and a headache lasting at least 4 hours per day for 15 or more days per month causing at least moderate disability. 
Patients enrolled in the study kept a diary of headache days and actually suffered from an average of 26 headache days per month. At 12 weeks follow-up, patients in the treatment group experienced a 28% decrease in number of headache days, a 41% improvement in overall disability measured by the migraine disability assessment or Midas questionnaire and a 20% improvement in Zon pain and disability Index or PAD scores, as well as numerous improvements by other qualitative measures. Neuromodulation therapy will not be appropriate for everyone in Europe who suffers from intractable chronic migraine, but headache neurologists in Europe now have another tool in their toolbox which will help reduce the suffering for some of these patients.
We estimate that approximately 2.2 million patients in Europe suffer from severe and chronic migraine, which is approximately 5% of the total migraine population in Europe. If we can help only 5% of this 5% with our Neuromodulation therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver at the same time we reduce patient suffering and health improve health care economics. As always, market development will take time, but limited market release activities already are underway and are expected to benefit our organic sales growth rate in 2012.
Another major new growth driver we are implementing is renal denervation for treatment resistant hypertensive patients, our first inhuman series for our renal denervation system already is underway. We expect to receive CE Mark and begin launching our renal denervation technology in Europe before the end of 2012. To clarify  significance of this new technology for St. Jude Medical growth program, we estimate that as many as 1 in every 3 adults in a developed world suffers from hypertension. Approximately 25% of patients treated for hypertension do not respond to medical therapy. We estimate that we are able to treat only 1% of adult hypertensive patients who do not respond to medical therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver. Keep in mind that today, hypertension generates a direct annual cost of global medical budgets of approximately $500 billion as with each of arbor of our major investments, St. Jude Medical's goal is to create a new $1 billion growth franchise for the benefit of our investors at the same time we help make quality global healthcare more affordable.
These are the exact same goals that motivated our investments in fractional flow reserve or FFR technology for patient suffering from coronary artery disease, CardioMEMS technology for patients who suffer from heart failure, Deep Brain Stimulation for treatment resistant depression and an entire portfolio of medical device technologies developed to help address the epidemic of Atrial Fibrillation. All of these technologies have been reviewed thoroughly and pass communication, so I will not extend my prepared remarks by reiterating details of these technologies here.
St. Jude Medical places high priority on investing in properly designed comparative effectiveness trials to support robust reimbursement and healthy market growth long-term for all of our emerging technologies. The goal standard for this initiative is our past sponsorship of the same trial, which establish as the cost of stenting patients with multivessel coronary disease can be reduced by 14% through the use of our fractional flow reserve or FFR technology. The complete list of comparative effectiveness trials we are supporting includes the Cabana Atrial Fibrillation, the East trial for Atrial Fibrillation, the FAME 2 trial for coronary artery disease, the 10-year follow-up study for heart failure and ICD patients and the broaden trial for patients who suffer from treatment resistant depression. Taken together, these investments gives us confidence that after our new technologies enter the market in an environment of macroeconomic stress and healthcare reform, our technologies will be surrounded by adequate reimbursement and attractive market growth long-term.
Next I would like to offer updates on the progress we are making with key initiatives in our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM franchise. I'm going to start with an update on our ST segment monitoring technology. We have not been talking about our ST segment monitoring technology recently because we have been working with FDA to define the regulatory pathway needed to bring this technology to the market in the United States. Now that the regulatory pathway is clear, we offer this update. 
First, as a reminder, the ST segment is a section of an electrocardiogram that depicts electrical changes between heart beats to indicate obstruction of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle. We are the first and only company who has been able to monitor these changes with our implantable defibrillator or ICDs, which means we can do so in a manner that is extremely cost-effective for patients who have ICD. This technology is especially important because it may provide an early warning signal that a patient is experiencing a heart attack. When a patient is experiencing a heart attack every minute counts for every 30 minutes that treatment is delayed, mortality increases by 7.5%. Because symptoms can be vague in approximately 1/3 of patients don't even have typical chest symptoms, the average time it takes for patients to seek treatment has remained almost 3 hours in the United States over the last decade.
This ST segment monitoring technology received CE Mark in December of 2008 and is now nearing the end of its third year on the market in Europe. This technology was approved by the MH LW in Japan in 2010 and is now widely available not only in Europe and Japan, but also in China, India and in all other major markets around the world. 
St. Jude Medical announced last quarter that we have now enrolled our first patient in the IDE clinical trial required by FDA to bring this technology to market in the United States. Our analyzed ST trial is a prospective non-randomized multicenter pivotal IDE investigation of up to 5,228 patients who will be enrolled at approximately 200 medical centers. The analyzed ST trial is designed to study the safety and efficacy of the ST segment monitoring technology in the Fortify ST ICD.
The sensitivity of the feature for detecting acute coronary syndrome events, including myocardial infarctions, will be the primary efficacy endpoint, the primary safety end point will be assessed by reporting the percentage of patients who experience a false positive detection. 
The analyzed ST trial will be the largest IDE trial for an implantable device ever performed in the United States and will cost tens of millions of dollars. It is premature for us to predict when this technology will become available in the United States, but our rough estimate is that it will be between 7 to 8 years after the technology became available in Europe and approximately 4 to 5 years after the technology became available in Japan and virtually all other major markets. 
Our take away for this experience is that there is a compelling need for the FDA regulatory approval process to become more predictable, more transparent and more cost-effective.
The regulatory pendulum at the FDA has swung too far in the wrong direction against innovation and needs to take a more practical approach to risk benefit analysis. The medical device industry is a major generator of jobs, exports and healthcare savings for the U.S. economy. St. Jude Medical is focused on technology innovation that is part of the solution to affordable healthcare and sustainable economic growth. We need a strong FDA that is fully funded and it has a culture in organizational confidence to strike the right balance between approving innovative medical device technology on the one hand and on the other hand, protecting the public health in a way that is not overly defensive.
Next is an update on FDA regulatory approval for our unified quadripolar CRT-D system. As we indicated previously, our first-generation quadripolar CRT-D system received CE Mark and began limited launch in Europe exactly 2 years ago this month. 
Last month, we announced CE Mark an initial launch of our second-generation quadripolar CRT-D system in Europe. Although this technology is not yet available in Japan, it is available in India and in most other major medical device markets outside the United States. 
In markets where the product is already available, St. Jude Medical is gaining meaningful market share due to physician appreciation of the advantages of quadripolar CRT-D system can bring to help reduce the expense and duration of initial implants to help reduce re-operations due to phrenic nerve stimulation, high pacing thresholds and lead dislodgment and to help improve the ability of a physician to electronically reposition the Left-Heart Lead without the need for an additional surgery. 
We cannot predict when we will receive FDA approval for our unify quadripolar CRT-D system. We are waiting FDA response through our completed PMA supplement submission and are not aware of any outstanding issues. Our field organization has already been trained and inventory is in place to support a strong launch of our Unify Quadra product line in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval.
Our experience in Europe and in other major markets with our quadripolar CRT-D system makes us optimistic that this product line will help us gain meaningful share in the United States once we have approval to bring this innovation to market.
Next, I'd like to touch on the success we are having with our Accent MRI pacemaker in Europe. We announced last quarter that we received CE Mark approval and we're initiating launch in Europe of our Accent MRI pacemaker. 
The advantage of this pacemaker system is that it offers uncompromised taking patient of technology in addition to full MRI compatible scanning capabilities, with no anatomical zone or MRI power restrictions. This is a breakthrough innovation that offers significant benefit to patients and clinicians. Early customer response in Europe is encouraging. We look forward to fully deploying this technology in Europe over the next few quarters and then bringing this innovation to the United States when we are able to satisfy the FDA process for doing so.
Finally, in addition to implementing new growth drivers, St. Jude Medical continues to focus on improving the productivity of our global operations. The special charges we recognized this quarter in connection with restructuring our part of this initiative, we will continue to restructure as appropriate as well as expand our manufacturing volumes in Malaysia, in Costa Rica, in South Carolina and in other cost advantaged locations as part of our or comprehensive programs to optimize our cost structure long-term. 
I would like to conclude my prepared remarks by summarizing that our program for implementing 18 new growth drivers is making good progress.

We would continue to guide to the same level of growth this quarter that we guided to last quarter, which was we wanted to be conservative, we wanted to really take this issue off the table for purposes of updating models for St. Jude Medical and for our growth rate and we indicated that we expected for full year 2011 the global CRM market to shrink about 2%. And so that continues to be a good estimate here one quarter later. We really did not see significant changes in the CRM market over the last 90 days. We think the market didn't get better. The market didn't get worse. We saw ASP dynamics consistent during this last quarter as in the prior quarter. It's a tough market with a number of distressed conditions, but it seems to be reasonably steady-state. With respect to the Department of Justice investigation as everyone would appreciate, we have no special insights, the DOJ doesn't talk to us about it. So we really monitoring events as they become publicly visible in the same way that everybody else is. And as we cannot predict what comes next or exactly what's the time line is for the DOJ investigation, and I don't think anybody outside the DOJ can actually do that. With respect to the kind of longer-term outlook for the CRM market, we've directed peoples attention to the American Heart Journal Study that came out earlier this year. It was a study that was conducted by a number of luminaries from UCLA, from Northwestern University, from Duke, it indicated the number of patients who are dying every year who are not receiving optimal therapy for heart failure conditions, including optimal ICD therapy. There were a number of wide range estimates for what the impact is on the public health from the failure of available technology to get to all of the patients who need it. But at the midpoint is as I recall, there is an estimate that about 20 people in the year in the United states were needlessly dying of heart failure condition due to the fact that they didn't have in ICD and they should have one. So there's just one data point we've referred people a number of times to other kind of highly visible data points, so the miniscule number of implants per population in emerging markets with particularly site China and India, but also a number of other emerging markets, all of which give us the optimism that over the long term, there are still plenty of growth left in the global CRM market and St. Jude Medical will be well positioned to take advantage of that growth as it emerges. So those are, Rick, those are my main comments on kind of the dynamics surrounding the CRM market. Did I answer your question or so was there another part of it?"

We're not aware of any outstanding issues and we're waiting to hear from FDA. So approval could be later today, approval could be later this quarter, approval could be -- so that tells you our state of knowledge. We're ready to go, the technology has been established to be safe, it's been established to be effective, it's been in the market in Europe for 2 years, it's helping patients elsewhere all around the world. we're looking forward to the opportunity to have this technology begin to help patients in the United States as well and we just wait day by day, but have no special insight into when we'll receive our approval. On the former question about our ICD leads. First, so there's a lot I'd like to say and it will be on the scope of what I could really appropriately address in this call, but starting point is we have the most robust post-market surveillance of lead reliability of anybody in the industry. A lot of times, people have talked about the limitations of passive reporting and we always point out that we have the most robust active reporting, active follow-up of our device reliability, including our ICD lead reliability. We have a robust the score registry, we have a robust optimal registry, both of which are active registries. We conduct additional studies as needed on an active basis. So if you look at all the fine print in the product performance reports that  come out in the CRM space, you'll see that we break out more data and that the inputs into our data are far more comprehensive and robust then is the case from other organizations. So we have a lot of confidence that we have a good handle on St. Jude Medical device reliability and as everyone can see from just looking at reliability records here over the last, pick any period of time, I'll just say over the last 5 years, our device reliability performance has been -- has set the standard for device reliability, bar none. So that will be kind of on the opening comment. But then, what's going on here with the topic of 7 French leads it's really something that's going to play to our advantage. And what I think the headline issues that a person might see and some of the ways that commentators really get drawn into competitive marketing efforts, I think is something that I'd like to address it, and let me start with the context. So the first thing is people ought to just keep in mind that our ICD lead line represents a very significant competitive advantage to us today and it has no now for a number of years. So we have only 7 French D line on the market, Boston Scientific works with 9 French lead line the way that we calculate the measurements, Medtronic works for the 8 french lead line the way that we calculate the measurement. And so -- and the fact that we have the only 7 French lead line is meaningful from a clinical perspectives. So keep in mind that ICD patients include a large percent, a large percent of ICP patients are heart failure patients and so by definition, that means that their hemodynamics already compromised. And so the heart failure patients who receive ICD therapy are typically going to receive a CRT-D device and so that's 3 leads, that's 3 leads in a single vessel and clearly, it makes a difference if those leads can perform effectively and take up less space in the vascular system of a patient who's hemodynamics already are compromised. And clearly, a smaller lead is better. Medtronic saw that when they had the 7 French lead line. We saw that as we put our her 7 French lead line in the market. It drives strong customer preference because of the advantages to the patients that I just summarized. When Medtronic pulled their 7 French ICD lead line off the market, that created a major advantage for us. And you would recall, Rick and others who have been in the field here long enough would recall, that when Medtronic pulled its Fedelis lead line up the market due to the catastrophic fractures and failures that forced them to take the entire line off the market and never return it to market, that created a big advantage for us. And the question was, how long is that advantage going to last, how long would it take for Medtronic to get back on the market with the 7 French lead line? People may forget that, that was October 2007 at that time, the speculation was it might take Medtronic as long as 2 years to get a 7 French ICD lead line back on the market. Four years later, they don't have one and I would encourage everyone to go to Medtronic after this call and ask for an update on when will Medtronic got a 7 French lead line back out on the market. And our understanding, which would be of course limited by the fact that Medtronic talk about this, but our market intelligence is that Medtronic has been unable to be successful in developing their 7 French lead line and if they're still years away, but I don't know if they're going to give you a date, our intelligence is they are still years away. So that's the context for what's stirred up here in the last 30 days or so. So Medtronic has recently started a campaign in the United States where they're going to customers and they're telling them 7 French leads are too small and not safe and they point to study by one center in Northern Ireland that documented partial failures of ICD lead insulation. There are several problems with Medtronic's campaign. The first is that the center in Northern Ireland used mostly 8 French leads. Then second thing is, that lead insulation failures are not due to French size. The thickness of the silicone insulation on a 7 French lead is exactly the same as the thickness of silicon insulation on an 8 French leads. So right away, you'll  see where the Medtronic field organization get itself off track thinking, since it's 7 French, it must just thin down the insulation and that may be what Medtronic tried to do with their the development efforts, that may be why they've been unsuccessful in getting a 7 French lead line back on the market. That's not what we did to to provide a 7 French ICD lead. Our technology innovation was far more elegant inside the lead. We did not in any way compromise the insulation thickness or the lead insulation to give physicians and patients the benefit of 7 French ICD line. And then a third, and there be again an expanded conversation, the person I like to be engineering data had really educate the market and this is exactly what we're doing that our physician customers. But third, although failure rates are low overall due to insulation failure caused by abrasion, although the failure rates are low overall, the 8 French leads have a statistically significant higher rate of insulation failure. Now remember, my earlier remarks, Medtronic is the only company with an 8 French ICD lead on the market. So this is peculiar situation where you've got a company where the data shows a statistically significant higher insulation failure rate on an 8 French lead. And you got that company running around talking about insulation failures. So it's the kind of situation that really plays to our strength. It's a great marketing opportunity for us. This is going to backfire on anyone who is working with either incorrect or incomplete data to work to mislead customers and the private patients of the benefit of state-of-the-art technology. And all of these, what this does is this sets the table for us to come in, point out of the things and far more that I've just outlined to customers to talk about and remind customers of the advantages of the St. Jude Medical ICD lead line. So in the interim here, a key theme for us is that although the overall failure rates are low, we have long focused on insulation failure due to abrasion as a problem to solve in our efforts of continuous improvement in our lead technology. And so, I'm not sure the exact time line is. It's been 10 years or so that we've been invested and we've been developing a proprietary material that we call Optum, which we began to put into our the line in 2006. Optum is 50x more resistant to abrasion than silicon. You can no longer buy an ICD lead from St. Jude Medical unless it is protected from abrasion by Optum. That's why at the end of last year, we completely discontinued offering to customers any ICD leads that were unprotected by Optum. Customers can only get the benefit of Optum protection against insulation failures and Optum protection against lead abrasion from St. Jude Medical. So all of this is -- it's a little bit, I'm reminded of rabbit talking about the hopeful me in that briar patch. We're a little bit like briar rabbit saying, oh my goodness, that's not talk leads. I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek with the point being that we like talking about leads. We like talking about the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical's ICD leads and pacing leads. We like talking about the advantages of the reliability data. We like talking about the advantages of our lead handling performance. We like talking about the advantages of our smaller leads without any compromise and insulation and in fact, with a superior technology in our insulation material. And so that's what speed up here. So that have offered my couple of my comments and again, the engineering data is really very robust, very favorable to St. Jude Medical, very favorable to patient safety and our entire lead line has been a strong basis for our gaining market share over the last 4 years and it will continue to be a basis for our gain of market share in the noble market here in years to come. And that's without having the benefit of quadripolar. So having attention beat to leads placed to our strengths and competitors help focus their attention to leads, that's fine with us. We actually have quite a bit of our own marketing initiative designed to help get physicians to give us time to walk them through all of the reasons that the St. Jude Medical ICD system is a superior system, and particularly on the strengths of our superiority order of leads."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,383,000,000, up approximately 12% over the 1,240,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,383,000,000, up approximately 12% over the 1,240,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's third quarter increased this quarter sales by about $73 million. On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased approximately 6% versus last year. 
During the third quarter, we recognized $21 million or $0.06 per share in after-tax special charges, primarily in connection with our previously announced restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within our CRM business, as well as costs associated with our continuing efforts to improve our international sales and sales support organization. In addition, we recognized $9 million or $0.03 per share in after-tax charges related to increased collection risk for accounts receivable related to one customer in Europe.
Additional information about these charges can be found in today's press release. Comments during this conference call referencing third quarter results and guidance for our full year 2011 results, including earnings per share, will be exclusive of these items.
Earnings per share were $0.78 for the third quarter of 2011, an 8% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.72 in the third quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we completed our $500 million share repurchases program that was announced in August. This reduced the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the third quarter by approximately 6 million shares, which provided one $0.01 of benefit to our adjusted EPS.
Before we discuss our third quarter 2011 sales results by product category, with guidance for the fourth quarter, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.37 to $1.42 and each JPY 78 to JPY 83 would translate into USD $1. For the third quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter, we have updated the currency rates used in our model. We are now assuming that for the fourth quarter of 2011, each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38 and that each JPY 76 to JPY 81 will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates decreases total forecasted sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 by about $20 million to $25 million, which we estimate will reduce fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the third quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $751 million, up 2% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter CRM sales were down 3% versus the third quarter of last year. 
For the third quarter, ICD sales were $445 million, up 1% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales decreased 3% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $257 million, down 10% versus last year's third quarter. International ICD sales were $188 million, a 21% increase over the third quarter of 2010, including $20 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For low-voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $306 million, an increase of 2% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter low-voltage device sales decreased 4% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $126 million, down 6% from last year's third quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $180 million, up 9% from the third quarter of 2010, including $18 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $714 million to $754 million. And for the full year 2011, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,020,000,000 to $3,060,000,000. Our revised CRM sales guidance for 2011 takes into account the expected negative impact of currency in the fourth quarter and the fact that our Unify Quadra -- quadripolar CRT-D system was not approved by FDA within our previously assumed time line.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $202 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range and up 20% over the third quarter of last year, including $11 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter AF product sales increased 13% versus last year. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million. As a result of the strong performance in the first 3 quarters of 2011 and despite a weakening currency environment, we now expect our 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $810 million to $825 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2011 were $328 million, up 37% over the third quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 28% versus last year. 
As discussed on prior calls, we now breakout our sales of cardiovascular products into 2 categories, structural heart and vascular. Sales of heart valve products, along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug, are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, the FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories.
For the third quarter of 2011, sales of structural heart products were $151 million, an increase of 91% over the third quarter of 2010 or 80% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the third quarter of 2011 were $177 million, a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2010 or 2% on a constant currency basis. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $323 million to $338 million. We now expect our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,335,000,000. This revised 2011 guidance range is primarily the result of the anticipated negative impact of currency on our business in the fourth quarter.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2011 were $102 million, up 10% from the third quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $102 million to $112 million. We now expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales to be in the range of $400 million to $410 million, due to challenging market conditions and the elective nature of Neuromodulation therapy.
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 48% of St. Jude Medical sales in the third quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 52% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the third quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.7%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 74.0% to 74.5%. Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 35.9% of net sales, an increase of 160 basis points over the third quarter of 2010. As we have mentioned on previous earnings calls, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points during 2011. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 35.0% to 35.5%.
Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2011 were 12.8% of net sales compared with 12.1% of sales in the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0%, as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $20 million in the third quarter, which includes $7 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense in the range of $20 million to $25 million. And for the full year 2011, we now expect other expense of approximately $91 million to $96 million. 
For the third quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0%. For 2011, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $960 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $3 billion in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 322 million to 324 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 at 327 million to 329 million. This revised guidance on outstanding shares reflects the impact of our $500 million share repurchase program, which we completed in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. And for the full year 2011, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.28. 
I'd now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

Virtually, everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors, such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics, will have on MedTec",3094,"Thank you, John. Virtually, everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors, such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics, will have on MedTech market growth rates. These are legitimate concerns and continue to draw significant attention from the St. Jude Medical leadership team. 
It is more important, however, to realize that St. Jude Medical has set itself apart from other companies by preparing to accelerate its growth in spite of these concerns. During our Annual Investor Conference in February of this year, we talked about 18 new growth drivers that support our confidence that we will accelerate our organic sales growth over the long-term. The remainder of my comments will update you on our progress and accomplishments implementing these new growth drivers. 
Let me start with our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program. We reported today that revenue for our structural heart program increased over 90% on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter. Although much of this growth was due to the benefit of our acquisition of AGA in November 2010, this growth also was due to the success of our Trifecta pericardial's tissue valve in Europe and in the United States and our Epic stented tissue valve program in Japan.
Keep in mind that the pericardial stented tissue valve market represents a new growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical of approximately $500 million annually. Revenue for our stented tissue valve products grew over 50% globally during the third quarter and is expected to continue growing at a strong double-digit rate for the foreseeable future. We are just beginning to capture our share of this new $500 million segment of the heart valve market.
A second new growth driver we are implementing to help accelerate our long-term organic sales growth is our Portico transcatheter valve implant or TAVI program. Our first in human series of implants at 3 centers in Canada and in Europe has been highly successful. We will begin enrolling in our pivotal trial for CE Mark purposes this quarter and are on track to begin a limited launch of our Portico line of TAVI heart valves in Europe before the end of 2012. We are optimistic that our Portico line of TAVI heart valves will offer key competitive advantages due to its ease of use, deployment accuracy, repositioning, capability and retrievability in a way that will support meaningful gain of market share once this product line is fully launched.
In addition to our TAVI line of heart valves and our new lines of stented tissue valves, a third major growth driver that we are implementing within our structural heart program is our percutaneous mitral valve repair or PMVR product line. Although we still are not disclosing details of our PMVR technology due to our patent protection activities, I would like to say a little more about our PMVR program. 
Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common form of valvular heart disease and is a significant public health problem that leads to dilation of the heart, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary congestion and heart failure. Like the other major disease states St. Jude Medical addresses with its technology, mitral valve regurgitation is both an epidemic and expensive disease for healthcare budgets in the United States and globally. We estimate that if our PMVR technology can help even 5% of the patients in developed markets, who already have been diagnosed with symptomatic mitral valve regurgitation, we will have a new $2 billion growth driver. At the same time, we save money for global healthcare budgets. 
We are starting our first in human series of PMVR procedures this quarter. We estimate that we will receive CE Mark and begin launching this technology in Europe before the end of 2013. We expect to capture good synergies in Europe from the investment we will make to launch both our Portico line of TAVI heart valves before the end of 2012 and our PMVR technology before the end of 2013.
A fourth new growth driver within our structural heart franchise is our left atrial appendage or LAA closure system. In 2010, LAA closure technology was recognized by the Cleveland Clinic as one of the most important MedTech innovations of the year. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (sic) [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] or NICE in the U.K. issued guidance in 2010 supporting the comparative effectiveness of LAA closure in patients with atrial fibrillation. At least one commentator estimates that with reasonable assumptions, the LAA closure market will be a new $400 million growth market by 2015.
St. Jude Medical's AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug LAA closure system currently enjoys a leading market share in Europe and is growing at a strong double-digit rate. In the United States, the feasibility phase of our IDE clinical trial has been completed. We expect to begin enrolling in the pivotal phase of our IDE clinical trial in the near future. With favorable comparative effectiveness data, the endorsement of major key opinion leaders and the normal but time-consuming work of market development initiatives, we think our LAA closure program has the realistic potential to become a winner in an environment of health care reform and budget cuts and become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the long term.
Before I move away from the topic of new growth drivers within our structural heart program, I would like to touch on the topic of PFO closure for stroke and migraine. Enthusiasm for PFO closure for emerging indications has been dampened by the unsuccessful CLOSURE I and mistrials conducted by NMT, although reservations are understandable and St. Jude Medical models no revenue tied to emerging indications for PFO closure. NMT's Closure I and mistrials compare to St. Jude Medical's RESPECT and PREMIUM trials in the same way that a leaky boat compares to the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria of the Columbus expedition. Compared with the NMT PFO closure system, which was reported to leak, we expect our AMPLATZER PFO closure device to show better procedural success, a better closure rate, less device thrombus and less atrial fibrillation. 
In addition to the superiority of our product design, St. Jude Medical's clinical trials also are designed differently from the NMT trials in favorable way. We have different inclusion and exclusion criteria and different clinical endpoints. Although we do not know whether our RESPECT or PREMIUM clinical trials will be successful, these trials deserve continued attention as serious initiatives, which has the potential to generate new growth. 
The PFO closure trial furthest along is our RESPECT trial, which evaluates the benefit of PFO closure for certain patients who have a high risk of stroke. We currently have approximately 950 patients enrolled in this event-driven trial. We are blinded to the data and, therefore, cannot comment further, but we expect the clinical data defining the end point of this trial to become available during 2012.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation growth franchise. We announced last month that we have received industry's first and only regulatory approval for use of an implanted neurostimulation device for patients who suffer from intractable chronic migraine. Data from our pivotal clinical trial were presented at the International Headache Congress in Berlin in June. 
And considering this data, it is important to note that the patients we studied were the so-called worst of the worst. The inclusion criteria required failure of at least 3 drugs and a headache lasting at least 4 hours per day for 15 or more days per month, causing at least moderate disability. Patients enrolled in the study kept a diary of headache days and actually suffered from an average of 26 headache days per month. At 12 weeks follow-up, patients in the treatment group experienced a 28% decrease in number of headache days, a 41% improvement in overall disability measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment, or MIDAS questionnaire, and a 20% improvement in Zung Pain and Disability Index, or PAD scores, as well as numerous improvements by other qualitative measures. 
Neuromodulation therapy will not be appropriate for everyone in Europe who suffers from intractable chronic migraine, but headache neurologists in Europe now have another tool in their toolbox which will help reduce the suffering for some of these patients. We estimate that approximately 2.2 million patients in Europe suffer from severe and chronic migraine, which is approximately 5% of the total migraine population in Europe. If we can help only 5% of this 5% with our Neuromodulation therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver. At the same time, we reduce patient suffering and help improve healthcare economics. As always, market development will take time, but limited market release activities already are underway and are expected to benefit our organic sales growth rate in 2012.
Another major new growth driver we are implementing is renal denervation for treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. Our first in human series for our renal denervation system already is underway. We expect to receive CE Mark and begin launching our renal denervation technology in Europe before the end of 2012. To clarify the significance of this new technology for St. Jude Medical's growth program, we estimate that as many as 1 in every 3 adults in a developed world suffers from hypertension. Approximately 25% of patients treated for hypertension do not respond to medical therapy. We estimate that if we are able to treat only 1% of adult hypertensive patients who do not respond to medical therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver. 
Keep in mind that today, hypertension generates a direct annual cost of global medical budgets of approximately $500 billion. As with each of our other major investments, St. Jude Medical's goal is to create a new $1 billion growth franchise for the benefit of our investors. At the same time, we help make quality global healthcare more affordable.
These are the exact same goals that motivated our investments in: fractional flow reserve, or FFR technology, for patients suffering from coronary artery disease; CardioMEMS technology for patients who suffer from heart failure; deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression; and an entire portfolio of medical device technologies developed to help address the epidemic of atrial fibrillation. All of these technologies have been reviewed thoroughly in past communication, so I will not extend my prepared remarks by reiterating details of these technologies here.
St. Jude Medical places high priority on investing in properly designed comparative effectiveness trials to support robust reimbursement and healthy market growth, long term, for all of our emerging technologies. The gold standard for this initiative is our past sponsorship of the FAME trial, which established that the cost of stenting patients with multivessel coronary disease can be reduced by 14% through the use of our fractional flow reserve, or FFR technology. 
The complete list of comparative effectiveness trials we are supporting includes: the CABANA for atrial fibrillation, the EAST trial for atrial fibrillation, the FAME II trial for coronary artery disease, the SCD-HeFT 10-Year Follow-up Study for heart failure in ICD patients and the Brodmann trial for patients who suffer from treatment-resistant depression. Taken together, these investments give us confidence that after our new technologies enter the market in an environment of macroeconomic stress and healthcare reform, our technologies will be surrounded by adequate reimbursement and attractive market growth, long term.
Next I would like to offer updates on the progress we are making with key initiatives in our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM franchise. I'm going to start with an update on our ST segment monitoring technology. We have not been talking about our ST segment monitoring technology recently because we have been working with FDA to define the regulatory pathway needed to bring this technology to the market in the United States. Now that the regulatory pathway is clear, we offer this update. 
First, as a reminder, the ST segment is a section of an electrocardiogram that depicts electrical changes between heart beats to indicate obstruction of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle. We are the first and only company who has been able to monitor these changes with our implantable defibrillator, or ICDs, which means we can do so in a manner that is extremely cost-effective for patients who have ICD. This technology is especially important, because it may provide an early warning signal that a patient is experiencing a heart attack. 
When a patient is experiencing a heart attack every minute counts. For every 30 minutes that treatment is delayed, mortality increases by 7.5%. Because symptoms can be vague, in approximately 1/3 of patients don't even have typical chest symptoms, the average time it takes for patient to seek treatment has remained at almost 3 hours in the United States over the last decade.
This ST segment monitoring technology received CE Mark in December of 2008 and is now nearing the end of its third year on the market in Europe. This technology was approved by the MHLW in Japan in 2010 and is now widely available, not only in Europe and Japan but also in China, India and in all other major markets around the world. 
St. Jude Medical announced last quarter that we have now enrolled our first patient in the IDE clinical trial required by FDA to bring this technology to market in the United States. Our Analyze ST trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, pivotal IDE investigation of up to 5,228 patients who will be enrolled at approximately 200 medical centers. The Analyze ST trial is designed to study the safety and efficacy of the ST segment monitoring technology in the Fortify ST ICD. The sensitivity of the feature for detecting acute coronary syndrome events, including myocardial infarctions, will be the primary efficacy end point. The primary safety end point will be assessed by reporting the percentage of patients who experienced a false-positive. 
The Analyze ST trial will be the largest IDE trial for an implantable device ever performed in the United States and will cost tens of millions of dollars. It is premature for us to predict when this technology will become available in the United States, but our rough estimate is that it will be between 7 to 8 years after the technology became available in Europe and approximately 4 to 5 years after the technology became available in Japan and virtually all other major markets. 
Our takeaway from this experience is that there is a compelling need for the FDA regulatory approval process to become more predictable, more transparent and more cost-effective. The regulatory pendulum at the FDA has swung too far in the wrong direction against innovation and needs to take a more practical approach to risk benefit analysis. The medical device industry is a major generator of jobs, exports and healthcare savings for the U.S. economy. St. Jude Medical is focused on technology innovation that is part of the solution to affordable healthcare and sustainable economic growth. We need a strong FDA that is fully funded and that has the culture and organizational confidence to strike the right balance between approving innovative medical device technology on the one hand and, on the other hand, protecting the public health in a way that is not overly defensive.
Next is an update on FDA regulatory approval for our Unify quadripolar CRT-D system. As we indicated previously, our first-generation quadripolar CRT-D system received CE Mark and began limited launch in Europe exactly 2 years ago this month. Last month, we announced CE Mark and initial launch of our second-generation quadripolar CRT-D system in Europe. Although this technology is not yet available in Japan, it is available in India and in most other major medical device markets outside the United States. 
In markets where the product already is available, St. Jude Medical is gaining meaningful market share due to physician appreciation of the advantages of quadripolar CRT-D system can bring to help reduce the expense and duration of initial implants, to help reduce reoperations due to phrenic nerve stimulation, high pacing thresholds and lead dislodgment and to help improve the ability of a physician to electronically reposition the Left-Heart Lead without the need for an additional surgery. 
We cannot predict when we will receive FDA approval for our Unify quadripolar CRT-D system. We are waiting FDA response through our completed PMA supplement submission and are not aware of any outstanding issues. Our field organization has already been trained and inventory is in place to support a strong launch of our Unify Quadra product line in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval. Our experience in Europe and in other major markets with our quadripolar CRT-D system makes us optimistic that this product line will help us gain meaningful share in the United States once we have approval to bring this innovation to market.
Next, I'd like to touch on the success we are having with our Accent MRI Pacemaker in Europe. We announced last quarter that we received CE Mark approval and we're initiating launch in Europe of our Accent MRI Pacemaker. The advantage of this pacemaker system is that it offers uncompromised taking -- pacing technology in addition to full MRI compatible scanning capabilities, with no anatomical zone or MRI power restrictions. This is a breakthrough innovation that offers significant benefits to patients and clinicians. Early customer response in Europe is encouraging. We look forward to fully deploying this technology in Europe over the next few quarters and then bringing this innovation to the United States when we are able to satisfy the FDA process for doing so.
Finally, in addition to implementing new growth drivers, St. Jude Medical continues to focus on improving the productivity of our global operations. The special charges we recognized this quarter, in connection with restructuring our part of this initiative, we will continue to restructure as appropriate, as well as expand our manufacturing volumes in Malaysia, in Costa Rica, in South Carolina and in other cost-advantaged locations, as part of our comprehensive programs to optimize our cost structure long term. 
I would like to conclude my prepared remarks by summarizing that our program for implementing 18 new growth drivers is making good progress. We are supporting these new growth drivers with robust comparative effectiveness data. We simultaneously are reducing cost and increasing productivity. St. Jude Medical's program for delivering superior growth over the long term is on track. 
With that, I will stop and turn it over to Brooke to moderate the questions. Brooke, go ahead, please."

We would continue to guide to the same level of growth this quarter that we guided to last quarter, which was we wanted to be conservative. We wanted to really take this issue off the table for purposes of updating models for St. Jude Medical and for our growth rate. And we indicated that we expected for full year 2011 the global CRM market to shrink about 2%, and so that continues to be a good estimate here one quarter later. We really did not see significant changes in the CRM market over the last 90 days. We think the market didn't get better. The market didn't get worse. We saw ASP dynamics consistent during this last quarter as in the prior quarter. It's a tough market with a number of distressed conditions, but it seems to be reasonably steady state. With respect to the Department of Justice investigation, as everyone would appreciate, we have no special insights. The DOJ doesn't talk to us about it. So we -- we're really monitoring events as they become publicly visible in the same way that everybody else is. And -- so we cannot predict what comes next or exactly what's the time line is for the DOJ investigation. And I don't think anybody outside the DOJ can actually do that. With respect to the kind of longer-term outlook for the CRM market, the -- we've directed people's attention to the American Heart Journal study that came up earlier this year. It was a study that was conducted by a number of luminaries from UCLA, from Northwestern University, from Duke. It indicated the number of patients who are dying every year, who are not receiving optimal therapy for heart failure conditions, including optimal ICD therapy. And that is -- so there were a number of wide range estimates for what the impact is on the public health from the failure of available technology to get to all of the patients who need it. But at the midpoint is, I recall, there is an estimate that about 20,000 people a year in the United states were needlessly dying of their heart failure condition due to their -- the fact that they didn't have in ICD, and they should've had one. So there's just one data point we've referred people a number of times to other kind of highly visible data points, the miniscule number of implants per population in emerging markets. We particularly cite China and India and -- but also a number of other emerging markets. All of which give us the optimism that over the long term, there are still plenty of growth left in the global CRM market, and St. Jude Medical will be well positioned to take advantage of that growth as it emerges. So those are -- Rick, those are my main comments on the -- on kind of the dynamics surrounding the CRM market. Did I answer your question or was there another part of it?"

We're not aware of any outstanding issues, and we're waiting to hear from FDA. So approval could be later today. Approval could be later this quarter. Approval could be -- so we -- that tells you our state of knowledge. We're ready to go. The technology has been established to be safe. It's been established to be effective. It's been on the market in Europe for 2 years. It's helping patients elsewhere all around the world. We look forward to the opportunity to have this technology begin to help patients in the United States as well. And we just wait day by day, but have no special insight into when we'll receive our approval. On the former question about the -- our ICD leads. First -- so there's a lot I'd like to say, and it'll go beyond the scope of what I could really appropriately address in this call. But starting point is we have the most robust post-market surveillance of lead reliability of anybody in the industry. A lot of times, people have talked about the limitations of passive reporting, and we always point out that we have the most robust active reporting, active follow-up of our device reliability, including our ICD lead reliability. We have a robust score registry. We have a robust optimum registry. Both of which are active registries. We conduct additional studies as needed on an active basis. So we -- if you look at all the fine print in the product performance reports that come out in the CRM space, you'll see that we break out more data, and that the inputs into our data are far more comprehensive and robust that is the case from other organizations. So we have a lot of confidence that we have a good handle on St. Jude Medical device reliability. And as everyone can see from just looking at reliability records here over the last, pick any period of time, I'll just say over the last 5 years, our device reliability performance has been -- has set the standard for device reliability, bar none. So that would be just kind of an opening comment. But then what's going on here with the topic of 7 French leads is really something that's going to play to our advantage. And what I think the headline issues that a person might see and some of the ways that commentators really get drawn into competitive marketing efforts, I think is something that I'd like to address. And let me start with the context. So the first thing is people ought to -- just keep in mind that our ICD lead line are in -- is a -- represents a very significant competitive advantage to us today, and it has now for a number of years. So we have the only 7 French ICD line on the market. Boston Scientific works with a 9 French lead line the way that we calculate the measurements. Medtronic works with an 8 French lead line the way that we calculate the measurement. And so -- and the fact that we have the only 7 French lead line is meaningful from a clinical perspective. So keep in mind that ICD patients include a large percent -- a large percent of ICD patients are heart failure patients. And so by definition, that means that their hemodynamics are already compromised. And so the heart failure patients who receive ICD therapy are typically going to receive a CRT-D device. And so that's 3 leads. That's 3 leads in a single vessel. And so, clearly, it makes a difference if those leads can perform effectively and take up less space in the vascular system of a patient who's hemodynamics already are compromised, and clearly, a smaller lead is better. Medtronic saw that when they had a 7 French lead line. We saw that as we put our 7 French lead line in the market. It draws a strong customer preference because of the advantages to the patients that I've just summarized. When Medtronic pulled their 7 French ICD lead line off the market, that created a major advantage for us. And you would recall, Rick, and others who've been in the field here long enough would recall that when Medtronic pulled its Fidelis lead line off the market due to the catastrophic fractures and failures that forced them to take the entire line off the market and never return it to market, that created a big advantage for us. And the question was, how long was that advantage going to last, how long would it take for Medtronic to get back on the market with a 7 French lead line. People may forget that, that was October 2007. At the time, the speculation was it might take Medtronic as long as 2 years to get a 7 French ICD line -- lead line back on the market. Four years later, they don't have one. And I would encourage everyone to go to Medtronic after this call and ask for an update on when will Medtronic got a 7 French lead line back out on the market. And our understanding, which would be, of course, limited by the fact that Medtronic don't really talk to us about this, but our market intelligence is that Medtronic has been unable to be successful in developing their 7 French lead line and that they're still years away. I don't know if they're going to give you a date or not, our intelligence is they're still years away. So that's the context for what's stirred up here in the last 30 days or so. So Medtronic has recently started a campaign in the United States where they're going to customers and they're telling them 7 French leads are too small and not safe, and they point to a study by one center in Northern Ireland that documented partial failures of ICD lead insulation. There are several problems with Medtronic's campaign. The first is that the center in Northern Ireland used mostly 8 French leads. And then second thing is, that lead insulation failures are not due to French size. The thickness of silicone insulation on a 7 French lead is exactly the same as the thickness of silicon insulation on an 8 French lead. So right away, you see where the Medtronic field organization gets itself off track thinking, ""Oh, if it's a 7 French, they must just thin down the insulation."" And that may be what Medtronic tried to do in their lead development efforts. That may be why they've been unsuccessful in getting a 7 French lead line back on the market. That's not what we did to provide a 7 French ICD lead. Our technology innovation was far more elegant inside the lead. We did not in any way compromise the insulation thickness or the lead insulation to give physicians and patients the benefit of a -- of 7 French ICD line. And then third -- and there be, again, in an expanded conversation, a person would like to bring out a lot of engineering data and really educate the market, and this is exactly what we're doing with our physician customers. But third, although failure rates are low overall due to insulation failure caused by abrasion, although the failure rates are low overall, 8 F leads -- the 8 French leads have a statistically significant higher rate of insulation failure. And -- now remember, my earlier remarks, Medtronic is the only company with an 8 French ICD lead on the market. So this is that peculiar situation where you've got a company where the data shows a statistically significant higher insulation failure rate on an 8 French lead, and you got that company running around talking about insulation failures. So it's the kind of situation that really plays to our strength. It's a great marketing opportunity for us. This is going to backfire on anyone who is working with either incorrect or incomplete data to work to mislead customers and deprive patients of the benefit of state-of-the-art technology. And this -- well, all of this -- what this does is this sets the table for us to come in, point out all of the things and far more than I've just outlined to customers to talk about and remind customers of the advantages of the St. Jude Medical ICD lead line. So in the interim here, a key theme for us is that although the overall failure rates are low, we have long focused on insulation failure due to abrasion as a problem to solve in our efforts of continuous improvement in our lead technology. And so I'm not sure of the exact time line is. It's been 10 years or so that we've been invested and we've been developing a proprietary material that we call Optim, which we began to put into our lead line in 2006. Optim is 50x more resistant to abrasion than silicon. You can no longer buy an ICD lead from St. Jude Medical unless it is protected from abrasion by Optim. That's why at the end of last year, we completely discontinued offering to customers any ICD leads that were unprotected by Optim. Customers can only get the benefit of Optim protection against insulation failures and Optim protection against lead abrasion from St. Jude Medical. So all of this is -- it's a little bit -- I'm reminded of Brer Rabbit, talking about don't throw me into the briar patch. We're a little bit like Brer Rabbit saying, ""Oh my goodness, let's not talk leads."" The -- I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek, with the point being that we like talking about leads. We like talking about the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical's ICD leads and pacing leads. We like talking about the advantages of the reliability data. We like talking about the advantages of our lead-handling performance. We like talking about the advantages of our smaller leads without any compromise in the insulation and, in fact, with a superior technology in our insulation material. And so that's what -- what's teed up here. So that's a -- I've offered couple of my comments. And again, the engineering data is really very robust, very favorable to St. Jude Medical, very favorable to patient safety. And our entire lead line has been a strong basis for our gaining market share over the last 4 years, and it'll continue to be a basis for our gain of share in the de novo market here in years to come. And that's without having the benefit of quadripolar. So having attention be to leads plays to our strengths. And if the competitors help focus their attention to leads, that's fine with us. We actually have quite a bit of our own marketing initiative designed to help get physicians to give us time to walk them through all of the reasons that the St. Jude Medical ICD system is a superior system, and particularly on the strengths of our superiority order of leads."

I thought the one piece of the puzzle that everybody's going to be focused on, if we fast forward a couple of years, is going to be the competitive landscape in the U.S. market and the potential for intellectual property battle between Medtronic and whoever else may follow them, including yourself. Can you just spend a minute, to the degree which you're comfortable talking about, the IP and your comfort on entering that market, not just in Europe but in the U.S.?"

We've got a lot of talent focused on what's the whole landscape, what's the right place for us within that landscape, how can we change the landscape with our own IP activity. So we're fully focused on the intellectual property landscape for renal denervation in the same way that we are for each of our other major technologies and major new growth drivers. As far as saying anything more specifically, anytime anyone ask questions on legal strategy, we always no comment and -- we always say no comment.

If we don't get approval at all, we'll expect the CRM revenue to come in the lower half of the range.

And as we said a quarter ago, the -- in the U.S., the CRM market clearly hit a pothole and took a bit of a dive last quarter. It has not recovered this quarter. So as you look at the -- look for short-term data that would indicate a positive trend, we won't point you to do that. What we'll say is the market took a drop a quarter ago. It continues in that same kind of depressed condition, has very weak dynamics. Those weak dynamics were merged into our market model a quarter ago. Those weak dynamics are continuing into this quarter, and so our view of the CRM market for 2011 remains exactly the same.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,383,000,000, up approximately 12% over the $1,240,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,383,000,000, up approximately 12% over the $1,240,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's third quarter increased this quarter sales by about $73 million. On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased approximately 6% versus last year. 
During the third quarter, we recognized $21 million or $0.06 per share in after-tax special charges, primarily in connection with our previously announced restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within our CRM business, as well as costs associated with our continuing efforts to improve our international sales and sales support organization. In addition, we recognized $9 million or $0.03 per share in after-tax charges related to increased collection risk for accounts receivable related to one customer in Europe.
Additional information about these charges can be found in today's press release. Comments during this conference call referencing third quarter results and guidance for our full year 2011 results, including earnings per share, will be exclusive of these items.
Earnings per share were $0.78 for the third quarter of 2011, an 8% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.72 in the third quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we completed our $500 million share repurchases program that was announced in August. This reduced the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the third quarter by approximately 6 million shares, which provided $0.01 of benefit to our adjusted EPS.
Before we discuss our third quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the fourth quarter, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.37 to $1.42 and each JPY 78 to JPY 83 would translate into USD $1. For the third quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter, we have updated the currency rates used in our model. We are now assuming that for the fourth quarter of 2011, each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38 and that each JPY 76 to JPY 81 will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates decreases total forecasted sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 by about $20 million to $25 million, which we estimate will reduce fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the third quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $751 million, up 2% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter CRM sales were down 3% versus the third quarter of last year. 
For the third quarter, ICD sales were $445 million, up 1% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales decreased 3% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $257 million, down 10% versus last year's third quarter. International ICD sales were $188 million, a 21% increase over the third quarter of 2010, including $20 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For low-voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $306 million, an increase of 2% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter low-voltage device sales decreased 4% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $126 million, down 6% from last year's third quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $180 million, up 9% from the third quarter of 2010, including $18 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $714 million to $754 million. And for the full year 2011, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,020,000,000 to $3,060,000,000. Our revised CRM sales guidance for 2011 takes into account the expected negative impact of currency in the fourth quarter and the fact that our Unify Quadra quadripolar CRT-D system was not approved by FDA within our previously assumed time line.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $202 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range and up 20% over the third quarter of last year, including $11 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter AF product sales increased 13% versus last year. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million. As a result of the strong performance in the first 3 quarters of 2011 and despite a weakening currency environment, we now expect our 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $810 million to $825 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2011 were $328 million, up 37% over the third quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 28% versus last year. 
As discussed on prior calls, we now break out our sales of cardiovascular products into 2 categories, structural heart and vascular. Sales of heart valve products, along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug, are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, the FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories.
For the third quarter of 2011, sales of structural heart products were $151 million, an increase of 91% over the third quarter of 2010 or 80% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the third quarter of 2011 were $177 million, a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2010 or 2% on a constant currency basis. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $323 million to $338 million. We now expect our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,335,000,000. This revised 2011 guidance range is primarily the result of the anticipated negative impact of currency on our business in the fourth quarter.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2011 were $102 million, up 10% from the third quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $102 million to $112 million. We now expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales to be in the range of $400 million to $410 million due to challenging market conditions and the elective nature of Neuromodulation therapy.
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 48% of St. Jude Medical sales in the third quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 52% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the third quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.7%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 74.0% to 74.5%. Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 35.9% of net sales, an increase of 160 basis points over the third quarter of 2010. As we have mentioned on previous earnings calls, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points during 2011. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 35.0% to 35.5%.
Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2011 were 12.8% of net sales compared with 12.1% of sales in the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0%, as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $20 million in the third quarter, which includes $7 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense in the range of $20 million to $25 million. And for the full year 2011, we now expect other expense of approximately $91 million to $96 million. 
For the third quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0%. For 2011, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $960 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $3 billion in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 322 million to 324 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 at 327 million to 329 million. This revised guidance on outstanding shares reflects the impact of our $500 million share repurchase program, which we completed in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. And for the full year 2011, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.28. 
I'd now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

Virtually everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics will have on MedTech m",3096,"Thank you, John. Virtually everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics will have on MedTech market growth rates. These are legitimate concerns and continue to draw significant attention from the St. Jude Medical leadership team. 
It is more important, however, to realize that St. Jude Medical has set itself apart from other companies by preparing to accelerate its growth in spite of these concerns. During our Annual Investor Conference in February of this year, we talked about 18 new growth drivers that support our confidence that we will accelerate our organic sales growth over the long-term. The remainder of my comments will update you on our progress and accomplishments implementing these new growth drivers. 
Let me start with our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program. We reported today that revenue for our structural heart program increased over 90% on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter. Although much of this growth was due to the benefit of our acquisition of AGA in November 2010, this growth also was due to the success of our Trifecta pericardial's tissue valve in Europe and in the United States and our Epic stented tissue valve program in Japan.
Keep in mind that the pericardial stented tissue valve market represents a new growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical of approximately $500 million annually. Revenue for our stented tissue valve products grew over 50% globally during the third quarter and is expected to continue growing at a strong double-digit rate for the foreseeable future. We are just beginning to capture our share of this new $500 million segment of the heart valve market.
A second new growth driver we are implementing to help accelerate our long-term organic sales growth is our Portico transcatheter valve implant or TAVI program. Our first in human series of implants at 3 centers in Canada and in Europe has been highly successful. We will begin enrolling in our pivotal trial for CE Mark purposes this quarter and are on track to begin a limited launch of our Portico line of TAVI heart valves in Europe before the end of 2012. We are optimistic that our Portico line of TAVI heart valves will offer key competitive advantages due to its ease of use, deployment accuracy, repositioning, capability and retrievability in a way that will support meaningful gain of market share once this product line is fully launched.
In addition to our TAVI line of heart valves and our new lines of stented tissue valves, a third major growth driver that we are implementing within our structural heart program is our percutaneous mitral valve repair or PMVR product line. Although we still are not disclosing details of our PMVR technology due to our patent protection activities, I would like to say a little more about our PMVR program. 
Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common form of valvular heart disease and is a significant public health problem that leads to dilation of the heart, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary congestion and heart failure. Like the other major disease states St. Jude Medical addresses with its technology, mitral valve regurgitation is both an epidemic and expensive disease for healthcare budgets in the United States and globally. We estimate that if our PMVR technology can help even 5% of the patients in developed markets who already have been diagnosed with symptomatic mitral valve regurgitation, we will have a new $2 billion growth driver. At the same time, we save money for global healthcare budgets. 
We are starting our first in human series of PMVR procedures this quarter. We estimate that we will receive CE Mark and begin launching this technology in Europe before the end of 2013. We expect to capture good synergies in Europe from the investment we will make to launch both our Portico line of TAVI heart valves before the end of 2012 and our PMVR technology before the end of 2013.
A fourth new growth driver within our structural heart franchise is our left atrial appendage or LAA closure system. In 2010, LAA closure technology was recognized by the Cleveland Clinic as one of the most important MedTech innovations of the year. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (sic) [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] or NICE in the U.K. issued guidance in 2010 supporting the comparative effectiveness of LAA closure in patients with atrial fibrillation. At least one commentator estimates that with reasonable assumptions the LAA closure market will be a new $400 million growth market by 2015.
St. Jude Medical's AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug LAA closure system currently enjoys a leading market share in Europe and is growing at a strong double-digit rate. In the United States, the feasibility phase of our IDE clinical trial has been completed. We expect to begin enrolling in the pivotal phase of our IDE clinical trial in the near future. With favorable comparative effectiveness data, the endorsement of major key opinion leaders and the normal but time-consuming work of market development initiatives, we think our LAA closure program has the realistic potential to become a winner in an environment of health care reform and budget cuts and become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the long term.
Before I move away from the topic of new growth drivers within our structural heart program, I would like to touch on the topic of PFO closure for stroke and migraine. Enthusiasm for PFO closure for emerging indications has been dampened by the unsuccessful CLOSURE I and mistrials conducted by NMT, although reservations are understandable and St. Jude Medical models no revenue tied to emerging indications for PFO closure. NMT's Closure I and mistrials compare to St. Jude Medical's RESPECT and PREMIUM trials in the same way that a leaky boat compares to the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria of the Columbus expedition. Compared with the NMT PFO closure system which was reported to leak, we expect our AMPLATZER PFO closure device to show better procedural success, a better closure rate, less device thrombus and less atrial fibrillation. 
In addition to the superiority of our product design, St. Jude Medical's clinical trials also are designed differently from the NMT trials in favorable ways. We have different inclusion and exclusion criteria and different clinical endpoints. Although we do not know whether our RESPECT or PREMIUM clinical trials will be successful, these trials deserve continued attention as serious initiatives which have the potential to generate new growth. 
The PFO closure trial furthest along is our RESPECT trial, which evaluates the benefit of PFO closure for certain patients who have a high risk of stroke. We currently have approximately 950 patients enrolled in this event-driven trial. We are blinded to the data and therefore cannot comment further, but we expect the clinical data defining the end point of this trial to become available during 2012.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation growth franchise. We announced last month that we have received industry's first and only regulatory approval for use of an implanted neurostimulation device for patients who suffer from intractable chronic migraine. Data from our pivotal clinical trial were presented at the International Headache Congress in Berlin in June. 
In considering this data, it is important to note that the patients we studied were the so-called worst of the worst. The inclusion criteria required failure of at least 3 drugs and a headache lasting at least 4 hours per day for 15 or more days per month, causing at least moderate disability. Patients enrolled in the study kept a diary of headache days and actually suffered from an average of 26 headache days per month. At 12 weeks follow-up, patients in the treatment group experienced a 28% decrease in number of headache days, a 41% improvement in overall disability measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment or MIDAS questionnaire, and a 20% improvement in Zung Pain and Disability Index or PAD scores, as well as numerous improvements by other qualitative measures. 
Neuromodulation therapy will not be appropriate for everyone in Europe who suffers from intractable chronic migraine, but headache neurologists in Europe now have another tool in their toolbox which will help reduce the suffering for some of these patients. We estimate that approximately 2.2 million patients in Europe suffer from severe and chronic migraine, which is approximately 5% of the total migraine population in Europe. If we can help only 5% of this 5% with our Neuromodulation therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver. At the same time, we reduce patient suffering and help improve healthcare economics. As always market development will take time, but limited market release activities already are underway and are expected to benefit our organic sales growth rate in 2012.
Another major new growth driver we are implementing is renal denervation for treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. Our first in human series for our renal denervation system already is underway. We expect to receive CE Mark and begin launching our renal denervation technology in Europe before the end of 2012. To clarify the significance of this new technology for St. Jude Medical's growth program, we estimate that as many as one in every 3 adults in the developed world suffers from hypertension. Approximately 25% of patients treated for hypertension do not respond to medical therapy. We estimate that if we are able to treat only 1% of adult hypertensive patients who do not respond to medical therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver. 
Keep in mind that today hypertension generates a direct annual cost of global medical budgets of approximately $500 billion. As with each of our other major investments, St. Jude Medical's goal is to create a new $1 billion growth franchise for the benefit of our investors. At the same time, we help make quality global healthcare more affordable.
These are the exact same goals that motivated our investments in fractional flow reserve or FFR technology for patients suffering from coronary artery disease, CardioMEMS technology for patients who suffer from heart failure, deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression and an entire portfolio of medical device technologies developed to help address the epidemic of atrial fibrillation. All of these technologies have been reviewed thoroughly in past communication, so I will not extend my prepared remarks by reiterating details of these technologies here.
St. Jude Medical places high priority on investing in properly designed comparative effectiveness trials to support robust reimbursement and healthy market growth long term for all of our emerging technologies. The gold standard for this initiative is our past sponsorship of the FAME trial, which established that the cost of stenting patients with multivessel coronary disease can be reduced by 14% through the use of our fractional flow reserve or FFR technology. 
The complete list of comparative effectiveness trials we are supporting includes the CABANA for atrial fibrillation, the EAST trial for atrial fibrillation, the FAME II trial for coronary artery disease, the SCD-HeFT 10-Year Follow-up Study for heart failure in ICD patients and the Brodmann trial for patients who suffer from treatment-resistant depression. Taken together, these investments give us confidence that after our new technologies enter the market in an environment of macroeconomic stress and healthcare reform, our technologies will be surrounded by adequate reimbursement and attractive market growth long term.
Next I would like to offer updates on the progress we are making with key initiatives in our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM franchise. I'm going to start with an update on our ST segment monitoring technology. We have not been talking about our ST segment monitoring technology recently because we have been working with FDA to define the regulatory pathway needed to bring this technology to the market in the United States. Now that the regulatory pathway is clear, we offer this update. 
First as a reminder, the ST segment is a section of an electrocardiogram that depicts electrical changes between heartbeats to indicate obstruction of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle. We are the first and only company who has been able to monitor these changes with our implantable defibrillator or ICDs, which means we can do so in a manner that is extremely cost-effective for patients who have ICD. This technology is especially important because it may provide an early warning signal that a patient is experiencing a heart attack. 
When a patient is experiencing a heart attack, every minute counts. For every 30 minutes that treatment is delayed, mortality increases by 7.5%. Because symptoms can be vague and approximately 1/3 of patients don't even have typical chest symptoms, the average time it takes for a patient to seek treatment has remained at almost 3 hours in the United States over the last decade.
This ST segment monitoring technology received CE Mark in December of 2008 and is now nearing the end of its third year on the market in Europe. This technology was approved by the MHLW in Japan in 2010 and is now widely available not only in Europe and Japan, but also in China, India and in all other major markets around the world. 
St. Jude Medical announced last quarter that we have now enrolled our first patient in the IDE clinical trial required by FDA to bring this technology to market in the United States. Our Analyze ST trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, pivotal IDE investigation of up to 5,228 patients who will be enrolled at approximately 200 medical centers. The Analyze ST trial is designed to study the safety and efficacy of the ST segment monitoring technology in the Fortify ST ICD. The sensitivity of the feature for detecting acute coronary syndrome events including myocardial infarctions will be the primary efficacy end point. The primary safety end point will be assessed by reporting the percentage of patients who experienced a false positive detection. 
The Analyze ST trial will be the largest IDE trial for an implantable device ever performed in the United States and will cost tens of millions of dollars. It is premature for us to predict when this technology will become available in the United States, but our rough estimate is that it will be between 7 to 8 years after the technology became available in Europe and approximately 4 to 5 years after the technology became available in Japan and virtually all other major markets. 
Our takeaway from this experience is that there is a compelling need for the FDA regulatory approval process to become more predictable, more transparent and more cost-effective. The regulatory pendulum at the FDA has swung too far in the wrong direction against innovation and needs to take a more practical approach to risk benefit analysis. The medical device industry is a major generator of jobs, exports and healthcare savings for the U.S. economy. St. Jude Medical is focused on technology innovation that is part of the solution to affordable healthcare and sustainable economic growth. We need a strong FDA that is fully funded and that has the culture and organizational confidence to strike the right balance between approving innovative medical device technology on the one hand and on the other hand, protecting the public health in a way that is not overly defensive.
Next is an update on FDA regulatory approval for our Unify quadripolar CRT-D system. As we indicated previously, our first-generation quadripolar CRT-D system received CE Mark and began limited launch in Europe exactly 2 years ago this month. Last month, we announced CE Mark and initial launch of our second-generation quadripolar CRT-D system in Europe. Although this technology is not yet available in Japan, it is available in India and in most other major medical device markets outside the United States. 
In markets where the product already is available, St. Jude Medical is gaining meaningful market share due to physician appreciation of the advantages a quadripolar CRT-D system can bring to help reduce the expense and duration of initial implants, to help reduce reoperations due to phrenic nerve stimulation, high pacing thresholds and lead dislodgment and to help improve the ability of a physician to electronically reposition the Left-Heart Lead without the need for an additional surgery. 
We cannot predict when we will receive FDA approval for our Unify quadripolar CRT-D system. We are waiting FDA response to our completed PMA supplement submission and are not aware of any outstanding issues. Our field organization has already been trained and inventory is in place to support a strong launch of our Unify Quadra product line in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval. Our experience in Europe and in other major markets with our quadripolar CRT-D system makes us optimistic that this product line will help us gain meaningful share in the United States once we have approval to bring this innovation to market.
Next, I'd like to touch on the success we are having with our Accent MRI Pacemaker in Europe. We announced last quarter that we received CE Mark approval and we're initiating launch in Europe of our Accent MRI Pacemaker. The advantage of this pacemaker system is that it offers uncompromised ticking of pacing technology in addition to full MRI compatible scanning capabilities with no anatomical zone or MRI power restrictions. This is a breakthrough innovation that offers significant benefits to patients and clinicians. Early customer response in Europe is encouraging. We look forward to fully deploying this technology in Europe over the next few quarters and then bringing this innovation to the United States when we are able to satisfy the FDA process for doing so.
Finally, in addition to implementing new growth drivers, St. Jude Medical continues to focus on improving the productivity of our global operations. The special charges we recognized this quarter in connection with restructuring our part of this initiative we will continue to restructure as appropriate, as well as expand our manufacturing volumes in Malaysia, in Costa Rica, in South Carolina and in other cost-advantaged locations as part of our comprehensive programs to optimize our cost structure long term. 
I would like to conclude my prepared remarks by summarizing that our program for implementing 18 new growth drivers is making good progress. We are supporting these new growth drivers with robust comparative effectiveness data. We simultaneously are reducing cost and increasing productivity. St. Jude Medical's program for delivering superior growth over the long term is on track. 
With that, I will stop and turn it over to Brooke to moderate the questions. Brooke, go ahead, please."

We would continue to guide to the same level of growth this quarter that we guided to last quarter, which was we wanted to be conservative. We wanted to really take this issue off the table for purposes of updating models for St. Jude Medical and for our growth rate. And we indicated that we expected for full year 2011 the global CRM market to shrink about 2%, and so that continues to be a good estimate here one quarter later. We really did not see significant changes in the CRM market over the last 90 days. We think the market didn't get better. The market didn't get worse. We saw ASP dynamics consistent during this last quarter as in the prior quarter. It's a tough market with a number of distressed conditions, but it seems to be reasonably steady state. With respect to the Department of Justice investigation, as everyone would appreciate, we have no special insights. The DOJ doesn't talk to us about it. So we -- we're really monitoring events as they become publicly visible in the same way that everybody else is. And so we cannot predict what comes next or exactly what's the time line is for the DOJ investigation. And I don't think anybody outside the DOJ can actually do that. With respect to the kind of longer-term outlook for the CRM market, the -- we've directed people's attention to the American Heart Journal study that came out earlier this year. It was a study that was conducted by a number of luminaries from UCLA, from Northwestern University, from Duke. It indicated the number of patients who are dying every year who are not receiving optimal therapy for heart failure conditions, including optimal ICD therapy. And that is -- so there were a number of wide range estimates for what the impact is on the public health from the failure of available technology to get to all of the patients who need it. But at the midpoint, as I recall, there is an estimate that about 20,000 people a year in the United states were needlessly dying of their heart failure condition due to their -- the fact that they didn't have in ICD and they should've had one. So there's just one data point. We've referred people a number of times to other kind of highly visible data points, the miniscule number of implants per population in emerging markets. We particularly cite China and India and -- but also a number of other emerging markets, all of which give us the optimism that over the long term there's still plenty of growth left in the global CRM market and St. Jude Medical will be well positioned to take advantage of that growth as it emerges. So those are -- Rick, those are my main comments on kind of the dynamics surrounding the CRM market. Did I answer your question or was there another part of it?"

Approval could be -- so we -- that tells you our state of knowledge. We're ready to go. The technology has been established to be safe. It's been established to be effective. It's been on the market in Europe for 2 years. It's helping patients elsewhere all around the world. We look forward to the opportunity to have this technology begin to help patients in the United States as well and we just wait day by day, but have no special insight into when we'll receive our approval. On the former question about the -- our ICD leads. First -- so there's a lot I'd like to say, and it'll go beyond the scope of what I could really appropriately address in this call. But starting point is we have the most robust post-market surveillance of lead reliability of anybody in the industry. A lot of times, people talk about the limitations of passive reporting and we always point out that we have the most robust active reporting, active follow-up of our device reliability, including our ICD lead reliability. We have a robust score registry. We have a robust optimum registry, both of which are active registries. We conduct additional studies as needed on an active basis. So we -- if you look at all the fine print in the product performance reports that come out in the CRM space, you'll see that we break out more data and that the inputs into our data are far more comprehensive and robust than is the case from other organizations. So we have a lot of confidence that we have a good handle on St. Jude Medical device reliability. And as everyone can see from just looking at reliability records here over the last, pick any period of time, I'll just say over the last 5 years, our device reliability performance has been -- has set the standard for device reliability bar none. So that would be just kind of an opening comment. But then what's going on here with the topic of 7 French leads is really something that's going to play to our advantage. And what I think the headline issues that a person might see and some of the ways that commentators really get drawn into competitive marketing efforts I think is something that I'd like to address. And let me start with the context. So the first thing is people ought to -- just keep in mind that our ICD lead line are in -- is a -- represents a very significant competitive advantage to us today, and it has now for a number of years. So we have the only 7 French ICD line on the market. Boston Scientific works with a 9 French lead line the way that we calculate the measurements. Medtronic works with an 8 French lead line the way that we calculate the measurement. And so -- and the fact that we have the only 7 French lead line is meaningful from a clinical perspective. So keep in mind that ICD patients include a large percent -- a large percent of ICD patients are heart failure patients and so by definition, that means that their hemodynamics already compromised. And so the heart failure patients who receive ICD therapy are typically going to receive a CRT-D device. And so that's 3 leads. That's 3 leads in a single vessel. And so clearly, it makes a difference if those leads can perform effectively and take up less space in the vascular system of a patient who's hemodynamics already are compromised and clearly, a smaller lead is better. Medtronic saw that when they had a 7 French lead line. We saw that as we put our 7 French lead line in the market. It draws a strong customer preference because of the advantages to the patients that I've just summarized. When Medtronic pulled their 7 French ICD lead line off the market, that created a major advantage for us. And you would recall, Rick, and others who've been in the field here long enough would recall that when Medtronic pulled its Fidelis lead line off the market due to the catastrophic fractures and failures that forced them to take the entire line off the market and never return it to market, that created a big advantage for us. And the question was how long was that advantage going to last, how long would it take for Medtronic to get back on the market with a 7 French lead line. People may forget that, that was October 2007. At the time, the speculation was it might take Medtronic as long as 2 years to get a 7 French ICD line -- lead line back on the market. Four years later, they don't have one and I would encourage everyone to go to Medtronic after this call and ask for an update on when will Medtronic got a 7 French lead line back out on the market. And our understanding, which would be, of course, limited by the fact that Medtronic doesn't really talk to us about this, but our market intelligence is that Medtronic has been unable to be successful in developing their 7 French lead line and that they're still years away. I don't know if they're going to give you a date or not, our intelligence is they're still years away. So that's the context for what's stirred up here in the last 30 days or so. So Medtronic has recently started a campaign in the United States where they're going to customers and they're telling them 7 French leads are too small and not safe, and they point to a study by one center in Northern Ireland that documented partial failures of ICD lead insulation. There are several problems with Medtronic's campaign. The first is that the center in Northern Ireland used mostly 8 French leads. And then second thing is that lead insulation failures are not due to French size. The thickness of silicone insulation on a 7 French lead is exactly the same as the thickness of silicon insulation on an 8 French lead. So right away you see where the Medtronic field organization gets itself off track thinking, ""Oh, if it's a 7 French, they must just thin down the insulation."" And that may be what Medtronic tried to do in their lead development efforts. That may be why they've been unsuccessful in getting a 7 French lead line back on the market. That's not what we did to provide a 7 French ICD lead. Our technology innovation was far more elegant inside the lead. We did not in any way compromise the insulation thickness or the lead insulation to give physicians and patients the benefit of a -- of 7 French ICD line. And then third -- and there be again, in an expanded conversation, a person would like to bring out a lot of engineering data and really educate the market and this is exactly what we're doing with our physician customers. But third, although failure rates are low overall due to insulation failure caused by abrasion, although the failure rates are low overall, 8 F leads -- the 8 French leads have a statistically significant higher rate of insulation failure. And -- now remember my earlier remarks, Medtronic is the only company with an 8 French ICD lead on the market. So this is a peculiar situation where you've got a company where the data shows a statistically significant higher insulation failure rate on an 8 French lead, and you got that company running around talking about insulation failures. So it's the kind of situation that really plays to our strength. It's a great marketing opportunity for us. This is going to backfire on anyone who is working with either incorrect or incomplete data to work to mislead customers and deprive patients of the benefit of state-of-the-art technology. And this -- well, all of this -- what this does is this sets the table for us to come in, point out all of the things and far more than I've just outlined to customers to talk about and remind customers of the advantages of the St. Jude Medical ICD lead line. So in the interim here, a key theme for us is that although the overall failure rates are low, we have long focused on insulation failure due to abrasion as a problem to solve in our efforts of continuous improvement in our lead technology. And so I'm not sure of the exact time line, it's been 10 years or so that we've been invested and we've been developing a proprietary material that we call Optim, which we began to put into our lead line in 2006. Optim is 50x more resistant to abrasion than silicon. You can no longer buy an ICD lead from St. Jude Medical unless it is protected from abrasion by Optim. That's why at the end of last year, we completely discontinued offering to customers any ICD leads that were unprotected by Optim. Customers can only get the benefit of Optim protection against insulation failures and Optim protection against lead abrasion from St. Jude Medical. So all of this is -- it's a little bit -- I'm reminded of Brer Rabbit, talking about don't throw me into the briar patch. We're a little bit like Brer Rabbit saying, ""Oh my goodness, let's not talk leads."" The -- I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek, with the point being that we like talking about leads. We like talking about the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical's ICD leads and pacing leads. We like talking about the advantages of the reliability data. We like talking about the advantages of our lead-handling performance. We like talking about the advantages of our smaller leads without any compromise in the insulation and in fact with a superior technology in our insulation material. And so that's what -- what's teed up here. So that's a -- I've offered you a couple of my comments. And again, the engineering data is really very robust, very favorable to St. Jude Medical, very favorable to patient safety. And our entire lead line has been a strong basis for our gaining market share over the last 4 years, and it'll continue to be a basis for our gain of share in the de novo market here in years to come. And that's without having the benefit of quadripolar. So having attention be to leads plays to our strengths. And if the competitors help focus their attention to leads, that's fine with us. We actually have quite a bit of our own marketing initiative designed to help get physicians to give us time to walk them through all of the reasons that the St. Jude Medical ICD system is a superior system, and particularly on the strengths of our superiority of leads."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,383,000,000, up approximately 12% over the $1,240,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's third quarter increased this quarter sales by about $73 million. On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased approximately 6% versus last year. 
During the third quarter, we recognized $21 million or $0.06 per share in after-tax special charges, primarily in connection with our previously announced restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within our CRM business, as well as costs associated with our continuing efforts to improve our international sales and sales support organization. In addition, we recognized $9 million or $0.03 per share in after-tax charges related to increased collection risk for accounts receivable related to one customer in Europe.
Additional information about these charges can be found in today's press release. Comments during this conference call referencing third quarter results and guidance for our full year 2011 results, including earnings per share, will be exclusive of these items.
Earnings per share were $0.78 for the third quarter of 2011, an 8% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.72 in the third quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we completed our $500 million share repurchases program that was announced in August. This reduced the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the third quarter by approximately 6 million shares, which provided $0.01 of benefit to our adjusted EPS.
Before we discuss our third quarter 2011 sales results by product category with guidance for the fourth quarter, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2011, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.37 to $1.42 and each JPY 78 to JPY 83 would translate into USD $1. For the third quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter, we have updated the currency rates used in our model. We are now assuming that for the fourth quarter of 2011, each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38 and that each JPY 76 to JPY 81 will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates decreases total forecasted sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 by about $20 million to $25 million, which we estimate will reduce fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the third quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $751 million, up 2% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter CRM sales were down 3% versus the third quarter of last year. 
For the third quarter, ICD sales were $445 million, up 1% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales decreased 3% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $257 million, down 10% versus last year's third quarter. International ICD sales were $188 million, a 21% increase over the third quarter of 2010, including $20 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For low-voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $306 million, an increase of 2% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter low-voltage device sales decreased 4% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $126 million, down 6% from last year's third quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $180 million, up 9% from the third quarter of 2010, including $18 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $714 million to $754 million. And for the full year 2011, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $3,020,000,000 to $3,060,000,000. Our revised CRM sales guidance for 2011 takes into account the expected negative impact of currency in the fourth quarter and the fact that our Unify Quadra quadripolar CRT-D system was not approved by FDA within our previously assumed time line.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $202 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance range and up 20% over the third quarter of last year, including $11 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter AF product sales increased 13% versus last year. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million. As a result of the strong performance in the first 3 quarters of 2011 and despite a weakening currency environment, we now expect our 2011 AF product sales to be in the range of $810 million to $825 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2011 were $328 million, up 37% over the third quarter of 2010, including $21 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 28% versus last year. 
As discussed on prior calls, we now break out our sales of cardiovascular products into 2 categories, structural heart and vascular. Sales of heart valve products, along with the AMPLATZER Occluder products and left atrial appendage plug, are categorized as structural heart. Our vascular products include vascular closure products, the FFR PressureWire, OCT products, vascular plugs and other vascular accessories.
For the third quarter of 2011, sales of structural heart products were $151 million, an increase of 91% over the third quarter of 2010 or 80% on a constant currency basis. Sales of vascular products in the third quarter of 2011 were $177 million, a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2010 or 2% on a constant currency basis. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $323 million to $338 million. We now expect our full year 2011 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,320,000,000 to $1,335,000,000. This revised 2011 guidance range is primarily the result of the anticipated negative impact of currency on our business in the fourth quarter.
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2011 were $102 million, up 10% from the third quarter of 2010, including $3 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $102 million to $112 million. We now expect full year 2011 Neuromodulation sales to be in the range of $400 million to $410 million due to challenging market conditions and the elective nature of Neuromodulation therapy.
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 48% of St. Jude Medical sales in the third quarter of 2011 came from the United States, while 52% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the third quarter of 2011 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.7%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 74.0% to 74.5%. Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 35.9% of net sales, an increase of 160 basis points over the third quarter of 2010. As we have mentioned on previous earnings calls, the AGA Medical operations, including the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, are expected to increase SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points during 2011. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 35.0% to 35.5%.
Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2011 were 12.8% of net sales compared with 12.1% of sales in the third quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0%, as we continue to invest in our internal programs to drive growth in our business.
Net other expense was $20 million in the third quarter, which includes $7 million from the recently enacted excise tax in Puerto Rico. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense in the range of $20 million to $25 million. And for the full year 2011, we now expect other expense of approximately $91 million to $96 million. 
For the third quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 22.0%. For 2011, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $960 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $3 billion in total debt and $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2011. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2011, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 322 million to 324 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2011 at 327 million to 329 million. This revised guidance on outstanding shares reflects the impact of our $500 million share repurchase program, which we completed in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. And for the full year 2011, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.28. 
I'd now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

Virtually everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics will have on MedTech m",3096,"Thank you, John. Virtually everyone in MedTech is concerned about the impact factors such as the European debt crisis, other macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translations, healthcare reform and other public policy dynamics will have on MedTech market growth rates. These are legitimate concerns and continue to draw significant attention from the St. Jude Medical leadership team. 
It is more important, however, to realize that St. Jude Medical has set itself apart from other companies by preparing to accelerate its growth in spite of these concerns. During our Annual Investor Conference in February of this year, we talked about 18 new growth drivers that support our confidence that we will accelerate our organic sales growth over the long-term. The remainder of my comments will update you on our progress and accomplishments implementing these new growth drivers. 
Let me start with our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program. We reported today that revenue for our structural heart program increased over 90% on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter. Although much of this growth was due to the benefit of our acquisition of AGA in November 2010, this growth also was due to the success of our Trifecta pericardial's tissue valve in Europe and in the United States and our Epic stented tissue valve program in Japan.
Keep in mind that the pericardial stented tissue valve market represents a new growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical of approximately $500 million annually. Revenue for our stented tissue valve products grew over 50% globally during the third quarter and is expected to continue growing at a strong double-digit rate for the foreseeable future. We are just beginning to capture our share of this new $500 million segment of the heart valve market.
A second new growth driver we are implementing to help accelerate our long-term organic sales growth is our Portico transcatheter valve implant or TAVI program. Our first in human series of implants at 3 centers in Canada and in Europe has been highly successful. We will begin enrolling in our pivotal trial for CE Mark purposes this quarter and are on track to begin a limited launch of our Portico line of TAVI heart valves in Europe before the end of 2012. We are optimistic that our Portico line of TAVI heart valves will offer key competitive advantages due to its ease of use, deployment accuracy, repositioning, capability and retrievability in a way that will support meaningful gain of market share once this product line is fully launched.
In addition to our TAVI line of heart valves and our new lines of stented tissue valves, a third major growth driver that we are implementing within our structural heart program is our percutaneous mitral valve repair or PMVR product line. Although we still are not disclosing details of our PMVR technology due to our patent protection activities, I would like to say a little more about our PMVR program. 
Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common form of valvular heart disease and is a significant public health problem that leads to dilation of the heart, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary congestion and heart failure. Like the other major disease states St. Jude Medical addresses with its technology, mitral valve regurgitation is both an epidemic and expensive disease for healthcare budgets in the United States and globally. We estimate that if our PMVR technology can help even 5% of the patients in developed markets who already have been diagnosed with symptomatic mitral valve regurgitation, we will have a new $2 billion growth driver. At the same time, we save money for global healthcare budgets. 
We are starting our first in human series of PMVR procedures this quarter. We estimate that we will receive CE Mark and begin launching this technology in Europe before the end of 2013. We expect to capture good synergies in Europe from the investment we will make to launch both our Portico line of TAVI heart valves before the end of 2012 and our PMVR technology before the end of 2013.
A fourth new growth driver within our structural heart franchise is our left atrial appendage or LAA closure system. In 2010, LAA closure technology was recognized by the Cleveland Clinic as one of the most important MedTech innovations of the year. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (sic) [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] or NICE in the U.K. issued guidance in 2010 supporting the comparative effectiveness of LAA closure in patients with atrial fibrillation. At least one commentator estimates that with reasonable assumptions the LAA closure market will be a new $400 million growth market by 2015.
St. Jude Medical's AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug LAA closure system currently enjoys a leading market share in Europe and is growing at a strong double-digit rate. In the United States, the feasibility phase of our IDE clinical trial has been completed. We expect to begin enrolling in the pivotal phase of our IDE clinical trial in the near future. With favorable comparative effectiveness data, the endorsement of major key opinion leaders and the normal but time-consuming work of market development initiatives, we think our LAA closure program has the realistic potential to become a winner in an environment of health care reform and budget cuts and become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the long term.
Before I move away from the topic of new growth drivers within our structural heart program, I would like to touch on the topic of PFO closure for stroke and migraine. Enthusiasm for PFO closure for emerging indications has been dampened by the unsuccessful CLOSURE I and mistrials conducted by NMT, although reservations are understandable and St. Jude Medical models no revenue tied to emerging indications for PFO closure. NMT's Closure I and mistrials compare to St. Jude Medical's RESPECT and PREMIUM trials in the same way that a leaky boat compares to the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria of the Columbus expedition. Compared with the NMT PFO closure system which was reported to leak, we expect our AMPLATZER PFO closure device to show better procedural success, a better closure rate, less device thrombus and less atrial fibrillation. 
In addition to the superiority of our product design, St. Jude Medical's clinical trials also are designed differently from the NMT trials in favorable ways. We have different inclusion and exclusion criteria and different clinical endpoints. Although we do not know whether our RESPECT or PREMIUM clinical trials will be successful, these trials deserve continued attention as serious initiatives which have the potential to generate new growth. 
The PFO closure trial furthest along is our RESPECT trial, which evaluates the benefit of PFO closure for certain patients who have a high risk of stroke. We currently have approximately 950 patients enrolled in this event-driven trial. We are blinded to the data and therefore cannot comment further, but we expect the clinical data defining the end point of this trial to become available during 2012.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation growth franchise. We announced last month that we have received industry's first and only regulatory approval for use of an implanted neurostimulation device for patients who suffer from intractable chronic migraine. Data from our pivotal clinical trial were presented at the International Headache Congress in Berlin in June. 
In considering this data, it is important to note that the patients we studied were the so-called worst of the worst. The inclusion criteria required failure of at least 3 drugs and a headache lasting at least 4 hours per day for 15 or more days per month, causing at least moderate disability. Patients enrolled in the study kept a diary of headache days and actually suffered from an average of 26 headache days per month. At 12 weeks follow-up, patients in the treatment group experienced a 28% decrease in number of headache days, a 41% improvement in overall disability measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment or MIDAS questionnaire, and a 20% improvement in Zung Pain and Disability Index or PAD scores, as well as numerous improvements by other qualitative measures. 
Neuromodulation therapy will not be appropriate for everyone in Europe who suffers from intractable chronic migraine, but headache neurologists in Europe now have another tool in their toolbox which will help reduce the suffering for some of these patients. We estimate that approximately 2.2 million patients in Europe suffer from severe and chronic migraine, which is approximately 5% of the total migraine population in Europe. If we can help only 5% of this 5% with our Neuromodulation therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver. At the same time, we reduce patient suffering and help improve healthcare economics. As always market development will take time, but limited market release activities already are underway and are expected to benefit our organic sales growth rate in 2012.
Another major new growth driver we are implementing is renal denervation for treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. Our first in human series for our renal denervation system already is underway. We expect to receive CE Mark and begin launching our renal denervation technology in Europe before the end of 2012. To clarify the significance of this new technology for St. Jude Medical's growth program, we estimate that as many as 1 in every 3 adults in the developed world suffers from hypertension. Approximately 25% of patients treated for hypertension do not respond to medical therapy. We estimate that if we are able to treat only 1% of adult hypertensive patients who do not respond to medical therapy, we will have a new $1 billion growth driver. 
Keep in mind that today hypertension generates a direct annual cost of global medical budgets of approximately $500 billion. As with each of our other major investments, St. Jude Medical's goal is to create a new $1 billion growth franchise for the benefit of our investors. At the same time, we help make quality global healthcare more affordable.
These are the exact same goals that motivated our investments in fractional flow reserve or FFR technology for patients suffering from coronary artery disease, CardioMEMS technology for patients who suffer from heart failure, deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression and an entire portfolio of medical device technologies developed to help address the epidemic of atrial fibrillation. All of these technologies have been reviewed thoroughly in past communication, so I will not extend my prepared remarks by reiterating details of these technologies here.
St. Jude Medical places high priority on investing in properly designed comparative effectiveness trials to support robust reimbursement and healthy market growth long term for all of our emerging technologies. The gold standard for this initiative is our past sponsorship of the FAME trial, which established that the cost of stenting patients with multivessel coronary disease can be reduced by 14% through the use of our fractional flow reserve or FFR technology. 
The complete list of comparative effectiveness trials we are supporting includes the CABANA for atrial fibrillation, the EAST trial for atrial fibrillation, the FAME II trial for coronary artery disease, the SCD-HeFT 10-Year Follow-up Study for heart failure in ICD patients and the Brodmann trial for patients who suffer from treatment-resistant depression. Taken together, these investments give us confidence that after our new technologies enter the market in an environment of macroeconomic stress and healthcare reform, our technologies will be surrounded by adequate reimbursement and attractive market growth long term.
Next I would like to offer updates on the progress we are making with key initiatives in our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM franchise. I'm going to start with an update on our ST segment monitoring technology. We have not been talking about our ST segment monitoring technology recently because we have been working with FDA to define the regulatory pathway needed to bring this technology to the market in the United States. Now that the regulatory pathway is clear, we offer this update. 
First as a reminder, the ST segment is a section of an electrocardiogram that depicts electrical changes between heartbeats to indicate obstruction of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle. We are the first and only company who has been able to monitor these changes with our implantable defibrillator or ICDs, which means we can do so in a manner that is extremely cost-effective for patients who have ICD. This technology is especially important because it may provide an early warning signal that a patient is experiencing a heart attack. 
When a patient is experiencing a heart attack, every minute counts. For every 30 minutes that treatment is delayed, mortality increases by 7.5%. Because symptoms can be vague and approximately 1/3 of patients don't even have typical chest symptoms, the average time it takes for a patient to seek treatment has remained at almost 3 hours in the United States over the last decade.
This ST segment monitoring technology received CE Mark in December of 2008 and is now nearing the end of its third year on the market in Europe. This technology was approved by the MHLW in Japan in 2010 and is now widely available not only in Europe and Japan, but also in China, India and in all other major markets around the world. 
St. Jude Medical announced last quarter that we have now enrolled our first patient in the IDE clinical trial required by FDA to bring this technology to market in the United States. Our Analyze ST trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, pivotal IDE investigation of up to 5,228 patients who will be enrolled at approximately 200 medical centers. The Analyze ST trial is designed to study the safety and efficacy of the ST segment monitoring technology in the Fortify ST ICD. The sensitivity of the feature for detecting acute coronary syndrome events including myocardial infarctions will be the primary efficacy end point. The primary safety end point will be assessed by reporting the percentage of patients who experienced a false positive detection. 
The Analyze ST trial will be the largest IDE trial for an implantable device ever performed in the United States and will cost tens of millions of dollars. It is premature for us to predict when this technology will become available in the United States, but our rough estimate is that it will be between 7 to 8 years after the technology became available in Europe and approximately 4 to 5 years after the technology became available in Japan and virtually all other major markets. 
Our takeaway from this experience is that there is a compelling need for the FDA regulatory approval process to become more predictable, more transparent and more cost-effective. The regulatory pendulum at the FDA has swung too far in the wrong direction against innovation and needs to take a more practical approach to risk benefit analysis. The medical device industry is a major generator of jobs, exports and healthcare savings for the U.S. economy. St. Jude Medical is focused on technology innovation that is part of the solution to affordable healthcare and sustainable economic growth. We need a strong FDA that is fully funded and that has the culture and organizational confidence to strike the right balance between approving innovative medical device technology on the one hand and on the other hand, protecting the public health in a way that is not overly defensive.
Next is an update on FDA regulatory approval for our Unify quadripolar CRT-D system. As we indicated previously, our first-generation quadripolar CRT-D system received CE Mark and began limited launch in Europe exactly 2 years ago this month. Last month, we announced CE Mark and initial launch of our second-generation quadripolar CRT-D system in Europe. Although this technology is not yet available in Japan, it is available in India and in most other major medical device markets outside the United States. 
In markets where the product already is available, St. Jude Medical is gaining meaningful market share due to physician appreciation of the advantages a quadripolar CRT-D system can bring to help reduce the expense and duration of initial implants, to help reduce reoperations due to phrenic nerve stimulation, high pacing thresholds and lead dislodgment and to help improve the ability of a physician to electronically reposition the Left-Heart Lead without the need for an additional surgery. 
We cannot predict when we will receive FDA approval for our Unify quadripolar CRT-D system. We are waiting FDA response to our completed PMA supplement submission and are not aware of any outstanding issues. Our field organization has already been trained and inventory is in place to support a strong launch of our Unify Quadra product line in the United States within days of receiving FDA approval. Our experience in Europe and in other major markets with our quadripolar CRT-D system makes us optimistic that this product line will help us gain meaningful share in the United States once we have approval to bring this innovation to market.
Next, I'd like to touch on the success we are having with our Accent MRI Pacemaker in Europe. We announced last quarter that we received CE Mark approval and we're initiating launch in Europe of our Accent MRI Pacemaker. The advantage of this pacemaker system is that it offers uncompromised ticking of pacing technology in addition to full MRI compatible scanning capabilities with no anatomical zone or MRI power restrictions. This is a breakthrough innovation that offers significant benefits to patients and clinicians. Early customer response in Europe is encouraging. We look forward to fully deploying this technology in Europe over the next few quarters and then bringing this innovation to the United States when we are able to satisfy the FDA process for doing so.
Finally, in addition to implementing new growth drivers, St. Jude Medical continues to focus on improving the productivity of our global operations. The special charges we recognized this quarter in connection with restructuring our part of this initiative we will continue to restructure as appropriate, as well as expand our manufacturing volumes in Malaysia, in Costa Rica, in South Carolina and in other cost-advantaged locations as part of our comprehensive programs to optimize our cost structure long term. 
I would like to conclude my prepared remarks by summarizing that our program for implementing 18 new growth drivers is making good progress. We are supporting these new growth drivers with robust comparative effectiveness data. We simultaneously are reducing cost and increasing productivity. St. Jude Medical's program for delivering superior growth over the long term is on track. 
With that, I will stop and turn it over to Brooke to moderate the questions. Brooke, go ahead, please."

We would continue to guide to the same level of growth this quarter that we guided to last quarter, which was we wanted to be conservative. We wanted to really take this issue off the table for purposes of updating models for St. Jude Medical and for our growth rate. And we indicated that we expected for full year 2011 the global CRM market to shrink about 2%, and so that continues to be a good estimate here one quarter later. We really did not see significant changes in the CRM market over the last 90 days. We think the market didn't get better. The market didn't get worse. We saw ASP dynamics consistent during this last quarter as in the prior quarter. It's a tough market with a number of distressed conditions, but it seems to be reasonably steady state. With respect to the Department of Justice investigation, as everyone would appreciate, we have no special insights. The DOJ doesn't talk to us about it. So we -- we're really monitoring events as they become publicly visible in the same way that everybody else is. And so we cannot predict what comes next or exactly what's the time line is for the DOJ investigation. And I don't think anybody outside the DOJ can actually do that. With respect to the kind of longer-term outlook for the CRM market, the -- we've directed people's attention to the American Heart Journal study that came out earlier this year. It was a study that was conducted by a number of luminaries from UCLA, from Northwestern University, from Duke. It indicated the number of patients who are dying every year who are not receiving optimal therapy for heart failure conditions, including optimal ICD therapy. And that is -- so there were a number of wide range estimates for what the impact is on the public health from the failure of available technology to get to all of the patients who need it. But at the midpoint, as I recall, there is an estimate that about 20,000 people a year in the United states were needlessly dying of their heart failure condition due to their -- the fact that they didn't have in ICD and they should've had one. So there's just one data point. We've referred people a number of times to other kind of highly visible data points, the miniscule number of implants per population in emerging markets. We particularly cite China and India and -- but also a number of other emerging markets, all of which give us the optimism that over the long term there's still plenty of growth left in the global CRM market and St. Jude Medical will be well positioned to take advantage of that growth as it emerges. So those are -- Rick, those are my main comments on kind of the dynamics surrounding the CRM market. Did I answer your question or was there another part of it?"

Approval could be -- so we -- that tells you our state of knowledge. We're ready to go. The technology has been established to be safe. It's been established to be effective. It's been on the market in Europe for 2 years. It's helping patients elsewhere all around the world. We look forward to the opportunity to have this technology begin to help patients in the United States as well and we just wait day by day, but have no special insight into when we'll receive our approval. On the former question about the -- our ICD leads. First -- so there's a lot I'd like to say, and it'll go beyond the scope of what I could really appropriately address in this call. But starting point is we have the most robust post-market surveillance of lead reliability of anybody in the industry. A lot of times, people talk about the limitations of passive reporting and we always point out that we have the most robust active reporting, active follow-up of our device reliability, including our ICD lead reliability. We have a robust score registry. We have a robust optimum registry, both of which are active registries. We conduct additional studies as needed on an active basis. So we -- if you look at all the fine print in the product performance reports that come out in the CRM space, you'll see that we break out more data and that the inputs into our data are far more comprehensive and robust than is the case from other organizations. So we have a lot of confidence that we have a good handle on St. Jude Medical device reliability. And as everyone can see from just looking at reliability records here over the last, pick any period of time, I'll just say over the last 5 years, our device reliability performance has been -- has set the standard for device reliability bar none. So that would be just kind of an opening comment. But then what's going on here with the topic of 7 French leads is really something that's going to play to our advantage. And what I think the headline issues that a person might see and some of the ways that commentators really get drawn into competitive marketing efforts I think is something that I'd like to address. And let me start with the context. So the first thing is people ought to -- just keep in mind that our ICD lead line are in -- is a -- represents a very significant competitive advantage to us today, and it has now for a number of years. So we have the only 7 French ICD line on the market. Boston Scientific works with a 9 French lead line the way that we calculate the measurements. Medtronic works with an 8 French lead line the way that we calculate the measurement. And so -- and the fact that we have the only 7 French lead line is meaningful from a clinical perspective. So keep in mind that ICD patients include a large percent -- a large percent of ICD patients are heart failure patients and so by definition, that means that their hemodynamics already compromised. And so the heart failure patients who receive ICD therapy are typically going to receive a CRT-D device. And so that's 3 leads. That's 3 leads in a single vessel. And so clearly, it makes a difference if those leads can perform effectively and take up less space in the vascular system of a patient who's hemodynamics already are compromised and clearly, a smaller lead is better. Medtronic saw that when they had a 7 French lead line. We saw that as we put our 7 French lead line in the market. It draws a strong customer preference because of the advantages to the patients that I've just summarized. When Medtronic pulled their 7 French ICD lead line off the market, that created a major advantage for us. And you would recall, Rick, and others who've been in the field here long enough would recall that when Medtronic pulled its Fidelis lead line off the market due to the catastrophic fractures and failures that forced them to take the entire line off the market and never return it to market, that created a big advantage for us. And the question was how long was that advantage going to last, how long would it take for Medtronic to get back on the market with a 7 French lead line. People may forget that, that was October 2007. At the time, the speculation was it might take Medtronic as long as 2 years to get a 7 French ICD line -- lead line back on the market. Four years later, they don't have one and I would encourage everyone to go to Medtronic after this call and ask for an update on when will Medtronic got a 7 French lead line back out on the market. And our understanding, which would be, of course, limited by the fact that Medtronic doesn't really talk to us about this, but our market intelligence is that Medtronic has been unable to be successful in developing their 7 French lead line and that they're still years away. I don't know if they're going to give you a date or not, our intelligence is they're still years away. So that's the context for what's stirred up here in the last 30 days or so. So Medtronic has recently started a campaign in the United States where they're going to customers and they're telling them 7 French leads are too small and not safe, and they point to a study by one center in Northern Ireland that documented partial failures of ICD lead insulation. There are several problems with Medtronic's campaign. The first is that the center in Northern Ireland used mostly 8 French leads. And then second thing is that lead insulation failures are not due to French size. The thickness of silicone insulation on a 7 French lead is exactly the same as the thickness of silicon insulation on an 8 French lead. So right away you see where the Medtronic field organization gets itself off track thinking, ""Oh, if it's a 7 French, they must just thin down the insulation."" And that may be what Medtronic tried to do in their lead development efforts. That may be why they've been unsuccessful in getting a 7 French lead line back on the market. That's not what we did to provide a 7 French ICD lead. Our technology innovation was far more elegant inside the lead. We did not in any way compromise the insulation thickness or the lead insulation to give physicians and patients the benefit of a -- of 7 French ICD line. And then third -- and there be again, in an expanded conversation, a person would like to bring out a lot of engineering data and really educate the market and this is exactly what we're doing with our physician customers. But third, although failure rates are low overall due to insulation failure caused by abrasion, although the failure rates are low overall, 8 F leads -- the 8 French leads have a statistically significant higher rate of insulation failure. And -- now remember my earlier remarks, Medtronic is the only company with an 8 French ICD lead on the market. So this is a peculiar situation where you've got a company where the data shows a statistically significant higher insulation failure rate on an 8 French lead, and you got that company running around talking about insulation failures. So it's the kind of situation that really plays to our strength. It's a great marketing opportunity for us. This is going to backfire on anyone who is working with either incorrect or incomplete data to work to mislead customers and deprive patients of the benefit of state-of-the-art technology. And this -- well, all of this -- what this does is this sets the table for us to come in, point out all of the things and far more than I've just outlined to customers to talk about and remind customers of the advantages of the St. Jude Medical ICD lead line. So in the interim here, a key theme for us is that although the overall failure rates are low, we have long focused on insulation failure due to abrasion as a problem to solve in our efforts of continuous improvement in our lead technology. And so I'm not sure of the exact time line, it's been 10 years or so that we've been invested and we've been developing a proprietary material that we call Optim, which we began to put into our lead line in 2006. Optim is 50x more resistant to abrasion than silicon. You can no longer buy an ICD lead from St. Jude Medical unless it is protected from abrasion by Optim. That's why at the end of last year, we completely discontinued offering to customers any ICD leads that were unprotected by Optim. Customers can only get the benefit of Optim protection against insulation failures and Optim protection against lead abrasion from St. Jude Medical. So all of this is -- it's a little bit -- I'm reminded of Brer Rabbit, talking about don't throw me into the briar patch. We're a little bit like Brer Rabbit saying, ""Oh my goodness, let's not talk leads."" The -- I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek, with the point being that we like talking about leads. We like talking about the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical's ICD leads and pacing leads. We like talking about the advantages of the reliability data. We like talking about the advantages of our lead-handling performance. We like talking about the advantages of our smaller leads without any compromise in the insulation and in fact with a superior technology in our insulation material. And so that's what -- what's teed up here. So that's a -- I've offered you a couple of my comments. And again, the engineering data is really very robust, very favorable to St. Jude Medical, very favorable to patient safety. And our entire lead line has been a strong basis for our gaining market share over the last 4 years, and it'll continue to be a basis for our gain of share in the de novo market here in years to come. And that's without having the benefit of quadripolar. So having attention be to leads plays to our strengths. And if the competitors help focus their attention to leads, that's fine with us. We actually have quite a bit of our own marketing initiative designed to help get physicians to give us time to walk them through all of the reasons that the St. Jude Medical ICD system is a superior system, and particularly on the strengths of our superiority of leads."
