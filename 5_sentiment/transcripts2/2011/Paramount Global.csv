Now I'm given to all, but CBS this year was nothing less than sensational, what an extraordinary finish to an extraordinary year. Every single division improved on its performance and resonates too. As usual, they did everything right. I always say, we like our extraordinary content and CBS' content is in every single area where CBS competes on the network, which is yet again and on the global markets where people watch hit programming on our major market TV and Radio. Nationwide and on our top global websites, CBS has the content that by far leaves its competitors, the content that audience want most, and that content and our performance get better and better and better. We saw it in the 2010 results. We're seeing it continue in 2011 today, and I am certain we'll keep seeing it for years to come and it will be never, never-ending. The way CBS is bound to continue and has a great management team and it is a great management team.

Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter results with you today, results that capped a tremendous 2010 and speak to the momentum we saw throughout the year and are",2402,"Thank you very much, Sumner, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter results with you today, results that capped a tremendous 2010 and speak to the momentum we saw throughout the year and are now seeing this year as well. Every one of our businesses grew during the quarter, with solid revenue increases and double-digit OIBDA growth across all of the company's operating segments. Our success continues to come primarily from the performance of our content and the increasing demand we're seeing for that content in an improving economic marketplace, locally, nationally and internationally. 
Today's very strong fourth quarter results closed out a terrific year in which we have consistently delivered on our promises. We've capitalized on the sharp increase in advertising while at the same time continuing to diversify and de-risk our business model by building profitable secondary revenue streams that don't depend on advertising. We've prudently managed both our cost structure and our balance sheet and at the same time, delivered more value to our shareholders. And through a number of long-term strategic deals throughout the company, we've set up CBS for a very bright future, one in which we are ideally positioned for continued growth this year and beyond.
Not only we did a very good quarter and year, but given the growing value of our content, the trends we see in our businesses and the media landscape as a whole, we expect these results to continue for a long, long time.
Before I turn it over to Joe and we take your questions, I'm going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights beginning with our full year and fourth quarter results. Revenue for 2010 of $14.1 billion was up 8%, and quarterly revenues up $3.9 billion was up 11%, once again speaking to our building momentum throughout the year. 2010 OIBDA of $2.4 billion was up 32% and fourth quarter OIBDA of $770 million was up 32% as well, illustrating our ability to turn increasing revenue into even better profits. And most importantly, EPS for the year was $1.11, up 102% from 2009, and fourth quarter EPS of $0.46 was up 77% from last year's fourth quarter. CBS also true up $1.45 billion in free cash flow in 2010, up 75% from our total in 2009. 
So as you can see, in every single key measure, we had a remarkable quarter and a remarkable year. Plus we had an OIBDA margin of 20% in the fourth quarter, three percentage points higher than last year's quarter, and we are confident we will deliver even better margins in 2011 by continuing to manage our expenses, growing our secondary revenue streams and realizing better economics from our recent Comcast and NCAA deal. And going forward, we are positioned to exceed peak margin levels within the next couple of years. Finally, last month, we began executing on our $1.5 billion share buyback program. It is going very well, an we are pleased to be continuing our commitment of returning value to our shareholders. So clearly, we are in great financial shape across-the-board. 
Now let's take a quick look at some fourth quarter outlets throughout our businesses. Beginning with our Entertainment segment where fourth quarter revenue was up 11% and OIBDA was up 31%. At the CBS Television Network, ad revenue was up more than 8% with Primetime and Sports performing particularly well. We're having a terrific 2010, 2011 season. We are the leading network by a lot once again, and the margin continues to grow. CBS was the only network to successfully launch its entire new fall lineup, and three of our new series, Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0 and Mike and Molly are the top three new shows of the season. At the same time, our returning shows continued to dominate. For example, number one ranked drama, NCIS, just broken on the series record, attracting nearly 23 million viewers to a show that's now on its eighth season. 
Looking ahead to next season, we could almost play a pass hand. There could be very little change necessary in our schedule because we have so many successful programs. One thing is for sure, any new show that does make it onto our schedule is going to have to be pretty extraordinary. This means reduced cost for development, reduced cost for promotion, et cetera, et cetera. Having the number one schedule also is helping us lead the way in the scatter market, which was extremely hot in the fourth quarter and continues to be even hotter through the first with prices 40% over upfront. So looking ahead to May and June, you've got a pretty good idea where pricing is heading in this year's upfront.
In Sports, our programming is also being sold into a very strong marketplace with pricing significantly higher than a year ago and our ratings growth is a terrific story too. The NFL on CBS was up 10% this year, the highest viewer average in 23 years. And the AFC Championship game between the Jetsons and Stealers [ph] delivered nearly 55 million viewers, the highest total in the game's history. And we assume gearing up for the NCAA Menâ€™s Basketball tournament where we and our new partners at Turner have virtually sold out inventory already at very favorable pricing. Our deal with Turner de-risked our exposure in this terrific property without taking away our offsite. As a result, we have a very profitable deal over the next 14 years. 
Last week, we also made some management moves that will have a positive effect on our Sports and News division. CBS Sports programming obviously means more and more of our corporation all the time, so we took Sean McManus' real passion has always been sports and allowed him to focus all of his time growing that division. At the same time, we took Jeff Fager, a universally admired journalist who has been running the critically and ratings-acclaimed 60 minutes, the most successful news program in history and put him in charge of CBS News. In doing these moves, we have significantly strengthened both organizations. 
Finally, at the network, the Grammy Awards on Sunday delivered its highest audience in 10 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. Just like in sports, big-ticket events continue to show ratings growth, proving once again that broadcast television is the best game in town.
Meanwhile, throughout the rest of our Entertainment segment, we continue to grow our non-advertising revenues well, content licensing, global syndication and retransmission consent of becoming increasingly important as the broadcast model evolves in CBS's favor. Let me address a few of our accomplishments in these areas during the quarter now. Starting with syndication, which continues to be strong for us. During the quarter, we sold the second cycle of CSI, which was a key driver in the company's content licensing and distribution fees, which grew by 21%. In addition, we continue to benefit from selling new shows overseas. Thanks to an exploding international marketplace. All three of our new dramas this year, Hawaii Five-0, Blue Bloods and The Defenders were profitable before we aired a single episode in the United States. The current seasons of all three of these shows are now being monetized in more than 200 markets. Our three CSIs in addition to our two NCISs, all CBS own shows consistently ranked as top programs in markets around the world. And thanks to more channels being offered by international distributors, our presence on top 10 lists in emerging markets is growing all the time.
At the same time, our new international channel in the U.K., India and Australia are already steadily increasing their audiences. These channels are allowing us to build our brand internationally and establish demand for our content in new growing markets. And of course, the rapid growth of retrans also continues to diversify our revenue base. We beat our full year target of $100 million by a nice margin and we're working on new deals all the time. 
And finally, in the world of new media, we continued to be well positioned to capitalize on the competition for our premium content. There is clearly tremendous demand for network programming from all of the online video distributors coming to market. As you know, we've been very judicious about the ways in which we grow this new revenue stream. We will continue to look to do non-exclusive deals that provide recurring revenue and are incremental to the big picture.
Speaking of new media, CBS Interactive turned in a very strong fourth quarter as well, with display advertising revenues up 18% year-over-year. CBS.com has now been the number one TV network website for 25 straight months in terms of unique viewers. At the same time, more and more advertisers are buying across both TV and the web, and we're seeing this virtual circle reflected in our results. CBS Interactive continues to grow our presence across mobile platforms as well. We produced more than 40 apps for iPads and other tablets during the year, each of which generate revenue for us, and we've doubled the paid views across our mobile site and apps versus 2009.
Our Entertainment segment also includes CBS Films, which had a good showing these last few weeks with the release of The Mechanic. The film opened well, and, most importantly, will be profitable for us. Once again, we are slowly going into this business. We've done four small films so far. We've got our toe in the water, and we like where we stand right now.
Moving to our Cable Network segment, we had a solid finish to 2010. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6%. OIBDA was up 10% with a margin up 46%. Showtime subs continue to grow, and we ended the year at just under 20 million subscribers, so we've closed the gap considerably with our top competitor, and we have plenty of growth left ahead of us. In fact, 2010 marked the seventh straight year of annual growth in subscribers for Showtime. Showtime's original programming continues to be the catalyst for our growth. The most recent seasons of Dexter, Weeds with their highest jet and newer shows like Nurse Jackie and The Big C have become new hits for us as well. This quarter, we gave you Shameless starring William H. Macy. Shameless's launch to Showtime's the best number ever for a freshman drama in six weeks and continues to outperform every new show we've ever premiered with the viewership rising every single week. 
In Publishing, revenues for the fourth quarter were up 5% year-over-year and OIBDA was up 32%. Like our other businesses, its leading content that's driving our growth. And also like other businesses, Digital is an increasingly important part of our results. Sales of Simon & Schuster e-books were up 160% for the year in 2010, and we had a terrific holiday season. All the people who got e-readers for Christmas needed to buy books to load them. The week after Christmas, we sold electronic versions of 78% of the books in our entire digital catalog, showing the breadth of titles that are now being bought in this new format. We continue to digitize our library. We're now approaching 10,000 titles, demonstrating once again that great content indoors and we can monetize it forever. 
Turning to Local Broadcasting. This business built on its momentum throughout 2010, producing its best results of the year in the fourth quarter and the best segment performance in the entire company. Revenue was up 21% with Television Stations. Advertising revenue up 20% in Television Stations; and Radio ad revenue up 14%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 43% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 39%, up six percentage points from last year's quarter. Political advertising certainly contributed to our results, but the resurgence in local advertising was the story here. In fact, given the intense demand we're seeing from local advertisers before the election, we could've taken the inventory results of the candidates and sold them in open market at very attractive pricing. 
Momentum continues in Outdoor, as well. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6% as the advertising market there continued to improve as well. OIBDA increased 22% year-over-year on higher revenues and a lower cost structure. We see ongoing improvement in this business, and as the market has recovered, we have strategically resumed our digital buildup pursuing some high profile installations in major cities like New York and Washington, D.C., while we still stay well within our CapEx guidance. 
So as you can see, every one of our businesses contributed to our best results of the year in the fourth quarter. We're confident it will drive our success going forward as well. We finished 2010 on a high, and we've been busy laying the groundwork for an even better 2011 and 2012. We have every reason to believe we will build in our success, and here is why. The CBS Television Network continues to build hits and provide an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. Advertisers are recognizing this with extraordinary pricing in the scatter market and it will pay off in this year's upfront as well. The success of our own shows continues to grow. That means we can keep getting paid for today's hits for many, many years to come.
At the same time, we're growing retrans and affiliate compensation at a very healthy rate, and the CBS Television Network has become a true dual revenue stream business. The local ad marketplace continues its broad-based recovery. Our 2011 outlook for local business is very optimistic even without the Super Bowl or political. On the cost side, we continue to watch our operations closely and improve contracts of more revenues now fall from the bottom line. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we'll save about $90 million in interest cost annually following all of our debt actions last year. And finally, we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders. 
I mentioned earlier that we started our share buyback in January on schedule as the economic recovery continues, and as our businesses keep generating healthy free cash flow, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders going forward.
Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I'll provide some more detail on the results for the quarter and full year and update you on what we're seeing in 2011. I'll start with our total company results for the quarter. Our 11% revenue growth for",1411,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on the results for the quarter and full year and update you on what we're seeing in 2011. I'll start with our total company results for the quarter. Our 11% revenue growth for the quarter can be broken down as follows: Advertising revenue was up 12%, reflecting the continued strong ad market both locally and nationally. Content licensing and distribution was up 21%, driven by strong domestic and international syndication sales. Fourth quarter affiliate and subscription fees were up 1% due to the impact of a one-time reclassification in the prior year. To give you some color on the underlying growth within this category, Cable affiliate revenue was up 7%, and retrans revenue up nearly 50%. So for the full year 2010, affiliate and subscription fees were up 9%, which is much more indicative of the performance going into 2011.
As Les said, OIBDA of $770 million was up 32% from the prior year. This quarter, we are adjusting for $15 million of restructuring activities, as well as a $44 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt that we discussed on our last call. You will see the benefits of these actions in 2011. During Q4 of 2009, we also had restructuring charges of $13 million and impairment charges of $186 million. So clearly, our reported results were up significantly more than our adjusted results we're discussing here. We expanded our OIBDA margin for the fifth consecutive quarter to 20%. Meanwhile, operating income was up 45% for the quarter, and diluted EPS came in at $0.46, up 77% from the prior year. 
Let's quickly recap our full year results, which speak to the continued strength of our businesses. Total company revenue was up 8%. OIBDA was up 32%. Operating income up 49%, and diluted EPS of $1.11, up 102%. This operating leverage demonstrates the strong flow-through of high-margin advertising and affiliate revenues, and our continued cost efforts remain.
Turning to our five segments. Entertainment revenue of $2 billion was up 11% for the quarter, driven by content license fees from both domestic and international syndication. Advertising revenue also grew sharply with network advertising up 8% due to solid pricing gains in Primetime in Sports. Top categories included Automotive and Financial Services. Fourth quarter scatter pricing was upwards of 35% above upfront pricing. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $249 million, up 31%, driven by the strong revenue performance. At Cable Networks, revenues of $368 million for the quarter was up 6%, primarily as a result of increases in both subs and rates. 
Cable OIBDA of $169 million was up 10%, which is at a 46% for the quarter. Due to the timing of expenses, we always look at the margin on a full year basis, which came in at 39%, up from 34% in 2009. We expect to continue to expand our margin in 2011 while investing more in original content where we retain more rights and, thus, more profits.
Publishing revenue of $232 million was up 5%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong title sales in the quarter. Digital content represented 10% of total Publishing revenue in Q4 of this year versus 5% in the prior year, and we expect this will continue to grow in 2011. Publishing OIBDA of $20 million for the quarter was up 32%, driven by the change in the revenue mix and our continued aggressive cost containment measures, partially offset by a higher provision for doubtful accounts relating to the border situation. We have been monitoring this closely for sometime and have reduced our receivable exposure to a minimal amount as of December 31.
Local Broadcasting revenue of $822 million was up 21% for the quarter. TV Station advertising was up 28%, and Radio ad revenue was up 14%. Political advertising contributed to the growth. However, the increased local demand was impressive. For example, oil, retail and financial services were all up in the teens for the quarter. Even with this growth, the overall spend of major categories is still off by more than 20% from 2007 spend levels, leaving us plenty of room to grow. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $322 million, up 43% for the quarter. As Les mentioned, the margin at this segment hit 39% this quarter, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2006. As you can see, our disciplined cost containment, we can achieve historical margins. 
Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 6% to $511 million. In constant dollars, the Americas and Europe combined grew 9% with the Americas leading the way with revenue growth of 13%, driven by higher occupancy rates and the onset of better pricing. As expected, we are now seeing more dollars float to this business as the recovery continues. OIBDA for Outdoor of $101 million increased 22% from prior year's fourth quarter as we continue to focus on restructuring our business model. We expect healthy margin expansion at this segment in 2011 as well.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $40 million for the quarter, which included a discretionary pre-funding of our pension plans of $167 million. For 2010, free cash flow was $1.45 billion, up 75% from prior year. CapEx for the full year came in at $284 million, right within our guidance range of $250 million to $300 million. We've used this year is cash flow primarily to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing debt by $1.4 billion and pre-funding our pension plans. Our cash on hand at the end of the year was $480 million. As you know, in January, we initiated our $1.5 billion share buyback program, and it is well underway. We will update you on the activity for Q1 with our first quarter results. But as we have said previously, we expect to complete this program in about 18 months.
Looking into 2011, here's what we're seeing. Starting with our advertising trends for Q1. As Les mentioned, the scatter market pricing as a network is robust, up 40% above last year's upfront, which is a very positive sign for this year's upfront. Online display advertising is expected to be up in the teens. TV Stations' advertising revenues are pacing to be flat, even with the difficult comp of no Super Bowl or political advertising, meaning our base business strength is offsetting both these prior year events. Radio stations are pacing to be up low to mid-single digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid to high single digits on a constant-dollar basis, again led by Americas pacing up double digits.
For the first quarter, there are two specific items to be aware of for comparison purposes: first is Super Bowl; and second, our new NCAA contract. Obviously, we didn't have the Super Bowl in Q1 2011, which will impact our year-over-year growth rates at both the Entertainment and Local Broadcasting segments. With respect to the new NCAA agreement, we will only recognize revenue associated with the games that air on CBS and not the games that air on internal networks. As a result, we expect a reduction in revenue in Q1 versus the prior year, but you'll also see a greater reduction in expenses, which will drive higher profits and a significant margin expansion for both the Entertainment segment as well as the company.
Looking at the full year 2011. As we said on our last call, we expect to improve our profits and continue our margin expansion trend. We're estimating CapEx for 2011 to continue to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million for the third consecutive year. With this lowered CapEx, depreciation will continue to trend down slightly but the bigger benefit will be realized in a few years from now. Interest expense and cash payments for interest will be down considerably year-over-year because of lower debt levels. Our effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be approximately 39%, which is comparable to 2010.
So in conclusion, we are more excited about the future growth prospects of CBS than ever before. We've made long-term changes to our operating cost model, and the structural changes to our revenue mix are real and meaningful. With lower polls on cash from our debt obligations, we are focused on returning value to our shareholders now and in the future. 
With that, Lisa, we could open up the lines."

We are looking at some of these platforms, and we're determining what will augment those two forms of revenue, first and foremost, without in any way hurting what we're doing. Our syndication operation is at full tilt, and obviously, with these kind of upfront, as well as scatter marketplace, the numbers that are coming in for the network are truly remarkable. So we're not going to do anything to damage that. At the same token, we have the largest television library in the world.

When there are four games on simultaneously, they will be on four different channels. We generally look at the game that we want in the first rounds, and for those people in local marketplaces, they will get the game that they want. At the same time, there will be highlights shown on our network of the other three games and vice versa. As you get down to the final rounds, we have the final fore for the first four years of the deal, so that will be significant. Those are significant games. And in the regional games, there's sort of all alternating games. Obviously, occasionally, there'll be two games going on simultaneously, so you'll be able to watch the one that you want. So Joe said revenue goes down, but cost goes down a lot, and probably for our viewer, they will be very happy because they will get whatever game they want to see. So for us, it's a major win in terms of economic things, and by and large, we're getting games that we want, and the relationship with Turner is terrific. Both teams are selling. And as we said earlier, the sales are going extremely well. They're selling into a very strong sports marketplace, so I think everybody comes out a winner of it. The fans, CBS, Turner and the NCAA."

It's also good show, but it's helped by following the number one rated comedy on the air. What happens is yes, it's a tough problem here at CBS. We tell the people that are out there, look you've got to be really good to make it on our schedule. But if you do make it on our schedule, the chances of succeeding are higher because you will generally put in a position where you're launched by a successful television show. We also have the advantage of removing shows a year early rather than a year late, and I give you what we did with Without a Trace a year ago where it was a successful show. It did run through its eighth year. We've pulled off the show. Their license fee was, at that point, since it was in its eighth year, almost $4 million an episode, replaced with a show called The Good Wife, which cost about less than half that amount. We also owned 100% of The Good Wife. The ratings were just as good. As a matter of fact, it won some Emmy Awards, and we took it off early and helped our schedule. A similar thing, if you look throughout our schedule, we don't let shows age and just hang around because that's all we got. We don't have to do that, and I think success propels further success, and I think we'll continue to do that."

I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter results with you today, results that capped a tremendous 2010 and speak to the momentum we saw throughout the year and are",2404,"Thank you very much, Sumner, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter results with you today, results that capped a tremendous 2010 and speak to the momentum we saw throughout the year and are now seeing this year as well. Every one of our businesses grew during the quarter, with solid revenue increases and double-digit OIBDA growth across all of the company's operating segments. Our success continues to come primarily from the performance of our content and the increasing demand we're seeing for that content in an improving economic marketplace, locally, nationally and internationally. 
Today's very strong fourth quarter results closed out a terrific year in which we have consistently delivered on our promises. We've capitalized on the sharp increase in advertising while at the same time continuing to diversify and de-risk our business model by building profitable secondary revenue streams that don't depend on advertising. We've prudently managed both our cost structure and our balance sheet and at the same time, delivered more value to our shareholders. And through a number of long-term strategic deals throughout the company, we've set up CBS for a very bright future, one in which we are ideally positioned for continued growth this year and beyond.
Not only was it a very good quarter and year, but given the growing value of our content, the trends we see in our businesses and the media landscape as a whole, we expect these results to continue for a long, long time.
Before I turn it over to Joe and we take your questions, I'm going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights beginning with our full year and fourth quarter results. Revenue for 2010 of $14.1 billion was up 8%, and quarterly revenues of $3.9 billion was up 11%, once again speaking to our building momentum throughout the year. 2010 OIBDA of $2.4 billion was up 32% and fourth quarter OIBDA of $770 million was up 32% as well, illustrating our ability to turn increasing revenue into even better profits. And most importantly, EPS for the year was $1.11, up 102% from 2009, and fourth quarter EPS of $0.46 was up 77% from last year's fourth quarter. CBS also drew up $1.45 billion in free cash flow in 2010, up 75% from our total in 2009. 
So as you can see, in every single key measure, we had a remarkable quarter and a remarkable year. Plus we had an OIBDA margin of 20% in the fourth quarter, three percentage points higher than last year's quarter, and we are confident we will deliver even better margins in 2011 by continuing to manage our expenses, growing our secondary revenue streams and realizing better economics from our recent Comcast and NCAA deals. And going forward, we are positioned to exceed peak margin levels within the next couple of years. Finally, last month, we began executing on our $1.5 billion share buyback program. It is going very well, and we are pleased to be continuing our commitment of returning value to our shareholders. So clearly, we are in great financial shape across-the-board. 
Now let's take a quick look at some fourth quarter highlights throughout our businesses. Beginning with our Entertainment segment where fourth quarter revenue was up 11% and OIBDA was up 31%. At the CBS Television Network, ad revenue was up more than 8% with Primetime and Sports performing particularly well. We're having a terrific 2010, 2011 season. We are the leading network by a lot once again, and the margin continues to grow. CBS was the only network to successfully launch its entire new fall lineup, and three of our new series, Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0 and Mike & Molly are the top three new shows of the season. At the same time, our returning shows continued to dominate. For example, number one ranked drama, NCIS, just broken of a [ph] series record, attracting nearly 23 million viewers to a show that's now in its eighth season. 
Looking ahead to next season, we could almost play a pass hand. There could be very little change necessary in our schedule because we have so many successful programs. One thing is for sure, any new show that does make it onto our schedule is going to have to be pretty extraordinary. This means reduced cost for development, reduced cost for promotion, et cetera, et cetera. Having the number one schedule also is helping us lead the way in the scatter market, which was extremely hot in the fourth quarter and continues to be even hotter through the first with prices 40% over upfront. So looking ahead to May and June, you've got a pretty good idea where pricing is heading in this year's upfront.
In Sports, our programming is also being sold into a very strong marketplace with pricing significantly higher than a year ago and our ratings growth is a terrific story too. The NFL on CBS was up 10% this year, the highest viewer average in 23 years. And the AFC Championship game between the Jets and the Steelers delivered nearly 55 million viewers, the highest total in the game's history. And we assume gearing up for the NCAA Menâ€™s Basketball tournament where we and our new partners at Turner have virtually sold out inventory already at very favorable pricing. Our deal with Turner de-risked our exposure in this terrific property without taking away our offsite. As a result, we have a very profitable deal over the next 14 years. 
Last week, we also made some management moves that will have a positive effect on our Sports and News division. CBS Sports programming obviously means more and more [ph] of our corporation all the time, so we took Sean McManus' real passion has always been sports and allowed him to focus all of his time growing that division. At the same time, we took Jeff Fager, a universally admired journalist who has been running the critically and ratings-acclaimed 60 Minutes, the most successful news program in history and put him in charge of CBS News. In doing these moves, we have significantly strengthened both organizations. 
Finally, at the network, the Grammy Awards on Sunday delivered its highest audience in 10 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. Just like in sports, big-ticket events continue to show ratings growth, proving once again that broadcast television is the best game in town.
Meanwhile, throughout the rest of our Entertainment segment, we continue to grow our non-advertising revenues well. Content licensing, global syndication and retransmission consent of becoming increasingly important as the broadcast model evolves in CBS's favor. Let me address a few of our accomplishments in these areas during the quarter now. Starting with syndication, which continues to be strong for us. During the quarter, we sold the second cycle of CSI, which was a key driver in the company's content licensing and distribution fees, which grew by 21%. In addition, we continue to benefit from selling new shows overseas thanks to an exploding international marketplace. All three of our new dramas this year, Hawaii Five-0, Blue Bloods and The Defenders were profitable before we aired a single episode in the United States. The current seasons of all three of these shows are now being monetized in more than 200 markets. Our three CSIs in addition to our two NCIS's, all CBS-owned shows consistently ranked as top programs in markets around the world. And thanks to more channels being offered by international distributors, our presence on top 10 lists in emerging markets is growing all the time.
At the same time, our new international channel in the U.K., India and Australia are already steadily increasing their audiences. These channels are allowing us to build our brand internationally and establish demand for our content in new growing markets. And of course, the rapid growth of retrans also continues to diversify our revenue base. We beat our full year target of $100 million by a nice margin and we're working on new deals all the time. 
And finally, in the world of new media, we continued to be well positioned to capitalize on the competition for our premium content. There is clearly tremendous demand for network programming from all of the online video distributors coming to market. As you know, we've been very judicious about the ways in which we grow this new revenue stream. We will continue to look to do non-exclusive deals that provide recurring revenue and are incremental to the big picture.
Speaking of new media, CBS Interactive turned in a very strong fourth quarter as well, with display advertising revenues up 18% year-over-year. CBS.com has now been the number one TV network website for 25 straight months in terms of unique viewers. At the same time, more and more advertisers are buying across both TV and the web, and we're seeing this virtual circle reflected in our results. CBS Interactive continues to grow our presence across mobile platforms as well. We produced more than 40 apps for iPads and other tablets during the year, each of which generate revenue for us, and we've doubled the page views across our mobile sites and apps versus 2009.
Our Entertainment segment also includes CBS Films, which had a good showing these last few weeks with the release of The Mechanic. The film opened well, and, most importantly, will be profitable for us. Once again, we are slowly going into this business. We've done four small films so far. We've got our toe in the water, and we like where we stand right now.
Moving to our Cable Network segment, we had a solid finish to 2010. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6%. OIBDA was up 10% with the margin up 46%. Showtime subs continue to grow, and we ended the year at just under 20 million subscribers, so we've closed the gap considerably with our top competitor, and we have plenty of growth left ahead of us. In fact, 2010 marked the seventh straight year of annual growth in subscribers for Showtime. Showtime's original programming continues to be the catalyst for our growth. The most recent seasons of Dexter, Weeds with their highest yet [ph], and newer shows like Nurse Jackie and The Big C have become new hits for us as well. This quarter, we gave you Shameless starring William H. Macy. Shameless's launch to Showtime's the best numbers ever for a freshman drama in six weeks and continues to outperform every new show we've ever premiered with viewership rising every single week. 
In Publishing, revenues for the fourth quarter were up 5% year-over-year and OIBDA was up 32%. Like our other businesses, it's leading content that's driving our growth. And also like our other businesses, Digital is an increasingly important part of our results. Sales of Simon & Schuster e-books were up 160% for the year in 2010, and we had a terrific holiday season. All the people who got e-readers for Christmas needed to buy books to load them. The week after Christmas, we sold electronic versions of 78% of the books in our entire digital catalog, showing the breadth of titles that are now being bought in this new format. We continue to digitize our library. We're now approaching 10,000 titles, demonstrating once again that great content indoors and we can monetize it forever. 
Turning to Local Broadcasting. This business built on its momentum throughout 2010, producing its best results of the year in the fourth quarter and the best segment performance in the entire company. Revenue was up 21% with Television Stations, advertising revenue up 20% in Television Stations, and Radio ad revenue up 14%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 43% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 39%, up six percentage points from last year's quarter. Political advertising certainly contributed to our results, but the resurgence in local advertising was the story here. In fact, given the intense demand we're seeing from local advertisers before the election, we could've taken the inventory results of the candidates and sold them in the open market at very attractive pricing. 
Momentum continues in Outdoor as well. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6% as the advertising market there continued to improve as well. OIBDA increased 22% year-over-year on higher revenues and a lower cost structure. We see ongoing improvement in this business, and as the market has recovered, we have strategically resumed our digital build-out pursuing some high-profile installations in major cities like New York and Washington, D.C., while we still stay well within our CapEx guidance. 
So as you can see, every one of our businesses contributed to our best results of the year in the fourth quarter. We're confident it will drive our success going forward as well. We finished 2010 on a high, and we've been busy laying the groundwork for an even better 2011 and 2012. We have every reason to believe we will build on our success, and here is why. The CBS Television Network continues to build hits and provide an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. Advertisers are recognizing this with extraordinary pricing in the scatter market and it will pay off in this year's upfront as well. The success of our own shows continues to grow. That means we can keep getting paid for today's hits for many, many years to come.
At the same time, we're growing retrans and affiliate compensation at a very healthy rate, and the CBS Television Network has become a true dual revenue stream business. The local ad marketplace continues its broad-based recovery. Our 2011 outlook for local business is very optimistic even without the Super Bowl or political. On the cost side, we continue to watch our operations closely and improve contracts of more revenues now fall through the bottom line. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we'll save about $90 million in interest cost annually following all of our debt actions last year. And finally, we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders. 
I mentioned earlier that we started our share buyback in January on schedule as the economic recovery continues, and as our businesses keep generating healthy free cash flow, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders going forward.
Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I'll provide some more detail on the results for the quarter and full year and update you on what we're seeing in 2011. I'll start with our total company results for the quarter. Our 11% revenue growth for the quarter can be broken down as follows: Advertising revenue was up 12%, reflecting the continued strong ad market both locally and nationally. Content licensing and distribution was up 21%, driven by strong domestic and international syndication sales. Fourth quarter affiliate and subscription fees were up 1% due to the impact of a one-time reclassification in the prior year. To give you some color on the underlying growth within this category, Cable affiliate revenue was up 7%, and retrans revenue up nearly 50%. So for the full year 2010, affiliate and subscription fees were up 9%, which is much more indicative of the performance going into 2011.
As Les said, OIBDA of $770 million was up 32% from the prior year. This quarter, we are adjusting for $15 million of restructuring activities, as well as a $44 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt that we discussed on our last call. You will see the benefits of these actions in 2011. During Q4 of 2009, we also had restructuring charges of $13 million and impairment charges of $186 million. So clearly, our reported results were up significantly more than our adjusted results we're discussing here. We expanded our OIBDA margin for the fifth consecutive quarter to 20%. Meanwhile, operating income was up 45% for the quarter, and diluted EPS came in at $0.46, up 77% from the prior year. 
Let's quickly recap our full year results, which speak to the continued strength of our businesses. Total company revenue was up 8%, OIBDA was up 32%, operating income up 49%, and diluted EPS of $1.11, up 102%. This operating leverage demonstrates the strong flow-through of high-margin advertising and affiliate revenues, and our continued cost efforts remain.
Turning to our five segments. Entertainment revenue of $2 billion was up 11% for the quarter, driven by content license fees from both domestic and international syndication. Advertising revenue also grew sharply with network advertising up 8% due to solid pricing gains in Primetime and Sports. Top categories included Automotive and Financial Services. Fourth quarter scatter pricing was upwards of 35% above upfront pricing. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $249 million, up 31%, driven by the strong revenue performance. At Cable Networks, revenues of $368 million for the quarter was up 6%, primarily as a result of increases in both subs and rates. 
Cable OIBDA of $169 million was up 10%, which is a 46% margin for the quarter. Due to the timing of expenses, we always look at the margin on a full year basis, which came in at 39%, up from 34% in 2009. We expect to continue to expand our margin in 2011 while investing more in original content where we retain more rights and thus more profits.
Publishing revenue of $232 million was up 5%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong title sales in the quarter. Digital content represented 10% of total Publishing revenue in Q4 of this year versus 5% in the prior year, and we expect this will continue to grow in 2011. Publishing OIBDA of $20 million for the quarter was up 32%, driven by the change in the revenue mix and our continued aggressive cost containment measures, partially offset by a higher provision for doubtful accounts relating to the border situation. We have been monitoring this closely for some time and have reduced our receivable exposure to a minimal amount as of December 31.
Local Broadcasting revenue of $822 million was up 21% for the quarter. TV Station advertising was up 28%, and Radio ad revenue was up 14%. Political advertising contributed to the growth, however, the increased local demand was impressive. For example, oil, retail and financial services were all up in the teens for the quarter. Even with this growth, the overall spend of major categories is still off by more than 20% from 2007 spend levels, leaving us plenty of room to grow. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $322 million, up 43% for the quarter. As Les mentioned, the margin at this segment hit 39% this quarter, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2006. As you can see our disciplined cost containment, we can achieve historical margins. 
Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 6% to $511 million. In constant dollars, the Americas and Europe combined grew 9% with the Americas leading the way with revenue growth of 13%, driven by higher occupancy rates and the onset of better pricing. As expected, we are now seeing more dollars float to this business as the recovery continues. OIBDA for Outdoor of $101 million increased 22% from prior year's fourth quarter as we continue to focus on restructuring our business model. We expect healthy margin expansion at this segment in 2011 as well.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $40 million for the quarter, which included a discretionary pre-funding of our pension plans of $167 million. For 2010, free cash flow was $1.45 billion, up 75% from prior year. CapEx for the full year came in at $284 million, right within our guidance range of $250 million to $300 million. We've used this year's cash flow primarily to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing debt by $1.4 billion and pre-funding our pension plans. Our cash on hand at the end of the year was $480 million. As you know, in January, we initiated our $1.5 billion share buyback program, and it is well underway. We will update you on the activity for Q1 with our first quarter results. But as we have said previously, we expect to complete this program in about 18 months.
Looking into 2011, here's what we're seeing. Starting with our advertising trends for Q1. As Les mentioned, the scatter market pricing as a network is robust, up 40% above last year's upfront, which is a very positive sign for this year's upfront. Online display advertising is expected to be up in the teens. TV Stations' advertising revenues are pacing to be flat, even with the difficult comp of no Super Bowl or political advertising, meaning our base business strength is offsetting both these prior-year events. Radio stations are pacing to be up low- to mid-single digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid- to high-single digits on a constant-dollar basis, again led by Americas pacing up double digits.
For the first quarter, there are two specific items to be aware of for comparison purposes: first is Super Bowl, and second, our new NCAA contract. Obviously, we didn't have the Super Bowl in Q1 2011, which will impact our year-over-year growth rates at both the Entertainment and Local Broadcasting segments. With respect to the new NCAA agreement, we will only recognize revenue associated with the games that air on CBS and not the games that air on internal networks. As a result, we expect a reduction in revenue in Q1 versus the prior year, but you will also see a greater reduction in expenses, which will drive higher profits and a significant margin expansion for both the Entertainment segment as well as the company.
Looking at the full year 2011. As we said on our last call, we expect to improve our profits and continue our margin expansion trend. We're estimating CapEx for 2011 to continue to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million for the third consecutive year. With this lowered CapEx, depreciation will continue to trend down slightly but the bigger benefit will be realized in a few years from now. Interest expense and cash payments for interest will be down considerably year-over-year because of lower debt levels. Our effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be approximately 39%, which is comparable to 2010.
So in conclusion, we are more excited about the future growth prospects of CBS than ever before. We've made long-term changes to our operating cost model, and the structural changes to our revenue mix are real and meaningful. With lower polls on cash from our debt obligations, we are focused on returning value to our shareholders now and in the future. 
With that, Lisa, we can open up the lines."

Our syndication operation is at full tilt, and obviously, with these kind of upfront, as well as scatter marketplace, the numbers that are coming into the network are truly remarkable. So we're not going to do anything to damage that. At the same token, we have the largest television library in the world. So we have many assets and many ways of looking at things. So what's great about these assets, we're still selling I Love Lucy along with CSI.

When there are four games on simultaneously, they will be on four different channels. We generally look at the game that we want in the first rounds, and for those people in local marketplaces, they will get the game that they want. At the same time, there will be highlights shown on our network of the other three games and vice versa. As you get down to the final rounds, we have the final four for the first four years of the deal, so that will be significant. Those are significant games. And in the regional games, there's sort of alternating games. Obviously, occasionally, there'll be two games going on simultaneously, so you'll be able to watch the one that you want. So as Joe said, revenue goes down, but cost goes down a lot, and probably for our viewer, they will be very happy because they will get whatever game they want to see. So for us, it's a major win in terms of economic things, and by and large, we're getting the games that we want, and the relationship with Turner is terrific. Both teams are selling, and as we said earlier, the sales are going extremely well. They're selling into a very strong sports marketplace, so I think everybody comes out a winner of it.

We tell the people that are out there, ""Look, you'd better be really good to make it on our schedule, but if you do make it on our schedule, the chances of succeeding are higher because you will generally put in a position where you're launched by a successful television show."" We also have the advantage of removing shows a year early rather than a year late, and I give you what we did with Without a Trace a year ago where it was a successful show. It did run through its eighth year. We've pulled off the show. Their license fee was, at that point, since it was in its eighth year, almost $4 million an episode, replaced it with a show called The Good Wife, which cost about less than half that amount. We also owned 100% of The Good Wife. The ratings were just as good. As a matter of fact, it won some Emmy Awards, and we took it off early and helped our schedule. A similar thing, if you look throughout our schedule, we don't let shows age and just hang around because that's all we got. We don't have to do that, and I think success propels further success, and I think we'll continue to do that."

Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter results with you today, results that capped a tremendous 2010 and speak to the momentum we saw throughout the year and are now seeing this year as well. Every one of our businesses grew during the quarter, with solid revenue increases and double-digit OIBDA growth across all of the company's operating segments. Our success continues to come primarily from the performance of our content and the increasing demand we're seeing for that content in an improving economic marketplace, locally, nationally and internationally. 
Today's very strong fourth quarter results closed out a terrific year which we have consistently delivered on our promises. We've capitalized on the sharp increase in advertising, while at the same time continuing to diversify and de-risk our business model by building profitable secondary revenue streams that don't depend on advertising. We've prudently managed both our cost structure and our balance sheet and at the same time, delivered more value to our shareholders. And through a number of long-term strategic deals throughout the company, we've set up CBS for a very bright future, one in which we are ideally positioned for continued growth this year and beyond.
Not only was it a very good quarter and year, but given the growing value of our content, the trends we see in our businesses and the media landscape as a whole, we expect these results to continue for a long, long time.
Before I turn it over to Joe and we take your questions, I'm going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights, beginning with our full year and fourth quarter results. Our revenue for 2010 of $14.1 billion was up 8%, and quarterly revenues of $3.9 billion was up 11%, once again speaking to our building momentum throughout the year. 2010 OIBDA of $2.4 billion was up 32% and fourth quarter OIBDA of $770 million was up 32% as well, illustrating our ability to turn increasing revenue into even better profits. And most importantly, EPS for the year was $1.11, up 102% from 2009, and fourth quarter EPS of $0.46 was up 77% from last year's fourth quarter. CBS also drew up $1.45 billion in free cash flow in 2010, up 75% from our total in 2009. 
So as you can see, in every single key measure, we had a remarkable quarter and a remarkable year. Plus we had an OIBDA margin of 20% in the fourth quarter, three percentage points higher than last year's quarter, and we are confident we will deliver even better margins in 2011 by continuing to manage our expenses, growing our secondary revenue streams and realizing better economics from our recent Comcast and NCAA deals. And going forward, we are positioned to exceed peak margin levels within the next couple of years. Finally, last month, we began executing on our $1.5 billion share buyback program. It is going very well, and we are pleased to be continuing our commitment of returning value to our shareholders. So clearly, we are in great financial shape across-the-board. 
Now let's take a quick look at some fourth quarter highlights throughout our businesses. Beginning with our Entertainment segment, where fourth quarter revenue was up 11% and OIBDA was up 31%. At the CBS Television Network, ad revenue was up more than 8%, with Primetime and Sports performing particularly well. We're having a terrific 2010, 2011 season. We are the leading network by a lot once again, and the margin continues to grow. CBS was the only network to successfully launch its entire new fall lineup, and three of our new series, Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0 and Mike & Molly are the top three new shows of the season. At the same time, our returning shows continued to dominate. For example, number one ranked drama, NCIS, just broke another series record, attracting nearly 23 million viewers to a show that's now in its eighth season. 
Looking ahead to next season, we could almost play a pass hand. There could be very little change necessary in our schedule because we have so many successful programs. One thing is for sure, any new show that does make it onto our schedule is going to have to be pretty extraordinary. This means reduced cost for development, reduced cost for promotion, et cetera, et cetera. Having the number one schedule also is helping us lead the way in the scatter market, which was extremely hot in the fourth quarter and continues to be even hotter through the first with prices 40% over upfront. So looking ahead to May and June, you've got a pretty good idea where pricing is heading in this year's upfront.
In Sports, our programming is also being sold into a very strong marketplace, with pricing significantly higher than a year ago and our ratings growth is a terrific story too. The NFL on CBS was up 10% this year, the highest viewer average in 23 years. And the AFC Championship game between the Jets and the Steelers delivered nearly 55 million viewers, the highest total in the game's history. And we are soon gearing up for the NCAA Menâ€™s Basketball tournament, where we and our new partners at Turner have virtually sold out inventory already at very favorable pricing. Our deal with Turner de-risked our exposure in this terrific property without taking away our offsite. As a result, we have a very profitable deal over the next 14 years. 
Last week, we also made some management moves that will have a positive effect on our Sports and News division. CBS Sports programming obviously means more and more to our corporation all the time, so we took Sean McManus' real passion, has always been sports, and allowed him to focus all of his time growing that division. At the same time, we took Jeff Fager, a universally admired journalist who has been running the critically and ratings-acclaimed 60 Minutes, the most successful news program in history, and put him in charge of CBS News. In doing these moves, we have significantly strengthened both organizations. 
Finally, at the network, the Grammy Awards on Sunday delivered its highest audience in 10 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. Just like in sports, big-ticket events continue to show ratings growth, proving once again that broadcast television is the best game in town.
Meanwhile, throughout the rest of our Entertainment segment, we continue to grow our non-advertising revenues well. Content licensing, global syndication and retransmission consent are becoming increasingly important as the broadcast model evolves in CBS's favor. Let me address a few of our accomplishments in these areas during the quarter now. Starting with syndication which continues to be strong for us. During the quarter, we sold the second cycle of CSI, which was a key driver in the company's content licensing and distribution fees, which grew by 21%. In addition, we continue to benefit from selling new shows overseas, thanks to an exploding international marketplace. All three of our new dramas this year, Hawaii Five-0, Blue Bloods and The Defenders were profitable before we aired a single episode in the United States. The current seasons of all three of these shows are now being monetized in more than 200 markets. Our three CSIs, in addition to our two NCIS', all CBS-owned shows, consistently ranked as top programs in markets around the world. And thanks to more channels being offered by international distributors, our presence on top 10 lists in emerging markets is growing all the time.
At the same time, our new international channel in the U.K., India and Australia are already steadily increasing their audiences. These channels are allowing us to build our brand internationally and establish demand for our content in new growing markets. And of course, the rapid growth of retrans also continues to diversify our revenue base. We beat our full year target of $100 million by a nice margin and we're working on new deals all the time. 
And finally, in the world of new media, we continued to be well positioned to capitalize on the competition for our premium content. There is clearly tremendous demand for network programming from all of the online video distributors coming to market. As you know, we've been very judicious about the ways in which we grow this new revenue stream. We will continue to look to do non-exclusive deals that provide recurring revenue and are incremental to the big picture.
Speaking of new media, CBS Interactive turned in a very strong fourth quarter as well, with display advertising revenues up 18% year-over-year. CBS.com has now been the number one TV network website for 25 straight months in terms of unique viewers. At the same time, more and more advertisers are buying across both TV and the web, and we're seeing this virtuous circle reflected in our results. CBS Interactive continues to grow our presence across mobile platforms as well. We produced more than 40 apps for iPads and other tablets during the year, each of which generate revenue for us, and we've doubled the page views across our mobile sites and apps versus 2009.
Our Entertainment segment also includes CBS Films, which had a good showing these last few weeks with the release of The Mechanic. The film opened well, and, most importantly, will be profitable for us. Once again, we are slowly going into this business. We've done four small films so far. We've got our toe in the water, and we like where we stand right now.
Moving to our Cable Network segment, we had a solid finish to 2010. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6%. OIBDA was up 10% with the margin of 46%. Showtime subs continue to grow, and we ended the year at just under 20 million subscribers, so we've closed the gap considerably with our top competitor, and we have plenty of growth left ahead of us. In fact, 2010 marked the seventh straight year of annual growth in subscribers for Showtime. Showtime's original programming continues to be the catalyst for our growth. The most recent seasons of Dexter, Weeds were their highest yet, and newer shows like Nurse Jackie and The Big C have become new hits for us as well. This quarter, we gave you Shameless starring William H. Macy. Shameless launched to Showtime's best numbers ever for a freshman drama and six weeks in, continues to outperform every new show we've ever premiered with viewership rising every single week. 
In Publishing, revenues for the fourth quarter were up 5% year-over-year and OIBDA was up 32%. Like our other businesses, it's leading content that's driving our growth. And also like our other businesses, Digital is an increasingly important part of our results. Sales of Simon & Schuster e-books were up 160% for the year in 2010, and we had a terrific holiday season. All the people who got e-readers for Christmas needed to buy books to load them. The week after Christmas, we sold electronic versions of 78% of the books in our entire digital catalog, showing the breadth of titles that are now being bought in this new format. We continue to digitize our library. We're now approaching 10,000 titles, demonstrating once again that great content endures and we can monetize it forever. 
Turning to Local Broadcasting. This business built on its momentum throughout 2010, producing its best results of the year in the fourth quarter and the best segment performance in the entire company. Revenue was up 21% with Television Stations, advertising revenue up 20% in Television Stations, and Radio ad revenue up 14%. At the same time, Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 43% year-over-year, and our OIBDA margin was 39%, up six percentage points from last year's quarter. Political advertising certainly contributed to our results, but the resurgence in local advertising was the story here. In fact, given the intense demand we're seeing from local advertisers before the election, we could've taken the inventory results of the candidates and sold them in the open market at very attractive pricing. 
Momentum continues at Outdoor as well. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6%, as the advertising market there continued to improve as well. OIBDA increased 22% year-over-year on higher revenues and a lower cost structure. We see ongoing improvement in this business, and as the market has recovered, we have strategically resumed our digital build-out pursuing some high-profile installations in major cities like New York and Washington, D.C., while we still stay well within our CapEx guidance. 
So as you can see, every one of our businesses contributed to our best results of the year in the fourth quarter. We're confident it will drive our success going forward as well. We finished 2010 on a high, and we've been busy laying the groundwork for an even better 2011 and 2012. We have every reason to believe we will build on our success, and here is why. The CBS Television Network continues to build hits and provide an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. Advertisers are recognizing this with extraordinary pricing in the scatter market and it will pay off in this year's upfront as well. The success of our own shows continues to grow. That means we can keep getting paid for today's hits for many, many years to come.
At the same time, we're growing retrans and affiliate compensation at a very healthy rate, and the CBS Television Network has become a true dual revenue stream business. The local ad marketplace continues its broad-based recovery. Our 2011 outlook for local business is very optimistic, even without the Super Bowl or political. On the cost side, we continue to watch our operations closely and improve contracts so more revenues now fall through the bottom line. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we'll save about $90 million in interest costs annually following all of our debt actions last year. And finally, we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders. 
I mentioned earlier that we started our share buyback in January on schedule. As the economic recovery continues, and as our businesses keep generating healthy free cash flow, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders going forward.
Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."
27763231,117442246,103912,"CBS Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on the results for the quarter and full year and update you on what we're seeing in 2011. I'll start with our total company results for the quarter. Our 11% revenue growth for",1410,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some more detail on the results for the quarter and full year and update you on what we're seeing in 2011. I'll start with our total company results for the quarter. Our 11% revenue growth for the quarter can be broken down as follows: Advertising revenue was up 12%, reflecting the continued strong ad market both locally and nationally. Content licensing and distribution was up 21%, driven by strong domestic and international syndication sales. Fourth quarter affiliate and subscription fees were up 1% due to the impact of a one-time reclassification in the prior year. To give you some color on the underlying growth within this category, Cable affiliate revenue was up 7%, and retrans revenue up nearly 50%. So for the full year 2010, affiliate and subscription fees were up 9%, which is much more indicative of the performance going into 2011.
As Les said, OIBDA of $770 million was up 32% from the prior year. This quarter, we are adjusting for $15 million of restructuring activities, as well as a $44 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt that we discussed on our last call. You will see the benefits of these actions in 2011. During Q4 of 2009, we also had restructuring charges of $13 million and impairment charges of $186 million. So clearly, our reported results were up significantly more than our adjusted results we're discussing here. We expanded our OIBDA margin for the fifth consecutive quarter to 20%. Meanwhile, operating income was up 45% for the quarter, and diluted EPS came in at $0.46, up 77% from the prior year. 
Let's quickly recap our full year results, which speak to the continued strength of our businesses. Total company revenue was up 8%, OIBDA was up 32%, operating income up 49%, and diluted EPS of $1.11, up 102%. This operating leverage demonstrates the strong flow-through of high-margin advertising and affiliate revenues, and our continued cost efforts remain.
Turning to our five segments. Entertainment revenue of $2 billion was up 11% for the quarter, driven by content license fees from both domestic and international syndication. Advertising revenue also grew sharply, with network advertising up 8% due to solid pricing gains in Primetime and Sports. Top categories included Automotive and Financial Services. Fourth quarter scatter pricing was upwards of 35% above upfront pricing. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $249 million, up 31%, driven by the strong revenue performance. At Cable Networks, revenues of $368 million for the quarter was up 6%, primarily as a result of increases in both subs and rates. 
Cable OIBDA of $169 million was up 10%, which is a 46% margin for the quarter. Due to the timing of expenses, we always look at the margin on a full year basis, which came in at 39%, up from 34% in 2009. We expect to continue to expand our margin in 2011 while investing more in original content, where we retain more rights and thus more profits.
Publishing revenue of $232 million was up 5%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong title sales in the quarter. Digital content represented 10% of total Publishing revenue in Q4 of this year versus 5% in the prior year, and we expect this will continue to grow in 2011. Publishing OIBDA of $20 million for the quarter was up 32%, driven by the change in the revenue mix and our continued aggressive cost containment measures, partially offset by a higher provision for doubtful accounts relating to the border situation. We have been monitoring this closely for some time and have reduced our receivable exposure to a minimal amount as of December 31.
Local Broadcasting revenue of $822 million was up 21% for the quarter. TV Station advertising was up 28%, and Radio ad revenue was up 14%. Political advertising contributed to the growth; however, the increased local demand was impressive. For example, oil, retail and financial services were all up in the teens for the quarter. Even with this growth, the overall spend of major categories is still off by more than 20% from 2007 spend levels, leaving us plenty of room to grow. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $322 million, up 43% for the quarter. As Les mentioned, the margin at this segment hit 39% this quarter, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2006. As you can see our disciplined cost containment, we can achieve historical margins. 
Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 6% to $511 million. In constant dollars, the Americas and Europe combined grew 9%, with the Americas leading the way with revenue growth of 13%, driven by higher occupancy rates and the onset of better pricing. As expected, we are now seeing more dollars float to this business as the recovery continues. OIBDA for Outdoor of $101 million increased 22% from prior year's fourth quarter as we continue to focus on restructuring our business model. We expect healthy margin expansion at this segment in 2011 as well.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $40 million for the quarter, which included a discretionary pre-funding of our pension plan of $167 million. For 2010, free cash flow was $1.45 billion, up 75% from prior year. CapEx for the full year came in at $284 million, right within our guidance range of $250 million to $300 million. We've used this year's cash flow primarily to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing debt by $1.4 billion and pre-funding our pension plans. Our cash on hand at the end of the year was $480 million. As you know, in January, we initiated our $1.5 billion share buyback program, and it is well underway. We will update you on the activity for Q1 with our first quarter results. But as we have said previously, we expect to complete this program in about 18 months.
Looking into 2011, here's what we're seeing. Starting with our advertising trends for Q1. As Les mentioned, the scatter market pricing at the network is robust, up 40% above last year's upfront, which is a very positive sign for this year's upfront. Online display advertising is expected to be up in the teens. TV Stations' advertising revenues are pacing to be flat, even with the difficult comp of no Super Bowl or political advertising, meaning our base business strength is offsetting both these prior-year events. Radio stations are pacing to be up low- to mid-single digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid- to high-single digits on a constant-dollar basis, again led by Americas pacing up double digits.
For the first quarter, there are two specific items to be aware of for comparison purposes: first is Super Bowl, and second, our new NCAA contract. Obviously, we didn't have the Super Bowl in Q1 2011, which will impact our year-over-year growth rates at both the Entertainment and Local Broadcasting segments. With respect to the new NCAA agreement, we will only recognize revenue associated with the games that air on CBS and not the games that air on Turner Networks. As a result, we expect a reduction in revenue in Q1 versus the prior year, but you will also see a greater reduction in expenses, which will drive higher profits and a significant margin expansion for both the Entertainment segment as well as the company.
Looking at the full year 2011. As we said on our last call, we expect to improve our profits and continue our margin expansion trend. We're estimating CapEx for 2011 to continue to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million for the third consecutive year. With this lowered CapEx, depreciation will continue to trend down slightly, but the bigger benefit will be realized in a few years from now. Interest expense and cash payments for interest will be down considerably year-over-year because of lower debt levels. Our effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be approximately 39%, which is comparable to 2010.
So in conclusion, we are more excited about the future growth prospects of CBS than ever before. We've made long-term changes to our operating cost model, and the structural changes to our revenue mix are real and meaningful. With lower polls on cash from our debt obligations, we are focused on returning value to our shareholders now and in the future. 
With that, Lisa, we can open up the lines."

We are looking at some of these platforms, and we're determining what will augment those two forms of revenue, first and foremost, without in any way hurting what we're doing. Our syndication operation is at full tilt, and obviously, with this kind of upfront, as well as scatter marketplace, the numbers that are coming into the network are truly remarkable. So we're not going to do anything to damage that. At the same token, we have the largest television library in the world. So we have many assets and many ways of looking at things.

And in the regional games, there's sort of alternating games. Obviously, occasionally, there'll be two games going on simultaneously, so you'll be able to watch the one that you want. So as Joe said, revenue goes down, but cost goes down a lot, and probably for our viewer, they will be very happy because they will get whatever game they want to see.

We tell the people that are out there, ""Look, you'd better be really good to make it on our schedule, but if you do make it on our schedule, the chances of succeeding are higher because you will generally be put in a position where you're launched by a successful television show."" We also have the advantage of removing shows a year early rather than a year late, and I give you what we did with Without a Trace a year ago where it was a successful show. It had run through its eighth year. We pulled off the show. Their license fee was, at that point, since it was in its eighth year, almost $4 million an episode, replaced it with a show called The Good Wife, which cost about less than half that amount. We also owned 100% of The Good Wife. The ratings were just as good. As a matter of fact, it won some Emmy Awards, and we took it off early and helped our schedule. A similar thing, if you look throughout our schedule, we don't let shows age and just hang around because that's all we got. We don't have to do that, and I think success propels further success, and I think we'll continue to do that."

The Good Wife doesn't do quite as well, but yet it does extraordinarily well when you compare it to what a show like that would've done years ago. So once again, as we said earlier, every single one of our new shows was profitable from day one because of the international marketplace, and that keeps growing in leaps and bounds because there are new channels all over the world and new markets opening up. So the international marketplace has never been hotter, and it's a reason we're glad we own most of our content."

We obviously have an agreement with the NFL where we do give them some money, but that the contract would be extended to a certain extent if there were any games that we missed. So ultimately, at the end of the day, we do not anticipate losing any revenue. We think we will get the games back in some way, shape or form. So they will be an immediate hit, and I'm guardedly optimistic that Mr. Goodell will come to an agreement with the players before the season starts and we'll be back playing."

EPS was $0",2646,"Thank you very much, Sumner, for that wonderful introduction. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us once again. By now, you've read our release and have seen that we had a wonderful quarter. It was up 64%, 96% on a reported basis. EPS was $0.29, up nearly 6x from the first quarter last year. Every single segment of CBS is performing at extremely high levels. In a minute, I'm going to walk you through our divisions in more detail. But I can tell you on top that initial every one of our businesses, we are very pleased with what we are seeing. And heading through the rest of the year we are looking as strong as we ever have. This quarter is also a great one because you can truly see the kind of strong fundamental performance that we are confident we will achieve going forward. We did not benefit from any onetime items or adjustments. We just generated healthy underlying growth that speaks to the strength of our businesses.
As the numbers show, we're clearly benefiting from the strategic actions we've taken to enhance and derisk our business model, including diversifying our revenue streams and managing our cost structure. Our valuable content and our ability to sell it with increasing profitability is a powerful combination that position CBS for success not just for the rest of this year but for many years to come. We are very encouraged by the ongoing strength of the advertising marketplace. We posted solid underlying revenue growth during the quarter. And as we look to the rest of '11 and into '12, our business continues to be very healthy, particularly given the highly favorable climate heading into this year's. Scatter is still extremely hot and pacing in our local businesses is looking very solid as well. In just the first 4 months of the year, we are already making meaningful progress towards many of the core initiatives that we emphasized at our upfront for investors in February. A major theme we discussed that day was the opportunity we have to monetize the value of our content through strategic business deals. There were some notable examples of our progress during the quarter, including our new NCAA deal with Turner broadcasting. Our first year in this 14-year agreement was a ratings success and it places us in a much stronger and now profitable position.
We also made significant progress in our strategy of getting paid incremental dollars for our content. This includes the deal we made with Netflix in February and, more recently, a new lucrative domestic syndication deal for Hawaii Five-0. More on that later.
We continue to have great success selling our content across the company on all sorts of platforms. And because of this success and the healthy free cash flow we continue to generate and the improved visibility we have in all of our businesses, we are pleased to announce today that we doubled our quarterly dividend to $0.10 a share. This is of course in addition to continuing our aggressive and significant share buyback program. Returning value to shareholders is a commitment we take very seriously and we are pleased to deliver it even more strongly once again today. So clearly, we're in terrific shape on every front. I'm now going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights, and then I'll turn it over to Joe to go into this in more depth. And then of course, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Starting with the results. As I said, the bottom line performance of the company was exceptional. EPS of $0.29 increased nearly six-fold from $0.05 a year ago. The success was primarily driven by our dramatic increases in OIBDA, which totaled $576 million for the quarter, up 64% and accelerating from last year. As you know, our first quarter last year included the Super Bowl and this year it did not. Also this year, we shared revenues with Turner Broadcasting for the NCAA Tournament. Even with these factors, revenue was essentially flat at $3.5 billion and underlying revenue growth at all of our businesses was very strong. And we are particularly pleased with our free cash flow of $853 million in the first quarter. This is up 29% year-over-year and once again was achieved without the benefit of last year's Super Bowl.
It's this healthy free cash flow and the ongoing confidence we have in our businesses that led to our dividend increase today. This increase will be comfortably paid out of the cash flow generated by all of our businesses as will our share repurchase plan that continues into the second quarter. 
During the first quarter, we purchased $250 million worth of stock and are on track to repurchase another $250 million this quarter. In all of these key financial metrics, we are very pleased to have been able to outperform during the quarter. And given the ongoing strength of our operations and the moves we made to set them up for continued success in the future, we feel very good about our ability to drive our performance throughout '11 and '12 and beyond. 
So now let's take a brief closer look at our businesses beginning with our Entertainment segment. The CBS Television Networks continues to be number 1 and the only network to be up in viewers this season. We have success across the board in every genre. We have the number 1 scripted series, the number 1 drama, the number 1 new sitcom, the number 1 news magazine and the number 1 most watched scripted series every single night of the week. As we look into the future, our schedule is set up to succeed for a long time. In addition to the many CBS-owned franchises we'll have returning, we've completed early renewals at good terms for a number of key shows, including the Big Bang Theory, which has been renewed until 2014. We are by far the most stable network in the business, and we are preparing to announce our new fall schedule at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. Given the success we're having right now, the bar has been set very high for new programming. Even though we'll only have a few tough spots to fill, I'm very pleased with the pilots I've seen so far, including some very strong projects from CBS Studios.
At the same time, primetime scatter in the second quarter is up over 40% over last year's upfront, continuing the 40% gains we have through the first quarter. So between the strength of our programming, our development and the marketplace overall, we expect to see solid double-digit increases when we sell next year's schedule a few weeks from now. 
Meanwhile, at CBS News, I'm really pleased with the progress made by Jeff Hager and David Rose in such a short time. These guys know how to win and have lots to build on. We just announced that we have a terrific new anchor in Scott Pelley, an extraordinary television journalist who has won multiple Peabody and Emmy awards. Plus CBS Sunday morning is getting ratings as good as it has in 4 years, and 60 Minutes continues to roll finishing the top 20 week after week. 
We were extremely pleased and proud to announce just today that this Sunday, we will have an exclusive with President Obama for his first and only interview on the killing of Osama bin Laden. I'm confident that better content will lead to improved financial results as Jeff and David take on some of the opportunities we have in front of us in news. I'm really proud of this team.
CBS Sports is also increasing its value to our corporation all the time. Working together with Turner Broadcasting, our coverage of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament was the most watched since 2005. Higher ratings and a strong marketplace drove significantly increased sales. And given our greatly reduced cost, deployment was profitable for us for the first time in many years. This new deal has successfully deed our financial exposure in this marquee franchise without taking away our upside. And the good news is that we will benefit from this tremendous swing in the value of our new deal well into the next decade. Throughout the CBS Television Network and broadcast television in general, big event programming continues to pull in viewers unlike any other medium. CBS Sports coverage of the Masters last month was the second-highest in the decade. And this year's Grammy broadcast in February has the biggest audience in 11 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. Broadcast Television is still the best game in town for years sometimes try to say otherwise, but the dominant broadcast remains universally acknowledged in the marketplace and is here to stay. All of this success results in increased leverage as we negotiate multiple new revenue streams for our content. As you know, retrans continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are very confident we'll achieve our goal of $250 million by next year. And on top of that, we are also increasingly getting paid reverse compensation from our affiliates. This is another new source of revenue that will grow for many years to come.
At the same time, we are capitalizing on all the new opportunities to get paid for CBS content by traditional and online distributors. Just last month, we sold Hawaii Five-0 to TNT at very attractive rates. Our international and domestic syndication commitments for this show are now nearly $5 million per episode, meeting that it is already extremely profitable. This is only Hawaii Five-0's first year and it's already on its way to being another $1 billion franchise for us joining NCIS and CSI, which both remained strong on our network as well. 
Meanwhile, the Netflix deal we announced in February is going to generate $100,000 of new dollars as well. Once again, the content in the Netflix deal is for programming that we've already sold elsewhere meaning it's not cutting into lucrative first and second month syndication dollars. Meaningful revenue from the Netflix deal will kick in beginning in the second quarter. Plus the Netflix deal is U.S. only and nonexclusive. So not only can we sell this program again domestically, but we will also look to sell the same content online internationally as well. And with competition for Netflix growing all the time, there is the great possibility that several new prudent deals are on the horizon.
And another of the key ways we are getting paid for our premium content is at CBS Interactive. This division turned in a strong first quarter as well. During the quarter, we brought a terrific new leader for CBS Interactive in Jim Lanzone. Jim is first and foremost a product guy and is busy working on improving our content across the division. We expect great things from Interactive going forward under Jim's leadership. 
Moving to our Cable segment, we continue to see growth in both rates and subscriptions at Showtime and the CBS Sports Network. Showtime leads the way with subs up considerably year-over-year, now totaling above 20 million subscribers. Original programming continues to drive Showtime's growth. Our new drama, debuted this month and delivered the best ratings for new drama series in 7 years and has already been picked up for a second season.
We are looking forward to new seasons of Shameless, the Big C, Weeds and Dexter as well as a number of new shows. Our investment in original content and our reduced cost for theatricals have greatly expanded our margins in Cable Networks, something you can really see in our results today.
Our Publishing business also performed strongly on the back of great content. Simon & Schuster had 61 New York Times bestsellers during the quarter, and won this year's general nonfiction Pulitzer for the Emperor of All maladies. E-books are growing in a much more rapid pace now, which is good news for us due to the improved cost structure. First quarter Digital sales of $28 million were up 148% over last year, representing our highest quarterly performance today. Just like in our other businesses, as Publishing continues to evolve, we feel good about our ability to monetize our content however our audience wants to consume it.
Now turning to Local Broadcasting. During the quarter, we drove increasing revenues at our TV stations, CBS Radio and the segment as a whole, again despite no Super Bowl and virtually no political advertising. In fact, revenue from the NFL alone was actually up at our TV stations versus a year ago with the Super Bowl. And to be up in an odd number of year without political advertising is extremely unusual. The momentum continues to be broad-based. We're selling into this improved advertising marketplace with higher ratings in many of our key major markets. In February, all 16 of our CBS Television Stations ranked number 1 or number 2 in primetime and late local news. And the weekly newscast, weekday newscast here in New York at CBS 2011 was the most-watched late news in the country. This is the first time since the Winter Olympics in 1994 WCBS has finished number 1 in sweeps. And in Radio, 7 of our top 10 markets gained rating shares during the quarter. We're very encouraged by our ability to sell these ratings going forward with second quarter pacings looking solid at our TV and Radio stations led once again by major markets.
In addition, we are aggressively looking to grow the overall revenue pie in our Local Broadcasting segment. We have rolled out plans for digital subchannels that will leverage local TV and radio programming, as well as content from our new local websites. We'll start by launching these subchannels in New York and L.A. during the third quarter. Meanwhile, our major market local websites continue to show growth month after month. CBS local websites ranked number 1 in total minutes spent each month in the quarter beating our other regional sites in the category, including Yelp, Yahoo! local and MSN local. 
Our momentum continued at Outdoor as well, and we're now seeing the benefits of our renegotiated trends and contracts in New York and Washington, D.C. Second quarter pacing for Outdoor is rising with U.S. occupance and rate's up considerably over a year ago. In addition, as the marketplace recovered, we have been strategically continuing our digital buildout. We're pursuing high-profile installations in major markets while still staying well within the CapEx range we've been giving you.
So you can see we're pretty excited. Across the board, our businesses are performing exceptionally well, both financially and operationally. We have begun 2011 with strong momentum. And there are many, many reasons why we're confident our momentum will continue throughout the year and into '12 and '13 as well. CBS Studios is building new hits all the time, and the first-place CBS Television Network provides an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. No matter which new platforms come along, advertising continues to covet the kind of big-ticket programming that we have on CBS. 
At the same time, we're successfully expanding and diversifying our non-advertising revenue sources. The local ad marketplace continues to grow with major markets like ours leading the way. We're holding down costs and finding every opportunity to enter into better deals all the time. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders including the significant increase in our dividend, which we announced today.
It's clearly a very good time to be an investor in CBS, and we have every reason to believe it will be for a long, long time. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will provide you more detail on the results for the quarter and update you on what we're seeing in Q2. But before I walk you through our strong results, I want to point out that we're confident that the performance we're seeing this quarter is sustainable. We're in the early stages of benefiting from the improved long-term deals with many more to come. We are favorably changing our revenue mix, and our visibility into the marketplace is more clear and very promising. This quarter proves that our underlying revenue performance continues to grow and our operating leverage is significant. We see this momentum continuing. 
So now let's look at our total company results for the quarter. Revenues at $3.5 billion were essentially flat with the prior year despite no Super Bowl and including the impact of our new NCAA arrangement return. Taken together, these 2 items lowered the revenue comparison by 10 percentage points. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, for our new NCAA contract, we only recognized revenues for the games that air on CBS. The underlying base advertising revenues for the company were up double digits for the quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up 4%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 10%. It's important to note again that these results do not reflect the impact of our new Netflix deal, which starts in Q2.
OIBDA of $576 million was up 64% from the prior year. On a reported basis, OIBDA was up 96% because of $57 million of restructuring charges recognized last year. We've also expanded our OIBDA margin for yet another quarter. The overall margin in the first quarter expanded 650 basis points to 16% as we continue to enhance our business model with prudent programming investment, derisked contractual obligations and larger contributions from high margin recurring revenue streams. Our Q1 OIBDA margin is expected to be the lowest of the year.
Operating income more than doubled to $437 million for the quarter, once again demonstrating the company's strong operating leverage. Diluted EPS came in at $0.29 compared to $0.05 a year ago. So in addition to our operating profit strength, you can see the direct benefit of lower interest expense due to our delevering activities last year. 
Let's turn to our segments. Entertainment revenues for the quarter were $2 billion, down 4%. This decrease in revenue is due to the absence of the Super Bowl and that I just mentioned the new way we recognized revenue for the NCAA. Together, these 2 items lowered the segment comparison by 17 points. Network advertising was up 12% for the quarter led by football, and syndication both domestically and internationally was strong. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $268 million, up 85% as a result of growth in high margin advertising revenues and lower cost from the revised NCAA agreement. 
Cable revenues for the quarter were $393 million, up 7% primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases. Cable OIBDA of $153 million was up 51% for a 39% margin, which is up 12 percentage points from a year ago. The margin in Q1 is traditionally the lowest of the year, so we expect this quarter's 39% margin to expand further. As Les said, you're seeing the benefits of investing in original content, which has a higher margin than theatrical programming.
Publishing revenues of $155 million for the quarter were up 2%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong titles. Digital sales represented 18% of total revenue and more than doubled last year's first quarter. Publishing OIBDA for the quarter of $7 million was up 133%, driven by the change in the revenue mix of higher digital sales, which have lower operating costs than the traditional print business. I'd also like to point out that these results were achieved without shipping product orders during the first quarter.
Local Broadcasting revenues of $621 million were up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenues were up 4% and TV station revenues were up 1%. Three items impacted our TV Station comp: The Super Bowl, political and the sale of a station last year, which combined, lowered our comparison by 11 percentage points. The fact that we showed growth despite the absence of the revenue for these related items speaks to the underlying strength of the base business. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $169 million, up 26% for the quarter. We continue to expand our margin at this segment and you can see the effects of the restructuring activities we implemented last year during the quarter.
Outdoor revenues for the quarter were up 5% to $413 million, with the Americas up 11% on a constant dollar basis. Occupancy rates in the U.S. are approaching historical levels so most of the gains in the quarter came from pricing. With the continued strength in demand and the tighter inventory supply, we are now starting to really see pricing power come back into this business. OIBDA for Outdoor of $49 million increased 53% from prior year's first quarter as we continue to focus on improving the economics of our long-term contracts.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $853 million for the quarter, up 29%. This was our second highest quarterly cash flow on record. Capital expenditures were $41 million, flat to the prior year and in line with our full year estimate. Our cash on hand at March 31 was $972 million. As Les said, during Q1, we spent $250 million on our share repurchase program. We retired 11.8 million shares at an average price of just over $21 a share. We expect to spend approximately another $250 million during the second quarter. We also extended our $2 billion credit facility through March of 2015 on more favorable terms, reducing our commitment fees as well as our borrowing spreads.
We are currently examining efficient ways to fund up our pension plan to capitalize on an attractive rate environment. More than that in the coming quarters. As you saw today, we doubled our quarterly dividends starting with the next dividend payable on July 1. We are very comfortable doing this at this time due to our enhanced visibility into our cash flow with new contracts like Comcast, like the NCAA and Netflix, just to name a few, and in our local businesses where our clients are making commitments earlier so we have a greater lead time in our planning.
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in Q2. The key takeaway for Q2 is that the momentum's continuing. Scatter market at the network remained strong, up 40% above last year's upfront, a very positive sign heading into this year's upfront. Q2 option cancellations remain historically low given the strength of our schedule and the robust scatter market. TV station's advertising revenues are pacing to be up low single digits even with a more difficult political comp. National advertisers are leading the way. Radio stations are pacing to be up mid-single digits led by auto and retail both up double digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid to high single digits. 
So to wrap up, we're off to a very strong start in 2011. Our leading position as a premium content provider continues to be the key to our success. The strong advertising momentum we saw exiting Q4 of last year accelerated into Q1 and is sustaining its momentum into Q2. On top of that, visibility, particularly in our local businesses, has returned to prerecession levels and has enhanced our confidence for those businesses.
In addition, we're very excited that our nonadvertising revenue streams such as retrans, affiliate fees, online distribution fees are significantly adding to the recurring nature of our business and will increasingly drive the growth of our top and bottom line for many years to come. In short, every single segment of CBS is performing at very high levels. We are very pleased with what we're seeing but even more optimistic for what lies ahead. 
With that, Jay, we can open the lines for questions. Operator?"

You're right. As you're sitting here, May 2, with 40% increase going on in scatter, you know when people are buying in June, they're going to be looking at that.

And I know you're somewhat hamstrung by how you can comment on this. But clearly, the notion of JC sort of expanding its U.S. footprint is obviously nothing new. We've been hearing about this for 3 years now. Previous rumors of pending deals have just turned out to be massive head takes. That being said, you guys have stated for the record many times that Outdoor is sort of non-core operations. So could you comment -- against that backdrop, could you maybe comment on a couple of things? First of all, is the London 2 platform also non-core? And then could you just comment on the tax basis of the Outdoor business in general?"

By now, you've read our release and have seen that we had a wonderful quarter. OIBDA was up 64%, 96% on a reported basis. EPS was $0.29, up nearly 6x from the first quarter last year. Every single segment of CBS is performing at extremely high levels. In a minute, I'm going to walk you through our divisions in more detail. But I can tell you up top that in every one of our businesses, we are very pleased with what we are seeing. And heading into the rest of the year, we are looking as strong as we ever have. This quarter is also a great one because you can truly see the kind of strong fundamental performance that we are confident we will achieve going forward. We did not benefit from any one-time items or adjustments. We just generated healthy underlying growth that speaks to the strength of our businesses.
As the numbers show, we're clearly benefiting from the strategic actions we've taken to enhance and derisk our business model, including diversifying our revenue streams and managing our cost structure. Our valuable content and our ability to sell it with increasingly creasing profitability is a powerful combination that position CBS to success, not just for the rest of this year but for many years to come. We are very encouraged by the ongoing strength of the advertising marketplace. We posted solid underlying revenue growth during the quarter. And as we look to the rest of '11 and into '12, our business continues to be very healthy, particularly given the highly favorable climate heading into this year's upfront. Scatter is still extremely hot, and pacing in our local businesses is looking very solid as well. In just the first 4 months of the year, we are already making meaningful progress towards many of the core initiatives that we emphasized at our upfront for investors in February. A major theme we discussed that day was the opportunity we have to monetize the value of our content through strategic business deals. There were some notable examples of our progress during the quarter, including our new NCAA deal with Turner Broadcasting. Our first year in this 14-year agreement was a ratings success, and it places us in a much stronger and now profitable position.
We also made significant progress in our strategy of getting paid incremental dollars for our content. This includes the deal we made with Netflix in February and more recently, a new lucrative domestic syndication deal for Hawaii Five-0. More on that later.
We continue to have great success selling our content across the company on all sorts of platforms. And because of this success and the healthy free cash flow we continue to generate and the improved visibility we have in all of our businesses, we are pleased to announce today that we doubled our quarterly dividend to $0.10 a share. This is, of course, in addition to continuing our aggressive and significant share buyback program. Returning value to shareholders is a commitment we take very seriously, and we are pleased to deliver it even more strongly once again today. So clearly, we're in terrific shape on every front. I'm now going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights. And then I'll turn it over to Joe to go into this in more depth. And then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Starting with the results. As I said, the bottom line performance of the company was exceptional. EPS of $0.29 increased nearly six-fold from $0.05 a year ago. The success was primarily driven by our dramatic increases in OIBDA, which totaled $576 million for the quarter, up 64% and accelerating from last year. As you know, our first quarter last year included the Super Bowl, and this year it did not. Also this year, we shared revenues with Turner Broadcasting for the NCAA Tournament. Even with these factors, revenue was essentially flat at $3.5 billion, and underlying revenue growth at all of our businesses was very strong. And we are particularly pleased with our free cash flow of $853 million in the first quarter. This is up 29% year-over-year and once again was achieved without the benefit of last year's Super Bowl.
It's this healthy free cash flow and the ongoing confidence we have in our businesses that led to our dividend increase today. This increase will be comfortably paid out of the cash flow generated by all of our businesses as will our share repurchase plan that continues into the second quarter. 
During the first quarter, we purchased $250 million worth of stock and are on track to repurchase another $250 million this quarter. In all of these key financial metrics, we are very pleased to have been able to outperform during the quarter. And given the ongoing strength of our operations and the moves we made to set them up for continued success in the future, we feel very good about our ability to drive our performance throughout '11 and '12 and beyond. 
So now let's take a brief closer look at our businesses. Beginning with our Entertainment segment. The CBS Television Network continues to be number one and the only network to be up in viewers this season. We have success across the board in every genre. We have the number one scripted series, the number one drama, the number one sitcom, the number one news sitcom, the number one news magazine and the number one most-watched scripted series every single night of the week. As we look into the future, our schedule is set up to succeed for a long time. In addition to the many CBS-owned franchises we'll have returning, we've completed early renewals at good terms for a number of key shows, including The Big Bang Theory, which has been renewed until 2014. We are by far the most stable network in the business, and we are preparing to announce our new fall schedule at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. Given the success we're having right now, the bar has been set very high for new programming. Even though we'll only have a few tough spots to fill, I'm very pleased with the pilots I've seen so far, including some very strong projects from CBS Studios.
At the same time, primetime scatter in the second quarter is up over 40% over last year's upfront, continuing the 40% gains we have through the first quarter. So between the strength of our programming, our development and the marketplace overall, we expect to see solid double-digit increases when we sell next year's schedule a few weeks from now. 
Meanwhile, at CBS News, I'm really pleased with the progress made by Jeff Hager and David Rose in such a short time. These guys know how to win and have lots to build on. We just announced that we have a terrific new anchor in Scott Pelley, an extraordinary television journalist who has won multiple Peabody and Emmy Awards. Plus CBS Sunday morning is getting ratings as good as it has in 4 years, and 60 Minutes continues to roll, finishing the top 20 week after week. 
We were extremely pleased and proud to announce just today that this Sunday, we will have an exclusive with President Obama for his first and only interview on the killing of Osama bin Laden. I'm confident that better content will lead to improved financial results, as Jeff and David take on some of the opportunities we have in front of us in news. I'm really proud of this team.
CBS Sports is also increasing its value to our corporation all the time. Working together with Turner Broadcasting, our coverage of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament was the most watched since 2005. Higher ratings and a strong marketplace drove significantly increased sales. And given our greatly reduced cost, the tournament was profitable for us for the first time in many years. This new deal has successfully derisked our financial exposure in this marquee franchise without taking away our upside. And the good news is that we will benefit from this tremendous swing in the value of our new deal well into the next decade. Throughout the CBS Television Network and broadcast television in general, big event programming continues to pull in viewers unlike any other medium. CBS Sports coverage of the Masters last month was the second highest in the decade. And this year's Grammy broadcast in February had the biggest audience in 11 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. Broadcast television is still the best game in town for years, sometimes when we try to say otherwise. But the dominance of broadcast remains universally acknowledged in the marketplace and is here to stay. All of this success results in increased leverage as we negotiate multiple new revenue streams for our content. As you know, retrans [retransmission] continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are very confident we'll achieve our goal of $250 million by next year. And on top of that, we are also increasingly getting paid reverse compensation from our affiliates. This is another new source of revenue that will grow for many years to come.
At the same time, we are capitalizing on all the new opportunities to get paid for CBS content by traditional and online distributors. Just last month, we sold Hawaii Five-0 to TNT at very attractive rates. Our international and domestic syndication commitments for this show are now nearly $5 million per episode, meaning that it is already extremely profitable. This is only Hawaii Five-0's first year, and it's already on its way to being another $1 billion franchise for us joining NCIS and CSI, which both remained strong on our network as well. 
Meanwhile, the Netflix deal we announced in February is going to generate hundreds of millions of new dollars as well. Once again, the contract in the Netflix deal is for programming that we've already sold elsewhere, meaning it's not cutting into lucrative first and second month syndication dollars. Meaningful revenue from the Netflix deal will kick in beginning in the second quarter. Plus the Netflix deal is U.S. only and non-exclusive. So not only can we sell this program again domestically, but we will also look to sell the same content online internationally as well. And with competition for Netflix growing all the time, there is the great possibility that several new prudent deals are on the horizon.
Another one of the key ways we are getting paid for our premium content is at CBS Interactive. This division turned in a strong first quarter as well. During the quarter, we brought in a terrific new leader for CBS Interactive in Jim Lanzone. Jim is first and foremost a product guy and is busy working on improving our content across the division. We expect great things from Interactive going forward under Jim's leadership. 
Moving to our Cable segment, we continue to see growth in both rates and subscriptions at Showtime and the CBS Sports Network. Showtime leads the way with subs up considerably year-over-year, now totaling above 20 million subscribers. Original programming continues to drive Showtime's growth. Our new drama, The Borgias, that debuted earlier this month and delivered the best ratings for a new drama series in 7 years and has already been picked up for a second season.
We are looking forward to new seasons of Shameless, the Big C, Weeds and Dexter as well as a number of new shows. Our investment in original content and our reduced cost for theatricals have greatly expanded our margins in Cable Networks, something you can really see in our results today.
Our Publishing business also performed strongly on the back of great content. Simon & Schuster had 61 New York Times bestsellers during the quarter and won this year's general nonfiction Pulitzer for The Emperor of All Maladies. E-books are growing in a much more rapid pace now, which is good news for us due to the improved cost structure. First quarter digital sales of $28 million were up, 148% over last year, representing our highest quarterly performance today. Just like in our other businesses, as Publishing continues to evolve, we feel good about our ability to monetize our content however our audience wants to consume it.
Now turning to Local Broadcasting. During the quarter, we drove increasing revenues at our TV stations, CBS Radio and the segment as a whole, again despite no Super Bowl and virtually no political advertising. In fact, revenue from the NFL alone was actually up at our TV stations versus a year ago with the Super Bowl. And to be up in an odd numbered year without political advertising is extremely unusual. The momentum continues to be broad-based. We're selling into this improved advertising marketplace with higher ratings in many of our key major markets. In February, all 16 of our CBS Television Stations ranked number one or number two in primetime and late local news. And the weekly newscast, weekday newscast here in New York at CBS 2011 was the most-watched late news in the country. This is the first time since the Winter Olympics in 1994 that WCBS has finished number one in sweeps. And in Radio, 7 of our top 10 markets gained rating shares during the quarter. We're very encouraged by our ability to sell these ratings going forward with second quarter pacings looking solid at our TV and radio stations led once again by major markets.
In addition, we are aggressively looking to grow the overall revenue pie in our Local Broadcasting segment. We have rolled out plans for digital subchannels that will leverage local TV and radio programming, as well as content from our new local websites. We'll start by launching these subchannels in New York and L.A. during the third quarter. Meanwhile, our major market local websites continue to show growth month after month. CBS local websites ranked number one in total minutes spent each month for the quarter, beating out other regional sites in the category, including Yelp, Yahoo! Local and MSN Local. 
Our momentum continued at Outdoor as well, and we're now seeing the benefits of our renegotiated trends and contracts in New York and Washington, D.C. Second quarter pacing for Outdoor is rising with U.S. occupancy and rates up considerably over a year ago. In addition, as the marketplace has recovered, we've been strategically continuing our digital buildout. We're pursuing high-profile installations in major markets while still staying well within the CapEx range we've been giving you.
So you can see we're pretty excited. Across the board, our businesses are performing exceptionally well, both financially and operationally. We have begun 2011 with strong momentum. And there are many, many reasons why we're confident our momentum will continue throughout the year and into '12 and '13 as well. CBS Studios is building new hits all the time, and the first-place CBS Television Network provides an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. No matter which new platforms come along, advertisers continues to covet the kind of big-ticket programming that we have on CBS. 
At the same time, we're successfully expanding and diversifying our non-advertising revenue sources. The local ad marketplace continues to grow with major markets like ours leading the way. We're holding down costs and finding every opportunity to enter into better deals all the time. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders, including the significant increase in our dividend which we announced today.
It's clearly a very good time to be an investor in CBS, and we have every reason to believe it will be for a long, long time. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will provide you more detail on the results for the quarter and update you on what we're seeing in Q2. But before I walk you through our strong results, I want to point out that we're confident that the performance we're seeing this quarter is sustainable. We're in the early stages of benefiting from the improved long-term deals with many more to come. We are favorably changing our revenue mix, and our visibility into the marketplace is more clear and very promising. This quarter proves that our underlying revenue performance continues to grow, and our operating leverage is significant. We see this momentum continuing. 
So now let's look at our total company results for the quarter. Revenues at $3.5 billion were essentially flat with the prior year despite no Super Bowl and including the impact of our new NCAA arrangement return. Taken together, these 2 items lowered the revenue comparison by 10 percentage points. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, for our new NCAA contract, we only recognized revenues for the games that air on CBS. The underlying base advertising revenues for the company were up double digits for the quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up 4%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 10%. It's important to note again that these results do not reflect the impact of our new Netflix deal, which starts in Q2.
OIBDA of $576 million was up 64% from the prior year. On a reported basis, OIBDA was up 96% because of $57 million of restructuring charges recognized last year. We have also expanded our OIBDA margin for yet another quarter. The overall margin in the first quarter expanded 650 basis points to 16%, as we continue to enhance our business model with prudent programming investment, derisked contractual obligations and larger contributions from high margin recurring revenue streams. Our Q1 OIBDA margin is expected to be the lowest of the year.
Operating income more than doubled to $437 million for the quarter, once again demonstrating the company's strong operating leverage. Diluted EPS came in at $0.29 compared to $0.05 a year ago. So in addition to our operating profit strength, you can see the direct benefit of lower interest expense due to our delevering activities last year. 
Let's turn to our segments. Entertainment revenues for the quarter were $2 billion, down 4%. This decrease in revenue is due to the absence of the Super Bowl, and that I just mentioned the new way we recognized revenue for the NCAA. Together, these 2 items lowered the segment comparison by 17 points. Network advertising was up 12% for the quarter led by football. And syndication, both domestically and internationally, was strong. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $268 million, up 85% as a result of growth in high margin advertising revenues and lower cost from the revised NCAA agreement. 
Cable revenues for the quarter were $393 million, up 7%, primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases. Cable OIBDA of $153 million was up 51% for a 39% margin, which is up 12 percentage points from a year ago. The margin in Q1 is traditionally the lowest of the year, so we expect this quarter's 39% margin to expand further. As Les said, you're seeing the benefits of investing in original content, which has a higher margin than theatrical programming.
Publishing revenues of $155 million for the quarter were up 2%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong titles. Digital sales represented 18% of total revenue and more than doubled last year's first quarter. Publishing OIBDA for the quarter of $7 million was up 133%, driven by the change in the revenue mix of higher digital sales, which have lower operating costs than the traditional print business. I'd also like to point out that these results were achieved without shipping product orders during the first quarter.
Local Broadcasting revenues of $621 million were up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenues were up 4% and TV station revenues were up 1%. Three items impacted our TV station comp: the Super Bowl, political and the sale of a station last year, which combined, lowered our comparison by 11 percentage points. The fact that we showed growth despite the absence of the revenue for these related items speaks to the underlying strength of the base business. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $169 million, up 26% for the quarter. We continue to expand our margin at this segment, and you can see the effects of the restructuring activities we implemented last year during the quarter.
Outdoor revenues for the quarter were up 5% to $413 million, with the Americas up 11% on a constant-dollar basis. Occupancy rates in the U.S. are approaching historical levels, so most of the gains in the quarter came from pricing. With the continued strength in demand and the tighter inventory supply, we are now starting to really see pricing power come back into this business. OIBDA for Outdoor of $49 million increased 53% from prior year's first quarter, as we continue to focus on improving the economics of our long-term contracts.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $853 million for the quarter, up 29%. This was our second highest quarterly cash flow on record. Capital expenditures were $41 million, flat to the prior year and in line with our full year estimate. Our cash on hand at March 31 was $972 million. As Les said, during Q1, we spent $250 million on our share repurchase program. We retired 11.8 million shares at an average price of just over $21 a share. We expect to spend approximately another $250 million during the second quarter. We also extended our $2 billion credit facility through March of 2015 on more favorable terms, reducing our commitment fees as well as our borrowing spreads.
We are currently examining efficient ways to fund up our pension plan to capitalize on an attractive rate environment. More on that in the coming quarters. As you saw today, we doubled our quarterly dividends starting with the next dividend payable on July 1. We are very comfortable doing this at this time due to our enhanced visibility into our cash flow with new contracts like Comcast, like the NCAA and Netflix, just to name a few, and in our local businesses where our clients are making commitments earlier, so we have a greater lead time in our planning.
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in Q2. The key takeaway for Q2 is that the momentum's continuing. Scatter market at the network remained strong, up 40% above last year's upfront, a very positive sign heading into this year's upfront. Q2 option cancellations remain historically low, given the strength of our schedule and the robust scatter market. TV station's advertising revenues are pacing to be up low single digits even with a more difficult political comp. National advertisers are leading the way. Radio stations are pacing to be up mid-single digits led by auto and retail, both up double digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid to high single digits. 
So to wrap up, we're off to a very strong start in 2011. Our leading position as a premium content provider continues to be the key to our success. The strong advertising momentum we saw exiting Q4 of last year accelerated into Q1 and is sustaining its momentum into Q2. On top of that, visibility, particularly in our local businesses, has returned to pre-recession levels and has enhanced our confidence for those businesses.
In addition, we're very excited that our non-advertising revenue streams, such as retrans, affiliate fees, online distribution fees, are significantly adding to the recurring nature of our business and will increasingly drive the growth of our top and bottom line for many years to come. In short, every single segment of CBS is performing at very high levels. We are very pleased with what we're seeing but even more optimistic for what lies ahead. 
With that, Jay, we can open the lines for questions. Operator?"

By now, you've read our release and have seen that we had a wonderful quarter. OIBDA was up 64%, 96% on a reported basis. EPS was $0.29, up nearly 6x from the first quarter last year. Every single segment of CBS is performing at extremely high levels. In a minute, I'm going to walk you through our divisions in more detail. But I can tell you up top that in every one of our businesses, we are very pleased with what we are seeing. And heading into the rest of the year, we are looking as strong as we ever have. This quarter is also a great one because you can truly see the kind of strong fundamental performance that we are confident we will achieve going forward. We did not benefit from any one-time items or adjustments. We just generated healthy underlying growth that speaks to the strength of our businesses.
As the numbers show, we're clearly benefiting from the strategic actions we've taken to enhance and derisk our business model, including diversifying our revenue streams and managing our cost structure. Our valuable content and our ability to sell it with increasing profitability is a powerful combination that positions CBS for success, not just for the rest of this year but for many years to come. We are very encouraged by the ongoing strength of the advertising marketplace. We posted solid underlying revenue growth during the quarter. And as we look to the rest of '11 and into '12, our business continues to be very healthy, particularly given the highly favorable climate heading into this year's upfront. Scatter is still extremely hot, and pacing in our local businesses is looking very solid as well. In just the first 4 months of the year, we are already making meaningful progress towards many of the core initiatives that we emphasized at our upfront for investors in February. A major theme we discussed that day was the opportunity we have to monetize the value of our content through strategic business deals. There were some notable examples of our progress during the quarter, including our new NCAA deal with Turner Broadcasting. Our first year in this 14-year agreement was a ratings success, and it places us in a much stronger and now profitable position.
We also made significant progress in our strategy of getting paid incremental dollars for our content. This includes the deal we made with Netflix in February and more recently, a new lucrative domestic syndication deal for Hawaii Five-0. More on that later.
We continue to have great success selling our content across the company on all sorts of platforms. And because of this success and the healthy free cash flow we continue to generate and the improved visibility we have in all of our businesses, we are pleased to announce today that we've doubled our quarterly dividend to $0.10 a share. This is, of course, in addition to continuing our aggressive and significant share buyback program. Returning value to shareholders is a commitment we take very seriously, and we are pleased to deliver it even more strongly once again today. So clearly, we're in terrific shape on every front. I'm now going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights. And then I'll turn it over to Joe to go into this in more depth. And then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Starting with the results. As I said, the bottom line performance of the company was exceptional. EPS of $0.29 increased nearly six-fold from $0.05 a year ago. The success was primarily driven by our dramatic increases in OIBDA, which totaled $576 million for the quarter, up 64% and accelerating from last year. As you know, our first quarter last year included the Super Bowl, and this year it did not. Also this year, we shared revenues with Turner Broadcasting for the NCAA Tournament. Even with these factors, revenue was essentially flat at $3.5 billion, and underlying revenue growth at all of our businesses was very strong. And we are particularly pleased with our free cash flow of $853 million in the first quarter. This is up 29% year-over-year and once again was achieved without the benefit of last year's Super Bowl.
It's this healthy free cash flow and the ongoing confidence we have in our businesses that led to our dividend increase today. This increase will be comfortably paid out of the cash flow generated by all of our businesses as will our share repurchase plan that continues into the second quarter. 
During the first quarter, we purchased $250 million worth of stock and are on track to repurchase another $250 million this quarter. In all of these key financial metrics, we are very pleased to have been able to outperform during the quarter. And given the ongoing strength of our operations and the moves we made to set them up for continued success in the future, we feel very good about our ability to drive our performance throughout '11 and '12 and beyond. 
So now let's take a brief closer look at our businesses. Beginning with our Entertainment segment. The CBS Television Network continues to be number one and the only network to be up in viewers this season. We have success across the board in every genre. We have the number one scripted series, the number one drama, the number one sitcom, the number one news sitcom, the number one news magazine and the number one most-watched scripted series every single night of the week. As we look into the future, our schedule is set up to succeed for a long time. In addition to the many CBS-owned franchises we'll have returning, we've completed early renewals at good terms for a number of key shows, including The Big Bang Theory, which has been renewed until 2014. We are by far the most stable network in the business, and we are preparing to announce our new fall schedule at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. Given the success we're having right now, the bar has been set very high for new programming. Even though we'll only have a few spots to fill, I'm very pleased with the pilots I've seen so far, including some very strong projects from CBS Studios.
At the same time, primetime scatter in the second quarter is up over 40% over last year's upfront, continuing the 40% gains we have through the first quarter. So between the strength of our programming, our development and the marketplace overall, we expect to see solid double-digit increases when we sell next year's schedule a few weeks from now. 
Meanwhile, at CBS News, I'm really pleased with the progress made by Jeff Fager and David Rhodes in such a short time. These guys know how to win and have lots to build on. We just announced that we have a terrific new anchor in Scott Pelley, an extraordinary television journalist who has won multiple Peabody and Emmy Awards. Plus CBS Sunday Morning is getting ratings as good as it has in 4 years, and 60 Minutes continues to roll, finishing in the top 20 week after week. 
We were extremely pleased and proud to announce just today that this Sunday, we will have an exclusive with President Obama for his first and only interview on the killing of Osama bin Laden. I'm confident that better content will lead to improved financial results, as Jeff and David take on some of the opportunities we have in front of us in news. I'm really proud of this team.
CBS Sports is also increasing its value to our corporation all the time. Working together with Turner Broadcasting, our coverage of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament was the most watched since 2005. Higher ratings and a strong marketplace drove significantly increased sales. And given our greatly reduced cost, the tournament was profitable for us for the first time in many years. This new deal has successfully derisked our financial exposure in this marquee franchise without taking away our upside. And the good news is that we will benefit from this tremendous swing in the value of our new deal well into the next decade. Throughout the CBS Television Network and broadcast television in general, big event programming continues to pull in viewers unlike any other medium. CBS Sports coverage of the Masters last month was the second highest in a decade. And this year's Grammy broadcast in February had the biggest audience in 11 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. Broadcast television is still the best game in town. For years, some pundits have tried to say otherwise, but the dominance of broadcast remains universally acknowledged in the marketplace and is here to stay. All of this success results in increased leverage as we negotiate multiple new revenue streams for our content. As you know, retrans [retransmission] continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are very confident we'll achieve our goal of $250 million by next year. And on top of that, we are also increasingly getting paid reverse compensation from our affiliates. This is another new source of revenue that will grow for many years to come.
At the same time, we are capitalizing on all the new opportunities to get paid for CBS content by traditional and online distributors. Just last month, we sold Hawaii Five-0 to TNT at very attractive rates. Our international and domestic syndication commitments for this show are now nearly $5 million per episode, meaning that it is already extremely profitable. This is only Hawaii Five-0's first year, and it's already on its way to being another $1 billion franchise for us joining NCIS and CSI, which both remained strong on our network as well. 
Meanwhile, the Netflix deal we announced in February is going to generate hundreds of millions of new dollars as well. Once again, the contract in the Netflix deal is for programming that we've already sold elsewhere, meaning it's not cutting into lucrative first and second month syndication dollars. Meaningful revenue from the Netflix deal will kick in beginning in the second quarter. Plus the Netflix deal is U.S. only and non-exclusive. So not only can we sell this program again domestically, but we will also look to sell the same content online internationally as well. And with competition for Netflix growing all the time, there is a great possibility that several new prudent deals are on the horizon.
Another one of the key ways we're getting paid for our premium content is at CBS Interactive. This division turned in a strong first quarter as well. During the quarter, we brought in a terrific new leader for CBS Interactive in Jim Lanzone. Jim is first and foremost a product guy and is busy working on improving our content across the division. We expect great things from Interactive going forward under Jim's leadership. 
Moving to our Cable segment, we continue to see growth in both rates and subscriptions at Showtime and the CBS Sports Network. Showtime leads the way with subs up considerably year-over-year, now totaling above 20 million subscribers. Original programming continues to drive Showtime's growth. Our new drama, The Borgias, debuted earlier this month and delivered the best ratings for a new drama series in 7 years and has already been picked up for a second season.
We are looking forward to new seasons of Shameless, The Big C, Weeds and Dexter as well as a number of new shows. Our investment in original content and our reduced cost for theatricals have greatly expanded our margins in Cable Networks, something you can really see in our results today.
Our Publishing business also performed strongly on the back of great content. Simon & Schuster had 61 New York Times bestsellers during the quarter and won this year's general nonfiction Pulitzer for The Emperor of All Maladies. E-books are growing at a much more rapid pace now, which is good news for us due to the improved cost structure. First quarter digital sales of $28 million were up 148% over last year, representing our highest quarterly performance to date. Just like in our other businesses, as Publishing continues to evolve, we feel good about our ability to monetize our content however our audience wants to consume it.
Now turning to Local Broadcasting. During the quarter, we drove increasing revenues at our TV stations, CBS Radio and the segment as a whole, again despite no Super Bowl and virtually no political advertising. In fact, revenue from the NFL alone was actually up at our TV stations versus a year ago with the Super Bowl. And to be up in an odd numbered year without political advertising is extremely unusual. The momentum continues to be broad-based. We're selling into this improved advertising marketplace with higher ratings in many of our key major markets. In February, all 16 of our CBS Television Stations ranked number one or number two in primetime and late local news. And the weekly newscast, weekday newscast here in New York at CBS 2 at 11 [CBS 2 News at 11PM] was the most-watched late news in the country. This is the first time since the Winter Olympics in 1994 that WCBS has finished number one in sweeps. And in Radio, 7 of our top 10 markets gained rating shares during the quarter. We're very encouraged by our ability to sell these ratings going forward with second quarter pacings looking solid at our TV and radio stations led once again by major markets.
In addition, we are aggressively looking to grow the overall revenue pie in our Local Broadcasting segment. We have rolled out plans for digital subchannels that will leverage local TV and radio programming, as well as content from our new local websites. We'll start by launching these subchannels in New York and L.A. during the third quarter. 
Meanwhile, our major market local websites continue to show growth month after month. CBS local websites ranked number one in total minutes spent each month in the quarter, beating out other regional sites in the category, including Yelp, Yahoo! Local and MSN Local. 
Our momentum continued at Outdoor as well, and we're now seeing the benefits of our renegotiated trends and contracts in New York and Washington, D.C. Second quarter pacing for Outdoor is rising with U.S. occupancy and rates up considerably over a year ago. In addition, as the marketplace has recovered, we've been strategically continuing our digital buildout. We're pursuing high-profile installations in major markets while still staying well within the CapEx range we've been giving you.
So you can see we're pretty excited. Across the board, our businesses are performing exceptionally well, both financially and operationally. We have begun 2011 with strong momentum. And there are many, many reasons why we're confident our momentum will continue throughout the year and into '12 and '13 as well. CBS Studios is building new hits all the time, and the first-place CBS Television Network provides an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. No matter which new platforms come along, advertisers continues to covet the kind of big-ticket programming that we have on CBS. 
At the same time, we're successfully expanding and diversifying our non-advertising revenue sources. The local ad marketplace continues to grow with major markets like ours leading the way. We're holding down costs and finding every opportunity to enter into better deals all the time. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders, including the significant increase in our dividend which we announced today.
It's clearly a very good time to be an investor in CBS, and we have every reason to believe it will be for a long, long time. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will provide you more detail on the results for the quarter and update you on what we're seeing in Q2. But before I walk you through our strong results, I want to point out that we're confident that the performance we're seeing this quarter is sustainable. We're in the early stages of benefiting from the improved long-term deals with many more to come. We are favorably changing our revenue mix, and our visibility into the marketplace is more clear and very promising. This quarter proves that our underlying revenue performance continues to grow, and our operating leverage is significant. We see this momentum continuing. 
So now let's look at our total company results for the quarter. Revenues at $3.5 billion were essentially flat with the prior year despite no Super Bowl and including the impact of our new NCAA arrangement with Turner. Taken together, these 2 items lowered the revenue comparison by 10 percentage points. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, for our new NCAA contract, we only recognized revenues for the games that air on CBS. The underlying base advertising revenues for the company were up double digits for the quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up 4%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 10%. It's important to note again that these results do not reflect the impact of our new Netflix deal, which starts in Q2.
OIBDA of $576 million was up 64% from the prior year. On a reported basis, OIBDA was up 96% because of $57 million of restructuring charges recognized last year. We have also expanded our OIBDA margin for yet another quarter. The overall margin in the first quarter expanded 650 basis points to 16%, as we continue to enhance our business model with prudent programming investment, derisked contractual obligations and larger contributions from high margin recurring revenue streams. Our Q1 OIBDA margin is expected to be the lowest of the year.
Operating income more than doubled to $437 million for the quarter, once again demonstrating the company's strong operating leverage. Diluted EPS came in at $0.29 compared to $0.05 a year ago. So in addition to our operating profit strength, you can see the direct benefit of lower interest expense due to our delevering activities last year. 
Let's turn to our segments. Entertainment revenues for the quarter were $2 billion, down 4%. This decrease in revenue is due to the absence of the Super Bowl, and that I just mentioned the new way we recognized revenue for the NCAA. Together, these 2 items lowered the segment comparison by 17 points. Network advertising was up 12% for the quarter led by football. And syndication, both domestically and internationally, was strong. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $268 million, up 85% as a result of growth in high margin advertising revenues and lower cost from the revised NCAA agreement. 
Cable revenues for the quarter were $393 million, up 7%, primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases. Cable OIBDA of $153 million was up 51% for a 39% margin, which is up 12 percentage points from a year ago. The margin in Q1 is traditionally the lowest of the year, so we expect this quarter's 39% margin to expand further. As Les said, you're seeing the benefits of investing in original content, which has a higher margin than theatrical programming.
Publishing revenues of $155 million for the quarter were up 2%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong titles. Digital sales represented 18% of total revenue and more than doubled last year's first quarter. Publishing OIBDA for the quarter of $7 million was up 133%, driven by the change in the revenue mix of higher digital sales, which have lower operating costs than the traditional print business. I'd also like to point out that these results were achieved without shipping product orders during the first quarter.
Local Broadcasting revenues of $621 million were up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenues were up 4% and TV station revenues were up 1%. Three items impacted our TV station comp: the Super Bowl, political and the sale of a station last year, which combined, lowered our comparison by 11 percentage points. The fact that we showed growth despite the absence of the revenue for these related items speaks to the underlying strength of the base business. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $169 million, up 26% for the quarter. We continue to expand our margin at this segment, and you can see the effects of the restructuring activities we implemented last year during the quarter.
Outdoor revenues for the quarter were up 5% to $413 million, with the Americas up 11% on a constant-dollar basis. Occupancy rates in the U.S. are approaching historical levels, so most of the gains in the quarter came from pricing. With the continued strength in demand and the tighter inventory supply, we are now starting to really see pricing power come back into this business. OIBDA for Outdoor of $49 million increased 53% from prior year's first quarter, as we continue to focus on improving the economics of our long-term contracts.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $853 million for the quarter, up 29%. This was our second highest quarterly cash flow on record. Capital expenditures were $41 million, flat to the prior year and in line with our full year estimate. Our cash on hand at March 31 was $972 million. As Les said, during Q1, we spent $250 million on our share repurchase program. We retired 11.8 million shares at an average price of just over $21 a share. We expect to spend approximately another $250 million during the second quarter. We also extended our $2 billion credit facility through March of 2015 on more favorable terms, reducing our commitment fees as well as our borrowing spreads.
We are currently examining efficient ways to fund up our pension plan to capitalize on an attractive rate environment. More on that in the coming quarters. As you saw today, we doubled our quarterly dividends starting with the next dividend payable on July 1. We are very comfortable doing this at this time due to our enhanced visibility into our cash flow with new contracts like Comcast, like the NCAA and Netflix, just to name a few, and in our local businesses where our clients are making commitments earlier, so we have a greater lead time in our planning.
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in Q2. The key takeaway for Q2 is that the momentum's continuing. Scatter market at the network remained strong, up 40% above last year's upfront, a very positive sign heading into this year's upfront. Q2 option cancellations remain historically low, given the strength of our schedule and the robust scatter market. TV station's advertising revenues are pacing to be up low single digits even with a more difficult political comp. National advertisers are leading the way. Radio stations are pacing to be up mid-single digits led by auto and retail, both up double digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid to high single digits. 
So to wrap up, we're off to a very strong start in 2011. Our leading position as a premium content provider continues to be the key to our success. The strong advertising momentum we saw exiting Q4 of last year accelerated into Q1 and is sustaining its momentum into Q2. On top of that, visibility, particularly in our local businesses, has returned to pre-recession levels and has enhanced our confidence for those businesses.
In addition, we're very excited that our non-advertising revenue streams, such as retrans, affiliate fees, online distribution fees, are significantly adding to the recurring nature of our business and will increasingly drive the growth of our top and bottom line for many years to come. In short, every single segment of CBS is performing at very high levels. We are very pleased with what we're seeing but even more optimistic for what lies ahead. 
With that, Jay, we can open the lines for questions. Operator?"

So when you look at the Netflix and you say, gee, it's great to be in business with them, and they are terrific, and we feel that way about them, there are going to be competitors who are going to pay the same kind of dollars, and we see that across the way. Look, I don't believe that Blockbuster was bought by DISH to be a bunch of stores selling cassettes. I think they're a content place that wants our content. So the more, the merrier.

We haven't set it yet, but knowing that we are only going to replace a few shows. And we're going to look at a very solid increase. And as the marketplace evolves, we feel confident that the scatter will be strong. However, if the upfront dollars are where they should be, obviously, you'll sell more of it. It's always the risk reward factor. But any way you play the game, we're in very, very good shape. You're right. As you're sitting here, May 2, with 40% increase going on in scatter, you know when people are buying in June, they're going to be looking at that. So I think advertisers that didn't buy it at the upfront last year are kicking themselves because they are paying substantially more today than they were yesterday. How much we sell? It'll depend how much they want to pay. So it's going to be a question that we will ask. We have sold over the last 5 years anywhere from 65% to 80%. So it will be somewhere in that range."

EPS was",2670,"Thank you very much, Sumner, for that wonderful introduction. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us once again. By now, you've read our release and have seen that we had a wonderful quarter. OIBDA was up 64%, 96% on a reported basis. EPS was $0.29, up nearly 6x from the first quarter last year. Every single segment of CBS is performing at extremely high levels. In a minute, I'm going to walk you through our divisions in more detail. But I can tell you up top that in every one of our businesses, we are very pleased with what we are seeing. And heading into the rest of the year, we are looking as strong as we ever have. This quarter is also a great one because you can truly see the kind of strong fundamental performance that we are confident we will achieve going forward. We did not benefit from any one-time items or adjustments. We just generated healthy underlying growth that speaks to the strength of our businesses.
As the numbers show, we're clearly benefiting from the strategic actions we've taken to enhance and derisk our business model, including diversifying our revenue streams and managing our cost structure. Our valuable content and our ability to sell it with increasing profitability is a powerful combination that positions CBS for success, not just for the rest of this year but for many years to come. We are very encouraged by the ongoing strength of the advertising marketplace. We posted solid underlying revenue growth during the quarter. And as we look to the rest of '11 and into '12, our business continues to be very healthy, particularly given the highly favorable climate heading into this year's upfront. Scatter is still extremely hot, and pacing in our local businesses is looking very solid as well. In just the first 4 months of the year, we are already making meaningful progress towards many of the core initiatives that we emphasized at our upfront for investors in February. A major theme we discussed that day was the opportunity we have to monetize the value of our content through strategic business deals. There were some notable examples of our progress during the quarter, including our new NCAA deal with Turner Broadcasting. Our first year in this 14-year agreement was a ratings success, and it places us in a much stronger and now profitable position.
We also made significant progress in our strategy of getting paid incremental dollars for our content. This includes the deal we made with Netflix in February and more recently, a new lucrative domestic syndication deal for Hawaii Five-0. More on that later.
We continue to have great success selling our content across the company on all sorts of platforms. And because of this success and the healthy free cash flow we continue to generate and the improved visibility we have in all of our businesses, we are pleased to announce today that we've doubled our quarterly dividend to $0.10 a share. This is, of course, in addition to continuing our aggressive and significant share buyback program. Returning value to shareholders is a commitment we take very seriously, and we are pleased to deliver it even more strongly once again today. So clearly, we're in terrific shape on every front. I'm now going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights. And then I'll turn it over to Joe to go into this in more depth. And then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Starting with the results. As I said, the bottom line performance of the company was exceptional. EPS of $0.29 increased nearly six-fold from $0.05 a year ago. The success was primarily driven by our dramatic increases in OIBDA, which totaled $576 million for the quarter, up 64% and accelerating from last year. As you know, our first quarter last year included the Super Bowl, and this year it did not. Also this year, we shared revenues with Turner Broadcasting for the NCAA Tournament. Even with these factors, revenue was essentially flat at $3.5 billion, and underlying revenue growth at all of our businesses was very strong. And we are particularly pleased with our free cash flow of $853 million in the first quarter. This is up 29% year-over-year and once again was achieved without the benefit of last year's Super Bowl.
It's this healthy free cash flow and the ongoing confidence we have in our businesses that led to our dividend increase today. This increase will be comfortably paid out of the cash flow generated by all of our businesses as will our share repurchase plan that continues into the second quarter. 
During the first quarter, we purchased $250 million worth of stock and are on track to repurchase another $250 million this quarter. In all of these key financial metrics, we are very pleased to have been able to outperform during the quarter. And given the ongoing strength of our operations and the moves we made to set them up for continued success in the future, we feel very good about our ability to drive our performance throughout '11 and '12 and beyond. 
So now let's take a brief closer look at our businesses. Beginning with our Entertainment segment. The CBS Television Network continues to be number one and the only network to be up in viewers this season. We have success across the board in every genre. We have the number one scripted series, the number one drama, the number one sitcom, the number one news sitcom, the number one news magazine and the number one most-watched scripted series every single night of the week. As we look into the future, our schedule is set up to succeed for a long time. In addition to the many CBS-owned franchises we'll have returning, we've completed early renewals at good terms for a number of key shows, including The Big Bang Theory, which has been renewed until 2014. We are by far the most stable network in the business, and we are preparing to announce our new fall schedule at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. Given the success we're having right now, the bar has been set very high for new programming. Even though we'll only have a few spots to fill, I'm very pleased with the pilots I've seen so far, including some very strong projects from CBS Studios.
At the same time, primetime scatter in the second quarter is up over 40% over last year's upfront, continuing the 40% gains we have through the first quarter. So between the strength of our programming, our development and the marketplace overall, we expect to see solid double-digit increases when we sell next year's schedule a few weeks from now. 
Meanwhile, at CBS News, I'm really pleased with the progress made by Jeff Fager and David Rhodes in such a short time. These guys know how to win and have lots to build on. We just announced that we have a terrific new anchor in Scott Pelley, an extraordinary television journalist who has won multiple Peabody and Emmy Awards. Plus CBS Sunday Morning is getting ratings as good as it has in 4 years, and 60 Minutes continues to roll, finishing in the top 20 week after week. 
We were extremely pleased and proud to announce just today that this Sunday, we will have an exclusive with President Obama for his first and only interview on the killing of Osama bin Laden. I'm confident that better content will lead to improved financial results, as Jeff and David take on some of the opportunities we have in front of us in news. I'm really proud of this team.
CBS Sports is also increasing its value to our corporation all the time. Working together with Turner Broadcasting, our coverage of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament was the most watched since 2005. Higher ratings and a strong marketplace drove significantly increased sales. And given our greatly reduced cost, the tournament was profitable for us for the first time in many years. This new deal has successfully derisked our financial exposure in this marquee franchise without taking away our upside. And the good news is that we will benefit from this tremendous swing in the value of our new deal well into the next decade. Throughout the CBS Television Network and broadcast television in general, big event programming continues to pull in viewers unlike any other medium. CBS Sports coverage of the Masters last month was the second highest in a decade. And this year's Grammy broadcast in February had the biggest audience in 11 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. Broadcast television is still the best game in town. For years, some pundits have tried to say otherwise, but the dominance of broadcast remains universally acknowledged in the marketplace and is here to stay. All of this success results in increased leverage as we negotiate multiple new revenue streams for our content. As you know, retrans [retransmission] continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are very confident we'll achieve our goal of $250 million by next year. And on top of that, we are also increasingly getting paid reverse compensation from our affiliates. This is another new source of revenue that will grow for many years to come.
At the same time, we are capitalizing on all the new opportunities to get paid for CBS content by traditional and online distributors. Just last month, we sold Hawaii Five-0 to TNT at very attractive rates. Our international and domestic syndication commitments for this show are now nearly $5 million per episode, meaning that it is already extremely profitable. This is only Hawaii Five-0's first year, and it's already on its way to being another $1 billion franchise for us joining NCIS and CSI, which both remained strong on our network as well. 
Meanwhile, the Netflix deal we announced in February is going to generate hundreds of millions of new dollars as well. Once again, the contract in the Netflix deal is for programming that we've already sold elsewhere, meaning it's not cutting into lucrative first and second month syndication dollars. Meaningful revenue from the Netflix deal will kick in beginning in the second quarter. Plus the Netflix deal is U.S. only and non-exclusive. So not only can we sell this program again domestically, but we will also look to sell the same content online internationally as well. And with competition for Netflix growing all the time, there is a great possibility that several new prudent deals are on the horizon.
Another one of the key ways we're getting paid for our premium content is at CBS Interactive. This division turned in a strong first quarter as well. During the quarter, we brought in a terrific new leader for CBS Interactive in Jim Lanzone. Jim is first and foremost a product guy and is busy working on improving our content across the division. We expect great things from Interactive going forward under Jim's leadership. 
Moving to our Cable segment, we continue to see growth in both rates and subscriptions at Showtime and the CBS Sports Network. Showtime leads the way with subs up considerably year-over-year, now totaling above 20 million subscribers. Original programming continues to drive Showtime's growth. Our new drama, The Borgias, debuted earlier this month and delivered the best ratings for a new drama series in 7 years and has already been picked up for a second season.
We are looking forward to new seasons of Shameless, The Big C, Weeds and Dexter as well as a number of new shows. Our investment in original content and our reduced cost for theatricals have greatly expanded our margins in Cable Networks, something you can really see in our results today.
Our Publishing business also performed strongly on the back of great content. Simon & Schuster had 61 New York Times bestsellers during the quarter and won this year's general nonfiction Pulitzer for The Emperor of All Maladies. E-books are growing at a much more rapid pace now, which is good news for us due to the improved cost structure. First quarter digital sales of $28 million were up 148% over last year, representing our highest quarterly performance to date. Just like in our other businesses, as Publishing continues to evolve, we feel good about our ability to monetize our content however our audience wants to consume it.
Now turning to Local Broadcasting. During the quarter, we drove increasing revenues at our TV stations, CBS Radio and the segment as a whole, again despite no Super Bowl and virtually no political advertising. In fact, revenue from the NFL alone was actually up at our TV stations versus a year ago with the Super Bowl. And to be up in an odd numbered year without political advertising is extremely unusual. The momentum continues to be broad-based. We're selling into this improved advertising marketplace with higher ratings in many of our key major markets. In February, all 16 of our CBS Television Stations ranked number one or number two in primetime and late local news. And the weekly newscast, weekday newscast here in New York at CBS 2 at 11 [CBS 2 News at 11PM] was the most-watched late news in the country. This is the first time since the Winter Olympics in 1994 that WCBS has finished number one in sweeps. And in Radio, 7 of our top 10 markets gained rating shares during the quarter. We're very encouraged by our ability to sell these ratings going forward with second quarter pacings looking solid at our TV and radio stations led once again by major markets.
In addition, we are aggressively looking to grow the overall revenue pie in our Local Broadcasting segment. We have rolled out plans for digital subchannels that will leverage local TV and radio programming, as well as content from our new local websites. We'll start by launching these subchannels in New York and L.A. during the third quarter. 
Meanwhile, our major market local websites continue to show growth month after month. CBS local websites ranked number one in total minutes spent each month in the quarter, beating out other regional sites in the category, including Yelp, Yahoo! Local and MSN Local. 
Our momentum continued at Outdoor as well, and we're now seeing the benefits of our renegotiated trends and contracts in New York and Washington, D.C. Second quarter pacing for Outdoor is rising with U.S. occupancy and rates up considerably over a year ago. In addition, as the marketplace has recovered, we've been strategically continuing our digital buildout. We're pursuing high-profile installations in major markets while still staying well within the CapEx range we've been giving you.
So you can see we're pretty excited. Across the board, our businesses are performing exceptionally well, both financially and operationally. We have begun 2011 with strong momentum. And there are many, many reasons why we're confident our momentum will continue throughout the year and into '12 and '13 as well. CBS Studios is building new hits all the time, and the first-place CBS Television Network provides an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. No matter which new platforms come along, advertisers continues to covet the kind of big-ticket programming that we have on CBS. 
At the same time, we're successfully expanding and diversifying our non-advertising revenue sources. The local ad marketplace continues to grow with major markets like ours leading the way. We're holding down costs and finding every opportunity to enter into better deals all the time. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders, including the significant increase in our dividend which we announced today.
It's clearly a very good time to be an investor in CBS, and we have every reason to believe it will be for a long, long time. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will provide you more detail on the results for the quarter and update you on what we're seeing in Q2. But before I walk you through our strong results, I want to point out that we're confident that the performance we're seeing this quarter is sustainable. We're in the early stages of benefiting from the improved long-term deals with many more to come. We are favorably changing our revenue mix, and our visibility into the marketplace is more clear and very promising. This quarter proves that our underlying revenue performance continues to grow, and our operating leverage is significant. We see this momentum continuing. 
So now let's look at our total company results for the quarter. Revenues at $3.5 billion were essentially flat with the prior year despite no Super Bowl and including the impact of our new NCAA arrangement with Turner. Taken together, these 2 items lowered the revenue comparison by 10 percentage points. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, for our new NCAA contract, we only recognized revenues for the games that air on CBS. The underlying base advertising revenues for the company were up double digits for the quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up 4%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 10%. It's important to note again that these results do not reflect the impact of our new Netflix deal, which starts in Q2.
OIBDA of $576 million was up 64% from the prior year. On a reported basis, OIBDA was up 96% because of $57 million of restructuring charges recognized last year. We have also expanded our OIBDA margin for yet another quarter. The overall margin in the first quarter expanded 650 basis points to 16%, as we continue to enhance our business model with prudent programming investment, derisked contractual obligations and larger contributions from high margin recurring revenue streams. Our Q1 OIBDA margin is expected to be the lowest of the year.
Operating income more than doubled to $437 million for the quarter, once again demonstrating the company's strong operating leverage. Diluted EPS came in at $0.29 compared to $0.05 a year ago. So in addition to our operating profit strength, you can see the direct benefit of lower interest expense due to our delevering activities last year. 
Let's turn to our segments. Entertainment revenues for the quarter were $2 billion, down 4%. This decrease in revenue is due to the absence of the Super Bowl, and that I just mentioned the new way we recognized revenue for the NCAA. Together, these 2 items lowered the segment comparison by 17 points. Network advertising was up 12% for the quarter led by football. And syndication, both domestically and internationally, was strong. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $268 million, up 85% as a result of growth in high margin advertising revenues and lower cost from the revised NCAA agreement. 
Cable revenues for the quarter were $393 million, up 7%, primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases. Cable OIBDA of $153 million was up 51% for a 39% margin, which is up 12 percentage points from a year ago. The margin in Q1 is traditionally the lowest of the year, so we expect this quarter's 39% margin to expand further. As Les said, you're seeing the benefits of investing in original content, which has a higher margin than theatrical programming.
Publishing revenues of $155 million for the quarter were up 2%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong titles. Digital sales represented 18% of total revenue and more than doubled last year's first quarter. Publishing OIBDA for the quarter of $7 million was up 133%, driven by the change in the revenue mix of higher digital sales, which have lower operating costs than the traditional print business. I'd also like to point out that these results were achieved without shipping product orders during the first quarter.
Local Broadcasting revenues of $621 million were up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenues were up 4% and TV station revenues were up 1%. Three items impacted our TV station comp: the Super Bowl, political and the sale of a station last year, which combined, lowered our comparison by 11 percentage points. The fact that we showed growth despite the absence of the revenue for these related items speaks to the underlying strength of the base business. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $169 million, up 26% for the quarter. We continue to expand our margin at this segment, and you can see the effects of the restructuring activities we implemented last year during the quarter.
Outdoor revenues for the quarter were up 5% to $413 million, with the Americas up 11% on a constant-dollar basis. Occupancy rates in the U.S. are approaching historical levels, so most of the gains in the quarter came from pricing. With the continued strength in demand and the tighter inventory supply, we are now starting to really see pricing power come back into this business. OIBDA for Outdoor of $49 million increased 53% from prior year's first quarter, as we continue to focus on improving the economics of our long-term contracts.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $853 million for the quarter, up 29%. This was our second highest quarterly cash flow on record. Capital expenditures were $41 million, flat to the prior year and in line with our full year estimate. Our cash on hand at March 31 was $972 million. As Les said, during Q1, we spent $250 million on our share repurchase program. We retired 11.8 million shares at an average price of just over $21 a share. We expect to spend approximately another $250 million during the second quarter. We also extended our $2 billion credit facility through March of 2015 on more favorable terms, reducing our commitment fees as well as our borrowing spreads.
We are currently examining efficient ways to fund up our pension plan to capitalize on an attractive rate environment. More on that in the coming quarters. As you saw today, we doubled our quarterly dividends starting with the next dividend payable on July 1. We are very comfortable doing this at this time due to our enhanced visibility into our cash flow with new contracts like Comcast, like the NCAA and Netflix, just to name a few, and in our local businesses where our clients are making commitments earlier, so we have a greater lead time in our planning.
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in Q2. The key takeaway for Q2 is that the momentum's continuing. Scatter market at the network remained strong, up 40% above last year's upfront, a very positive sign heading into this year's upfront. Q2 option cancellations remain historically low, given the strength of our schedule and the robust scatter market. TV station's advertising revenues are pacing to be up low single digits even with a more difficult political comp. National advertisers are leading the way. Radio stations are pacing to be up mid-single digits led by auto and retail, both up double digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid to high single digits. 
So to wrap up, we're off to a very strong start in 2011. Our leading position as a premium content provider continues to be the key to our success. The strong advertising momentum we saw exiting Q4 of last year accelerated into Q1 and is sustaining its momentum into Q2. On top of that, visibility, particularly in our local businesses, has returned to pre-recession levels and has enhanced our confidence for those businesses.
In addition, we're very excited that our non-advertising revenue streams, such as retrans, affiliate fees, online distribution fees, are significantly adding to the recurring nature of our business and will increasingly drive the growth of our top and bottom line for many years to come. In short, every single segment of CBS is performing at very high levels. We are very pleased with what we're seeing but even more optimistic for what lies ahead. 
With that, Jay, we can open the lines for questions. Operator?"

As you're sitting here, May 2, with 40% increase going on in scatter, you know when people are buying in June, they're going to be looking at that. So I think advertisers that didn't buy it at the upfront last year are kicking themselves because they are paying substantially more today than they were yesterday. How much we sell? It'll depend how much they want to pay. So it's going to be a question that we will ask. We have sold over the last 5 years anywhere from 65% to 80%. So it will be somewhere in that range."

By now, you've read our release and have seen that we had a wonderful quarter. OIBDA was up 64%, 96% on a reported basis. EPS was $0.29, up nearly 6x from the first quarter last year. Every single segment of CBS is performing at extremely high levels. In a minute, I'm going to walk you through our divisions in more detail. But I can tell you up top that in every one of our businesses, we are very pleased with what we are seeing. And heading into the rest of the year, we are looking as strong as we ever have. 
This quarter is also a great one because you can truly see the kind of strong fundamental performance that we are confident we will achieve going forward. We did not benefit from any one-time items or adjustments. We just generated healthy underlying growth that speaks to the strength of our businesses. As the numbers show, we're clearly benefiting from the strategic actions we've taken to enhance and derisk our business model, including diversifying our revenue streams and managing our cost structure. Our valuable content and our ability to sell it with increasing profitability is a powerful combination that positions CBS for success, not just for the rest of this year but for many years to come.
We are very encouraged by the ongoing strength of the advertising marketplace. We posted solid underlying revenue growth during the quarter. And as we look to the rest of '11 and into '12, our business continues to be very healthy, particularly given the highly favorable climate heading into this year's upfront. 
Scatter is still extremely hot, and pacing in our local businesses is looking very solid as well. In just the first 4 months of the year, we are already making meaningful progress towards many of the core initiatives that we emphasized at our upfront for investors in February. 
A major theme we discussed that day was the opportunity we have to monetize the value of our content through strategic business deals. There were some notable examples of our progress during the quarter, including our new NCAA deal with Turner Broadcasting. Our first year in this 14-year agreement was a ratings success, and it places us in a much stronger and now profitable position.
We also made significant progress in our strategy of getting paid incremental dollars for our content. This includes the deal we made with Netflix in February and more recently, a new lucrative domestic syndication deal for Hawaii Five-0. More on that later. 
We continue to have great success selling our content across the company on all sorts of platforms. And because of this success and the healthy free cash flow we continue to generate and the improved visibility we have in all of our businesses, we are pleased to announce today that we've doubled our quarterly dividend to $0.10 a share. This is, of course, in addition to continuing our aggressive and significant share buyback program. Returning value to shareholders is a commitment we take very seriously, and we are pleased to deliver it even more strongly once again today. So clearly, we're in terrific shape on every front. 
I'm now going to spend a few minutes to walk you through our financial and operational highlights. And then I'll turn it over to Joe to go into this in more depth. And then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. 
Starting with the results. As I said, the bottom line performance of the company was exceptional. EPS of $0.29 increased nearly six-fold from $0.05 a year ago. The success was primarily driven by our dramatic increases in OIBDA, which totaled $576 million for the quarter, up 64% and accelerating from last year. As you know, our first quarter last year included the Super Bowl, and this year it did not. Also this year, we shared revenues with Turner Broadcasting for the NCAA Tournament. Even with these factors, revenue was essentially flat at $3.5 billion, and underlying revenue growth at all of our businesses was very strong. 
And we are particularly pleased with our free cash flow of $853 million in the first quarter. This is up 29% year-over-year and once again was achieved without the benefit of last year's Super Bowl. It's this healthy free cash flow and the ongoing confidence we have in our businesses that led to our dividend increase today. This increase will be comfortably paid out of the cash flow generated by all of our businesses as will our share repurchase plan that continues into the second quarter. 
During the first quarter, we purchased $250 million worth of stock and are on track to repurchase another $250 million this quarter. In all of these key financial metrics, we are very pleased to have been able to outperform during the quarter. And given the ongoing strength of our operations and the moves we made to set them up for continued success in the future, we feel very good about our ability to drive our performance throughout '11 and '12 and beyond. 
So now let's take a brief closer look at our businesses. Beginning with our Entertainment segment. The CBS Television Network continues to be number one and the only network to be up in viewers this season. We have success across the board in every genre. We have the number one scripted series, the number one drama, the number one sitcom, the number one news sitcom, the number one news magazine and the number one most-watched scripted series every single night of the week. 
As we look into the future, our schedule is set up to succeed for a long time. In addition to the many CBS-owned franchises we'll have returning, we've completed early renewals at good terms for a number of key shows, including The Big Bang Theory, which has been renewed until 2014. We are by far the most stable network in the business, and we are preparing to announce our new fall schedule at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. 
Given the success we're having right now, the bar has been set very high for new programming. Even though we'll only have a few spots to fill, I'm very pleased with the pilots I've seen so far, including some very strong projects from CBS Studios. At the same time, primetime scatter in the second quarter is up over 40% over last year's upfront, continuing the 40% gains we have through the first quarter. So between the strength of our programming, our development and the marketplace overall, we expect to see solid double-digit increases when we sell next year's schedule a few weeks from now. 
Meanwhile, at CBS News, I'm really pleased with the progress made by Jeff Fager and David Rhodes in such a short time. These guys know how to win and have lots to build on. We just announced that we have a terrific new anchor in Scott Pelley, an extraordinary television journalist who has won multiple Peabody and Emmy Awards. Plus CBS Sunday Morning is getting ratings as good as it has in 4 years, and 60 Minutes continues to roll, finishing in the top 20 week after week. 
We were extremely pleased and proud to announce just today that this Sunday, we will have an exclusive with President Obama for his first and only interview on the killing of Osama bin Laden. I'm confident that better content will lead to improved financial results, as Jeff and David take on some of the opportunities we have in front of us in news. I'm really proud of this team. 
CBS Sports is also increasing its value to our corporation all the time. Working together with Turner Broadcasting, our coverage of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament was the most watched since 2005. Higher ratings and a strong marketplace drove significantly increased sales. And given our greatly reduced cost, the tournament was profitable for us for the first time in many years. This new deal has successfully derisked our financial exposure in this marquee franchise without taking away our upside. And the good news is that we will benefit from this tremendous swing in the value of our new deal well into the next decade. 
Throughout the CBS Television Network and broadcast television in general, big event programming continues to pull in viewers unlike any other medium. CBS Sports coverage of the Masters last month was the second highest in a decade. And this year's Grammy broadcast in February had the biggest audience in 11 years with more than 26.5 million viewers. 
Broadcast television is still the best game in town. For years, some pundits have tried to say otherwise, but the dominance of broadcast remains universally acknowledged in the marketplace and is here to stay. All of this success results in increased leverage as we negotiate multiple new revenue streams for our content. 
As you know, retrans [retransmission] continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are very confident we'll achieve our goal of $250 million by next year. And on top of that, we are also increasingly getting paid reverse compensation from our affiliates. This is another new source of revenue that will grow for many years to come. At the same time, we are capitalizing on all the new opportunities to get paid for CBS content by traditional and online distributors. 
Just last month, we sold Hawaii Five-0 to TNT at very attractive rates. Our international and domestic syndication commitments for this show are now nearly $5 million per episode, meaning that it is already extremely profitable. This is only Hawaii Five-0's first year, and it's already on its way to being another $1 billion franchise for us joining NCIS and CSI, which both remain strong on our network as well.
Meanwhile, the Netflix deal we announced in February is going to generate hundreds of millions of new dollars as well. Once again, the content in the Netflix deal is for programming that we've already sold elsewhere, meaning it's not cutting into lucrative first and second month syndication dollars. Meaningful revenue from the Netflix deal will kick in beginning in the second quarter. Plus the Netflix deal is U.S. only and non-exclusive. So not only can we sell this programming again domestically, but we will also look to sell the same content online internationally as well. And with competition for Netflix growing all the time, there is a great possibility that several new prudent deals are on the horizon. 
Another one of the key ways we're getting paid for our premium content is at CBS Interactive. This division turned in a strong first quarter as well. During the quarter, we brought in a terrific new leader for CBS Interactive in Jim Lanzone. Jim is first and foremost a product guy and is busy working on improving our content across the division. We expect great things from Interactive going forward under Jim's leadership. 
Moving to our Cable segment, we continue to see growth in both rates and subscriptions at Showtime and the CBS Sports Network. Showtime leads the way with subs up considerably year-over-year, now totaling above 20 million subscribers. 
Original programming continues to drive Showtime's growth. Our new drama, The Borgias, debuted earlier this month and delivered the best ratings for a new drama series in 7 years and has already been picked up for a second season. We are looking forward to new seasons of Shameless, The Big C, Weeds and Dexter as well as a number of new shows. 
Our investment in original content and our reduced cost for theatricals have greatly expanded our margins in Cable Networks, something you can really see in our results today. Our Publishing business also performed strongly on the back of great content. Simon & Schuster had 61 New York Times bestsellers during the quarter and won this year's general nonfiction Pulitzer for The Emperor of All Maladies. E-books are growing at a much more rapid pace now, which is good news for us due to the improved cost structure. 
First quarter digital sales of $28 million were up 148% over last year, representing our highest quarterly performance to date. Just like in our other businesses, as Publishing continues to evolve, we feel good about our ability to monetize our content however our audience wants to consume it. Now turning to Local Broadcasting. During the quarter, we drove increasing revenues at our TV stations, CBS Radio and the segment as a whole, again despite no Super Bowl and virtually no political advertising. In fact, revenue from the NFL alone was actually up at our TV stations versus a year ago with the Super Bowl. And to be up in an odd numbered year without political advertising is extremely unusual. 
The momentum continues to be broad-based. We're selling into this improved advertising marketplace with higher ratings in many of our key major markets. In February, all 16 of our CBS Television Stations ranked number one or number two in primetime and late local news. And the weekly newscast, weekday newscast here in New York at CBS 2 at 11 [CBS 2 News at 11PM] was the most-watched late news in the country. This is the first time since the Winter Olympics in 1994 that WCBS has finished number one in sweeps. And in Radio, 7 of our top 10 markets gained rating shares during the quarter. We're very encouraged by our ability to sell these ratings going forward with second quarter pacings looking solid at our TV and radio stations led once again by major markets. 
In addition, we are aggressively looking to grow the overall revenue pie in our Local Broadcasting segment. We have rolled out plans for digital subchannels that will leverage local TV and radio programming, as well as content from our new local websites. We'll start by launching these subchannels in New York and L. A. during the third quarter. 
Meanwhile, our major market local websites continue to show growth month after month. CBS local websites ranked number one in total minutes spent each month in the quarter, beating out other regional sites in the category, including Yelp, Yahoo! Local and MSN Local. Our momentum continued at Outdoor as well, and we're now seeing the benefits of our renegotiated trends and contracts in New York and Washington, D. C. Second quarter pacing for Outdoor is rising with U.S. occupancy and rates up considerably over a year ago. 
In addition, as the marketplace has recovered, we've been strategically continuing our digital buildout. We're pursuing high-profile installations in major markets while still staying well within the CapEx range we've been giving you. 
So you can see we're pretty excited. Across the board, our businesses are performing exceptionally well, both financially and operationally. We have begun 2011 with strong momentum. And there are many, many reasons why we're confident our momentum will continue throughout the year and into '12 and '13 as well. 
CBS Studios is building new hits all the time, and the first-place CBS Television Network provides an unparalleled platform to launch new ones. No matter which new platforms come along, advertisers continues to covet the kind of big-ticket programming that we have on CBS. At the same time, we're successfully expanding and diversifying our non-advertising revenue sources. The local ad marketplace continues to grow with major markets like ours leading the way. We're holding down costs and finding every opportunity to enter into better deals all the time. Plus, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we're delivering on our promise to return more value to shareholders, including the significant increase in our dividend which we announced today. 
It's clearly a very good time to be an investor in CBS, and we have every reason to believe it will be for a long, long time. Thank you very much. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will provide you more detail on the results for the quarter and update you on what we're seeing in Q2. But before I walk you through our strong results, I want to point out that we're confident that the performance we're seeing this quarter is sustainable. We're in the early stages of benefiting from the improved long-term deals with many more to come. We are favorably changing our revenue mix, and our visibility into the marketplace is more clear and very promising. This quarter proves that our underlying revenue performance continues to grow, and our operating leverage is significant. We see this momentum continuing. 
So now let's look at our total company results for the quarter. Revenues at $3.5 billion were essentially flat with the prior year despite no Super Bowl and including the impact of our new NCAA arrangement with Turner. Taken together, these 2 items lowered the revenue comparison by 10 percentage points. 
As we mentioned on last quarter's call, for our new NCAA contract, we only recognize revenues for the games that air on CBS. The underlying base advertising revenues for the company were up double digits for the quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up 4%, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 10%. It's important to note again that these results do not reflect the impact of our new Netflix deal, which starts in Q2. 
OIBDA of $576 million was up 64% from the prior year. On a reported basis, OIBDA was up 96% because of $57 million of restructuring charges recognized last year. We have also expanded our OIBDA margin for yet another quarter. The overall margin in the first quarter expanded 650 basis points to 16%, as we continue to enhance our business model with prudent programming investment, derisked contractual obligations and larger contributions from high margin recurring revenue streams. Our Q1 OIBDA margin is expected to be the lowest of the year. 
Operating income more than doubled to $437 million for the quarter, once again demonstrating the company's strong operating leverage. Diluted EPS came in at $0.29 compared to $0.05 a year ago. So in addition to our operating profit strength, you can see the direct benefit of lower interest expense due to our delevering activities last year. 
Let's turn to our segments. Entertainment revenues for the quarter were $2 billion, down 4%. This decrease in revenue is due to the absence of the Super Bowl and, as I just mentioned, the new way we recognize revenue for the NCAA. Together, these 2 items lowered the segment comparison by 17 points. 
Network advertising was up 12% for the quarter led by football. And syndication, both domestically and internationally, was strong. 
OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $268 million, up 85% as a result of growth in high margin advertising revenues and lower cost from the revised NCAA agreement. Cable revenues for the quarter were $393 million, up 7%, primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases. Cable OIBDA of $153 million was up 51% for a 39% margin, which is up 12 percentage points from a year ago. The margin in Q1 is traditionally the lowest of the year, so we expect this quarter's 39% margin to expand further. As Les said, you're seeing the benefits of investing in original content, which has a higher margin than theatrical programming. 
Publishing revenues of $155 million for the quarter were up 2%, driven by higher digital content sales, as well as strong titles. Digital sales represented 18% of total revenue and more than doubled last year's first quarter. Publishing OIBDA for the quarter of $7 million was up 133%, driven by the change in the revenue mix of higher digital sales, which have lower operating costs than the traditional print business. I'd also like to point out that these results were achieved without shipping product orders during the first quarter. 
Local Broadcasting revenues of $621 million were up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenues were up 4% and TV station revenues were up 1%. Three items impacted our TV station comp: the Super Bowl, political and the sale of a station last year, which combined, lowered our comparison by 11 percentage points. The fact that we showed growth despite the absence of the revenue for these related items speaks to the underlying strength of the base business. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $169 million, up 26% for the quarter. 
We continue to expand our margin at this segment, and you can see the effects of the restructuring activities we implemented last year during the quarter. Outdoor revenues for the quarter were up 5% to $413 million, with the Americas up 11% on a constant-dollar basis. Occupancy rates in the U.S. are approaching historical levels, so most of the gains in the quarter came from pricing. With the continued strength in demand and the tighter inventory supply, we are now starting to really see pricing power come back into this business. OIBDA for Outdoor of $49 million increased 53% from prior year's first quarter, as we continue to focus on improving the economics of our long-term contracts. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow came in at $853 million for the quarter, up 29%. This was our second highest quarterly cash flow on record. Capital expenditures were $41 million, flat to the prior year and in line with our full year estimate. Our cash on hand at March 31 was $972 million. As Les said, during Q1, we spent $250 million on our share repurchase program. We retired 11.8 million shares at an average price of just over $21 a share. We expect to spend approximately another $250 million during the second quarter. We also extended our $2 billion credit facility through March of 2015 on more favorable terms, reducing our commitment fees as well as our borrowing spreads. 
We are currently examining efficient ways to fund up our pension plan to capitalize on an attractive rate environment. More on that in the coming quarters. As you saw today, we doubled our quarterly dividends starting with the next dividend payable on July 1. We are very comfortable doing this at this time due to our enhanced visibility into our cash flow with new contracts like Comcast, like the NCAA and Netflix, just to name a few, and in our local businesses where our clients are making commitments earlier, so we have a greater lead time in our planning. 
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in Q2. The key takeaway for Q2 is that the momentum's continuing. Scatter market at the network remained strong, up 40% above last year's upfront, a very positive sign heading into this year's upfront. Q2 option cancellations remain historically low, given the strength of our schedule and the robust scatter market. TV station's advertising revenues are pacing to be up low single digits even with a more difficult political comp. National advertisers are leading the way. Radio stations are pacing to be up mid-single digits led by auto and retail, both up double digits. Our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid to high single digits. 
So to wrap up, we're off to a very strong start in 2011. Our leading position as a premium content provider continues to be the key to our success. The strong advertising momentum we saw exiting Q4 of last year accelerated into Q1 and is sustaining its momentum into Q2. On top of that, visibility, particularly in our local businesses, has returned to pre-recession levels and has enhanced our confidence for those businesses. In addition, we're very excited that our non-advertising revenue streams, such as retrans, affiliate fees, online distribution fees, are significantly adding to the recurring nature of our business and will increasingly drive the growth of our top and bottom line for many years to come. 
In short, every single segment of CBS is performing at very high levels. We are very pleased with what we're seeing but even more optimistic for what lies ahead. 
With that, Jay, we can open the lines for questions. Operator?"

So when you look at a Netflix and you say, ""Gee, it's great to be in business with them, and they are terrific,"" and we feel that way about them, there are going to be competitors who are going to pay the same kind of dollars, and we see that across the way.

And as the marketplace evolves, we feel confident that the scatter will be strong. However, if the upfront dollars are where they should be, obviously, you'll sell more of it. It's always the risk reward factor. But any way you play the game, we're in very, very good shape. You're right. As you're sitting here, May 2, with 40% increase going on in scatter, you know when people are buying in June, they're going to be looking at that. So I think advertisers that didn't buy it at the upfront last year are kicking themselves because they are paying substantially more today than they were yesterday. How much we sell? It'll depend how much they want to pay. So it's going to be a question that we will ask. We have sold over the last 5 years anywhere from 65% to 80%. So it will be somewhere in that range."

I thank you today. CBS's second quarter performance was absolutely terrific. Our results which fill up a remarkable first quarter demonstrate one more time that our company is operating from a position of strength, world-class and at the very top of this game. Most important, we continue to demand a premium across every distribution platform. Our success is the long-term strategy -- to revenue in diverse ways, to manage our expenses, to deliver healthy profits and to create value by returning cash to shareholders. 
And in the second quarter, CBS achieved all of that even more. As you know, strategy more than that, and even management can execute that strategy. We are fortunate to have an executive in charge of CBS with the greatest and management team in that. And as a result, CBS keeps just getting better and stronger as we are more confident that we are poised to achieve greater heights in the years to come. 
And with that, to tell you more about the stronger second quarter performance, I'll turn the call over to my friend and colleague, CBS President.

We do indeed thank you for joining us once again today. Yes, it's been a very interesting day. It's been a very interesting week. There are certain things we can't control like what goes on in Washington, but we can control what we do at CBS. And nonetheless, despite what may have happened, we are very pleased to share our exceptional second quarter results with you today. 
Across every key financial metric, we turned in a stellar performance and the numbers speak for themselves. Despite a lack of political dollars, tough comps and some challenging macro economic factors, revenue was up 8%. OIBDA was up 51% and diluted EPS was up 164%. We achieved these results thanks to strong performances from our business units across the board. National and local, content and distribution, our operations continue to produce solid growth and increasing profits. We also achieved these results by doing exactly what we said we were going to do at our Analyst Day earlier this year. At that event, we laid out some of the most exciting areas of growth for our company that you may not have even be aware of. Let's take a minute to look at how we're delivering on these opportunities since our last call.
First, we said we will drive revenue and profit growth not just from traditional sources but increasingly from emerging platforms as well. So building on the Netflix deal we signed in the first quarter, we entered into a nonexclusive licensing agreement with Amazon a few weeks ago. This deal is another example of how we are capitalizing on the value of our content by selling into new distributors without taking away from established revenue streams. New entrants are coming into the marketplace all the time and we will look to negotiate additional prudent online distribution deals going forward. 
Next, we also emphasize that the demand for CBS content has never been stronger overseas. During the quarter, we screened our new shows to the international television buying community, leading to increased sales of our programming around the world. And just last week, we announced the new separate nonexclusive agreement with Netflix international to stream our programming in Latin America and Canada. International expansion is a key strategic growth area for our company, and this deal represents a significant step in that process. 
Please remember, neither the Amazon deal nor the Netflix international deal is reflected in this past quarter that was so excellent. We also walked you through a number of structural changes happening in the industry that are allowing us to derisk our business model and diversify our revenue base with additional nonadvertising sources. These include growing retransmission fees, reverse compensation from our affiliates and the great upside we have in our local media businesses. We continue to move forward on all of these initiatives, generating increasing revenues from each of them all the time.
As we discussed at the Analyst Day, these opportunities have significant room for long-term growth and we're making solid headway on each of them right now. Due to our success, CBS is a fundamentally different company today than we were just a few years ago, and the benefits of these fundamental changes to our business model are clearly coming through in our results and our investors have benefited as well. So let me discuss our exceptional results now. Then I'll point out some highlights from our businesses before I turn it over to Joe for more details. After that, we'll be happy to take your questions.
As I pointed out earlier, CBS's bottom line performance was extremely strong. Diluted EPS well more than doubled to $0.58 for the quarter. That's up from $0.22 a year ago and is just below record levels. OIBDA increased to $873 million, up 51% as every single one of our operating segments turned in strong profit growth. Just like with EPS, our OIBDA performance was also near record levels for the quarter, just shy of the company's all-time high. Plus, our second quarter margin of 24% was up 7 points from last year's quarter. 
We continue to manage our expenses closely, and as a result, our revenue growth is translating into near-record profit levels across the board. Meanwhile, revenue grew solidly to up 8% to $3.6 billion for the quarter. Once again, this was achieved despite difficult comparisons to last year, which included significant political dollars. We also generated very healthy levels of free cash flow up 32% for the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion is up 30% and represents a record for our company. Our strong free cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver on our commitment to create value for CBS shareholders. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 250 million of CBS stock and doubled our quarterly dividend payment to $0.10 per share. At the heart of all the success is great content. Our content is performing extremely well, and we are increasingly distributing it in the most profitable ways with new possibilities opening up all the time. 
Let's take a closer look at our businesses starting with our largest operating segment, Entertainment. During the quarter, the CBS Television Network ended the 2010 11th season as America's most-watched network for the eighth time in the past 9 years. We had the number 1 scripted series in NCIS, the number 1 comedy in the Big Bang theory and the number 1 news magazine in 60 Minutes. We also had more time period winning programs than any of the network and the number 1 scripted series every single night of the week. 
Looking ahead, we are confident that our primetime lineup is only getting stronger. We had only very few spots to fill, and we've added 5 new series the next fall that are the best of the best. We ended the season with scatter pricing up 40%, which carried us into this year's upfront marketplace with remarkable strength. In the upfront, we once again led the way in total dollars and rate increases, which were up in the midteens, setting us up for strong revenue growth in 2012. At the same time, continue to benefit from big event broadcast television, including our new long-term agreements for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament , which paid off very well for us in the second quarter. 
In addition, during the quarter, we signed a new deal to broadcast the Grammys for another decade on more favorable financial terms, and we also have the Southeastern conference, the SEC, considered by most to be the most valuable college football conference locked up for 12 more years. These long-term deals will benefit for a long, long time. Events like these pull together audiences only found on broadcast television and also drives social media usage like nothing else can, making them all the more valuable.
And needless to say, we're very pleased that the NFL has negotiated a new long-term agreement with its players. We remained optimistic throughout this process and are now getting ready for another terrific season of football and all that goes along with that. The teams and owners are happy. The players are happy. The network is happy. our 7 AFC ONOs are happy. The affiliates are happy and, most of all, our audience is happy. So this is a very good thing. 
At CBS News, with our new management team, is making terrific progress as well. The evening news with Scott Pelley is off to a very good start. We added more than 0.25 million viewers in the program's first 2 weeks on the air and our focus is continue this momentum as we work to showcase the very best in broadcast journalism across the organization.
Moving to our cable segment, where we also continue to grow. Showtime, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian all delivered increases in both rates and subscription. Showtime subs totaled $20.5 million at the end of the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Showtime steady stream of original series is filling our success and we expect to build on this with returning favorites like The Big C, Weeds, and Dexter, as well as the some of our promising new shows coming in the fall, including House of Lies and Homeland. Showtime is also benefiting from higher international syndication and Home Entertainment revenues as the demand for programming continues to increase around the world. So just as we do with our network programming, we are generating incremental dollars in cable by selling our premium content over and over again. 
Our Publishing division, Simon & Schuster is embracing digital distribution as effectively as any of the businesses in our Content group. Digital sales more than doubled year-over-year, and given the improved profitability of e-books, our OIBDA results were very strong. Once again, it's about delivering great content. So far this year, we've had 126 books of the New York Times bestseller list, and including the recent success of The Greater Journey by David McCullough, and looking ahead, we're already seeing strong sales of JC, A Stolen Life, which set a new Simon & Schuster record for one-day e-book sales on its debut and sold 240,000 digital copies in its first 2 weeks. 
Moving to our Local group, as you know, TV stations space tremendous pressures in odd years due to comparisons with political years. 2010 was an extremely strong political year for us, and despite that, we were still up in our Local Broadcasting segment this quarter with growth at both our TV stations and at Radio. Going forward, we expect political advertising will begin to pick up toward the end of the year, and as we've been seeing these past few weeks, the 2012 political season is already underway. And next year, as we've seen just in the past few days, promises to be another big one in terms of political revenue.
Also, TV stations were up despite a temporary slowdown in Japanese auto spending. as this spending comes back, we feel very good about this key category going forward. Because of these factors, we're confident that we will be able to successfully manage our Local Broadcasting businesses for continued growth just as we did in the second quarter. 
Finally, our after business is growing at a strong pace too. This segment is increasingly benefiting from newly restructured contract, and with capital costs going down, we're building out digital displays, which are a high-growth area. We are also benefiting from high occupancy levels and further pricing improvements. The wild door has a very good story as well.
As you can see across every segment of our company, CBS's second performance was extraordinary. Our content continues to fuel new and growing revenue on every platform, proving that hit programming is more valuable than it has ever been. In capitalizing on this trend, we're delivering on our promise to diversify and derisk our business model driving earnings to near-record levels. We're also managing our expenses closely in every one of our businesses to ensure that more and more revenues falling to the bottom line. Plus, our balance sheet has never been stronger and we continue to reap the benefit of the debt actions we've taken to reduce interest costs.
Finally, we are delivering on our promise to return free cash flow to shareholders through ongoing share repurchases and increased dividends. Enhancing shareholder value is a commitment that we will continue to fulfill quarter in and quarter out. So once again, it was a rough day, but our quarter was great with high single-digit revenue growth, 50-plus percent OIBDA growth and 100-plus percent EPS growth. Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased with our performance. We continued to command a very desirable competitive position that we have every reason to believe that we deliver strong results throughout the rest of the year into 2012 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"

Today, I will provide some more detail on the results for the quarter, then update you on what we see ahead. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter. This was a very strong, clean and straightf",1095,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide some more detail on the results for the quarter, then update you on what we see ahead. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter. This was a very strong, clean and straightforward quarter. There were no adjustments made to reported results for the quarter. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 8% from the prior year. Advertising revenue grew 3% despite the difficult comparisons for political advertising and the shared revenues with Turner on our new NCAA agreement. Content licensing and distribution revenue was up 21%, driven by the early benefit of our new domestic Netflix agreement. 
Affiliate and subscription fees were up 12%, benefiting from ongoing growth in cable and retransmission consent fees. OIBDA of $873 million was up 51% from the prior year as we continue to expand our margin. This significant improvement was driven by a number of factors, including the performance of our base businesses, our continued focus on cost containment, the benefits of our new NCAA agreement and a strong mix of high-margin incremental revenue. 
Our overall OIBDA margin in the second quarter expanded 700 basis points to 24%. Operating income of $734 million was up 69%. And as Les said, reported diluted EPS came in at $0.58, up 164%, another quarter of demonstrating the strong operating leverage of our businesses.
And on a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 3% despite the difficult comps of last year's Super Bowl and the political advertising as well as our new NCAA agreement that I just mentioned. Year-to-date OIBDA was up 55%. Year-to-date operating income was up 81% and year-to-date diluted EPS was up 190%.
Turning to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 10% driven by higher advertising and the CBS Network, greater content licensing fees through the first phase of our domestic Netflix deal and a third cycle sale of domestic syndication sale of Frasier, the cable. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $440 million, up 97%, representing a 24% margin. The strength of our Entertainment margin reflects many of the benefits from the actions we've taken to derisk the business and generate new high-margin revenue. 
In our Cable segment, revenue for the quarter was $413 million, up 12%, primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases as well as increases in international licensing revenues and DVD sales from original series, once again demonstrating the value of owning content. Cable OIBDA of $176 million was up 36% to a 43% margin. We said on our first quarter call that we expected margin expansion at the cable segment and we're seeing that today. 
Publishing revenue of $183 million for the quarter was down 3% as the strong growth as the sale of the more profitable digital content was offset by lower traditional print sales. Digital sales represented 15% of total Publishing revenues compared to 5% a year ago. Despite the slightly lower revenue, Publishing OIBDA grew 12% to $19 million, demonstrating the higher margin associated with digital sales. As the digital transition continues, we expect additional margin expansion at this segment. 
Local Broadcasting revenue of $691 million was up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenue was up 4% and TV revenue was up slightly. This was another quarter of posting growth at TV stations even with the difficult political comps, the temporary Japanese auto production issues and one less Television Stations. We want to point out that domestic auto was up in the high teens for the quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength in this important category. Other categories leading the way were financial services, pharmaceutical and telecom. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $230 million, up 7% for the quarter, representing a 33% margin. 
And finally, Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 7% to $490 million with the Americas also up 7% on a constant dollar basis. Revenue growth continues to come from increased pricing as occupancy levels remain high particularly in our large markets. Outdoor OIBDA of $86 billion increased 9% over a year ago. We expect to see better at OIBDA margins by the end of this year as we benefit from improved long-term contracts.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. As Les said, free cash flow came in at $646 million for the quarter, up 32%. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion was up 30% even with a difficult Super Bowl comparison from last year. On a year-to-date basis, cash interest was lower by over $50 million and CapEx at the halfway mark was $95 million, well within our full year estimate of $250 million to $300 million. During the quarter, we retired 9.9 million shares of our stock and spent $250 million of our buyback program. For the first 6 months of 2011, we've spent $500 million of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program and retired early 22 million shares at an average price just over $23 per share.
Our cash on hand at the end of the second quarter was $1.35 billion. After the quarter, we made a payment into the company's qualified pension plans in the amount of $200 million. Given the interest rate environment, our strong cash position and our cash status, this was a very efficient use of cash.
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in the short and longer term. Starting with Q3. Scatter pricing remains at plus 40% as we head into the new season and start to benefit from this year's strong upfront. Nonpolitical TV stations revenue is pacing up low single digits. Radio stations are also pacing to be up low single digits, and our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid single digits. On the longer-term side, we continue to focus on the initiatives we laid out at our Investor Day in February. We're making solid progress on derisking our business model and driving significant new high-margin nonadvertising revenue streams. We will update you as we continue to execute on these initiatives going forward. 
We also continue to manage our cost structure very effectively and our primary use of excess free cash flow will be to return it to shareholders via a combination of share buyback and dividend. We believe this strategy will benefit us for many years to come.
In summary, our results were very strong this quarter and we continue to take strategic steps to ensure that this success continues for the rest of this year and many years ahead. 
With that, jay, we can open the lines for questions."

So when you look at our current content, our ownership position, we have a pretty phenomenal library, and what we like to say about both Amazon and Netflix, none of the things we sold are currently shows that are on the air. So the world is getting bigger every day and expanding, and we hear about Apple wanting to buy content and Google, et cetera, et cetera, and Microsoft.

And then a more strategic, Les, when you look at your business over the next 3 to 5 years, at least in our view, the biggest area of growth and transformation is CBS from retransmission fees, which does in fact tie back to the existing cable, satellite, telco TV bundle. And so I was wondering if you could spend a minute on how you think about selling library content to these new distribution platforms in the effort of maximizing the value of the library? So we hear 7% of your library the Netflix in front to think what the real opportunity there as multiple come in and a lot more content and contracts how you think about making those shows available at price points versus trying to make sure creating some of that eats up sort of a big opportunity for you on the bundle?"

And so that's something once again that drops right to the bottom line and it's going to be growing every single year from now, knowing that we have a 10-year Comcast deal in place and a 5-year Time Warner deal in place, we sort of know -- we sort of guaranteed those reference coming in. And how we look at our library in our content? Once again, we continue to replenish our library. Yes, we have a lot of old stuff and part of this -- part of the Netflix and Amazon deal go back to original episodes of Star Trek and I love Lucy, but they also include a show like medium, which just went off the air this past year. What we've been able to do successfully is continue to replenish our library. We have 3 CSIs that are now on the air that aren't part of the Netflix deals or the Amazon deals. One day, they will come off the air and we will get a lot of money for those in those platforms. So the idea is our production companies, both at CBS as well as original production at Showtime, are going to continue to produce diverse revenue streams and our library is astronomical. There's plenty and plenty of series going back remember. Our libraries comprised of the old Paramount library, the old spelling library, the old CBS library and the old teen world Library. So we have a ton of content, and each one of these packages can just grow. Now in Netflix, that 7% does include a lot of our prime library stocked like Cheers and Frasier, but we have plenty of more and will be plenty of Mark coming in."

Our results, which follow up a remarkable first quarter, demonstrate one more time that our company is operating from a clear position of strength. Our world-class content is at the very top of its game. Most important, a continuous demand -- a premium across every distribution platform. Our success is the result of the long-term strategy [indiscernible] to grow revenues in diverse ways, to manage our expenses with discipline, to deliver healthy profits and to create value by returning cash to shareholders.  And in the second quarter, CBS achieved all of that and even more. But you know, strategy isn't enough. You need a management team to execute that strategy. We are fortunate to have an executive in charge of CBS with the baddest greatest income and management team to match. And as a result, CBS keeps just getting better and stronger.

There are certain things we can't control like what goes on in Washington, but we can control what we do at CBS. And nonetheless, despite what may have happened, we are very pleased to share our exceptional second quarter results with you today.
Across every key financial metric, we turned in a stellar performance, and the numbers speak for themselves. Despite a lack of political dollars, tough comps and some challenging macroeconomic factors, revenue was up 8%, OIBDA was up 51%, and diluted EPS was up 164%. We achieved these results, thanks to strong performances from our business units across the board. National and local, content and distribution, our operations continue to produce solid growth and increasing profits. We also achieved these results by doing exactly what we said we were going to do at our Analyst Day earlier this year. At that event, we laid out some of the most exciting areas of growth for our company that you may not have even be aware of. Let's take a minute to look at how we're delivering on these opportunities since our last call.
First, we said we would drive revenue and profit growth not just from traditional sources but increasingly from emerging platforms as well. So building on the Netflix deal we signed in the first quarter, we entered into a nonexclusive licensing agreement with Amazon a few weeks ago. This deal is another example of how we are capitalizing on the value of our content by selling into new distributors without taking away from established revenue streams. New entrants are coming into the marketplace all the time, and we will look to negotiate additional prudent online distribution deals going forward.
Next, we also emphasized that the demand for CBS content has never been stronger overseas. During the quarter, we screened our new shows to the international television buying community, leading to increased sales of our programming around the world. And just last week, we announced the new separate nonexclusive agreement with Netflix International to stream our programming in Latin America and Canada. International expansion is a key strategic growth area for our company, and this deal represents a significant step in that process.
Please remember, neither the Amazon deal nor the Netflix International deal is reflected in this past quarter that was so excellent. We also walk you through a number of structural changes happening in the industry that are allowing us to derisk our business model and diversify our revenue base with additional non-advertising sources. These include growing retransmission fees, reverse compensation from our affiliates and the great upside we have in our local media businesses. We continue to move forward on all of these initiatives, generating increasing revenues from each of them all the time.
As we discussed at the Analyst Day, these opportunities have significant room for long-term growth, and we're making solid headway on each of them right now. Due to our success, CBS is a fundamentally different company today than we were just a few years ago, and the benefits of these fundamental changes to our business model are clearly coming through in our results, and our investors have benefited, as well. So let me discuss our exceptional results now. Then I'll point out some highlights from our businesses before I turn it over to Joe for more details. After that, we'll be happy to take your questions.
As I pointed out earlier, CBS's bottom line performance was extremely strong. Diluted EPS well more than doubled to $0.58 for the quarter. That's up from $0.22 a year ago and is just below record levels. OIBDA increased to $873 million, up 51%, as every single one of our operating segments turned in strong profit growth. Just like with EPS, our OIBDA performance was also near record levels for the quarter, just shy of the company's all-time high. Plus, our second quarter margin of 24% was up 7 points from last year's quarter.
We continue to manage our expenses closely, and as a result, our revenue growth is translating into near-record profit levels across the board. Meanwhile, revenue grew solidly to up 8% to $3.6 billion for the quarter. Once again, this was achieved despite difficult comparisons to last year, which included significant political dollars. We also generated very healthy levels of free cash flow of 32% for the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion is up 30% and represents a record for our company. Our strong free cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver on our commitment to create value for CBS shareholders.
During the quarter, we repurchased 250 million of CBS stock and doubled our quarterly dividend payment to $0.10 per share. At the heart of all this success is great content. Our content is performing extremely well, and we are increasingly distributing it in the most profitable ways, with new possibilities opening up all the time.
Let's take a closer look at our businesses starting with our largest operating segment, Entertainment. During the quarter, the CBS Television Network ended the 2010 11th season as America's most-watched network for the eighth time in the past 9 years. We had the #1 scripted series drama in NCIS, the #1 comedy in the Big Bang Theory and the #1 news magazine in 60 Minutes. We also had more time-period winning programs than other network and the #1 scripted series every single night of the week.
Looking ahead, we are confident that our primetime lineup is only getting stronger. We had only very few spots to fill, and we've added 5 new series the next fall that are the best of the best. We ended the season with scatter pricing up 40%, which carried us into this year's upfront marketplace with remarkable strength. In the upfront, we once again led the way in total dollars and rate increases, which were up in the mid-teens, setting us up for strong revenue growth in 2012. At the same time, we continue to benefit from big event broadcast television, including our new long-term agreements for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, which paid off very well for us in the second quarter.
In addition, during the quarter, we signed a new deal to broadcast the Grammys for another decade on more favorable financial terms. And we also have the Southeastern Conference, the SEC, considered by most to be the most valuable college football conference, locked up for 12 more years. These long-term deals will benefit for a long, long time. Events like these pull together audiences only found on broadcast television and also drives social media usage like nothing else can, making them all the more valuable.
And needless to say, we're very pleased that the NFL has negotiated a new long-term agreement with its players. We remained optimistic throughout this process and are now getting ready for another terrific season of football and all that goes along with that. The teams and owners are happy. The players are happy. The network is happy. Our 7 AFC ONOs [ph] are happy. The affiliates are happy and, most of all, our audience is happy. So this is a very good thing.
At CBS News, with our new management team, is making terrific progress as well. The Evening News With Scott Pelley is off to a very good start. We added more than 0.25 million viewers in the program's first 2 weeks on the air, and our focus is to continue this momentum as we work to showcase the very best in broadcast journalism across the organization.
Moving to our Cable segment where we also continue to grow. Showtime, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian all delivered increases in both rates and subscriptions. Showtime subs totaled $20.5 million at the end of the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Showtime's steady stream of original series is filling our success, and we expect to build on this with returning favorites like The Big C, Weeds and Dexter, as well as with some of our promising new shows coming in the fall, including House of Lies and Homeland. Showtime is also benefiting from higher international syndication and Home Entertainment revenues as the demand for hip programming continues to increase around the world. So just as we do with our network programming, we are generating incremental dollars in cable by selling our premium content over and over again.
At our Publishing division, Simon & Schuster is embracing digital distribution as effectively as any of the businesses in our Content group. Digital sales more than doubled year-over-year, and given the improved profitability of e-books, our OIBDA results were very strong. Once again, it's about delivering great content. So far this year, we've had 126 books of the New York Times bestseller list including the recent success of The Greater Journey by David McCullough, and looking ahead, we're already seeing strong sales of JC Dugard's A Stolen Life, which set a new Simon & Schuster record for one-day e-book sales on its debut and sold 240,000 digital copies in its first 2 weeks.
Moving to our local group. As you know, TV stations stays tremendous pressures in odd years due to comparisons with political years. 2010 was an extremely strong political year for us, and despite that, we were still up in our Local Broadcasting segment this quarter with growth at both our TV stations and at radio. Going forward, we expect political advertising will begin to pick up toward the end of the year, and as we've been seeing these past few weeks, the 2012 political season is already underway and, next year, as we've seen just in the past few days, promises to be another big one in terms of political revenue.
Also, TV stations were up despite a temporary slowdown in Japanese auto spending. As this spending comes back, we feel very good about this key category going forward. Because of these factors, we're confident that we will be able to successfully manage our Local Broadcasting businesses for continued growth just as we did in the second quarter.
Finally, our after-business is growing at a strong pace, too. This segment is increasingly benefiting from newly restructured contract, and with capital costs going down, we're building out digital displays, which are a high-growth area. We're also benefiting from high occupancy levels and further pricing improvements. The wild door has a very good story as well.
As you can see across every segment of our company, CBS's second quarter performance was extraordinary. Our content continues to fuel new and growing revenue on every platform, proving that hit programming is more valuable than it has ever been. In capitalizing on this trend, we're delivering on our promise to diversify and derisk our business model, driving earnings to near-record levels. We're also managing our expenses closely in every one of our businesses to ensure that more and more revenues fall into the bottom line. Plus, our balance sheet has never been stronger, and we continue to reap the benefit of the debt actions we've taken to reduce interest cost.
Finally, we are delivering on our promise to return free cash flow to shareholders through ongoing share repurchases and increased dividends. Enhancing shareholder value is a commitment that we will continue to fulfill quarter in and quarter out.
So once again, it was a rough day, but our quarter was great with high single-digit revenue growth, 50-plus-percent OIBDA growth and 100-plus-percent EPS gross -- growth. Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased with our performance. We continue to command a very desirable competitive position that I have every reason to believe that we will deliver strong results throughout the rest of the year, into 2012 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"

Today, I will provide some more detail on the results for the quarter, then update you on what we see ahead. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter.This was a very strong, clean and straight",1089,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide some more detail on the results for the quarter, then update you on what we see ahead. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter.
This was a very strong, clean and straightforward quarter. There were no adjustments made to reported results for the quarter. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 8% from the prior year. Advertising revenue grew 3% despite the difficult comparisons for political advertising and the shared revenues with Turner on our new NCAA agreement. Content licensing and distribution revenue was up 21%, driven by the early benefit of our new domestic Netflix agreement.
Affiliate and subscription fees were up 12%, benefiting from ongoing growth in cable and retransmission consent fees. OIBDA of $873 million was up 51% from the prior year as we continue to expand our margin. This significant improvement was driven by a number of factors including the performance of our base businesses, our continued focus on cost containment, the benefits of our new NCAA agreement and a strong mix of high-margin incremental revenue.
Our overall OIBDA margin in the second quarter expanded 700 basis points to 24%. Operating income of $734 million was up 69%. And as Les said, reported diluted EPS came in at $0.58, up 164%, another quarter of demonstrating the strong operating leverage of our businesses.
And on a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 3% despite the difficult comps of last year's Super Bowl and the political advertising as well as our new NCAA agreement that I just mentioned. Year-to-date OIBDA was up 55%. Year-to-date operating income was up 81%. And year-to-date diluted EPS was up 190%.
Turning to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 10%, driven by higher advertising at the CBS Network, greater content licensing fees through the first phase of our domestic Netflix deal and a third cycle domestic syndication sale of Frasier to cable. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $440 million, up 97%, representing a 24% margin. The strength of our Entertainment margin reflects many of the benefits from the actions we've taken to derisk the business and generate new high-margin revenue.
In our Cable segment, revenue for the quarter was $413 million, up 12%, primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases as well as increases in international licensing revenues and DVD sales from original series, once again demonstrating the value of owning content. Cable OIBDA of $176 million was up 36% to a 43% margin. We said on our first quarter call that we expected margin expansion at the Cable segment, and you're seeing that today.
Publishing revenue of $183 million for the quarter was down 3% as the strong growth in the sale of more profitable digital content was offset by lower traditional print sales. Digital sales represented 15% of total Publishing revenues compared to 5% a year ago. Despite the slightly lower revenue, Publishing OIBDA grew 12% to $19 million, demonstrating the higher margin associated with digital sales. As the digital transition continues, we expect additional margin expansion at this segment.
Local Broadcasting revenue of $691 million was up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenue was up 4%, and TV revenue was up slightly. This was another quarter of posting growth at TV stations even with the difficult political comps, the temporary Japanese auto production issues and one less television station. We want to point out that domestic auto was up in the high-teens for the quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength in this important category.  Other categories leading the way were financial services, pharmaceutical and telecom. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $230 million, up 7% for the quarter, representing a 33% margin.
And finally, Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 7% to $490 million, with the Americas also up 7% on a constant dollar basis. Revenue growth continues to come from increased pricing as occupancy levels remain high particularly in our large markets. Outdoor OIBDA of $86 million increased 9% over a year ago. We expect to see better OIBDA margins by the end of this year as we benefit from improved long-term contracts.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. As Les said, free cash flow came in at $646 million for the quarter, up 32%. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion was up 30% even with a difficult Super Bowl comparison from last year. On a year-to-date basis, cash interest was lower by over $50 million, and CapEx at the halfway mark was $95 million, well within our full year estimate of $250 million to $300 million.
During the quarter, we retired 9.9 million shares of our stock and spent $250 million of our buyback program. For the first 6 months of 2011, we've spent $500 million of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program and retired early 22 million shares at an average price just over $23 per share.
Our cash on hand at the end of the second quarter was $1.35 billion. After the quarter, we made a payment into the company's qualified pension plans in the amount of $200 million. Given the interest rate environment, our strong cash position and our cash status, this was a very efficient use of cash.
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in the short and longer term starting with Q3. Scatter pricing remains at plus 40% as we head into the new season and start to benefit from this year's strong upfront. Nonpolitical TV stations revenue is pacing up low single digits. Radio stations are also pacing to be up low single digits, and our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid-single digits. On the longer-term side, we continue to focus on the initiatives we laid out at our Investor Day in February. We're making solid progress on derisking our business model and driving significant new high-margin non-advertising revenue streams. We will update you as we continue to execute on these initiatives going forward. 
We also continue to manage our cost structure very effectively, and our primary use of excess free cash flow will be to return it to shareholders via a combination of share buyback and dividend. We believe this strategy will benefit us for many years to come.
In summary, our results were very strong this quarter, and we continue to take strategic steps to ensure that this success continues for the rest of this year and many years ahead.
With that, Jay, we can open the line for questions."

And then, Joe, for you, if you wouldn't mind talking about -- I noticed we're building a big cash balance here, and I'm delighted that you spent $200 million after the close of the quarter through this early prepayment of pensions. But our debt is kind of flat, and I'm just thinking, through the use of proceeds here, you're really very constant in repurchasing shares. Could we see a step-up in share repurchases or prepayment of that pension plan rather than this cash flow? Or there's some reason we want to build all this cash on the books?"

So when you look at our current content, our ownership position, we have a pretty phenomenal library. And what we like to say about both Amazon and Netflix, none of the things we sold are currently shows that are on the air. So the world is getting bigger every day and expanding, and we hear about Apple wanting to buy content in Google, et cetera, et cetera, and Microsoft. So we think having the content we have is going to get bigger and bigger. Internationally, obviously we're expanding into Latin America and South America. It's becoming fairly significant. As well as Eastern Europe and the Far East are also markets that weren't open before. And in the traditional markets like Europe, what's great is they're sort of like America was 15 or 20 years ago where it used to be a small number of channels.

And then sort of more strategic, Les, when you look at your businesses over the next 3 to 5 years, at least in our view, the biggest area of growth and transformation of CBS is from retransmission fees, which does, in fact, tie back to the existing ""cable, satellite, telco, pay TV"" bundle. And so I was wondering if you could just spend a minute on how you think about selling library content to these new distribution platforms in the effort of maximizing the value of the library. So we hear 7% of your library to Netflix and try to think about what the real opportunity there is as more people come in and want more content?

So over the next 3 to 5 years, we think combined those numbers can be in the $600 million to $700 million range for those. And so that's something once again that drops right to the bottom line, and then it's going to be growing every single year from now. Knowing that we have a 10-year Comcast deal in place and a 5-year Time Warner deal in place, we sort of know we're sort of guaranteed those revenues coming in. And how we look at our library and our content, once again, we continue to replenish our library. Yes, we have a lot of old stuff and part of this -- part of the Netflix and Amazon deal go back to original episodes of Star Trek and I Love Lucy, but they also include a show like Medium, which just went off the air this past year. What we've been able to do successfully is continue to replenish our library. We have 3 CSIs that are now on the air that aren't part of these Netflix deals or the Amazon deals. One day, they will come off the air, and we will get a lot of money for those in those platforms. So the idea is our production companies, both at CBS as well as original production at Showtime, are going to continue to produce numerous revenue streams, and our library is astronomical. There's plenty and plenty of series going back. Remember, our library is comprised of the old Paramount library, the old Aaron Spelling library, the old CBS library and the old Teen World library. So we have a ton of content, and each one of these packages can just grow. Now in Netflix, that 7% does include a lot of our prime library stuff like Cheers and Frasier, but we have plenty more, and there'll be plenty more coming in."

And I think a lot of us were surprised with what we assume the magnitude is on the Netflix international deal. Did that number -- was that sort of a traditional media number and digital is kind of gravy, or was that all in there?

We're looking ahead and just staying with 2012. Clearly, the upfront is behind us. Advertising, all we pay is the commission on those revenues, so that feels pretty good. We know it's a presidential election year, so we know that's going to increase demand at the local marketplace. So advertising has got real high margin. Retransmission content fees, real high margin.

Our results, which follow up a remarkable first quarter, demonstrate one more time that our company is operating from a clear position of strength.

Our success is the result of the long-term strategy we've been telling you about [indiscernible] to grow revenues in diverse ways, to manage our expenses with discipline, to deliver healthy profits and to create value by returning cash to shareholders.  And in the second quarter, CBS achieved all of that and even more. But you know, strategy isn't enough. You need a management team to execute that strategy. We are fortunate to have an executive in charge of CBS that's about as great as they come and management teams to match. And as a result, CBS keeps just getting better and stronger.

We do indeed thank you for joining us once again today. Yes, it's been a very interesting day. It's been a very interesting week. There are certain things we can't control like what goes on in Washington, but we can control what we do at CBS. And nonetheless, despite what may have happened, we are very pleased to share our exceptional second quarter results with you today.
Across every key financial metric, we turned in a stellar performance, and the numbers speak for themselves. Despite a lack of political dollars, tough comps and some challenging macroeconomic factors, revenue was up 8%, OIBDA was up 51%, and diluted EPS was up 164%. We achieved these results, thanks to strong performances from our business units across the board. National and local, content and distribution, our operations continue to produce solid growth and increasing profits. We also achieved these results by doing exactly what we said we were going to do at our Analyst Day earlier this year. At that event, we laid out some of the most exciting areas of growth for our company that you may not have even be aware of. Let's take a minute to look at how we're delivering on these opportunities since our last call.
First, we said we would drive revenue and profit growth not just from traditional sources but increasingly from emerging platforms as well. So building on the Netflix deal we signed in the first quarter, we entered into a nonexclusive licensing agreement with Amazon a few weeks ago. This deal is another example of how we are capitalizing on the value of our content by selling it to new distributors without taking away from established revenue streams. New entrants are coming into the marketplace all the time, and we will look to negotiate additional prudent online distribution deals going forward.
Next, we also emphasized that the demand for CBS content has never been stronger overseas. During the quarter, we screened our new shows to the international television buying community, leading to increased sales of our programming around the world. And just last week, we announced the new separate nonexclusive agreement with Netflix International to stream our programming in Latin America and Canada. International expansion is a key strategic growth area for our company, and this deal represents a significant step in that process.
Please remember, neither the Amazon deal nor the Netflix International deal is reflected in this past quarter that was so excellent. We also walk you through a number of structural changes happening in the industry that are allowing us to derisk our business model and diversify our revenue base with additional non-advertising sources. These include growing retransmission fees, reverse compensation from our affiliates and the great upside we have in our local media businesses. We continue to move forward on all of these initiatives, generating increasing revenues from each of them all the time.
As we discussed at the Analyst Day, these opportunities have significant room for long-term growth, and we're making solid headway on each of them right now. Due to our success, CBS is a fundamentally different company today than we were just a few years ago, and the benefits of these fundamental changes to our business model are clearly coming through in our results, and our investors have benefited, as well. So let me discuss our exceptional results now. Then I'll point out some highlights from our businesses before I turn it over to Joe for more details. After that, we'll be happy to take your questions.
As I pointed out earlier, CBS's bottom line performance was extremely strong. Diluted EPS well more than doubled to $0.58 for the quarter. That's up from $0.22 a year ago and is just below record levels. OIBDA increased to $873 million, up 51%, as every single one of our operating segments turned in strong profit growth. Just like with EPS, our OIBDA performance was also near record levels for the quarter, just shy of the company's all-time high. Plus, our second quarter margin of 24% was up 7 points from last year's quarter.
We continue to manage our expenses closely, and as a result, our revenue growth is translating into near-record profit levels across the board. Meanwhile, revenue grew solidly too, up 8% to $3.6 billion for the quarter. Once again, this was achieved despite difficult comparisons to last year, which included significant political dollars. We also generated very healthy levels of free cash flow of 32% for the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion is up 30% and represents a record for our company. Our strong free cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver on our commitment to create value for CBS shareholders.
During the quarter, we repurchased 250 million of CBS stock and doubled our quarterly dividend payment to $0.10 per share. At the heart of all this success is great content. Our content is performing extremely well, and we are increasingly distributing it in the most profitable ways, with new possibilities opening up all the time.
Let's take a closer look at our businesses starting with our largest operating segment, Entertainment. During the quarter, the CBS Television Network ended the 2010 11th season as America's most-watched network for the eighth time in the past 9 years. We had the #1 scripted series drama in NCIS, the #1 comedy in the Big Bang Theory and the #1 news magazine in 60 Minutes. We also had more time-period winning programs than any other network and the #1 scripted series every single night of the week.
Looking ahead, we are confident that our primetime lineup is only getting stronger. We had only very few spots to fill, and we've added 5 new series the next fall that are the best of the best. We ended the season with scatter pricing up 40%, which carried us into this year's upfront marketplace with remarkable strength. In the upfront, we once again led the way in total dollars and rate increases, which were up in the mid-teens, setting us up for strong revenue growth in 2012. At the same time, we continue to benefit from big event broadcast television, including our new long-term agreements for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, which paid off very well for us in the second quarter.
In addition, during the quarter, we signed a new deal to broadcast the Grammys for another decade on more favorable financial terms. And we also have the Southeastern Conference, the SEC, considered by most to be the most valuable college football conference, locked up for 12 more years. These long-term deals will benefit for a long, long time. Events like these pull together audiences only found on broadcast television and also drive social media usage like nothing else can, making them all the more valuable.
And needless to say, we're very pleased that the NFL has negotiated a new long-term agreement with its players. We remained optimistic throughout this process and are now getting ready for another terrific season of football and all that goes along with that. The teams and owners are happy. The players are happy. The network is happy. Our 7 AFC ONOs are happy. The affiliates are happy and, most of all, our audience is happy. So this is a very good thing.
At CBS News, with our new management team, is making terrific progress as well. The Evening News with Scott Pelley is off to a very good start. We added more than 0.25 million viewers in the program's first 2 weeks on the air, and our focus is to continue this momentum as we work to showcase the very best in broadcast journalism across the organization.
Moving to our Cable segment where we also continue to grow. Showtime, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian all delivered increases in both rates and subscriptions. Showtime subs totaled $20.5 million at the end of the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Showtime's steady stream of original series is fueling our success, and we expect to build on this with returning favorites like The Big C, Weeds and Dexter, as well as with some of our promising new shows coming in the fall, including House of Lies and Homeland. Showtime is also benefiting from higher international syndication and Home Entertainment revenues as the demand for hip programming continues to increase around the world. So just as we do with our network programming, we are generating incremental dollars in cable by selling our premium content over and over again.
At our Publishing division, Simon & Schuster is embracing digital distribution as effectively as any of the businesses in our Content group. Digital sales more than doubled year-over-year, and given the improved profitability of e-books, our OIBDA results were very strong. Once again, it's about delivering great content. So far this year, we've had 126 books on the New York Times bestseller list including the recent success of The Greater Journey by David McCullough, and looking ahead, we're already seeing strong sales of Jaycee Dugard's A Stolen Life, which set a new Simon & Schuster record for one-day e-book sales on its debut and sold 240,000 digital copies in its first 2 weeks.
Moving to our local group. As you know, TV stations face tremendous pressures in odd years due to comparisons with political years. 2010 was an extremely strong political year for us, and despite that, we were still up in our Local Broadcasting segment this quarter with growth at both our TV stations and at radio. Going forward, we expect political advertising will begin to pick up toward the end of the year, and as we've been seeing these past few weeks, the 2012 political season is already underway and next year, as we've seen just in the past few days, promises to be another big one in terms of political revenue.
Also, TV stations were up despite a temporary slowdown in Japanese auto spending. As this spending comes back, we feel very good about this key category going forward. Because of these factors, we're confident that we will be able to successfully manage our Local Broadcasting businesses for continued growth just as we did in the second quarter.
Finally, our outdoor-business is growing at a strong pace, too. This segment is increasingly benefiting from newly restructured contracts, and with capital costs going down, we're building out digital displays, which are a high-growth area. We're also benefiting from high occupancy levels and further pricing improvements, though outdoor has a very good story as well.
As you can see across every segment of our company, CBS's second quarter performance was extraordinary. Our content continues to fuel new and growing revenue on every platform, proving that hit programming is more valuable than it has ever been. In capitalizing on this trend, we're delivering on our promise to diversify and derisk our business model, driving earnings to near-record levels. We're also managing our expenses closely in every one of our businesses to ensure that more and more revenues fall into the bottom line. Plus, our balance sheet has never been stronger, and we continue to reap the benefit of the debt actions we've taken to reduce interest costs.
Finally, we are delivering on our promise to return free cash flow to shareholders through ongoing share repurchases and increased dividends. Enhancing shareholder value is a commitment that we will continue to fulfill quarter in and quarter out.
So once again, it was a rough day, but our quarter was great with high single-digit revenue growth, 50-plus-percent OIBDA growth and 100-plus-percent EPS gross -- growth. Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased with our performance. We continue to command a very desirable competitive position that I have every reason to believe that we will deliver strong results throughout the rest of the year, into 2012 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"
27763231,133921780,151071,"CBS Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2011",2011-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide some more detail on the results for the quarter, then update you on what we see ahead. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter.This was a very strong, clean and straight",1087,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide some more detail on the results for the quarter, then update you on what we see ahead. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter.
This was a very strong, clean and straightforward quarter. There were no adjustments made to reported results for the quarter. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 8% from the prior year. Advertising revenue grew 3% despite the difficult comparisons for political advertising and the shared revenues with Turner on our new NCAA agreement. Content licensing and distribution revenue was up 21%, driven by the early benefit of our new domestic Netflix agreement.
Affiliate and subscription fees were up 12%, benefiting from ongoing growth in cable and retransmission consent fees. OIBDA of $873 million was up 51% from the prior year as we continue to expand our margin. This significant improvement was driven by a number of factors including the performance of our base businesses, our continued focus on cost containment, the benefits of our new NCAA agreement and a strong mix of high-margin incremental revenue.
Our overall OIBDA margin in the second quarter expanded 700 basis points to 24%. Operating income of $734 million was up 69%. And as Les said, reported diluted EPS came in at $0.58, up 164%, another quarter of demonstrating the strong operating leverage of our businesses.
And on a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 3% despite the difficult comps of last year's Super Bowl and the political advertising as well as our new NCAA agreement that I just mentioned. Year-to-date OIBDA was up 55%. Year-to-date operating income was up 81%. And year-to-date diluted EPS was up 190%.
Turning to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 10%, driven by higher advertising at the CBS Network, greater content licensing fees through the first phase of our domestic Netflix deal and a third cycle domestic syndication sale of Frasier to cable. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $440 million, up 97%, representing a 24% margin. The strength of our Entertainment margin reflects many of the benefits from the actions we've taken to derisk the business and generate new high-margin revenue.
In our Cable segment, revenue for the quarter was $413 million, up 12%, primarily as a result of subscription and rate increases as well as increases in international licensing revenues and DVD sales from original series, once again demonstrating the value of owning content. Cable OIBDA of $176 million was up 36% to a 43% margin. We said on our first quarter call that we expected margin expansion at the Cable segment, and you're seeing that today.
Publishing revenue of $183 million for the quarter was down 3% as the strong growth in the sale of more profitable digital content was offset by lower traditional print sales. Digital sales represented 15% of total Publishing revenues compared to 5% a year ago. Despite the slightly lower revenue, Publishing OIBDA grew 12% to $19 million, demonstrating the higher margin associated with digital sales. As the digital transition continues, we expect additional margin expansion at this segment.
Local Broadcasting revenue of $691 million was up 2% for the quarter. Radio revenue was up 4%, and TV revenue was up slightly. This was another quarter of posting growth at TV stations even with the difficult political comps, the temporary Japanese auto production issues and one less television station. We want to point out that domestic auto was up in the high-teens for the quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength in this important category.  Other categories leading the way were financial services, pharmaceutical and telecom. Local Broadcasting OIBDA was $230 million, up 7% for the quarter, representing a 33% margin.
And finally, Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 7% to $490 million, with the Americas also up 7% on a constant dollar basis. Revenue growth continues to come from increased pricing as occupancy levels remain high particularly in our large markets. Outdoor OIBDA of $86 million increased 9% over a year ago. We expect to see better OIBDA margins by the end of this year as we benefit from improved long-term contracts.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. As Les said, free cash flow came in at $646 million for the quarter, up 32%. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion was up 30% even with a difficult Super Bowl comparison from last year. On a year-to-date basis, cash interest was lower by over $50 million, and CapEx at the halfway mark was $95 million, well within our full year estimate of $250 million to $300 million.
During the quarter, we retired 9.9 million shares of our stock and spent $250 million of our buyback program. For the first 6 months of 2011, we've spent $500 million of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program and retired early 22 million shares at an average price just over $23 per share.
Our cash on hand at the end of the second quarter was $1.35 billion. After the quarter, we made a payment into the company's qualified pension plans in the amount of $200 million. Given the interest rate environment, our strong cash position and our cash status, this was a very efficient use of cash.
Now let me take you through what we're seeing in the short and longer term. Starting with Q3, scatter pricing remains at plus 40% as we head into the new season and start to benefit from this year's strong upfront. Nonpolitical TV stations revenue is pacing up low-single digits. Radio stations are also pacing to be up low-single digits, and our Outdoor group is currently pacing to be up mid-single digits. On the longer-term side, we continue to focus on the initiatives we laid out at our Investor Day in February. We're making solid progress on derisking our business model and driving significant new high-margin, non-advertising revenue streams. We will update you as we continue to execute on these initiatives going forward. 
We also continue to manage our cost structure very effectively, and our primary use of excess free cash flow will be to return it to shareholders via a combination of share buyback and dividend. We believe this strategy will benefit us for many years to come.
In summary, our results were very strong this quarter, and we continue to take strategic steps to ensure that this success continues for the rest of this year and many years ahead.
With that, Jay, we can open the line for questions."

And also on international, what markets specifically are so robust that it's really helping this profit number? And then, Joe, for you, if you wouldn't mind talking about -- I noticed we're building a big cash balance here, and I'm delighted that you spent $200 million after the close of the quarter through this early prepayment of pensions. But our debt is kind of flat, and I'm just thinking, through the use of proceeds here, you're really very constant in repurchasing shares. Could we see a step-up in share repurchases or prepayment of that pension plan rather than this cash build? Or there's some reason we want to build all this cash on the books?"

So when you look at our current content, our ownership position, we have a pretty phenomenal library. And what we like to say about both Amazon and Netflix, none of the things we sold are currently shows that are on the air. So the world is getting bigger every day and expanding, and we hear about Apple wanting to buy content, and Google, et cetera, et cetera, and Microsoft. So we think having the content we have is going to get bigger and bigger. Internationally, obviously we're expanding into Latin America and South America. It's becoming fairly significant. As well as Eastern Europe and the Far East are also markets that weren't open before. And in the traditional markets like Europe, what's great is they're sort of like America was 15 or 20 years ago where it used to be a small number of channels.

And then sort of more strategic, Les, when you look at your businesses over the next 3 to 5 years, at least in our view, the biggest area of growth and transformation of CBS is from retransmission fees, which does, in fact, tie back to the existing ""cable, satellite, telco, pay TV"" bundle. And so I was wondering if you could just spend a minute on how you think about selling library content to these new distribution platforms in the effort of maximizing the value of the library. So we hear 7% of your library to Netflix and try to think about what the real opportunity there is as more people come in and want more content?

So over the next 3 to 5 years, we think combined those numbers can be in the $600 million to $700 million range for those. And so that's something once again that drops right to the bottom line, and then it's going to be growing every single year from now. Knowing that we have a 10-year Comcast deal in place and a 5-year Time Warner deal in place, we sort of know we're sort of guaranteed those revenues coming in. And how we look at our library and our content, once again, we continue to replenish our library. Yes, we have a lot of old stuff and part of this -- part of the Netflix and Amazon deal go back to original episodes of Star Trek and I Love Lucy, but they also include a show like Medium, which just went off the air this past year. What we've been able to do successfully is continue to replenish our library. We have 3 CSIs that are now on the air that aren't part of these Netflix deals or the Amazon deals. One day, they will come off the air, and we will get a lot of money for those in those platforms. So the idea is our production companies, both at CBS as well as original production at Showtime, are going to continue to produce numerous revenue streams, and our library is astronomical. There's plenty and plenty of series going back. Remember, our library is comprised of the old Paramount library, the old Aaron Spelling library, the old CBS library and the old Teen World library. So we have a ton of content, and each one of these packages can just grow. Now in Netflix, that 7% does include a lot of our prime library stuff like Cheers and Frasier, but we have plenty more, and there'll be plenty more coming in."

We know it's a presidential election year, so we know that's going to increase demand at the local marketplace. So advertising has got real high margin. Retransmission content fees, real high margin.

For many quarters now, we have posted results that speak to the strength, stability and progress of our company. Today's numbers are no exception, and the good news is that due to our performance, the strategic actions we've been taking and our ability to take advantage of the fundamental shifts in our industry, we are positioned for continued success going forward, including in 2012, which promises to be a very, very good year. Our competitive position is as strong as ever and as one of the world's leading content companies, the way we are monetizing our programming are growing all the time from retrans to reverse comp to streaming to our expanding International business. All of these new opportunities mean increased stability to our revenue base and more and more dollars falling to the bottom line.
This past third quarter was indicative of the type of performance we have set ourselves up to achieve. We turned top line growth into sharp increases in OIBDA, up 25% and EPS, which was up 43%. And our OIBDA margin, once again, reached peak levels that we haven't seen since '06 and '07. Plus as we continue to tap recurring nonadvertising revenue streams, we are diversifying our revenue base. 
In the third quarter, our mix of advertising-related revenue came in at just 59%. We are clearly tracking ahead of our strategy to diversify and de-risk the company. Across the board, we're delivering on our strategies in priming CBS to take advantage of sum very exciting developments down the road. And the fact that we have this kind of confidence in the future is why we're announcing today a plan to buy back another $1.5 billion of our stock in addition to the $1.5 billion that is currently underway. This is also in addition to the dividend that we recently doubled. So clearly, returning value to our shareholders is of a significant importance to us.
Today, I'm going to take a closer look at our third quarter numbers and then discuss a few of the operating highlights at each of our segments. And after that, I'll turn it over to Joe for more analysis and financial information and then we'll take your questions. 
Despite the lack of political dollars this year versus last, third quarter revenues grew 2% to $3.4 billion. This kind of growth is extremely unusual for a nonpolitical year. It was achieved by strength in our traditional businesses, as well as the kinds of recurring nonadvertising revenues I just referenced. Once again, we were able to turn revenue growth into strong profit growth with OIBDA up 25% to $837 million for the quarter and EPS up 43%, coming in at $0.50 per diluted share. 
Our growth has been consistent all year long. Year-to-date, our OIBDA's up 43% and EPS, 109%. As mentioned, we are clearly being helped by new sources of high-margin revenue, as well as the underlying performance of our established businesses. But we also continue to hold down costs, including programming expenses that were lower than a year ago, and we're benefiting from all the debt reduction we implemented last year, the benefits of which will also continue.
In addition, our free cash flow has been terrific. We have now generated $1.5 billion in cash year-to-date and have nearly $1 billion of cash on hand as of the end of the quarter. This is after contributing to our pension plans and returning significant value to our shareholders. Along these lines, as I mentioned, we have doubled our share repurchase program by another $1.5 billion. This expanded program is scheduled for 2012 and 2013 and reflects the positive visibility we have in our operations across the company into the future. 
Also during the quarter, we made the first increased payment of our quarterly dividend that was doubled from a year ago. Going forward, whether it be share buybacks or dividend payments, returning value to our shareholders will continue to be a top priority.
Now let's take a look at how our success reflected in each of our operating segments beginning with Entertainment, led by the CBS Television Network, which, as you know, is off to a terrific start again this year. Our Entertainment segment continues to be driven by the increasing value of what we call the content chain, which in always we are getting paid for our program. 
The CBS Television Network is the first and most important link on that chain, and it continues to perform brilliantly. Primetime advertising, network's bread-and-butter was up solidly in the third quarter, and our ratings this quarter in the new fall season are significantly outpacing the field. 
CBS is averaging 2.5 million viewers ahead of our closest competitor, a difference of 24%. Through the first 6 weeks of the season, CBS is also the first network since People Meters began in 1987 to have 9 of the top 10 scripted series on television. And a few weeks ago, we made television history as the first network to ever broadcast 20 of the top 30 programs for the week. 
The network's success extends across all key measures. CBS is up year-over-year in viewers, households, 25 to 54 and yes, 18 to 49. In fact, we were the first network since 2002 to have the #1 drama, the #1 comedy and the #1 new series in 18 to 49 through the first month of the season. This kind of broad-based success we have an unmatched platform to launch new shows and keep growing our momentum well into the future. 
Once again, whoever says network television is a cyclical business hasn't been paying attention to CBS, which has been the leader in 9 in the last 10 years. Given the success of our ratings, we are the network clearly leading the way in the scatter marketplace. At CBS, we are delivering our audience across every single demographic as this continues, it will result in us receiving an even greater share of scatter dollars going forward. 
Meanwhile, in sports, the NFL continues to do extremely well for us. And coming up soon is college basketball, which in case you haven't noticed, is still scheduled to be played. And this weekend, on our air, we essentially have this year's college football championship, the #1 LSU plays #2 Alabama in primetime. So you don't have to wait for the BCS in January this year to find out who the best team in the country is. So our long-term view of the SEC is paying off now and will continue to do so until 2023. This deal is looking better all the time as the SEC has clearly become the dominant conference in college football. 
Beyond the network, the other links in our content chain are becoming more and more lucrative every single quarter. Syndication remains the next largest source of revenue for us with a specially sharp growth on the international side, led by CSI and NCIS, the 2 most popular shows in the world, our international syndication business is producing north of $1 billion a year for us, double what it was just 4 years ago. 
And as you know, you've read much about this, one of the most exciting areas of growth is the increased demand of our content from online video distributors like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu Plus and others. In less than 8 months, we have secured deals that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually to us and are a key factor in the diversification of our revenue streams. This phenomenon is being driven by consumer demand. Viewers are clearly looking to watch part of their content online, particularly younger viewers. Going forward, we feel very good about our ability to make significant money from this development year in and year out, no matter which streaming service consumers choose.
Each case, we're prudently delivering our programming to new viewers in a way that complements our traditional licensing businesses and realizes incremental value from our library by selling our content over and over again. Within the last month, we also signed a pair of long-term streaming deals for CW content with Netflix and Hulu. These deals, which we did with our partners at Warner Bros. will dramatically change the economics of The CW, as well as add to our studio bottom line. Plus like all of our deals, we continue to have the flexibility to sell our content elsewhere. 
Two other key growth areas are retransmission consent and reverse compensation from affiliates. Both revenue sources continue to grow at a steady clip, and each of them is right on track to meet the financial targets we've laid out for you previously. On the reverse comp side, we signed a new deal with one of our largest affiliate groups during the quarter. In this deal that comes into full affect next summer, we took a previous arrangement in which we had been paying our partners and turned it into a deal, which they will now be paying us, the kind of compensation we've told you we can expect. 
So from advertising to syndication to streaming to retrans and reverse comp, every link of the content chain continues to strengthen and serves to diversify our revenue in the marketplace that rewards content like never before.
The increasing value of our premium content is also at the heart of our Cable Network segment, which where we continue to see very healthy revenue and profit growth. Our 3 Cable Networks, Showtime, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian all grew rates and subscribers during the quarter, with Showtime at nearly 21 million subs, up 11% year-over-year. 
Last month, we launched the brand-new hit on Showtime with the premiere of Homeland. This show is acclaimed by many as clearly one of the best new shows on television. It had an extremely strong opening and has grown from there. Meanwhile, this year's premier of Dexter was its highest rated yet and continues to have more viewers than it did last year. And remember, just like at CBS, great Showtime content feeds the pipeline to be sold in all sorts of new ways down the road as well.
At our Publishing division, Simon & Schuster continues to grow its profits as well. We are increasingly benefiting from the sharp growth and improved business model of e-books. Sale of e-books more than doubled year-over-year and digital now represent 17% of Publishing's revenue. Simon & Schuster grew its overall revenue in the quarter as well, and we had 58 new entries on The New York Times best seller, including 9 #1s. And as you no doubt heard, we recently began selling Walter Isaacson's exclusive biography of the extraordinary Steve Jobs. 
Moving to our Local Broadcasting segment where we continue to have a story of strength and stability. Just like in the second quarter or third quarter, nonpolitical revenues grew low single digits and are pacing to do the same in the fourth. Our Television Stations we saw growth across most key advertising categories, and domestic significantly was up 21% year-over-year. 
CBS Radio also posted growth in domestic auto, as well as retail and financial services. Our TV stations continue to perform very well in terms of ratings too. This past month during primetime, WCBS-TV in New York was the most watched television station in the country, and the majority of our stations were #1 in their markets. And in radio, our strategy to program more sports stations has proven to be very successful. We now have sports formats in 9 of the top 11 markets, and audience on those stations has grown nearly 75% in the past 3 years. 
What's also exciting about our local businesses is the way they are positioning themselves for the future. We now have 25 local websites that reflect the combined resources of our TV and Radio stations in each markets. These sites such as cbsnewyork.com and cbsla.com, et cetera, are capitalizing on the way people are consuming local content online as opposed to newspapers or Yellow Pages. We have some of the most recognizable brands in the biggest markets and as this continues, the opportunity is significant. So we continue to love the local business and particularly the properties we own. However, as the other businesses are in our company grow even faster, our dependence on local becomes less pronounced. 
In the third quarter, while overall revenues have grown, we are very pleased that Local Broadcasting accounted for just 19% of our total revenue versus 24% just a few years ago. This is another example how we have become a more versatile company. 
Finally, our Outdoor business is performing very solidly as well. The pacing of domestically and abroad our business in the Americas is outperforming the competition in both revenue and OIBDA. And internationally, we are seeing the business strengthen as we pursue new contracts, optimize our cost structure and continue digital expansion.
Across the company, our business is operating right where we wanted to be and just as we told you it would. We are finishing '11 in a very strong position. You have seen our numbers for the quarter and for the year-to-date where OIBDA is up 43%. What's really exciting though is that I believe the company is set up for a record-breaking 2012, and here's why. 
The CBS Television Network has opened extremely well this fall. Looking ahead, the bulk of the network season takes place in '12, and we anticipate being in first place once again when the season concludes next year. Retrans and reverse comp in full swing with more new deals coming into play next year. International demand for our content is growing every single year faster than ever. Plus this year, you saw the streaming marketplace begin to truly take hold, and we made many deals already. 
We continue to talk to all these companies and many others that we haven't done deals with yet about finding ways to generate incremental dollars going forward. As you see, '12 is shaping up to be an even bigger year in terms of streaming. Also as you know, next year is shaping up to be a very contentious year in Washington. If we are up at this point in 2011 without virtually any political advertising, imagine what we can do with it in '12. So clearly, we're very excited where we are, and we're very excited about all the ways that our recurring committed revenue will grow into 2012. 
We feel very confident about the marketplaces in which we operate, and as evidenced by the expansion of the share buyback program we've announced today and the doubling of our dividend last quarter, we like where we're headed for the rest of this year, into '12 and beyond that as well. 
With that, I will turn it over to my friend and colleague, Joe Ianniello. Joe?"
27763231,139660136,184393,"CBS Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Les. Good afternoon, everyone. Next I'll give you some more detail on our results for the quarter and year-to-date then update you on Q4 trends and opportunities in 2012. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter. Les mentioned",1339,"Thanks, Les. Good afternoon, everyone. Next I'll give you some more detail on our results for the quarter and year-to-date then update you on Q4 trends and opportunities in 2012. 
Let's start with the total company results for the quarter. Les mentioned how we're steadily turning top line growth into higher and higher profits. The numbers this quarter demonstrate the kind of exceptional flow-through we've been delivering quarter after quarter. 
Despite significant political advertising from a year ago, overall revenue of $3.4 billion was up 2%, and advertising revenue was even with last year's quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenue was up 5% led by our recent digital streaming deals and continued growth in international syndication. Affiliate and subscription fees were up 7%, benefiting from further growth in cable and retransmission consent fees. 
OIBDA of $837 million was up 25% from the prior year, driven by high-growth margin revenue and our continued focus on controlling costs. Our overall OIBDA margin in the third quarter expanded 500 basis points to 25%, which ties a record for us. We're now benefiting from a larger and growing base of long-term committed revenue deals that are very high margin.
Operating income of $703 million was up 33%, and as Les said, diluted EPS came in at $0.50 per share, up 43%. We've not adjusted any reported items in this quarter or any quarter this year for that matter. For comparison purposes, 2010 amounts reflect the adjustments we made last year. 
I also want to point out that our results today do not yet reflect the benefit of the recent announced CW deals. On a year-to-date basis, the story's very consistent. Revenue was up 3% despite the difficult comps of last year's Super Bowl and political advertising, as well as our new NCAA agreement. As you may recall, we now share NCAA revenues with Time Warner, but our profits are significantly greater, and we have 13 years remaining on that deal. At the same time, year-to-date OIBDA was up 43%. Operating income was up 59%, and diluted EPS was up 109% to $1.36.
Let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 1% despite some timing of domestic syndication sales and one less NFL game in this quarter. This speaks to our underlying strength with primetime network advertising up 4% in the quarter. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $405 million, up 46%. The strength of the Entertainment segment's OIBDA was a combination of lower programming expenses and higher margin contributions coming from streaming deals and retrans fees. 
In our Cable segment, revenue for the quarter was $420 million, up 14% primarily as a result of affiliate fee increases on continued subscriber growth and higher pricing, as well as growth in content licensing fees from international syndication and streaming deals, once again, demonstrating the value of owning content. Cable OIBDA of $203 million was up 19% to a very healthy 48% margin. 
Publishing revenue of $220 million for the quarter was up 1%, driven by strong performances from titles such as A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard and In My Time by Dick Cheney. Publishing OIBDA grew 19% to $38 million in the quarter. This represents a 17% margin, one of the highest in Simon & Schuster's history continuing the trend of increased sales of more profitable digital content. 
Local Broadcasting revenue of $656 million was down 3% for the quarter without the benefit of political advertising we have last year. Radio revenue was even, and TV station revenue was down 6%. But nonpolitical revenue for this segment was up 2% for the quarter, illustrating the continued underlying strength. Both TV stations and Radio stations individually were also up 2% on this basis as well, and the growth in nonpolitical advertising in the quarter was broad-based across many categories. 
In fact, 4 of the top 5 categories each showed growth with an average increase of 4% for these categories in the quarter. The only top 5 category that did not grow was movies because of the timing of film release schedules compared to last year. Automotive grew this quarter as domestic spending was up strong double digits, and Japanese auto showed improvement from the second quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, Local Broadcasting has grown its revenues despite the difficult political comp, the absence of the Super Bowl and the disruptions with Japanese auto, and that's truly amazing. Local Broadcasting OIBDA of $184 million was down $11 million for the quarter due to the absence of the political advertising. However, year-to-date, we've grown OIBDA 7%. Again, this includes political in last year and demonstrates the underlying strength and stability of the station's business model, which also continues to benefit from our recent cost-containment efforts.
And finally, Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 4% to $477 million. We did benefit a few points from exchange rates, but the base business continues to grow just like our other local assets, led by increases in U.S. billboards and our South American business. Pricing for our U.S. billboards business was up 3% with a steady year-over-year occupancy rate. We've been disciplined about not renewing low-margin contracts, and we will continue that approach in the future.
Outdoor OIBDA of $80 million increased 4% over last year. The FX benefit to revenue also increased expenses, therefore, negatively impacting our flow-through. We also did incur a few nonrecurring items, which also reduced the flow-through of top line growth. As you all know, we continue to incur costs associated with the various legal claims. We expect further margin expansion in the fourth quarter and beyond as higher-margin contracts take effect.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Free cash flow came in at $29 million for the quarter, which includes a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans as we discussed on our last call. We will continue to opportunistically fund our pension plans, so stay tuned for more on that in the future. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 8% to $1.5 billion despite the absence of the Super Bowl from last year and the pension contribution this year. 
During the quarter, we spent $350 million on our share buyback program, retiring 13.5 million shares. For the first 9 months of 2011, we've utilized $850 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program and have retired over 35 million shares at an average price of about $24 per share.
Our cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $947 million. Now let me give you some observations about Q4. We continue to see a stable marketplace and based on current pacing data, we expect to see nonpolitical TV stations revenue to be up low single digits, CBS-TV stations doing even better than that, Radio stations to be up low single digits as well and our Outdoor group to be up mid-single digits. 
As Les mentioned, we are very excited about 2012, which is now less than 60 days away, and we've positioned the company to have an extraordinary year. Let me reiterate some of the opportunities. Retrans is stepping up. Reverse compensation's beginning to contribute. SVOD deals are accelerating. International demand for our content's never been stronger, and political advertising is back again, all this while we continue to manage our cost as well. 
We're always looking at additional opportunities for incremental cost savings, and next year will be no different. We're confident we can continue to identify permanent efficiencies to further expand our profit margins. We'll also continue to be diligent with capital allocation, always focused on our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders highlighted by our increased share buyback program we announced today. 
In summary, we're very pleased with the results we've been able to share with you this year on our earnings calls, and we're especially looking forward to speaking with all of you on our 2012 earnings calls. 
Thank you. And with that, Jay, we can open the line up for questions."

As you know, CBS is trailing yet another third quarter of very fantastic results. We have consistently delivered growth and profitability, of course, driven by the success of our premium content all over the world. In every area we compete, CBS is thriving. We continue to lead as the #1 network. We're signing more and more online distribution deals. We're launching one Showtime hit after another and Simon & Schuster publishing the bestsellers. We have a stable growth at our Local business. Our content is getting more and more and more valuable everyday. 
As we close out 2011, we are operating from a clear position of strength. And I tell you, 2012 promises to be even better. But it's not enough, as you know, to have great content.

For many quarters now, we have posted results that speak to the strength, stability and progress of our company. Today's numbers are no exception, and the good news is that due to our performance, the strategic actions we've been taking and our ability to take advantage of the fundamental shifts in our industry, we are positioned for continued success going forward, including in 2012, which promises to be a very, very good year. 
Our competitive position is as strong as ever. And as one of the world's leading content companies, the ways we are monetizing our programming are growing all the time, from retrans to reverse comp to streaming to our expanding international business. All of these new opportunities mean increased stability to our revenue base and more and more dollars falling to the bottom line.
This past third quarter was indicative of the type of performance we have set ourselves up to achieve. We turned top line growth into sharp increases in OIBDA, up 25%, and EPS, which was up 43%. And our OIBDA margin, once again, reached peak levels that we haven't seen since '06 and '07. Plus, as we continue to tap recurring non-advertising revenue streams, we are diversifying our revenue base. 
In the third quarter, our mix of advertising-related revenue came in at just 59%. So we are clearly tracking ahead of our strategy to diversify and de-risk the company. Across the board, we're delivering on our strategies and priming CBS to take advantage of some very exciting developments down the road. 
And the fact that we have this kind of confidence in the future is why we're announcing today a plan to buy back another $1.5 billion of our stock in addition to the $1.5 billion that is currently underway. This is also in addition to the dividend that we recently doubled. So clearly, returning value to our shareholder is of significant importance to us.
Today, I'm going to take a closer look at our third quarter numbers and then discuss a few of the operating highlights at each of our segments. And after that, I'll turn it over to Joe for more analysis and financial information. And then, we'll take your questions. 
Despite the lack of political dollars this year versus last, third quarter revenues grew 2% to $3.4 billion. This kind of growth is extremely unusual for a non-political year. It was achieved by strength in our traditional businesses, as well as the kinds of recurring non-advertising revenues I just referenced. 
Once again, we were able to turn revenue growth into strong profit growth, with OIBDA up 25% to $837 million for the quarter and EPS, up 43%, coming in at $0.50 per diluted share. Our growth has been consistent all year long. Year-to-date, our OIBDA is up 43% and EPS, 109%. 
As mentioned, we are clearly being helped by new sources of high-margin revenue, as well as the underlying performance of our established businesses. But we also continue to hold down costs, including programming expenses that were lower than a year ago, and we're benefiting from all the debt reduction we implemented last year, the benefits of which will also continue.
In addition, our free cash flow has been terrific. We have now generated $1.5 billion in cash year-to-date and have nearly $1 billion of cash on hand as the end of the quarter. This is after contributing to our pension plans and returning significant value to our shareholders. 
Along these lines, as I mentioned, we have doubled our share repurchase program by another $1.5 billion. This expanded program is scheduled for 2012 and 2013 and reflects the positive visibility we have in our operations across the company into the future. 
Also, during the quarter, we made the first increased payment of our quarterly dividend that was doubled from a year ago. Going forward, whether it be share buybacks or dividend payments, returning value to our shareholders will continue to be a top priority.
Now let's take a look at how our success is reflected in each of our operating segments beginning with Entertainment, led by the CBS Television Network, which as you know, is off to a terrific start again this year. Our Entertainment segment continues to be driven by the increasing value of we call the content chain, which in all ways, we are getting paid for our programs. 
The CBS Television Network is the first and most important link on that chain, and it continues to perform brilliantly. Primetime advertising, the network's bread and butter was up solidly in the third quarter, and our ratings this quarter in the new fall season are significantly outpacing the field. CBS is averaging 2.5 million viewers ahead of our closest competitor, a difference of 24%. 
Through the first 6 weeks of the season, CBS is also the first network since people meters began in 1987 to have 9 of the top 10 scripted series on television. And a few weeks ago, we made television history as the first network to ever broadcast 20 of the top 30 programs for the week. 
The network's success extends across all key measures. CBS is up year-over-year in viewers, households, 25 to 54 and yes, 18 to 49. In fact, we were the first network since 2002 to have the #1 drama, the #1 comedy and the #1 new series in 18 to 49 through the first month of the season. With this kind of broad-based success, we have an unmatched platform to launch new shows and keep growing our momentum well into the future. 
Once again, whoever says network television is a cyclical business hasn't been paying attention to CBS, which has been the leader in 9 in the last 10 years. Given the success of our ratings, we are the network clearly leading the way in the scatter marketplace. At CBS, we are delivering our audience across every single demographic. As this continues, it will result in us receiving an even greater share of scatter dollars going forward. 
Meanwhile, in sports, the NFL continues to do extremely well for us. And coming up soon is college basketball, which in case you haven't noticed, is still scheduled to be played. And this weekend, on our air, we essentially have this year's college football championship, when #1 LSU plays #2 Alabama in primetime. So you don't have to wait for the BCS in January this year to find out who the best team in the country is. So our long-term deal with the SEC is paying off now and will continue to do so until 2023. This deal is looking better all the time as the SEC has clearly become the dominant conference in college football. 
Beyond the network, the other links in our content chain are becoming more and more lucrative every single quarter. Syndication remains the next largest source of revenue for us, with especially sharp growth on the international side. Led by CSI and NCIS, the 2 most popular shows in the world, our international syndication business is producing north of $1 billion a year for us, double what it was just 4 years ago. 
And as you know, you've read much about this, one of the most exciting areas of growth is the increased demand of our content from online video distributors like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu Plus and others. In less than 8 months, we have secured deals that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually to us and are a key factor in the diversification of our revenue streams. This phenomenon is being driven by consumer demand. Viewers are clearly looking to watch part of their content online, particularly younger viewers. 
Going forward, we feel very good about our ability to make significant money from this development year in and year out, no matter which streaming service consumers choose. In each case, we're prudently delivering our programming to new viewers in a way that complements our traditional licensing businesses and realizes incremental value from our library by selling our content over and over again. 
Within the last month, we also signed a pair of long-term streaming deals for CW content with Netflix and Hulu. These deals, which we did with our partners at Warner Bros. will dramatically change the economics of The CW, as well as add to our studio bottom line. Plus, like all of our deals, we continue to have the flexibility to sell our content elsewhere. 
Two other key growth areas are retransmission consent and reverse compensation from affiliates. Both revenue sources continue to grow at a steady clip, and each of them is right on track to meet the financial targets we've laid out for you previously. 
On the reverse comp side, we signed a new deal with one of our largest affiliate groups during the quarter. In this deal that comes into full affect next summer, we took a previous arrangement in which we had been paying our partners and turned it into a deal, which they will now be paying us, the kind of compensation we've told you we can expect. 
So from advertising to syndication to streaming to retrans and reverse comp, every link of the content chain continues to strengthen and serves to diversify our revenue in a marketplace that rewards content like never before.
The increasing value of our premium content is also at the heart of our Cable Networks segment, which where we continue to see very healthy revenue and profit growth. Our 3 Cable Networks, Showtime, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian, all grew rates and subscribers during the quarter, with Showtime at nearly 21 million subs, up 11% year-over-year. 
Last month, we launched a brand new hit on Showtime with the premiere of Homeland. This show is acclaimed by many as clearly one of the best new shows on television. It had an extremely strong opening and has grown from there. Meanwhile, this year's premier of Dexter was its highest rated yet and continues to have more viewers than it did last year. And remember, just like at CBS, great Showtime content feeds the pipeline to be sold in all sorts of new ways down the road as well.
At our Publishing division, Simon & Schuster continues to grow its profits as well. We are increasingly benefiting from the sharp growth and improved business model of e-books. Sale of e-books has more than doubled year-over-year, and digital now represent 17% of Publishing's revenue. 
Simon & Schuster grew its overall revenue in the quarter as well, and we had 58 new entries on The New York Times best seller, including 9 #1s. And as you no doubt have heard, we recently began selling Walter Isaacson's exclusive biography of the extraordinary Steve Jobs. 
Moving to our Local Broadcasting segment, where we continue to have a story of strength and stability. Just like in the second quarter or third quarter, non-political revenues grew low single digits and are pacing to do the same in the fourth. 
At our Television Stations, we saw growth across most key advertising categories, and domestic auto significantly was up 21% year-over-year. CBS Radio also posted growth in domestic auto, as well as retail and financial services. 
Our TV stations continue to perform very well in terms of ratings, too. This past month during primetime, WCBS-TV in New York was the most watched television station in the country, and the majority of our stations were #1 in their markets. And in radio, our strategy to program more sports stations has proven to be very successful. We now have sports formats in 9 of the top 11 markets, and audience on those stations has grown nearly 75% in the past 3 years. 
What's also exciting about our Local business is the way they are positioning themselves for the future. We now have 25 local websites that reflect the combined resources of our TV and radio stations in each markets. These sites, such as cbsnewyork.com and cbsla.com, et cetera, are capitalizing on the way people are consuming local content online as opposed to newspapers or Yellow Pages. 
We have some of the most recognizable brands in the biggest markets. And as this continues, the opportunity is significant. So we continue to love the Local business and particularly the properties we own. However, as the other businesses are in our company grow even faster, our dependence on Local becomes less pronounced. 
In the third quarter, while overall revenues have grown, we're very pleased that Local Broadcasting accounted for just 19% of our total revenue versus 24% just a few years ago. This is another example how we have become a more versatile company. 
Finally, our Outdoor business is performing very solidly as well. With pacing, up domestically and abroad, our business in the Americas is outperforming the competition in both revenue and OIBDA. And internationally, we are seeing the business strengthen as we pursue new contracts, optimize our cost structure and continue digital expansion.
Across the company, our business is operating right where we want it to be and just as we told you it would. We are finishing '11 in a very strong position. You have seen our numbers for the quarter and for the year-to-date where OIBDA is up 43%. 
What's truly exciting though is that I believe the company is set up for a record-breaking 2012, and here's why. 
The CBS Television Network has opened extremely well this fall. Looking ahead, the bulk of the network season takes place in '12, and we anticipate being in first place once again when the season concludes next year. 
Retrans and reverse comp are full swing, with more new deals coming into play next year. International demand for our content is growing every single year faster than ever. 
Plus, this year, you saw the streaming marketplace begin to truly take hold, and we've made many deals already. We continue to talk to all these companies and many others that we haven't done deals with yet about finding ways to generate incremental dollars going forward. As you see, '12 is shaping up to be an even bigger year in terms of streaming. 
Also, as you know, next year is shaping up to be a very contentious year in Washington. If we're up at this point in 2011, without virtually any political advertising, imagine what we can do with it in '12. 
So clearly, we're very excited where we are, and we're very excited about all the ways that our recurring committed revenue will grow into 2012. We feel very confident about the marketplaces in which we operate. And as evidenced by the expansion of the share buyback program, we've announced today and the doubling of our dividend last quarter, we like where headed -- where we're for the rest of this year, into '12 and beyond that as well. 
With that, I will turn it over to my friend and colleague, Joe Ianniello. Joe?"

Next, I'll give you some more detail on our results for the quarter and year-to-date then update you on Q4 trends and opportunities in 2012. 
Let's start with the total company results for the quarter. 
Les mentioned how we're steadily turning top line growth into higher and higher profits. The numbers this quarter demonstrate the kind of exceptional flow-through we've been delivering quarter after quarter. 
Despite significant political advertising from a year ago, overall revenue of $3.4 billion was up 2%, and advertising revenue was even with last year's quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenue was up 5%, led by our recent digital streaming deals and continued growth in international syndication. Affiliate and subscription fees were up 7%, benefiting from further growth in cable and retransmission consent fees. 
OIBDA of $837 million was up 25% from the prior year, driven by high-growth margin revenue and our continued focus on controlling costs. Our overall OIBDA margin in the third quarter expanded 500 basis points to 25%, which ties a record for us. We're now benefiting from a larger and growing base of long-term committed revenue deals that have very high margin.
Operating income of $703 million was up 33%. And as Les said, diluted EPS came in at $0.50 per share, up 43%. 
We've not adjusted any reported items in this quarter or any quarter this year for that matter. For comparison purposes, 2010 amounts reflect the adjustments we made last year. I also want to point out that our results today do not yet reflect the benefit of the recent announced CW deals. 
On a year-to-date basis, the story is very consistent. Revenue was up 3% despite the difficult comps of last year's Super Bowl and political advertising, as well as our new NCAA agreement. As you may recall, we now share in NCAA revenues with Time Warner. But our profits are significantly greater, and we have 13 years remaining on that deal. 
At the same time, year-to-date OIBDA was up 43%. Operating income was up 59%, and diluted EPS was up 109% to $1.36.
Let's turn to our operating segments. 
Entertainment revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 1%, despite some timing of domestic syndication sales and one less NFL game in this quarter. This speaks to our underlying strength with primetime network advertising up 4% in the quarter. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $405 million, up 46%. The strength of the Entertainment segment's OIBDA was a combination of lower programming expenses and higher margin contributions coming from streaming deals and retrans fees. 
In our Cable segment, revenue for the quarter was $420 million, up 14%, primarily as a result of affiliate fee increases on continued subscriber growth and higher pricing, as well as growth in content licensing fees from international syndication and streaming deals, once again, demonstrating the value of owning content. Cable OIBDA of $203 million was up 19% to a very healthy 48% margin. 
Publishing revenue of $220 million for the quarter was up 1%, driven by strong performances from titles such as A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard and In My Time by Dick Cheney. Publishing OIBDA grew 19% to $38 million in the quarter. This represents a 17% margin, one of the highest in Simon & Schuster's history, continuing the trend of increased sales of more profitable digital content. 
Local Broadcasting revenue of $656 million was down 3% for the quarter without the benefit of political advertising we had last year. Radio revenue was even, and TV station revenue was down 6%. But non-political revenue for this segment was up 2% for the quarter, illustrating the continued underlying strength. Both TV stations and radio stations individually were also up 2% on this basis as well, and the growth in non-political advertising in the quarter was broad-based across many categories. 
In fact, 4 of the top 5 categories each showed growth with an average increase of 4% for these categories in the quarter. The only top 5 category that did not grow was movies because of the timing of film release schedules compared to last year. Automotive grew this quarter as domestic spending was up strong double digits, and Japanese auto showed improvement from the second quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, Local Broadcasting has grown its revenues despite the difficult political comp, the absence of the Super Bowl and the disruptions with Japanese auto, and that's truly amazing. 
Local Broadcasting OIBDA of $184 million was down $11 million for the quarter due to the absence of the political advertising. However, year-to-date, we've grown OIBDA 7%. Again, this includes political from last year and demonstrates the underlying strength and stability of the station's business model, which also continues to benefit from our recent cost-containment efforts.
And finally, Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 4% to $477 million. We did benefit a few points from exchange rates, but the base business continues to grow just like our other local assets, led by increases in U.S. billboards and our South American business. Pricing for our U.S. billboards business was up 3%, with a steady year-over-year occupancy rate. We've been disciplined about not renewing low-margin contracts, and we will continue that approach in the future.
Outdoor OIBDA of $80 million increased 4% over last year. The FX benefit to revenue also increased expenses, therefore, negatively impacting our flow-through. We also did incur a few nonrecurring items, which also reduced the flow-through of top line growth. As you all know, we continue to incur costs associated with various legal claims. We expect further margin expansion in the fourth quarter and beyond as higher-margin contracts take effect.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. 
Free cash flow came in at $29 million for the quarter, which includes a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans as we discussed on our last call. We will continue to opportunistically fund our pension plans, so stay tuned for more on that in the future. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 8% to $1.5 billion despite the absence of the Super Bowl from last year and the pension contributions this year. 
During the quarter, we spent $350 million on our share buyback program, retiring 13.5 million shares. For the first 9 months of 2011, we've utilized $850 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program and have retired over 35 million shares at an average price of about $24 per share.
Our cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $947 million. 
Now let me give you some observations about Q4. 
We continue to see a stable marketplace. And based on current pacing data, we expect to see non-political TV stations revenue to be up low single digits, with CBS TV Stations doing even better than that, Radio stations to be up low single digits as well and our Outdoor group to be up mid-single-digits. 
As Les mentioned, we are very excited about 2012, which is now less than 60 days away. And we've positioned the company to have an extraordinary year. Let me reiterate some of the opportunities. 
Retrans is stepping up. Reverse compensation is beginning to contribute. SVOD deals are accelerating. International demand for our content has never been stronger, and political advertising is back again. All this while we continue to manage our cost as well. 
We're always looking at additional opportunities for incremental cost savings and next year will be no different. We're confident we can continue to identify permanent efficiencies to further expand our profit margins. We'll also continue to be diligent with capital allocation, always focused on our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders, highlighted by our increased share buyback program we announced today. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the results we've been able to share with you this year on our earnings calls, but we're especially looking forward to speaking with all of you on our 2012 earnings calls. 
Thank you. And with that, Jay, we can open the line up for questions."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us again. For many quarters now, we have posted results that speak to the strength, stability and progress of our company. Today's numbers are no exce",2512,"Thank you, Sumner. I appreciate those kind words. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us again. 
For many quarters now, we have posted results that speak to the strength, stability and progress of our company. Today's numbers are no exception, and the good news is that due to our performance, the strategic actions we've been taking and our ability to take advantage of the fundamental shifts in our industry, we are positioned for continued success going forward, including in 2012, which promises to be a very, very good year. 
Our competitive position is as strong as ever. And as one of the world's leading content companies, the ways we are monetizing our programming are growing all the time, from retrans to reverse comp to streaming to our expanding international business. All of these new opportunities mean increased stability to our revenue base and more and more dollars falling to the bottom line.
This past third quarter was indicative of the type of performance we have set ourselves up to achieve. We turned top line growth into sharp increases in OIBDA, up 25%, and EPS, which was up 43%. And our OIBDA margin, once again, reached peak levels that we haven't seen since '06 and '07. Plus, as we continue to tap recurring non-advertising revenue streams, we are diversifying our revenue base. 
In the third quarter, our mix of advertising-related revenue came in at just 59%. So we are clearly tracking ahead of our strategy to diversify and de-risk the company. Across the board, we're delivering on our strategies and priming CBS to take advantage of some very exciting developments down the road. 
And the fact that we have this kind of confidence in the future is why we're announcing today a plan to buy back another $1.5 billion of our stock in addition to the $1.5 billion that is currently underway. This is also in addition to the dividend that we recently doubled. So clearly, returning value to our shareholder is of significant importance to us.
Today, I'm going to take a closer look at our third quarter numbers and then discuss a few of the operating highlights at each of our segments. And after that, I'll turn it over to Joe for more analysis and financial information. And then, we'll take your questions. 
Despite the lack of political dollars this year versus last, third quarter revenues grew 2% to $3.4 billion. This kind of growth is extremely unusual for a non-political year. It was achieved by strength in our traditional businesses, as well as the kinds of recurring non-advertising revenues I just referenced. 
Once again, we were able to turn revenue growth into strong profit growth, with OIBDA up 25% to $837 million for the quarter and EPS, up 43%, coming in at $0.50 per diluted share. Our growth has been consistent all year long. Year-to-date, our OIBDA is up 43% and EPS, 109%. 
As mentioned, we are clearly being helped by new sources of high-margin revenue, as well as the underlying performance of our established businesses. But we also continue to hold down costs, including programming expenses that were lower than a year ago, and we're benefiting from all the debt reduction we implemented last year, the benefits of which will also continue.
In addition, our free cash flow has been terrific. We have now generated $1.5 billion in cash year-to-date and have nearly $1 billion of cash on hand at the end of the quarter. This is after contributing to our pension plans and returning significant value to our shareholders. 
Along these lines, as I mentioned, we have doubled our share repurchase program by another $1.5 billion. This expanded program is scheduled for 2012 and 2013 and reflects the positive visibility we have in our operations across the company into the future. 
Also, during the quarter, we made the first increased payment of our quarterly dividend that was doubled from a year ago. Going forward, whether it be share buybacks or dividend payments, returning value to our shareholders will continue to be a top priority.
Now let's take a look at how our success is reflected in each of our operating segments beginning with Entertainment, led by the CBS Television Network, which as you know, is off to a terrific start again this year. Our Entertainment segment continues to be driven by the increasing value of we call the content chain, which in all ways, we are getting paid for our programs. 
The CBS Television Network is the first and most important link on that chain, and it continues to perform brilliantly. Primetime advertising, the network's bread and butter, was up solidly in the third quarter, and our ratings this quarter in the new fall season are significantly outpacing the field. CBS is averaging 2.5 million viewers ahead of our closest competitor, a difference of 24%. 
Through the first 6 weeks of the season, CBS is also the first network since people meters began in 1987 to have 9 of the top 10 scripted series on television. And a few weeks ago, we made television history as the first network to ever broadcast 20 of the top 30 programs for the week. 
The network's success extends across all key measures. CBS is up year-over-year in viewers, households, 25 to 54 and yes, 18 to 49. In fact, we were the first network since 2002 to have the #1 drama, the #1 comedy and the #1 new series in 18 to 49 through the first month of the season. With this kind of broad-based success, we have an unmatched platform to launch new shows and keep growing our momentum well into the future. 
Once again, whoever says network television is a cyclical business hasn't been paying attention to CBS, which has been the leader in 9 of the last 10 years. Given the success of our ratings, we are the network clearly leading the way in the scatter marketplace. At CBS, we are delivering our audience across every single demographic. As this continues, it will result in us receiving an even greater share of scatter dollars going forward. 
Meanwhile, in sports, the NFL continues to do extremely well for us. And coming up soon is college basketball, which in case you haven't noticed, is still scheduled to be played. And this weekend, on our air, we essentially have this year's college football championship, when #1 LSU plays #2 Alabama in primetime. So you don't have to wait for the BCS in January this year to find out who the best team in the country is. So our long-term deal with the SEC is paying off now and will continue to do so until 2023. This deal is looking better all the time as the SEC has clearly become the dominant conference in college football. 
Beyond the network, the other links in our content chain are becoming more and more lucrative every single quarter. Syndication remains the next largest source of revenue for us, with especially sharp growth on the international side. Led by CSI and NCIS, the 2 most popular shows in the world, our international syndication business is producing north of $1 billion a year for us, double what it was just 4 years ago. 
And as you know, you've read much about this, one of the most exciting areas of growth is the increased demand of our content from online video distributors like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu Plus and others. In less than 8 months, we have secured deals that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually to us and are a key factor in the diversification of our revenue streams. This phenomenon is being driven by consumer demand. Viewers are clearly looking to watch part of their content online, particularly younger viewers. 
Going forward, we feel very good about our ability to make significant money from this development year in and year out, no matter which streaming service consumers choose. In each case, we're prudently delivering our programming to new viewers in a way that complements our traditional licensing businesses and realizes incremental value from our library by selling our content over and over again. 
Within the last month, we also signed a pair of long-term streaming deals for CW content with Netflix and Hulu. These deals, which we did with our partners at Warner Bros., will dramatically change the economics of The CW, as well as add to our studio bottom line. Plus, like all of our deals, we continue to have the flexibility to sell our content elsewhere. 
Two other key growth areas are retransmission consent and reverse compensation from affiliates. Both revenue sources continue to grow at a steady clip, and each of them is right on track to meet the financial targets we've laid out for you previously. 
On the reverse comp side, we signed a new deal with one of our largest affiliate groups during the quarter. In this deal that comes into full effect next summer, we took a previous arrangement in which we had been paying our partners and turned it into a deal, which they will now be paying us, the kind of compensation we've told you we can expect. 
So from advertising to syndication to streaming to retrans and reverse comp, every link of the content chain continues to strengthen and serves to diversify our revenue in a marketplace that rewards content like never before.
The increasing value of our premium content is also at the heart of our Cable Networks segment, which where we continue to see very healthy revenue and profit growth. Our 3 Cable Networks, Showtime, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian, all grew rates and subscribers during the quarter, with Showtime at nearly 21 million subs, up 11% year-over-year. 
Last month, we launched a brand new hit on Showtime with the premiere of Homeland. This show is acclaimed by many as clearly one of the best new shows on television. It had an extremely strong opening and has grown from there. Meanwhile, this year's premier of Dexter was its highest rated yet and continues to have more viewers than it did last year. And remember, just like at CBS, great Showtime content feeds the pipeline to be sold in all sorts of new ways down the road as well.
At our Publishing division, Simon & Schuster continues to grow its profits as well. We are increasingly benefiting from the sharp growth and improved business model of e-books. Sale of e-books has more than doubled year-over-year, and digital now represent 17% of Publishing's revenue. 
Simon & Schuster grew its overall revenue in the quarter as well, and we had 58 new entries on The New York Times best seller, including 9 #1s. And as you no doubt have heard, we recently began selling Walter Isaacson's exclusive biography of the extraordinary Steve Jobs. 
Moving to our Local Broadcasting segment, where we continue to have a story of strength and stability. Just like in the second quarter or third quarter, non-political revenues grew low single digits and are pacing to do the same in the fourth. 
At our Television Stations, we saw growth across most key advertising categories, and domestic auto significantly was up 21% year-over-year. CBS Radio also posted growth in domestic auto, as well as retail and financial services. 
Our TV stations continue to perform very well in terms of ratings, too. This past month during primetime, WCBS-TV in New York was the most watched television station in the country, and the majority of our stations were #1 in their markets. And in radio, our strategy to program more sports stations has proven to be very successful. We now have sports formats in 9 of the top 11 markets, and audience on those stations has grown nearly 75% in the past 3 years. 
What's also exciting about our Local businesses is the way they are positioning themselves for the future. We now have 25 local websites that reflect the combined resources of our TV and radio stations in each markets. These sites, such as cbsnewyork.com and cbsla.com, et cetera, are capitalizing on the way people are consuming local content online as opposed to in newspapers or Yellow Pages. 
We have some of the most recognizable brands in the biggest markets. And as this continues, the opportunity is significant. So we continue to love the Local business and particularly the properties we own. However, as the other businesses are in our company grow even faster, our dependence on Local becomes less pronounced. 
In the third quarter, while overall revenues have grown, we're very pleased that Local Broadcasting accounted for just 19% of our total revenue versus 24% just a few years ago. This is another example how we have become a more versatile company. 
Finally, our Outdoor business is performing very solidly as well. With pacing up domestically and abroad, our business in the Americas is outperforming the competition in both revenue and OIBDA. And internationally, we are seeing the business strengthen as we pursue new contracts, optimize our cost structure and continue digital expansion.
Across the company, our business is operating right where we want it to be and just as we told you it would. We are finishing '11 in a very strong position. You have seen our numbers for the quarter and for the year-to-date where OIBDA is up 43%. 
What's truly exciting though is that I believe the company is set up for a record-breaking 2012, and here's why. 
The CBS Television Network has opened extremely well this fall. Looking ahead, the bulk of the network season takes place in '12, and we anticipate being in first place once again when the season concludes next year. 
Retrans and reverse comp are in full swing, with more new deals coming into play next year. International demand for our content is growing every single year faster than ever. 
Plus, this year, you saw the streaming marketplace begin to truly take hold, and we've made many deals already. We continue to talk to all these companies and many others that we haven't done deals with yet about finding ways to generate incremental dollars going forward. As you see, '12 is shaping up to be an even bigger year in terms of streaming. 
Also, as you know, next year is shaping up to be a very contentious year in Washington. If we're up at this point in 2011, without virtually any political advertising, imagine what we can do with it in '12. 
So clearly, we're very excited where we are, and we're very excited about all the ways that our recurring committed revenue will grow into 2012. We feel very confident about the marketplaces in which we operate. And as evidenced by the expansion of the share buyback program we've announced today and the doubling of our dividend last quarter, we like where headed -- where we're for the rest of this year, into '12 and beyond that as well. 
With that, I will turn it over to my friend and colleague, Joe Ianniello. Joe?"
27763231,139660136,184805,"CBS Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Les. Good afternoon, everyone. Next, I'll give you some more detail on our results for the quarter and year-to-date then update you on Q4 trends and opportunities in 2012. Let's start with the total company results for the quarter. Les mention",1345,"Thanks, Les. Good afternoon, everyone. Next, I'll give you some more detail on our results for the quarter and year-to-date then update you on Q4 trends and opportunities in 2012. 
Let's start with the total company results for the quarter. 
Les mentioned how we're steadily turning top line growth into higher and higher profits. The numbers this quarter demonstrate the kind of exceptional flow-through we've been delivering quarter after quarter. 
Despite significant political advertising from a year ago, overall revenue of $3.4 billion was up 2%, and advertising revenue was even with last year's quarter. Content licensing and distribution revenue was up 5%, led by our recent digital streaming deals and continued growth in international syndication. Affiliate and subscription fees were up 7%, benefiting from further growth in cable and retransmission consent fees. 
OIBDA of $837 million was up 25% from the prior year, driven by high-growth margin revenue and our continued focus on controlling costs. Our overall OIBDA margin in the third quarter expanded 500 basis points to 25%, which ties a record for us. We're now benefiting from a larger and growing base of long-term committed revenue deals that have very high margin.
Operating income of $703 million was up 33%. And as Les said, diluted EPS came in at $0.50 per share, up 43%. 
We've not adjusted any reported items in this quarter or any quarter this year for that matter. For comparison purposes, 2010 amounts reflect the adjustments we made last year. I also want to point out that our results today do not yet reflect the benefit of the recent announced CW deals. 
On a year-to-date basis, the story is very consistent. Revenue was up 3% despite the difficult comps of last year's Super Bowl and political advertising, as well as our new NCAA agreement. As you may recall, we now share in NCAA revenues with Time Warner. But our profits are significantly greater, and we have 13 years remaining on that deal. 
At the same time, year-to-date OIBDA was up 43%. Operating income was up 59%, and diluted EPS was up 109% to $1.36.
Let's turn to our operating segments. 
Entertainment revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 1%, despite some timing of domestic syndication sales and one less NFL game in this quarter. This speaks to our underlying strength with primetime network advertising up 4% in the quarter. OIBDA for the Entertainment segment came in at $405 million, up 46%. The strength of the Entertainment segment's OIBDA was a combination of lower programming expenses and higher margin contributions coming from streaming deals and retrans fees. 
In our Cable segment, revenue for the quarter was $420 million, up 14%, primarily as a result of affiliate fee increases on continued subscriber growth and higher pricing, as well as growth in content licensing fees from international syndication and streaming deals, once again, demonstrating the value of owning content. Cable OIBDA of $203 million was up 19% to a very healthy 48% margin. 
Publishing revenue of $220 million for the quarter was up 1%, driven by strong performances from titles such as A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard and In My Time by Dick Cheney. Publishing OIBDA grew 19% to $38 million in the quarter. This represents a 17% margin, one of the highest in Simon & Schuster's history, continuing the trend of increased sales of more profitable digital content. 
Local Broadcasting revenue of $656 million was down 3% for the quarter without the benefit of political advertising we had last year. Radio revenue was even, and TV station revenue was down 6%. But non-political revenue for this segment was up 2% for the quarter, illustrating the continued underlying strength. Both TV stations and radio stations individually were also up 2% on this basis as well, and the growth in non-political advertising in the quarter was broad-based across many categories. 
In fact, 4 of the top 5 categories each showed growth with an average increase of 4% for these categories in the quarter. The only top 5 category that did not grow was movies because of the timing of film release schedules compared to last year. Automotive grew this quarter as domestic spending was up strong double digits, and Japanese auto showed improvement from the second quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, Local Broadcasting has grown its revenues despite the difficult political comp, the absence of the Super Bowl and the disruptions with Japanese auto, and that's truly amazing. 
Local Broadcasting OIBDA of $184 million was down $11 million for the quarter due to the absence of the political advertising. However, year-to-date, we've grown OIBDA 7%. Again, this includes political from last year and demonstrates the underlying strength and stability of the station's business model, which also continues to benefit from our recent cost-containment efforts.
And finally, Outdoor revenue for the quarter was up 4% to $477 million. We did benefit a few points from exchange rates, but the base business continues to grow just like our other local assets, led by increases in U.S. billboards and our South American business. Pricing for our U.S. billboard business was up 3%, with a steady year-over-year occupancy rate. We've been disciplined about not renewing low-margin contracts, and we will continue that approach in the future.
Outdoor OIBDA of $80 million increased 4% over last year. The FX benefit to revenue also increased expenses, therefore negatively impacting our flow-through. We also did incur a few nonrecurring items, which also reduced the flow-through of top line growth. As you all know, we continue to incur costs associated with various legal claims. We expect further margin expansion in the fourth quarter and beyond as higher-margin contracts take effect.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. 
Free cash flow came in at $29 million for the quarter, which includes a $200 million contribution to our qualified pension plans as we discussed on our last call. We will continue to opportunistically fund our pension plans, so stay tuned for more on that in the future. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 8% to $1.5 billion despite the absence of the Super Bowl from last year and the pension contributions this year. 
During the quarter, we spent $350 million on our share buyback program, retiring 13.5 million shares. For the first 9 months of 2011, we've utilized $850 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program and have retired over 35 million shares at an average price of about $24 per share.
Our cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $947 million. 
Now let me give you some observations about Q4. 
We continue to see a stable marketplace. And based on current pacing data, we expect to see non-political TV stations revenue to be up low single digits, with the CBS TV Stations doing even better than that, Radio stations to be up low single digits as well and our Outdoor group to be up mid-single-digits. 
As Les mentioned, we are very excited about 2012, which is now less than 60 days away. And we've positioned the company to have an extraordinary year. Let me reiterate some of the opportunities. 
Retrans is stepping up. Reverse compensation is beginning to contribute. SVOD deals are accelerating. International demand for our content has never been stronger, and political advertising is back again. All this while we continue to manage our cost as well. 
We're always looking at additional opportunities for incremental cost savings and next year will be no different. We're confident we can continue to identify permanent efficiencies to further expand our profit margins. We'll also continue to be diligent with capital allocation, always focused on our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders, highlighted by our increased share buyback program we announced today. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the results we've been able to share with you this year on our earnings calls, but we're especially looking forward to speaking with all of you on our 2012 earnings calls. 
Thank you. And with that, Jay, we can open the line up for questions."
