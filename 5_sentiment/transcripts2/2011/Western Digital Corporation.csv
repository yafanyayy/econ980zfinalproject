Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive industry",1145,"Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive industry, with 651 million drives shipped. That's 330 million terabytes of storage capacity sold into a broadening of applications and markets. At 16%, this was the industry's strongest full year unit growth in five years. Rotating magnetic storage remains the dominant technology solution for high-volume, mass storage of digital content in both the consumer and commercial markets. Full year revenue for the industry expanded by some 13% to $34 billion. However, it was also a year of significant missed opportunity as the industry supply-demand dynamic deteriorated as the year progressed, resulting in sharply declining ASPs, with the final quarter demonstrating a year-over-year decline in industry revenue of 7% on a unit increase of 4% and an even sharper decline in profitability. WD again outperformed the industry in calendar 2010. We grew units 23%, revenues by 19% and operating income by 12%. The operating income number reflected the significant challenge of the industry's ASP deterioration that emerged midyear. While we improved our financial performance sequentially in the December quarter, we are far from happy that we failed to monetize our growth throughout the year and generate the kind of return needed to sustain robust investment in technologies and products to improve our customers' future experience. 
In the coming year, we expect the hard drive volume opportunity to approach 700 million units, representing a storage capacity of approximately 440 million terabytes. Our estimate of the investment required by the hard drive community, including our component suppliers, to support this growth, is approximately $5 billion. Though the need for the industry to perform well enough to sustain its critical role in the digital ecosystem should be clear to us, to our customers and to their customers. In reviewing how we can improve our future performance, we have identified a misalignment in how our industry typically begins the calendar year from a production standpoint in contrast with the underlying demand trend of PCs, our largest served market. We are determined to start this year with the benefit of lessons learned from this analysis. And Tim and Wolfgang will elaborate on this approach later in this call. 
In addressing the calendar year 2011 market opportunity, we expect to continue to grow faster than the overall market by providing greater customer value and satisfaction than competition. We will continue to leverage our cost advantage and our relentless focus on high quality, reliability and availability of product, especially in the industry's fastest growing market segments. We believe we can achieve this growth plan while at the same time improving the way in which we approach the supply-demand dynamic from the outset of the year. In the medium to long-term, we are focused on multiple growth opportunities in both our core business and beyond. First, as I have said, we intend to continue to grow in our existing hard drive segments by providing superior availability, quality, reliability and value, a proven approach that has established us as a leading supplier in each of our served markets today. 
Second, we will leverage that same approach into the underpenetrated markets for WD of gaming and traditional enterprise. We have recently introduced our second generation SAS product for the traditional enterprise market, along with our SAS offering for the high-capacity near line storage market and we believe our commitment and measured approach to these important markets will earn significant share as we deliver a succession of our outstanding products to customers in the years ahead. 
Third, we are focused on growing our storage presence beyond rotating magnetic media through our leadership in the embedded SSD space and our planned entry into the tier zero enterprise segment for SSD when that market evolves into a significant and profitable market opportunity. In the context of solid state technology, we also continue to evaluate the opportunity to combine rotating magnetic storage with flash into hybrid solutions. 
Fourth, as highlighted earlier this month at our analyst briefing at the Consumer Electronics Show, we are expanding our TAM by addressing the connected digital home market with products that integrate and bring to life consumers' personal and premium digital content. The acceleration of digital content creation offers almost unlimited opportunities for those smart enough to feel the pulse of the consumer and provide solutions to address the need to safely store, share and experience this growing mass of content, both private and public. This growth is being driven by relentless innovation in hardware and software, which in turn is enabling and encouraging new usage models, such as social media, which all compound to proliferate content and copies of content throughout the world. At WD, we view every device or system which enables and encourages content creation or consumption, including tablets, as a potential opportunity for expanded market participation, either directly or indirectly. Since fiscal 2004, WD has been at the forefront of the still nascent market for branded storage and connected home products, with 85 million WD branded products sold to consumers, including 2.5 million WD TV media players. We believe this market has the potential to generate significant growth for WD in the years ahead. We will continue to review opportunities to invest in and expand our presence in these and additional aligned markets in the months ahead as part of our strategic evaluation of how to best create value for our shareholders. We are excited about the changing landscape of the digital ecosystem, which we see filled with opportunity for WD. Managing through changing times is in our DNA at WD. We would like to remind investors that we are entering the fourth decade in the storage solutions marketplace with some valuable experiences and lessons learned along the way. Very early on, we were one of the world's leading suppliers of specialized semiconductors to the calculator industry. Beginning in the early '80s, we were the leading maker of standalone storage controllers for the original PC before we entered the hard drive business in 1988. Today, we're the world's volume leader in hard drives, having evolved from an exclusively desktop player to a broad-based, vertically integrated supplier to multiple market segments with an established consumer brand. So we have seen change and successfully embraced it throughout our history. We believe there is no one better positioned in the storage industry today than WD. We have a track record of good, crisp decision-making and execution, a healthy balance sheet to enable prudent and smart investments and a business model that has generated sustained and consistently profitable growth. We remain focused on extending this trend. Tim Leyden will now cover the operational developments and highlights of the December quarter. Tim?"

The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with over 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess inventory out of the December quarter proved correct, as we saw a moderation of the overweighting of workweek 13 shipments that had occurred in both the June and September quarters. Looking at our served markets in the December quarter, in the compute space, units increased from 114 million to 118 million. Commercial demand remains strong and while overall consumer demand was below expectations, demand for hard drives was further tempered by inventory reductions both in the systems supply chain and in the distribution channel. While the OEM PC shipments increased by nearly 4% sequentially, HDD shipments increased by only 2%, leading to a reduction in inventory within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. We also saw better matching of TAM to true demand in the industry as a whole, which resulted in more linear shipments throughout the quarter and less pressure to ship higher volumes later in the quarter. The near line enterprise market was down sequentially from 6.1 million to 5.7 million units. We believe this was a reflection of the fact that this segment's demand is driven by large discrete project expenditures, which drives lumpier demand patterns. On a full-year basis, this segment grew by 50% in calendar year 2010 and now accounts for around 40% of enterprise shipments and will continue to be a high-growth area of the industry. After a three-year period below its previous demand high point, the traditional enterprise market, at 8.3 million units returned close to its prerecession level of 8.5 million, reflecting a continuing recovery in the commercial market. For the first time, shipments of the 2.5-inch platform exceeded shipments of the 3.5-inch form factor, validating our decision to direct our traditional enterprise investments towards 2.5-inch sets. The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the branded products segment was at 14.7 million units, up from 11.6 million units in the September quarter and 11.3 million units in the year-ago quarter, presenting further evidence of continuing strong consumer demand for personal storage. In the DVR market segment, TAM was 12.1 million units, down significantly from 13.2 million and up year-on-year from 11.3 million units. The balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. We shipped 52.2 million units in the December quarter, with 5.5% from the year-ago period and 3% sequentially, while the overall market grew by 4.4% and 2.1% respectively. Revenues totaled $2.475 billion. We expanded gross margin by 19.2% and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $225 million. Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $505 million. We are pleased that the moderating steps that we started in the September quarter, relative to pricing, production builds, inventory alignment and capital expenditure achieved the desired results of keeping us within our business model parameters in the December quarter. Combined with a heightened emphasis on cost management, those actions contributed to our results being significantly better than we had guided in our October earnings call. We continue to focus on satisfying customer needs, staying on the industry area density curve and providing competitive products while at the same time, maintaining industry cost leadership. Consistent with the plans that we laid out in our October call, we optimized our profitable participation in the market in the December quarter while continuing to satisfy customer requirements. The adaptability of our business model enabled us to optimize mix and that, together with the pricing discipline and tight cost management, including accelerated cost improvements from our recently acquired Singapore media facility, contributed to our better-than-expected gross margin. Despite this, we still fell short of the profitability levels that we would normally have expected to achieve in what has traditionally been ours and the industry's most profitable quarter of the year. This is a direct result of the cumulative impact of higher price declines than normal in both the June and September quarters. As a reminder, based on historical achievements in past December quarters, ordinarily, we would expect that the gross margin percentage would be above the midpoint of our margin models range of 18% to 23%. Now, we are not happy that our fiscal Q2 gross margin performance at 19.2% is well below the midpoint of that range as we get into the more seasonally challenging quarters of the year. While inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were well-controlled in each segment, we still believe that despite a reduction of approximately 2 million to 3 million HDDs in the PC supply chain, there is still an inventory excess of some 6 million to 8 million HDD units in the PC manufacturers' pipeline and this will place additional downward pressure on the HDD TAM in the March quarter. Bearing that in mind, we intend to depart from what has been the industry's typical approach to inventory holding and supply demand balancing in the March quarter. Historically, over the last decade, PC volumes have shown an average unit volume decline of around 9% sequentially when March quarters are compared to the immediately preceding December quarters. Despite that PC industry historical demand trend, the HDD industry has typically shipped volumes but were down approximately 4% sequentially during the same period as HDD producers attempted to utilize the capacity that had already been put in place to service the seasonally stronger December quarter volumes. The consequence of this mismatch in unit volume trends between the PC and the HDD industries has been to put pressure on March quarter pricing, contribute to an inventory overhang exiting the March quarter and consequently exert further pricing pressure in the June quarter, which has repeatedly seen the weakest seasonal demand profile. Consequently, although we believe that end-user demand would be around 160 million units, we are forecasting an HDD TAM of 155 million units for the last quarter as we anticipate some further flushing of excess inventory in the PC pipeline. Additionally, we expect volumes in DVR branded products and enterprise segments to be seasonally flat to down sequentially. Despite this slower start to the calendar year, we expect to see mid- to high-single digits HDD volume growth in calendar 2011. 
Now, turning to our product lineup. We continue to focus on opportunities in the fastest growing market segments, which remains a key strategy for WD. Since our last report, we introduced new products and software that enable consumers to easily move data and content into, around and outside the home and experience their collection of movies, photos and music, as well as premium content on the Internet. We launched the new flagship of our popular WD TV Media Player family of products, the WD TV Live Hub, which centralizes and streams movies, photos and music to any connected stream in the home with its 1 TB capacity, media server capability and seamless connection to premium content services such as Netflix, Blockbuster OnDemand and Facebook. We updated our other WD TV products with premium online services first introduced on WD TV Live Hub. With an update to our WD Photos application, we enabled Android smartphone users with the ability to access all their photos residing on My Book live, My Book World Edition and WD ShareSpace network drives from anywhere in the world that they can connect to the Internet. That feature also available for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. 
In our core hard drive business, we began shipping the WD Scorpio Black mobile drive in 750 GB capacity for the road warrior who needs a 7200 RPM high-performance and the capacity to carry an entire media collection while traveling. Earlier today, we underscored our long-term commitment to the enterprise segment by bolstering our product portfolio with two new drive families. Our second generation, 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM WD S25 SAS drive for mission-critical high-performance server and storage applications, available in both 450 GB and 600 GB capacities. And a new 7200 RPM WD RE SAS 3.5-inch drive available in 1 TB and 2 TB capacities for near line applications, a large and expanding market serving IT data centers and cloud computing applications. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q2 financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter."
314057,117491707,92407,"Western Digital Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2011",2011-01-18,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.4",1093,"Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.475 billion, down 5% from the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 52.2 million units, up 5% from the prior-year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Player, WD LiveWire Network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $57 million, up 21% from the prior year and up 54% from the September quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $5 from the year-ago quarter and up $1 from the September quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $546 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter and up 28% sequentially. There were no customers that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, all regions contributed revenue gains, with Europe showing the best comparative improvement on a sequential basis. From a channel perspective, OEM declined as a percentage of revenue as we actively managed shipments and inventory and the retail channel increased along these low expectations. We exceeded the upper end of our revenue guidance by $75 million, which was achieved through a combination of remixing our product and business segments, improved pricing discipline, resulting in lower like-for-like price declines, higher volume due to a slightly higher TAM and moderate market share gains. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 26.2% in the year-ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the September quarter. And these gross margins exceeded our guidance by about 320 basis points. There were three main reasons for this. First, our like-for-like price declines were better than we had modeled. Second, we actively drove changes in our product and segment mix. Last but not least, our relentless efforts to optimize our product cost yielded larger than anticipated like-for-like cost improvement, with one factor being that our recently acquired Singapore media facility achieved accretion more quickly than anticipated. We had modeled a 50 basis point dilution for the quarter but we are now experiencing the 50 basis point accretion that we had built into our acquisition models. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $235 million or 9.5% of revenue. This compares with $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the September quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investment in our branded products business. Operating income was $240 million or 9.7% of revenue. This compares with $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $211 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were $1 million. Base expense for the December quarter was $40 million or 5.9% of pretax income. The rate for the quarter reflects the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter. Our net income totaled $225 million or $0.96 per share. This compares with $429 million or $1.85 per share and $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year ago and September quarter respectively. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was a negative two days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 26 days of inventory or 14 turns and 74 days of payables. We generated $505 million in cash flow from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $255 million. Capital additions for the December quarter totaled $215 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter totaled $151 million. We continue to expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue, plus up to $200 million for our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $620 million for the fiscal year. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the second quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $350 million. We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, an increase of $252 million from the September quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for fiscal Q3. As Tim indicated, over the last 10 years, PC shipments have declined on average 9% from the December to the March quarter. Yet, hard drive industry shipments have historically decreased by only 4%. This systematically creates a supply-demand dynamic that leads to significant price declines in this and subsequent quarters as we have experienced this past calendar year. Furthermore, despite the fact that the industry has made progress towards balancing supply and demand in the December quarter, we believe that there still remains an excess inventory of 6 million to 8 million units within the PC manufacturers pipeline. Also, our sense of the market indicates higher than usual PC inventory levels in both the distribution and retail channel. 
With the objective of entering the June quarter with a more balanced inventory, we estimate that the hard drive industry TAM for the March quarter is unlikely to exceed 155 million units. We strongly believe that the effect from fixed costs underabsorption are of much lesser impact to the bottom-line than subjecting the entire volume to significant price declines. Having said that, since we operate in a highly competitive market, we've modeled like-for-like price declines of 5%, in line with pricing trends in prior March quarters. We believe our value proposition will continue to resonate with our customers and we will maintain focus on ROI through product and segment mix management. We continue to strengthen our investments in R&D and market development to support the significant opportunities in our medium and long-term future. Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion. R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $240 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be at the upper end of our business model of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.55 and $0.65 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

And therefore over the past several years, as we began to invest in preparation for entry into the traditional enterprise market as one of the few remaining greenfield incremental growth opportunities for us, we focused in on investing in the 2.5-inch SAS environment. And we announced this morning, shipments of our second generation product in that space, if you look at history, our history and our entry into the 2.5-inch mobile arena, many companies entry into new segments in the industry over time, typically you're in third or fourth generation products before you see significant market share traction. You use the first and second generation products to establish your credentials and demonstrate your fundamental capabilities of understanding the market segment and having satisfied customers of that at relatively low volumes, you then begin to gain traction in a substantial presence. We believe that we're on track to achieve that kind of development within the 2.5-inch SAS enterprise traditional market, which by the time we gain that traction, we expect that that form factor and interface will command over 70% of that marketplace total demand. In addition to that, you have the growth area of near line storage, which is typically up until now, has over the last five years, has expanded using a 24/7 high reliability, 3.5-inch SATA drives, what WD calls its RAID edition products. And we have generated a substantial market position in that segment. And again, as Tim alluded to, that's about a 5 million unit market that has shown a 50% growth rate year-over-year and represents 40% of the total enterprise environment. And that's being driven primarily by cloud computing applications. And as we just announced this morning, a SAS product to service that market. And that demonstrates our ability to leverage core fundamental engineering investments. And then, once we had developed and launched our SAS interface into the market, now we're applying it to multiple platforms and multiple markets."

In the early days, the design and the software were pretty minimal. However, as we began to focus on that business, we identified that I believe some critical success factors. One was the need for a stylish and identifiable product ID. And we applied outside our experience to that point, engaged professionals in that arena and invested significant amounts of money in creating the WD My Book and My Passport design style, which based on market reaction, is quite compelling. We made some small investment in a software company several years ago that provides WD with the proprietary capability that drives the iPhone and Android apps that Tim described a moment ago and the ability to access any WD network connected device through the Internet or throughout your home or office infrastructure. We have continued to invest in software capability. In our branded business, our engineering resources are 60% software and 40% hardware. And then, overlaid on top of that has been the development of very strong channel, both in a brick-and-mortar environment and the e-tail environment more recently, where we have developed very strong relationships with our channel partners. And it's really through those channel relationships that we have identified the opportunity to expand the product offering to solve consumers' total in-home experience problem of how do you not only safely store the content but how do you then allow the consumer to easily experience that content. And as we explored consumers' expectations, as we explored our channel partners' view of us, we discovered that we had built up quite an amount of brand equity and that we were able to use that link with the engineering resources and the software development resources that we put into the media players to achieve quite a significant level of success. We think our 2.5 million units so far in that market in just a couple of years is pretty good. And so, encouraged by that, we have broadened our view of what the total home experience should be and what kinds of devices and services can enhance that experience. And we're exploring ways to deliver those to our customers. For instance, one of the inhibitors in the home is to showing full HD video without jerkiness and without interruption is that in most homes, the networking environment is WiFi. And you can't quite keep up with the full HD, full-motion video in a WiFi environment. Most homes do not have broadly embedded network dedicated network wires going to all the rooms. And so we came up with our livewire products, a networking product that uses the power lines in the home so that in a very convenient way for the user, without any major infrastructure development, they can actually transmit all their high-definition video content to every screen in the home in a very cost-efficient and very simple and consumer friendly way. I mean, it is literally as simple as plugging the network wiring to your router and plugging the plug into your electrical outlet. So we're continuing to look at that opportunity and we're continuing to broaden out the total product portfolio offering. The essence of it is simplicity, the essence of it is liberating the consumer from closed environments that are specific to one vendor or another and allowing multiple formats from multiple sources to be stored, shared and experienced."

And so what we are highlighting is the disconnect between the PC and the hard drive quarter-over-quarter declines that is systemic, has been in place for 10 years while all these things were moving around and shifting and evolving. But the PC is even though we have significant markets outside of PC, DVR, personal storage, which is really more of a linkage to installed base than to the incremental new sales. Nevertheless, PC is a large portion of our total target market. And therefore, the way that the PC moves up and down, it's I believe now, it's significant that we recognize that an attempt to manage the supply demand and sync with that, while also looking specifically at the other emerging and growing applications for hard drives and layering those on top of the PC-driven demand to get their own specific cadence. And while we haven't talked about that in detail in this guidance, it is underlying this guidance. We've looked at every market segment and formed the view about how it's going to perform and matched our supply plan to the demand that we perceive in those markets. So, we believe that the fundamental disconnect and we can argue whether it's 9% versus 4% or whether it should be 9.5% versus 4% but the fundamental piece is that overbuilding against the true demand is a recipe for incremental inventory overhang, creating pressure on the marketplace and that the price we pay in underabsorption to moderate our supply to match the true demand profile is a much smaller price than the price we have been paying by maintaining production velocity, increasing inventories and then applying extreme pricing pressure to the entire volumes that we produce."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive indust",1144,"Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive industry with 651 million drives shipped. That's 330 million terabytes of storage capacity sold into a broadening set of applications and markets. At 16%, this was the industry's strongest full year unit growth in five years. Rotating magnetic storage remains the dominant technology solution for high-volume mass storage of digital content in both the consumer and commercial markets. Full year revenue for the industry expanded by some 13% to $34 billion. However, it was also a year of significant missed opportunity as the industry's supply-demand dynamic deteriorated as the year progressed, resulting in sharply declining ASPs, with the final quarter demonstrating a year-over-year decline in industry revenue of 7% on a unit increase of 4%, and an even sharper decline in profitability. 
WD again outperformed the industry in calendar 2010. We grew units 23%, revenues by 19% and operating income by 12%. The operating income number reflected the significant challenge of the industry's ASP deterioration that emerged midyear. While we improved our financial performance sequentially in the December quarter, we are far from happy that we failed to monetize our growth throughout the year and generate the kind of return needed to sustain robust investment in technologies and products to improve our customers' future experience. 
In the coming year, we expect the hard drive volume opportunity to approach 700 million units, representing a storage capacity of approximately 440 million terabytes. Our estimate of the investment required by the hard drive community, including our component suppliers, to support this growth is approximately $5 billion. So the need for the industry to perform well enough to sustain its critical role in the digital ecosystem should be clear to us, to our customers and to their customers. In reviewing how we can improve our future performance, we have identified a misalignment in how our industry typically begins the calendar year from a production standpoint, in contrast with the underlying demand trend of PCs, our largest served market. We are determined to start this year with the benefit of lessons learned from this analysis. And Tim and Wolfgang will elaborate on this approach later in this call. 
In addressing the calendar year 2011 market opportunity, we expect to continue to grow faster than the overall market by providing greater customer value and satisfaction than competition. We will continue to leverage our cost advantage and our relentless focus on high quality, reliability and availability of product especially in the industry's fastest growing market segments. We believe we can achieve this growth plan while at the same time improving the way in which we approach the supply-demand dynamic from the outset of the year. 
In the medium to long term, we are focused on multiple growth opportunities in both our core business and beyond. First, as I have said, we intend to continue to grow in our existing hard drive segments by providing superior availability, quality, reliability and value, a proven approach that has established us as a leading supplier in each of our served markets today. 
Second, we will leverage that same approach into the underpenetrated markets for WD of gaming and traditional enterprise. We have recently introduced our second-generation SAS product for the traditional enterprise market, along with our SAS offering for the high-capacity near-line storage market, and we believe our commitment and measured approach to these important markets will earn significant share as we deliver a succession of outstanding products to customers in the years ahead. 
Third, we are focused on growing our storage presence beyond rotating magnetic media through our leadership in the embedded SSD space and our planned entry into the Tier 0 Enterprise segment for SSD when that market evolves into a significant and profitable market opportunity. In the context of solid state technology, we also continue to evaluate the opportunity to combine rotating magnetic storage with flash into hybrid solutions. 
Fourth, as highlighted earlier this month at our analyst briefing at the Consumer Electronics Show, we are expanding our TAM by addressing the connected digital home market with products that integrate and bring to life consumers' personal and premium digital content. The acceleration of digital content creation offers almost unlimited opportunities for those smart enough to feel the pulse of the consumer and provide solutions to address the need to safely store, share and experience this growing mass of content, both private and public. This growth is being driven by relentless innovation in hardware and software, which in turn is enabling and encouraging new usage models, such as social media, which all compound to proliferate content and copies of content throughout the world. At WD, we view every device or system which enables and encourages content creation or consumption, including tablets, as a potential opportunity for expanded market participation, either directly or indirectly. Since fiscal 2004, WD has been at the forefront of the still nascent market for branded storage and connected home products with 85 million WD-branded products sold to consumers, including 2.5 million WD TV Media players. We believe this market has the potential to generate significant growth for WD in the years ahead. We will continue to review opportunities to invest in and expand our presence in these and additional aligned markets in the months ahead as part of our strategic evaluation of how to best create value for our shareholders. We're excited about the changing landscape of the digital ecosystem, which we see filled with opportunity for WD. Managing through changing times is in our DNA at WD. 
We would like to remind investors that we are entering the fourth decade in the storage solutions marketplace with some valuable experiences and lessons learned along the way. Very early on, we were one of the world's leading suppliers of specialized semiconductors to the calculator industry. Beginning in the early '80s, we were the leading maker of stand-alone storage controllers for the original PC before we entered the hard drive business in 1988. Today, we're the world's unit volume leader in hard drives, having evolved from an exclusively desktop player to a broad-based, vertically integrated supplier to multiple market segments with an established consumer brand. So we have seen change and successfully embraced it throughout our history. 
We believe there is no one better positioned in the storage industry today than WD. We have a track record of good, crisp decision making and execution, a healthy balance sheet to enable prudent and smart investments and a business model that has generated sustained and consistently profitable growth. We remain focused on extending this trend. Tim Leyden will now cover the operational developments and highlights of the December quarter. Tim?"

The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear, and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess in",1395,"Thank you, John. The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear, and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess inventory out of the December quarter proved correct as we saw a moderation of the overweighting of workweek 13 shipments that had occurred in both the June and September quarters. 
Looking at our served markets in the December quarter. In the compute space, units increased from 114 million to 118 million. Commercial demand remained strong. And while overall consumer demand was below expectations, demand for hard drives was further tempered by inventory reductions both in the system supply chain and in the distribution channel. While the OEM PC shipments increased by nearly 4% sequentially, HDD shipments increased by only 2%, leading to a reduction in inventory within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. We also saw better matching of billed to true demand in the industry as a whole, which resulted in more linear shipments throughout the quarter and less pressure to ship higher volumes later in the quarter. The near-line enterprise market was down sequentially from 6.1 million to 5.7 million units. We believe this was a reflection of the fact that this segment's demand is driven by large discrete project expenditures, which drives lumpier demand patterns. On a full year basis, this segment grew by 50% in calendar year 2010 and now accounts for around 40% of enterprise shipments and will continue to be a high-growth area of the industry. After a three-year period below its previous demand high point, the traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units returned close to its prerecession level of 8.5 million, reflecting a continuing recovery in the commercial market. For the first time, shipments of the 2.5-inch platform exceeded shipments of the 3.5-inch form factor, validating our decision to direct our traditional enterprise investments towards 2.5-inch SAS. The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the Branded Products segment was at 14.7 million units, up from 11.6 million units in the September quarter and 11.3 million units in the year-ago quarter, presenting further evidence of continuing strong consumer demand for personal storage. In the DVR market segment, TAM was 12.1 million units, down sequentially from 13.2 million and up year-on-year from 11.3 million units. The balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. We shipped 52.2 million units in the December quarter, up 5.5% from the year-ago period and 3% sequentially, while the overall market grew by 4.4% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Revenues totaled $2.475 billion. We expanded gross margin by 19.2%, and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $225 million. Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $505 million. We are pleased that the moderating steps that we started in the September quarter relative to pricing, production builds, inventory alignment and capital expenditure achieved the desired result of keeping us within our business model parameters in the December quarter. Combined with a heightened emphasis on cost management, those actions contributed to our results being significantly better than we had guided in our October earnings call. We continue to focus on satisfying customer needs, staying on the industry areal density curve and providing competitive products while at the same time maintaining industry cost leadership. 
Consistent with the plans that we laid out in our October call, we optimized our profitable participation in the market in the December quarter while continuing to satisfy customer requirements. The adaptability of our business model enabled us to optimize mix and that, together with pricing discipline and tight cost management, including accelerated cost improvements from our recently acquired Singapore media facility, contributed to our better-than-expected gross margin. Despite this, we still fell short of the profitability levels that we would normally have expected to achieve in what has traditionally been ours and the industry's most profitable quarter of the year. This is a direct result of the cumulative impact of higher price declines than normal in both the June and September quarters. As a reminder, based on historical achievements in past December quarters, ordinarily, we would expect that the gross margin percentage would be above the midpoint of our margin model range of 18% to 23%. And we are not happy that our fiscal Q2 gross margin performance at 19.2% is well below the midpoint of that range as we get into the more seasonally challenging quarters of the year. 
While inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were well controlled in each segment, we still believe that despite a reduction of approximately 2 million to 3 million HDDs in the PC supply chain, there is still an inventory excess of some 6 million to 8 million HDD units in the PC manufacturers' pipeline, and this will place additional downward pressure on the HDD TAM in the March quarter. Bearing that in mind, we intend to depart from what has been the industry's typical approach to inventory holding and supply-demand balancing in the March quarter. Historically, over the last decade, PC volumes have shown an average unit volume decline of around 9% sequentially when March quarters are compared to the immediately preceding December quarters. Despite that PC industry historical demand trend, the HDD industry has typically shipped volumes that were down approximately 4% sequentially during the same period as HDD producers attempted to utilize the capacity that had already been put in place to service the seasonally stronger December quarter volumes. The consequence of this mismatch in unit volume trends between the PC and the HDD industries has been to put pressure on March quarter pricing, contribute to an inventory overhang exiting the March quarter and consequently exert further pricing pressure in the June quarter, which has repeatedly seen the weakest seasonal demand profile. Consequently, although we believe that end user demand would be around 160 million units, we are forecasting an HDD TAM of 155 million units for the last quarter as we anticipate some further flushing of excess inventory in the PC pipeline. Additionally, we expect volumes in DVR-Branded products and Enterprise segments to be seasonally flat to down sequentially. Despite this slower start to the calendar year, we expect to see mid- to high-single-digit HDD volume growth in calendar 2011. 
Now turning to our product lineup. We continue to focus on opportunities in the fastest growing market segments, which remains a key strategy for WD. Since our last report, we introduced new products and software that enable consumers to easily move data and content into, around and outside the home and experience their collection of movies, photos and music as well as premium content on the Internet. We launched the new flagship of our popular WD TV Media Player family of products, the WD TV Live Hub, which centralizes and streams movies, photos and music to any connected stream in the home with its 1 TB capacity, media server capability and seamless connection to premium content services such as Netflix, Blockbuster OnDemand and Facebook. We updated our other WD TV products with premium online services first introduced on WD TV Live Hub. With an update to our WD Photos application, we enabled Android smartphone users with the ability to access all their photos residing on My Book Live, My Book World Edition and WD ShareSpace network drives from anywhere in the world that they can connect to the Internet, a feature also available for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. 
In our core Hard Drive business, we began shipping the WD Scorpio Black mobile drive in 750 GB capacity for the road warrior who needs a 7200 RPM high performance and the capacity to carry an entire media collection while traveling. Earlier today, we underscored our long-term commitment to the Enterprise segment by bolstering our product portfolio with two new drive families. Our second-generation, 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM WD S25 SAS drive for mission-critical, high-performance server and storage applications available in both 450GB and 600GB capacities and a new 7200 RPM WD RE SAS 3.5-inch drive available in 1 TB and 2 TB capacities for near-line applications, a large and expanding market serving IT data centers and cloud computing applications. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q2 financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter."
314057,117491707,92514,"Western Digital Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2011",2011-01-18,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.4",1100,"Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.475 billion, down 5% from the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 52.2 million units, up 5% from the prior year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Player, WD LiveWire network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $57 million, up 21% from the prior year and up 54% from the September quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $5 from the year ago quarter and up $1 from the September quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $546 million, down 4% from the year ago quarter and up 28% sequentially. There were no customers that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, all regions contributed revenue gains with Europe showing the best comparative improvement on a sequential basis. From a channel perspective, OEM declined as a percentage of revenue as we actively managed shipments and inventory and the retail channel increased along these  expectations. We exceeded the upper end of our revenue guidance by $75 million, which was achieved through a combination of remixing our product and business segments, improved pricing discipline, resulting in lower like-for-like price declines, higher volume due to a slightly higher TAM and moderate market share gains. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 26.2% in the year ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the September quarter. And this gross margin exceeded our implied guidance by about 320 basis points. There were three main reasons for this. First, our like-for-like price declines were better than we had modeled. Second, we actively drove changes in our product and segment mix. Last but not least, our relentless effort to optimize our product cost yielded larger than anticipated like-for-like cost improvements, with one factor being that our recently acquired Singapore media facility achieved accretion more quickly than anticipated. We had modeled a 50 basis point dilution for the quarter, but we are now experiencing the 50 basis point accretion that we had built into our acquisition models. 
Total R&D and SG&A spending was $235 million or 9.5% of revenue. This compares with $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the September quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investment in our Branded Products business. 
Operating income was $240 million or 9.7% of revenue. This compares with $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $211 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were $1 million. 
Tax expense for the December quarter was $40 million or 5.9% of pretax income. The rate for the quarter reflects the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter. 
Our net income totaled $225 million or $0.96 per share. This compares with $429 million or $1.85 per share and $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year ago and September quarters, respectively. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was a negative two days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 26 days of inventory, or 14 turns, and 74 days of payables. We generated $505 million in cash flow from operations during the December quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $255 million. Capital additions for the December quarter totaled $215 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter totaled $151 million. We continue to expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue, plus up to $200 million for our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $620 million for the fiscal year. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the second quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $350 million. We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, an increase of $252 million from the September quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for fiscal Q3. As Tim indicated, over the last 10 years, PC shipments have declined on average 9% from the December to the March quarter. Yet, hard drive industry shipments have historically decreased by only 4%. This systematically creates a supply-demand dynamic that leads to significant price declines in this and subsequent quarters as we have experienced this past calendar year. Furthermore, despite the fact that the industry had made progress towards balancing supply and demand in the December quarter, we believe that there still remains an excess inventory of 6 million to 8 million units within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. Also, our sense of the market indicates higher than usual PC inventory levels in both the distribution and retail channels. 
With the objective of entering the June quarter with a more balanced inventory, we estimate that the hard drive industry TAM for the March quarter is unlikely to exceed 155 million units. We strongly believe that the effect from fixed cost underabsorption are of much lesser impact to the bottom line than subjecting the entire volume to significant price declines. Having said that, since we operate in a highly competitive market, we've modeled like-for-like price declines of 5%, in line with pricing trends in prior March quarters. We believe our value proposition will continue to resonate with our customers, and we will maintain focused on ROI through product and segment mix management. We continue to strengthen our investments in R&D and market development to support the significant opportunities in our medium and long-term future. Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $240 million; our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million; we expect our tax rate to be at the upper end of our business model of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million; we estimate earnings per share of between $0.55 and $0.65 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

And we're signaling our intent to do as much as we can in developing our build plans to eliminate those misalignments from the supply-demand dynamic. What our competitors do is entirely up to them.

With the transition with Exchange 2010, enabling folks to use SATA drives versus fibre channels, now you have EMC in primary storage where you're looking at SAS and SATA as a substitute for Fibre Channel, this historically has not been your real house. It's been more of Seagate's and Apache's. How should we think about this being the offset to some of these other dynamics you're talking about?"

As Tim highlighted, the movement to SAS as the predominant interface in that segment continues, and the transition from 3.5-inch to 2.5-inch form factor continues with 2.5-inch passing the 50% mark for the first time in the quarter just ended.
Our investments in that space -- we saw those trends emerging over the last several years. The two interfaces, SCSI and Fibre Channel, converging on SAS, and the 3.5-inch form factor transitioning to 2.5-inch. And therefore, over the past several years, as we began to invest in preparation for entry into the traditional enterprise market as one of the few remaining greenfield incremental growth opportunities for us, we focused in on investment in the 2.5-inch SAS environment. And we announced this morning shipments of our second-generation product in that space. If you look at history, our history and our entry into the 2.5-inch mobile arena, many companies' entry into new segments in the industry over time, typically you're in third- or fourth-generation products before you see significant market share traction. You use the first- and second-generation products to establish your credentials and demonstrate your fundamental capabilities of understanding the market segment. And having satisfied customers of that at relatively low volumes, you then begin to gain traction into a substantial presence. We believe that we're on track to achieve that kind of development within the 2.5-inch SAS traditional enterprise market, which, by the time we gain that traction, we expect that that form factor and interface will command over 70% of that marketplace total demand. In addition to that, you have the growth area of near-line storage, which typically, up till now over the last five years, has expanded using 24/7 high-reliability 3.5-inch SATA drives, what WD calls its RAID Edition products, and we have generated a substantial market position in that segment. And again, as Tim alluded to, that's about a 5 million unit market that has shown a 50% growth rate year-over-year and represents 40% of the total enterprise environment. And that's being driven primarily by cloud computing applications and, as we just announced this morning, a SAS product to service that market. And that demonstrates our ability to leverage core fundamental engineering investments. And then, once we had developed and launched our SAS interface into the market, now we're applying it to multiple platforms and multiple markets."

In the early days, the design and the software were pretty minimal. However, as we began to focus on that business, we identified, I believe, some critical success factors. One was the need for  a stylish and identifiable product ID. And we, quite outside our experience to that point, engaged professionals in that arena and invested significant amounts of money in creating the WD My Book and My Passport design style, which, based on market reaction, is quite compelling. We made some small investment in a software company several years ago that provides WD with the proprietary capability that drives the iPhone and Android apps that Tim described a moment ago and the ability to access any WD network-connected device through the Internet or throughout your home or office infrastructure. 
We have continued to invest in software capability. In our Branded business, our engineering resources are 60% software and 40% hardware. And then, overlaid on top of that has been the development of a very strong channel, both in the brick-and-mortar environment and the e-tail environment more recently, where we have developed very strong relationships with our channel partners. And it's really through those channel relationships that we have identified the opportunity to expand the product offering to solve consumers' total in-home experienced problem of how do you not only safely store the content but how do you then allow the consumer to easily experience that content. And as we explored consumers' expectations, as we explored our channel partners' view of us, we discovered that we had built up quite an amount of brand equity and that we were able to use that link with the engineering resources and the software development resources that we put into the media players to achieve quite a significant level of success. We think our 2.5 million units so far in that market in just a couple of years is pretty good. And so encouraged by that, we have broadened our view of what the total home experience should be and what kinds of devices and services can enhance that experience. And we're exploring ways to deliver those to our customers. For instance, one of the inhibitors in the home is -- to showing full HD video without jerkiness and without interruption is that in most homes, the networking environment is WiFi. And you can't quite keep up with a full HD, full-motion video in a WiFi environment. Most homes do not have broadly embedded dedicated network wires going to all the rooms. And so we came up with our Livewire products, a networking product that uses the power lines in the home so that in a very convenient way for the user, without any major infrastructure development, they can actually transmit all their high-definition video content to every screen in the home in a very cost-efficient and very simple and consumer friendly way. I mean, it is literally as simple as plugging the network wiring to your router and plugging the plug into your electrical outlet. So we're continuing to look at that opportunity, and we're continuing to broaden out the total product portfolio offering. The essence of it is simplicity. The essence of it is liberating the consumer from closed environments that are specific to one vendor or another and allowing multiple formats from multiple sources to be stored, shared and experienced."

And so what we're highlighting is the disconnect between the PC and the hard drive quarter-over-quarter declines, that is systemic, has been in place for 10 years while all these things were moving around and shifting and evolving. But even though we have significant markets outside of PC, DVR, personal storage, which is really more of a linkage to installed base than to the incremental new sales, nevertheless PC is a large portion of our total target market. And therefore, the way that the PC moves up and down, I believe now it's significant that we recognize that an attempt to manage the supply-demand and sync with that while also looking specifically at the other emerging and growing applications for hard drives and layering those on top of the PC-driven demand to get their own specific cadence. And while we haven't talked about that in detail in this guidance, it is underlying this guidance. We've looked at every market segment and formed a view about how it's going to perform and matched our supply plan to the demand that we perceive in those markets. Well, we believe that the fundamental disconnect -- and we can argue whether it's 9% versus 4% or whether it should be 9.5% versus 4%, but the fundamental piece is that overbuilding against true demand is a recipe for incremental inventory overhang, creating pressure on the marketplace and that the price we pay in underabsorption to moderate our supply to match the true demand profile is a much smaller price than the price we have been paying by maintaining production velocity, increasing inventories and then applying extreme pricing pressure to the entire volumes that we produce."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive indust",1144,"Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive industry with 651 million drives shipped. That's 330 million terabytes of storage capacity sold into a broadening set of applications and markets. At 16%, this was the industry's strongest full year unit growth in five years. Rotating magnetic storage remains the dominant technology solution for high-volume mass storage of digital content in both the consumer and commercial markets. Full year revenue for the industry expanded by some 13% to $34 billion. However, it was also a year of significant missed opportunity as the industry's supply-demand dynamic deteriorated as the year progressed, resulting in sharply declining ASPs, with the final quarter demonstrating a year-over-year decline in industry revenue of 7% on a unit increase of 4%, and an even sharper decline in profitability. 
WD again outperformed the industry in calendar 2010. We grew units 23%, revenues by 19% and operating income by 12%. The operating income number reflected the significant challenge of the industry's ASP deterioration that emerged midyear. While we improved our financial performance sequentially in the December quarter, we are far from happy that we failed to monetize our growth throughout the year and generate the kind of return needed to sustain robust investment in technologies and products to improve our customers' future experience. 
In the coming year, we expect the hard drive volume opportunity to approach 700 million units, representing a storage capacity of approximately 440 million terabytes. Our estimate of the investment required by the hard drive community, including our component suppliers, to support this growth is approximately $5 billion. So the need for the industry to perform well enough to sustain its critical role in the digital ecosystem should be clear to us, to our customers and to their customers. In reviewing how we can improve our future performance, we have identified a misalignment in how our industry typically begins the calendar year from a production standpoint, in contrast with the underlying demand trend of PCs, our largest served market. We are determined to start this year with the benefit of lessons learned from this analysis. And Tim and Wolfgang will elaborate on this approach later in this call. 
In addressing the calendar year 2011 market opportunity, we expect to continue to grow faster than the overall market by providing greater customer value and satisfaction than competition. We will continue to leverage our cost advantage and our relentless focus on high quality, reliability and availability of product especially in the industry's fastest growing market segments. We believe we can achieve this growth plan while at the same time improving the way in which we approach the supply-demand dynamic from the outset of the year. 
In the medium to long term, we are focused on multiple growth opportunities in both our core business and beyond. First, as I have said, we intend to continue to grow in our existing hard drive segments by providing superior availability, quality, reliability and value, a proven approach that has established us as a leading supplier in each of our served markets today. 
Second, we will leverage that same approach into the underpenetrated markets for WD of gaming and traditional enterprise. We have recently introduced our second-generation SAS product for the traditional enterprise market, along with our SAS offering for the high-capacity near-line storage market, and we believe our commitment and measured approach to these important markets will earn significant share as we deliver a succession of outstanding products to customers in the years ahead. 
Third, we are focused on growing our storage presence beyond rotating magnetic media through our leadership in the embedded SSD space and our planned entry into the Tier 0 Enterprise segment for SSD when that market evolves into a significant and profitable market opportunity. In the context of solid state technology, we also continue to evaluate the opportunity to combine rotating magnetic storage with flash into hybrid solutions. 
Fourth, as highlighted earlier this month at our analyst briefing at the Consumer Electronics Show, we are expanding our TAM by addressing the connected digital home market with products that integrate and bring to life consumers' personal and premium digital content. The acceleration of digital content creation offers almost unlimited opportunities for those smart enough to feel the pulse of the consumer and provide solutions to address the need to safely store, share and experience this growing mass of content, both private and public. This growth is being driven by relentless innovation in hardware and software, which in turn is enabling and encouraging new usage models, such as social media, which all compound to proliferate content and copies of content throughout the world. At WD, we view every device or system which enables and encourages content creation or consumption, including tablets, as a potential opportunity for expanded market participation, either directly or indirectly. Since fiscal 2004, WD has been at the forefront of the still nascent market for branded storage and connected home products with 85 million WD-branded products sold to consumers, including 2.5 million WD TV Media players. We believe this market has the potential to generate significant growth for WD in the years ahead. We will continue to review opportunities to invest in and expand our presence in these and additional aligned markets in the months ahead as part of our strategic evaluation of how to best create value for our shareholders. We're excited about the changing landscape of the digital ecosystem, which we see filled with opportunity for WD. Managing through changing times is in our DNA at WD. 
We would like to remind investors that we are entering the fourth decade in the storage solutions marketplace with some valuable experiences and lessons learned along the way. Very early on, we were one of the world's leading suppliers of specialized semiconductors to the calculator industry. Beginning in the early '80s, we were the leading maker of stand-alone storage controllers for the original PC before we entered the hard drive business in 1988. Today, we're the world's unit volume leader in hard drives, having evolved from an exclusively desktop player to a broad-based, vertically integrated supplier to multiple market segments with an established consumer brand. So we have seen change and successfully embraced it throughout our history. 
We believe there is no one better positioned in the storage industry today than WD. We have a track record of good, crisp decision making and execution, a healthy balance sheet to enable prudent and smart investments and a business model that has generated sustained and consistently profitable growth. We remain focused on extending this trend. Tim Leyden will now cover the operational developments and highlights of the December quarter. Tim?

The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear, and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess in",1395,"Thank you, John. The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear, and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess inventory out of the December quarter proved correct as we saw a moderation of the overweighting of workweek 13 shipments that had occurred in both the June and September quarters. 
Looking at our served markets in the December quarter. In the compute space, units increased from 114 million to 118 million. Commercial demand remained strong. And while overall consumer demand was below expectations, demand for hard drives was further tempered by inventory reductions both in the system supply chain and in the distribution channel. While the OEM PC shipments increased by nearly 4% sequentially, HDD shipments increased by only 2%, leading to a reduction in inventory within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. We also saw better matching of billed to true demand in the industry as a whole, which resulted in more linear shipments throughout the quarter and less pressure to ship higher volumes later in the quarter. The near-line enterprise market was down sequentially from 6.1 million to 5.7 million units. We believe this was a reflection of the fact that this segment's demand is driven by large discrete project expenditures, which drives lumpier demand patterns. On a full year basis, this segment grew by 50% in calendar year 2010 and now accounts for around 40% of enterprise shipments and will continue to be a high-growth area of the industry. After a three-year period below its previous demand high point, the traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units returned close to its prerecession level of 8.5 million, reflecting a continuing recovery in the commercial market. For the first time, shipments of the 2.5-inch platform exceeded shipments of the 3.5-inch form factor, validating our decision to direct our traditional enterprise investments towards 2.5-inch SAS. The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the Branded Products segment was at 14.7 million units, up from 11.6 million units in the September quarter and 11.3 million units in the year-ago quarter, presenting further evidence of continuing strong consumer demand for personal storage. In the DVR market segment, TAM was 12.1 million units, down sequentially from 13.2 million and up year-on-year from 11.3 million units. The balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. We shipped 52.2 million units in the December quarter, up 5.5% from the year-ago period and 3% sequentially, while the overall market grew by 4.4% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Revenues totaled $2.475 billion. We expanded gross margin by 19.2%, and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $225 million. Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $505 million. We are pleased that the moderating steps that we started in the September quarter relative to pricing, production builds, inventory alignment and capital expenditure achieved the desired result of keeping us within our business model parameters in the December quarter. Combined with a heightened emphasis on cost management, those actions contributed to our results being significantly better than we had guided in our October earnings call. We continue to focus on satisfying customer needs, staying on the industry areal density curve and providing competitive products while at the same time maintaining industry cost leadership. 
Consistent with the plans that we laid out in our October call, we optimized our profitable participation in the market in the December quarter while continuing to satisfy customer requirements. The adaptability of our business model enabled us to optimize mix and that, together with pricing discipline and tight cost management, including accelerated cost improvements from our recently acquired Singapore media facility, contributed to our better-than-expected gross margin. Despite this, we still fell short of the profitability levels that we would normally have expected to achieve in what has traditionally been ours and the industry's most profitable quarter of the year. This is a direct result of the cumulative impact of higher price declines than normal in both the June and September quarters. As a reminder, based on historical achievements in past December quarters, ordinarily, we would expect that the gross margin percentage would be above the midpoint of our margin model range of 18% to 23%. And we are not happy that our fiscal Q2 gross margin performance at 19.2% is well below the midpoint of that range as we get into the more seasonally challenging quarters of the year. 
While inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were well controlled in each segment, we still believe that despite a reduction of approximately 2 million to 3 million HDDs in the PC supply chain, there is still an inventory excess of some 6 million to 8 million HDD units in the PC manufacturers' pipeline, and this will place additional downward pressure on the HDD TAM in the March quarter. Bearing that in mind, we intend to depart from what has been the industry's typical approach to inventory holding and supply-demand balancing in the March quarter. Historically, over the last decade, PC volumes have shown an average unit volume decline of around 9% sequentially when March quarters are compared to the immediately preceding December quarters. Despite that PC industry historical demand trend, the HDD industry has typically shipped volumes that were down approximately 4% sequentially during the same period as HDD producers attempted to utilize the capacity that had already been put in place to service the seasonally stronger December quarter volumes. The consequence of this mismatch in unit volume trends between the PC and the HDD industries has been to put pressure on March quarter pricing, contribute to an inventory overhang exiting the March quarter and consequently exert further pricing pressure in the June quarter, which has repeatedly seen the weakest seasonal demand profile. Consequently, although we believe that end user demand would be around 160 million units, we are forecasting an HDD TAM of 155 million units for the last quarter as we anticipate some further flushing of excess inventory in the PC pipeline. Additionally, we expect volumes in DVR-Branded products and Enterprise segments to be seasonally flat to down sequentially. Despite this slower start to the calendar year, we expect to see mid- to high-single-digit HDD volume growth in calendar 2011. 
Now turning to our product lineup. We continue to focus on opportunities in the fastest growing market segments, which remains a key strategy for WD. Since our last report, we introduced new products and software that enable consumers to easily move data and content into, around and outside the home and experience their collection of movies, photos and music as well as premium content on the Internet. We launched the new flagship of our popular WD TV Media Player family of products, the WD TV Live Hub, which centralizes and streams movies, photos and music to any connected stream in the home with its 1 TB capacity, media server capability and seamless connection to premium content services such as Netflix, Blockbuster OnDemand and Facebook. We updated our other WD TV products with premium online services first introduced on WD TV Live Hub. With an update to our WD Photos application, we enabled Android smartphone users with the ability to access all their photos residing on My Book Live, My Book World Edition and WD ShareSpace network drives from anywhere in the world that they can connect to the Internet, a feature also available for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. 
In our core Hard Drive business, we began shipping the WD Scorpio Black mobile drive in 750 GB capacity for the road warrior who needs a 7200 RPM high performance and the capacity to carry an entire media collection while traveling. Earlier today, we underscored our long-term commitment to the Enterprise segment by bolstering our product portfolio with two new drive families. Our second-generation, 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM WD S25 SAS drive for mission-critical, high-performance server and storage applications available in both 450GB and 600GB capacities and a new 7200 RPM WD RE SAS 3.5-inch drive available in 1 TB and 2 TB capacities for near-line applications, a large and expanding market serving IT data centers and cloud computing applications. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q2 financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter.

I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.4",1100,"Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.475 billion, down 5% from the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 52.2 million units, up 5% from the prior year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Player, WD LiveWire network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $57 million, up 21% from the prior year and up 54% from the September quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $5 from the year ago quarter and up $1 from the September quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $546 million, down 4% from the year ago quarter and up 28% sequentially. There were no customers that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, all regions contributed revenue gains with Europe showing the best comparative improvement on a sequential basis. From a channel perspective, OEM declined as a percentage of revenue as we actively managed shipments and inventory and the retail channel increased along these  expectations. We exceeded the upper end of our revenue guidance by $75 million, which was achieved through a combination of remixing our product and business segments, improved pricing discipline, resulting in lower like-for-like price declines, higher volume due to a slightly higher TAM and moderate market share gains. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 26.2% in the year ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the September quarter. And this gross margin exceeded our implied guidance by about 320 basis points. There were three main reasons for this. First, our like-for-like price declines were better than we had modeled. Second, we actively drove changes in our product and segment mix. Last but not least, our relentless effort to optimize our product cost yielded larger than anticipated like-for-like cost improvements, with one factor being that our recently acquired Singapore media facility achieved accretion more quickly than anticipated. We had modeled a 50 basis point dilution for the quarter, but we are now experiencing the 50 basis point accretion that we had built into our acquisition models. 
Total R&D and SG&A spending was $235 million or 9.5% of revenue. This compares with $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the September quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investment in our Branded Products business. 
Operating income was $240 million or 9.7% of revenue. This compares with $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $211 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were $1 million. 
Tax expense for the December quarter was $40 million or 5.9% of pretax income. The rate for the quarter reflects the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter. 
Our net income totaled $225 million or $0.96 per share. This compares with $429 million or $1.85 per share and $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year ago and September quarters, respectively. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was a negative two days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 26 days of inventory, or 14 turns, and 74 days of payables. We generated $505 million in cash flow from operations during the December quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $255 million. Capital additions for the December quarter totaled $215 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter totaled $151 million. We continue to expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue, plus up to $200 million for our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $620 million for the fiscal year. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the second quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $350 million. We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, an increase of $252 million from the September quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for fiscal Q3. As Tim indicated, over the last 10 years, PC shipments have declined on average 9% from the December to the March quarter. Yet, hard drive industry shipments have historically decreased by only 4%. This systematically creates a supply-demand dynamic that leads to significant price declines in this and subsequent quarters as we have experienced this past calendar year. Furthermore, despite the fact that the industry had made progress towards balancing supply and demand in the December quarter, we believe that there still remains an excess inventory of 6 million to 8 million units within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. Also, our sense of the market indicates higher than usual PC inventory levels in both the distribution and retail channels. 
With the objective of entering the June quarter with a more balanced inventory, we estimate that the hard drive industry TAM for the March quarter is unlikely to exceed 155 million units. We strongly believe that the effect from fixed cost underabsorption are of much lesser impact to the bottom line than subjecting the entire volume to significant price declines. Having said that, since we operate in a highly competitive market, we've modeled like-for-like price declines of 5%, in line with pricing trends in prior March quarters. We believe our value proposition will continue to resonate with our customers, and we will maintain focused on ROI through product and segment mix management. We continue to strengthen our investments in R&D and market development to support the significant opportunities in our medium and long-term future. Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $240 million; our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million; we expect our tax rate to be at the upper end of our business model of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million; we estimate earnings per share of between $0.55 and $0.65 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.

With the transition with Exchange 2010, enabling folks to use SATA drives versus fibre channels, now you have EMC in primary storage where you're looking at SAS and SATA as a substitute for Fibre Channel, this historically has not been your real house.

As Tim highlighted, the movement to SAS as the predominant interface in that segment continues, and the transition from 3.5-inch to 2.5-inch form factor continues with 2.5-inch passing the 50% mark for the first time in the quarter just ended.
Our investments in that space -- we saw those trends emerging over the last several years. The two interfaces, SCSI and Fibre Channel, converging on SAS, and the 3.5-inch form factor transitioning to 2.5-inch. And therefore, over the past several years, as we began to invest in preparation for entry into the traditional enterprise market as one of the few remaining greenfield incremental growth opportunities for us, we focused in on investment in the 2.5-inch SAS environment. And we announced this morning shipments of our second-generation product in that space. If you look at history, our history and our entry into the 2.5-inch mobile arena, many companies' entry into new segments in the industry over time, typically you're in third- or fourth-generation products before you see significant market share traction. You use the first- and second-generation products to establish your credentials and demonstrate your fundamental capabilities of understanding the market segment. And having satisfied customers of that at relatively low volumes, you then begin to gain traction into a substantial presence. We believe that we're on track to achieve that kind of development within the 2.5-inch SAS traditional enterprise market, which, by the time we gain that traction, we expect that that form factor and interface will command over 70% of that marketplace total demand. In addition to that, you have the growth area of near-line storage, which typically, up till now over the last five years, has expanded using 24/7 high-reliability 3.5-inch SATA drives, what WD calls its RAID Edition products, and we have generated a substantial market position in that segment. And again, as Tim alluded to, that's about a 5 million unit market that has shown a 50% growth rate year-over-year and represents 40% of the total enterprise environment. And that's being driven primarily by cloud computing applications and, as we just announced this morning, a SAS product to service that market. And that demonstrates our ability to leverage core fundamental engineering investments. And then, once we had developed and launched our SAS interface into the market, now we're applying it to multiple platforms and multiple markets.

In the early days, the design and the software were pretty minimal. However, as we began to focus on that business, we identified, I believe, some critical success factors. One was the need for  a stylish and identifiable product ID. And we, quite outside our experience to that point, engaged professionals in that arena and invested significant amounts of money in creating the WD My Book and My Passport design style, which, based on market reaction, is quite compelling. We made some small investment in a software company several years ago that provides WD with the proprietary capability that drives the iPhone and Android apps that Tim described a moment ago and the ability to access any WD network-connected device through the Internet or throughout your home or office infrastructure. 
We have continued to invest in software capability. In our Branded business, our engineering resources are 60% software and 40% hardware. And then, overlaid on top of that has been the development of a very strong channel, both in the brick-and-mortar environment and the e-tail environment more recently, where we have developed very strong relationships with our channel partners. And it's really through those channel relationships that we have identified the opportunity to expand the product offering to solve consumers' total in-home experienced problem of how do you not only safely store the content but how do you then allow the consumer to easily experience that content. And as we explored consumers' expectations, as we explored our channel partners' view of us, we discovered that we had built up quite an amount of brand equity and that we were able to use that link with the engineering resources and the software development resources that we put into the media players to achieve quite a significant level of success. We think our 2.5 million units so far in that market in just a couple of years is pretty good. And so encouraged by that, we have broadened our view of what the total home experience should be and what kinds of devices and services can enhance that experience. And we're exploring ways to deliver those to our customers. For instance, one of the inhibitors in the home is -- to showing full HD video without jerkiness and without interruption is that in most homes, the networking environment is WiFi. And you can't quite keep up with a full HD, full-motion video in a WiFi environment. Most homes do not have broadly embedded dedicated network wires going to all the rooms. And so we came up with our Livewire products, a networking product that uses the power lines in the home so that in a very convenient way for the user, without any major infrastructure development, they can actually transmit all their high-definition video content to every screen in the home in a very cost-efficient and very simple and consumer friendly way. I mean, it is literally as simple as plugging the network wiring to your router and plugging the plug into your electrical outlet. So we're continuing to look at that opportunity, and we're continuing to broaden out the total product portfolio offering. The essence of it is simplicity. The essence of it is liberating the consumer from closed environments that are specific to one vendor or another and allowing multiple formats from multiple sources to be stored, shared and experienced.

And so what we're highlighting is the disconnect between the PC and the hard drive quarter-over-quarter declines, that is systemic, has been in place for 10 years while all these things were moving around and shifting and evolving. But even though we have significant markets outside of PC, DVR, personal storage, which is really more of a linkage to installed base than to the incremental new sales, nevertheless PC is a large portion of our total target market. And therefore, the way that the PC moves up and down, I believe now it's significant that we recognize that an attempt to manage the supply-demand and sync with that while also looking specifically at the other emerging and growing applications for hard drives and layering those on top of the PC-driven demand to get their own specific cadence. And while we haven't talked about that in detail in this guidance, it is underlying this guidance. We've looked at every market segment and formed a view about how it's going to perform and matched our supply plan to the demand that we perceive in those markets. Well, we believe that the fundamental disconnect -- and we can argue whether it's 9% versus 4% or whether it should be 9.5% versus 4%, but the fundamental piece is that overbuilding against true demand is a recipe for incremental inventory overhang, creating pressure on the marketplace and that the price we pay in underabsorption to moderate our supply to match the true demand profile is a much smaller price than the price we have been paying by maintaining production velocity, increasing inventories and then applying extreme pricing pressure to the entire volumes that we produce.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive indust",1146,"Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive industry with 651 million drives shipped. That's 330 million terabytes of storage capacity sold into a broadening set of applications and markets. At 16%, this was the industry's strongest full year unit growth in five years. Rotating magnetic storage remains the dominant technology solution for high-volume mass storage of digital content in both the consumer and commercial markets. Full year revenue for the industry expanded by some 13% to $34 billion. However, it was also a year of significant missed opportunity as the industry's supply-demand dynamic deteriorated as the year progressed, resulting in sharply declining ASPs, with the final quarter demonstrating a year-over-year decline in industry revenue of 7% on a unit increase of 4%, and an even sharper decline in profitability. 
WD again outperformed the industry in calendar 2010. We grew units 23%, revenues by 19% and operating income by 12%. The operating income number reflected the significant challenge of the industry's ASP deterioration that emerged midyear. While we improved our financial performance sequentially in the December quarter, we are far from happy that we failed to monetize our growth throughout the year and generate the kind of return needed to sustain robust investment in technologies and products to improve our customers' future experience. 
In the coming year, we expect the hard drive volume opportunity to approach 700 million units, representing a storage capacity of approximately 440 million terabytes. Our estimate of the investment required by the hard drive community, including our component suppliers, to support this growth is approximately $5 billion. So the need for the industry to perform well enough to sustain its critical role in the digital ecosystem should be clear to us, to our customers and to their customers. In reviewing how we can improve our future performance, we have identified a misalignment in how our industry typically begins the calendar year from a production standpoint, in contrast with the underlying demand trend of PCs, our largest served market. We are determined to start this year with the benefit of lessons learned from this analysis. And Tim and Wolfgang will elaborate on this approach later in this call. 
In addressing the calendar year 2011 market opportunity, we expect to continue to grow faster than the overall market by providing greater customer value and satisfaction than competition. We will continue to leverage our cost advantage and our relentless focus on high quality, reliability and availability of product especially in the industry's fastest growing market segments. We believe we can achieve this growth plan while at the same time improving the way in which we approach the supply-demand dynamic from the outset of the year. 
In the medium to long term, we are focused on multiple growth opportunities in both our core business and beyond. First, as I have said, we intend to continue to grow in our existing hard drive segments by providing superior availability, quality, reliability and value, a proven approach that has established us as a leading supplier in each of our served markets today. 
Second, we will leverage that same approach into the under penetrated markets for WD of gaming and traditional enterprise. We have recently introduced our second-generation SAS product for the traditional enterprise market, along with our first SAS offering for the high-capacity near-line storage market, and we believe our commitment and measured approach to these important markets will earn significant share as we deliver a succession of outstanding products to customers in the years ahead. 
Third, we are focused on growing our storage presence beyond rotating magnetic media through our leadership in the embedded SSD space and our planned entry into the Tier 0 Enterprise segment for SSD when that market evolves into a significant and profitable market opportunity. In the context of solid state technology, we also continue to evaluate the opportunity to combine rotating magnetic storage with flash into hybrid solutions. 
Fourth, as highlighted earlier this month at our analyst briefing at the Consumer Electronics Show, we are expanding our TAM by addressing the connected digital home market with products that integrate and bring to life consumers' personal and premium digital content. The acceleration of digital content creation offers almost unlimited opportunities for those smart enough to feel the pulse of the consumer and provide solutions to address the need to safely store, share and experience this growing mass of content, both private and public. This growth is being driven by relentless innovation in hardware and software, which in turn is enabling and encouraging new usage models, such as social media, which all compound to proliferate content and copies of content throughout the world. At WD, we view every device or system which enables and encourages content creation or consumption, including tablets, as a potential opportunity for expanded market participation, either directly or indirectly. Since fiscal 2004, WD has been at the forefront of the still nascent market for branded storage and connected home products with 85 million WD-branded products sold to consumers, including 2.5 million WD TV Media players. We believe this market has the potential to generate significant growth for WD in the years ahead. We will continue to review opportunities to invest in and expand our presence in these and additional aligned markets in the months ahead as part of our strategic evaluation of how to best create value for our shareholders. We're excited about the changing landscape of the digital ecosystem, which we see filled with opportunity for WD. Managing through changing times is in our DNA at WD. 
We would like to remind investors that we are entering the fourth decade in the storage solutions marketplace with some valuable experiences and lessons learned along the way. Very early on, we were one of the world's leading suppliers of specialized semiconductors to the calculator industry. Beginning in the early '80s, we were the leading maker of stand-alone storage controllers for the original PC before we entered the hard drive business in 1988. Today, we're the world's unit volume leader in hard drives, having evolved from an exclusively desktop player to a broad-based, vertically integrated supplier to multiple market segments with an established consumer brand. So we have seen change and successfully embraced it throughout our history. 
We believe there is no one better positioned in the storage industry today than WD. We have a track record of good, crisp decision making and execution, a healthy balance sheet to enable prudent and smart investments and a business model that has generated sustained and consistently profitable growth. We remain focused on extending this trend. Tim Leyden will now cover the operational developments and highlights of the December quarter. Tim?"

The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear, and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess in",1395,"Thank you, John. The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear, and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess inventory out of the December quarter proved correct as we saw a moderation of the overweighting of workweek 13 shipments that had occurred in both the June and September quarters. 
Looking at our served markets in the December quarter. In the compute space, units increased from 114 million to 118 million. Commercial demand remained strong. And while overall consumer demand was below expectations, demand for hard drives was further tempered by inventory reductions both in the system supply chain and in the distribution channel. While the OEM PC shipments increased by nearly 4% sequentially, HDD shipments increased by only 2%, leading to a reduction in inventory within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. We also saw better matching of billed to true demand in the industry as a whole, which resulted in more linear shipments throughout the quarter and less pressure to ship higher volumes later in the quarter. The near-line enterprise market was down sequentially from 6.1 million to 5.7 million units. We believe this was a reflection of the fact that this segment's demand is driven by large discrete project expenditures, which drives lumpier demand patterns. On a full year basis, this segment grew by 50% in calendar year 2010 and now accounts for around 40% of enterprise shipments and will continue to be a high-growth area of the industry. After a three-year period below its previous demand high point, the traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units returned close to its prerecession level of 8.5 million, reflecting a continuing recovery in the commercial market. For the first time, shipments of the 2.5-inch platform exceeded shipments of the 3.5-inch form factor, validating our decision to direct our traditional enterprise investments towards 2.5-inch SAS. The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the Branded Products segment was at 14.7 million units, up from 11.6 million units in the September quarter and 11.3 million units in the year-ago quarter, presenting further evidence of continuing strong consumer demand for personal storage. In the DVR market segment, TAM was 12.1 million units, down sequentially from 13.2 million and up year-on-year from 11.3 million units. The balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. We shipped 52.2 million units in the December quarter, up 5.5% from the year-ago period and 3% sequentially, while the overall market grew by 4.4% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Revenues totaled $2.475 billion. We expanded gross margin by 19.2%, and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $225 million. Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $505 million. We are pleased that the moderating steps that we started in the September quarter relative to pricing, production builds, inventory alignment and capital expenditure achieved the desired result of keeping us within our business model parameters in the December quarter. Combined with a heightened emphasis on cost management, those actions contributed to our results being significantly better than we had guided in our October earnings call. We continue to focus on satisfying customer needs, staying on the industry areal density curve and providing competitive products while at the same time maintaining industry cost leadership. 
Consistent with the plans that we laid out in our October call, we optimized our profitable participation in the market in the December quarter while continuing to satisfy customer requirements. The adaptability of our business model enabled us to optimize mix and that, together with pricing discipline and tight cost management, including accelerated cost improvements from our recently acquired Singapore media facility, contributed to our better-than-expected gross margin. Despite this, we still fell short of the profitability levels that we would normally have expected to achieve in what has traditionally been ours and the industry's most profitable quarter of the year. This is a direct result of the cumulative impact of higher price declines than normal in both the June and September quarters. As a reminder, based on historical achievements in past December quarters, ordinarily, we would expect that the gross margin percentage would be above the midpoint of our margin model range of 18% to 23%. And we are not happy that our fiscal Q2 gross margin performance at 19.2% is well below the midpoint of that range as we head into the more seasonally challenging quarters of the year. 
While inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were well controlled in each segment, we still believe that despite a reduction of approximately 2 million to 3 million HDDs in the PC supply chain, there is still an inventory excess of some 6 million to 8 million HDD units in the PC manufacturers' pipeline, and this will place additional downward pressure on the HDD TAM in the March quarter. Bearing that in mind, we intend to depart from what has been the industry's typical approach to inventory holding and supply-demand balancing in the March quarter. Historically, over the last decade, PC volumes have shown an average unit volume decline of around 9% sequentially when March quarters are compared to the immediately preceding December quarters. Despite that PC industry historical demand trend, the HDD industry has typically shipped volumes that were down approximately 4% sequentially during the same period as HDD producers attempted to utilize the capacity that had already been put in place to service the seasonally stronger December quarter volumes. The consequence of this mismatch in unit volume trends between the PC and the HDD industries has been to put pressure on March quarter pricing, contribute to an inventory overhang exiting the March quarter and consequently exert further pricing pressure in the June quarter, which has repeatedly seen the weakest seasonal demand profile. Consequently, although we believe that end user demand would be around 160 million units, we are forecasting an HDD TAM of 155 million units for the last quarter as we anticipate some further flushing of excess inventory in the PC pipeline. Additionally, we expect volumes in DVR-Branded products and Enterprise segments to be seasonally flat to down sequentially. Despite this slower start to the calendar year, we expect to see mid- to high-single-digit HDD volume growth in calendar 2011. 
Now turning to our product lineup. We continue to focus on opportunities in the fastest growing market segments, which remains a key strategy for WD. Since our last report, we introduced new products and software that enable consumers to easily move data and content into, around and outside the home and experience their collection of movies, photos and music as well as premium content on the Internet. We launched the new flagship of our popular WD TV Media Player family of products, the WD TV Live Hub, which centralizes and streams movies, photos and music to any connected screen in the home with its 1 TB capacity, media server capability and seamless connection to premium content services such as Netflix, Blockbuster OnDemand and Facebook. We updated our other WD TV products with premium online services first introduced on WD TV Live Hub. With an update to our WD Photos application, we enabled Android smartphone users with the ability to access all their photos residing on My Book Live, My Book World Edition and WD ShareSpace network drives from anywhere in the world that they can connect to the Internet, a feature also available for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. 
In our core Hard Drive business, we began shipping the WD Scorpio Black mobile drive in 750 GB capacity for the road warrior who needs a 7200 RPM high performance and the capacity to carry an entire media collection while traveling. Earlier today, we underscored our long-term commitment to the Enterprise segment by bolstering our product portfolio with two new drive families. Our second-generation, 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM WD S25 SAS drive for mission-critical, high-performance server and storage applications available in both 450GB and 600GB capacities and a new 7200 RPM WD RE SAS 3.5-inch drive available in 1 TB and 2 TB capacities for near-line applications, a large and expanding market serving IT data centers and cloud computing applications. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q2 financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter."
314057,117491707,92566,"Western Digital Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2011",2011-01-18,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.4",1101,"Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.475 billion, down 5% from the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 52.2 million units, up 5% from the prior year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Player, WD LiveWire network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $57 million, up 21% from the prior year and up 54% from the September quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $5 from the year ago quarter and up $1 from the September quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $546 million, down 4% from the year ago quarter and up 28% sequentially. There were no customers that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, all regions contributed revenue gains with Europe showing the best comparative improvement on a sequential basis. From a channel perspective, OEM declined as a percentage of revenue as we actively managed shipments and inventory and the retail channel increased along seasonal expectations. We exceeded the upper end of our revenue guidance by $75 million, which was achieved through a combination of remixing our product and business segments, improved pricing discipline, resulting in lower like-for-like price declines, higher volume due to a slightly higher TAM and moderate market share gains. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 26.2% in the year ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the September quarter. And this gross margin exceeded our implied guidance by about 320 basis points. There were three main reasons for this. First, our like-for-like price declines were better than we had modeled. Second, we actively drove changes in our product and segment mix. Last but not least, our relentless effort to optimize our product cost yielded larger than anticipated like-for-like cost improvements, with one factor being that our recently acquired Singapore media facility achieved accretion more quickly than anticipated. We had modeled a 50 basis point dilution for the quarter, but we are now experiencing the 50 basis point accretion that we had built into our acquisition models. 
Total R&D and SG&A spending was $235 million or 9.5% of revenue. This compares with $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the September quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investment in our Branded Products business. 
Operating income was $240 million or 9.7% of revenue. This compares with $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $211 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were $1 million. 
Tax expense for the December quarter was $40 million or 5.9% of pretax income. The rate for the quarter reflects the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter. 
Our net income totaled $225 million or $0.96 per share. This compares with $429 million or $1.85 per share and $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year ago and September quarters, respectively. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was a negative two days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 26 days of inventory, or 14 turns, and 74 days of payables. We generated $505 million in cash flow from operations during the December quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $255 million. Capital additions for the December quarter totaled $215 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter totaled $151 million. We continue to expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue, plus up to $200 million for our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $620 million for the fiscal year. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the second quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $350 million. We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, an increase of $252 million from the September quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for fiscal Q3. As Tim indicated, over the last 10 years, PC shipments have declined on average 9% from the December to the March quarter. Yet, hard drive industry shipments have historically decreased by only 4%. This systematically creates a supply-demand dynamic that leads to significant price declines in this and subsequent quarters as we have experienced this past calendar year. Furthermore, despite the fact that the industry had made progress towards balancing supply and demand in the December quarter, we believe that there still remains an excess inventory of 6 million to 8 million units within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. Also, our sense of the market indicates higher than usual PC inventory levels in both the distribution and retail channels. 
With the objective of entering the June quarter with a more balanced inventory, we estimate that the hard drive industry TAM for the March quarter is unlikely to exceed 155 million units. We strongly believe that the effect from fixed cost under absorption are of much lesser impact to the bottom line than subjecting the entire volume to significant price declines. Having said that, since we operate in a highly competitive market, we've modeled like-for-like price declines of 5%, in line with pricing trends in prior March quarters. We believe our value proposition will continue to resonate with our customers, and we will maintain focused on ROI through product and segment mix management. We continue to strengthen our investments in R&D and market development to support the significant opportunities in our medium and long-term future. Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $240 million; our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million; we expect our tax rate to be at the upper end of our business model of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million; we estimate earnings per share of between $0.55 and $0.65 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

And we will observe how the market's progressing through the quarter, and we'll take appropriate actions to ensure that we present our customers with opportunity.

It's been more of Seagate's and Apache's. How should we think about this being the offset to some of these other dynamics you're talking about?"

As Tim highlighted, the movement to SAS as the predominant interface in that segment continues, and the transition from 3.5-inch to 2.5-inch form factor continues with 2.5-inch passing the 50% mark for the first time in the quarter just ended.
Our investments in that space -- we saw those trends emerging over the last several years. The two interfaces, SCSI and Fibre Channel, converging on SAS, and the 3.5-inch form factor transitioning to 2.5-inch. And therefore, over the past several years, as we began to invest in preparation for entry into the traditional enterprise market as one of the few remaining greenfield incremental growth opportunities for us, we focused in on investment in the 2.5-inch SAS environment. And we announced this morning shipments of our second-generation product in that space. If you look at history, our history and our entry into the 2.5-inch mobile arena, many companies' entry into new segments in the industry over time, typically you're in third- or fourth-generation products before you see significant market share traction. You use the first- and second-generation products to establish your credentials and demonstrate your fundamental capabilities of understanding the market segment. And having satisfied customers of that at relatively low volumes, you then begin to gain traction into a substantial presence. We believe that we're on track to achieve that kind of development within the 2.5-inch SAS traditional enterprise market, which, by the time we gain that traction, we expect that, that form factor and interface will command over 70% of that marketplace total demand. In parallel to that, you have the growth area of near-line storage, which is typically, up till now over the last five years, has expanded using a 24/7 high-reliability 3.5-inch SATA drives, what WD calls its RAID Edition products, and we have generated a substantial market position in that segment. And again, as Tim alluded to, that's about a 5 million unit market that has shown a 50% growth rate year-over-year and represents 40% of the total enterprise environment. And that's being driven primarily by cloud computing applications and, as we just announced this morning, a SAS product to service that market. And that demonstrates our ability to leverage core fundamental engineering investments. And then, once we had developed and launched our SAS interface into the market, now we're applying it to multiple platforms and multiple markets."

In the early days, the design and the software were pretty minimal. However, as we began to focus on that business, we identified, I believe, some critical success factors. One was the need for  a stylish and identifiable product ID. And we, quite outside our experience to that point, engaged professionals in that arena and invested significant amounts of money in creating the WD My Book and My Passport design style, which, based on market reaction, is quite compelling. We made some small investment in a software company several years ago that provides WD with the proprietary capability that drives the iPhone and Android apps that Tim described a moment ago and the ability to access any WD network-connected device through the Internet or throughout your home or office infrastructure. 
We have continued to invest in software capability. In our Branded business, our engineering resources are 60% software and 40% hardware. And then, overlaid on top of that has been the development of a very strong channel, both in the brick-and-mortar environment and the e-tail environment more recently, where we have developed very strong relationships with our channel partners. And it's really through those channel relationships that we have identified the opportunity to expand the product offering to solve consumers' total in-home experienced problem of how do you not only safely store the content but how do you then allow the consumer to easily experience that content. And as we explored consumers' expectations, as we explored our channel partners' view of us, we discovered that we had built up quite an amount of brand equity and that we were able to use that linked with the engineering resources and the software development resources that we put into the media players to achieve quite a significant level of success. We think our 2.5 million units so far in that market in just a couple of years is pretty good. And so encouraged by that, we have broadened our view of what the total home experience should be and what kinds of devices and services can enhance that experience. And we're exploring ways to deliver those to our customers. For instance, one of the inhibitors in the home is -- to showing full HD video without jerkiness and without interruption is that in most homes, the networking environment is WiFi. And you can't quite keep up with a full HD, full-motion video in a WiFi environment. Most homes do not have broadly embedded dedicated network wires going to all the rooms. And so we came up with our Livewire products, a networking product that uses the power lines in the home so that in a very convenient way for the user, without any major infrastructure development, they can actually transmit all their high-definition video content to every screen in the home in a very cost-efficient and very simple and consumer friendly way. I mean, it is literally as simple as plugging the network wiring to your router and plugging the plug into your electrical outlet. So we're continuing to look at that opportunity, and we're continuing to broaden out the total product portfolio offering. The essence of it is simplicity. The essence of it is liberating the consumer from closed environments that are specific to one vendor or another and allowing multiple formats from multiple sources to be stored, shared and experienced."

And so what we're highlighting is the disconnect between the PC and the hard drive quarter-over-quarter declines, that is systemic, has been in place for 10 years while all these things were moving around and shifting and evolving. But even though we have significant markets outside of PC, DVR, personal storage, which is really more of a linkage to installed base than to the incremental new sales, nevertheless PC is a large portion of our total target market. And therefore, the way that the PC moves up and down, I believe now it's significant that we recognize that an attempt to manage the supply-demand and sync with that while also looking specifically at the other emerging and growing applications for hard drives and layering those on top of the PC-driven demand to get their own specific cadence. And while we haven't talked about that in detail in this guidance, it is underlying this guidance. We've looked at every market segment and formed a view about how it's going to perform and matched our supply plan to the demand that we perceive in those markets. Well, we believe that the fundamental disconnect -- and we can argue whether it's 9% versus 4% or whether it should be 9.5% versus 4%, but the fundamental thesis is that overbuilding against the true demand is a recipe for incremental inventory overhang, creating pressure on the marketplace and that the price we pay in under absorption to moderate our supply to match the true demand profile is a much smaller price than the price we have been paying by maintaining production velocity, increasing inventories and then applying extreme pricing pressure to the entire volumes that we produce."

With me on our Q3 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. First and foremost, we were pleased to determine in early March that Western Digital employees in Japan, as well as those of Hitachi GST were all safe after the tragic events of last month. Those personally affected by these events continue to be in our thoughts. Like many technology companies, we have been busy dealing with the disruptions resulting from the events in Japan. We are also proceeding on plan with our acquisition of HGST and have made significant process on that front. We are in the approval process with all of the required regulatory agencies. Our integration planning is well underway and we have successfully syndicated the loan financing associated with the transaction. We remain very excited about the potential of this acquisition. 
Industry shipments came in at 160 million units for the March quarter, slightly above our original expectation of 155 million units. As customers accelerated product purchases in the last three weeks of the quarter due to supply concerns as a result of the Japanese earthquake. Analyzing the effects of the events in Japan, on the technology industry generally, there were and remain a number of supply chain challenges, which are impacting both demand and supply visibility in the June quarter and beyond.  Tim will describe these in more detail. But I am pleased that the WD team with strong support from our suppliers, has mitigated the initial impact on our ability to support pre-earthquake customer share awards for the June quarter. We have now turned our attention to responding to customer upside requests for this quarter, which we believe are driven by unresolved supply chain issues at competitors and to fully supporting customer needs in the September quarter. We believe end customer demand for the June quarter in all markets for HDD's is tracking to seasonally normal patterns. However, there is uncertainty around the ability of our customers and the HDD industry to fully satisfy this demand due to supply chain challenges. In uncertain times like these, we believe a highly flexible and responsive WD business model is especially well-equipped to perform and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. I would now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational challenges and highlights in the March quarter in greater detail."

Entering the March quarter, we aligned our business with the 155 million unit TAM that we have forecasted in the January earnings call.

Entering the March quarter, we aligned our business with the 155 million unit TAM that we have forecasted in the January earnings call. With responding to the expected increase in TAM, triggered by the series of uncertain supply in the last few weeks of the quarter, our adaptable model enabled us to react rapidly to the upturn in demand and satisfy the actual TAM of 160 million units. 
Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected. Overall product capacity mix was relatively flat with type cost management enabled us to come in at the high-end of our implied gross margin guidance. We shipped 49.8 million units in the March quarter, down 4.6% sequentially and 2.5% from the year ago period. While the overall market decline by 4.8%, and 2.3%, respectively. 
Revenues totaled $2.25 billion. Gross margin was at 18.2% and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $146 million. We generated strong cash flow from operations of $313 million. 
Now turning to the overall market. In the compute space, units decrease sequentially from 116 million to 112 million. And decreased year-on-year from 119 million. We believe that the softer demand in the March quarter was driven to some extent by the late supply of CPUs to PC ODMs. Commercial demand strength continued while consumer demand will remain subdued. Against this backdrop, WD ship 36.3 million units into the compute space in the March quarter, compared to 37.8 million units in the December quarter, and 38.5 million units in the year ago quarter. 
As we maintained essentially flat market share in all three areas.
In the airline enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.4 million to 5.6 million units, and up from 5.2 million units year-on-year. Driven by the expansion of cloud computing, this market continues to offer further growth opportunity. The traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units remain flat with the December quarter and was up year-on-year from 7.4 million units, reflecting the continued strength of the commercial market. The shift to 2.5-inch sets continued as a percentage of total market represented by this platform has now advanced to around 54% of the TAM. WD shipped 2.3 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the March quarter. 
Essentially flat with the December and year ago quarters. We continue to put the building blocks in place to increase our presence in the traditional enterprise space and we're shipping out second-generation fast products to eliminate customer set and we continue to work on our third generation product. 
The HDD manufactures time in the branded product segment came in at 13 million units. Seasonally down from 14.7 million units in the December quarter and up from 10.7 million units in the year ago quarter. Presenting continued evidence of strong demand for personal storage. The seasonal cadence of this market is such that selling exceed sell through during the December quarter. You know it has adequate inventory in place for the holiday and post-holiday sales, whereas sell through exceeds sell-in during the March quarter as distributors and retailers lighten up our inventory in preparation for the seasonally weaker June quarter. WD shipped 6.4 million units into this market in the March quarter, down from 7.4 million units in the December quarter and up from 5.6 million units in the year ago quarter. We continue to compete strongly in this market segment where our brand equity, product lineup and differentiating features has earned us the leading position. 
In the DDR market segment, the TAM was 13.5 million units, down sequentially from 14.3 million, and up from 12.1 million in the year ago quarter. WD shipped 4.7 million units into this market in the March quarter, essentially flat with the December quarter and up slightly from 4.6 million in the year ago quarter. WDs product capabilities resonate with customers in this segment, and we continue to see growth opportunities as HDD's offered the Best value proposition to store and enjoy video content. The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8 in stripes. Inventories in the HDD supply-chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. 
Now turning to the June quarter. We believe that in an environment absent the impact of the Japanese earthquake, that the true demand for HDDs in the compute space will follow seasonal demand patterns, and will be flat to down from the March quarter. However, given the likely impacts, we believe that HDD TAM in the June quarter will be supply constrained. Shortages at this point appear to be more acute in 2.5-inch drives but we expect the product will also be short in the 3.5-inch form factor. Assuming the customer demand is not impacted by an inability to get other components that they need to build their systems. There are multiple levels of the supply chain of which availability problems may occur, from base chemicals up to final district components. And issues at each levels are still being worked by us, our suppliers and our customers. In the meantime, our customers are ordering what they can in order to reduce the number of direct individual supply concerns. We are planning our normal June quarter demand and we have underpinned supply to satisfy that level of unit volume. We are now looking to support our customers with the upside supplied in response to the request as they try to bridge shortages from other HDD suppliers. As John indicated, it is on uncertain times like these that WD flexible and responsive models and our consistency and execution enabled us to serve our customers well. 
In our other served markets, we expect volumes in DDR to be up seasonally, branded products to be down and enterprise segments to be flat. Now turning to our product line-up. We introduced new capacities for users of consumer network storage and high speed direct attached storage. We began populating our industry-leading My Book external drives with our 3 terabyte hard drives. Creative PC professionals and MAC enthusiasts, now can utilize the 6 terabyte My Book Studio addition to tool storage systems to support their ever increasing production of HD content. This 2 drive storage system has 4 interfaces, including he said 800 and firewire 800 for the fastest transfer speeds, create capability and Apple time machine compatibility. 
Our fast My Book live network drive was a total capacity of 3 terabytes now centralizes more media than ever before in consumers homes. We also added functionality to our WD TV Live major players, including cinema now, which revise users access to new release movies and TV episodes. New metric features, including the ability to search for movies and get recommendations directly on users HDTV, as well as support for enhanced audio with Dolby digital plus. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q3 financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

Summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q4 guidance after this call. Our Q3 actual results was slightly above the upper end of the guidance range we provided during our January investor call. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $2.25 billion, down 15% from the prior year and 9% sequentially. Operation shipments totaled 49.8 million units, down 3% from the prior year period and 5% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players, WD Life Wire Network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $50 million, up 8% from the prior year, and down 12% from the December quarter. 
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $45 per unit, down $6 from the year ago quarter and $2 from the December quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $441 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter and 19% sequentially. There was no single customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically the reach contributed roughly the same relative percentage of revenue as in the December quarter, with Asia's sales continuing to represent the majority of our revenue. From a channel perspective, retails percentage of revenue decline along seasonal expectations, while our OEM percentage increased slightly. Our gross margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 25.2% in the year ago quarter, and 19.2% in the December quarter. 
The quarter-over-quarter reduction of gross margin by 100 basis points is a function of a seasonal decline in our branded products business and some cost of under absorption of our manufacturing assets due to a reduced build plan. Total R&D in SG&A spending was $252 million, including $10 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition of HGST. Excluding these acquisition-related expenses, R&D in SG&A would have totaled $242 million or 10.7% of revenue. This compares with $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $235 million or 9.5% of revenue in the December quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product development and higher incentive accruals. 
Operating income was $158 million or 7% of revenue, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $168 million or 7.5% of revenue. This compares with $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $240 million or 9.7% of revenue in the December quarter. 
Net interest and other nonoperating income was $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $13 million or 8.2% of pretax income. Our net income totaled $146 million or $0.62 per share, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income totaled $156 million or $0.66 per share. This compares with $400 million or $1.71 per share and $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago and December quarters respectively. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables, 28 days of inventory or 13 terms and 73 days of payables. We generated $313 million in cash flow from operations during the March quarter and our free cash flow totaled $138 million. Capital expenditures for the March quarter totaled $175 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter totaled $151 million. 
We have lowered our forecast for capital expenditures and depreciation. We now expect our capital spending for the current fiscal year to be between $775 million and $800 million, including approximately $100 million for our 6 to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditure to optimize the output from our Singapore media facility we acquired last year. 
Depreciation and amortization is now expected to be about $610 million for the current fiscal year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning carryover spending of up to $100 million for 6 to 8-inch wafer conversion in Singapore major facility optimization. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the third quarter and thereby reduced our debt balance to $325 million. We exited fiscal Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion, an increase of $120 million from the December quarter. 
Before I talk about our Q4 guidance, let me update you on the profits we made on the debt financing related to our planned acquisition of HGST. The cash portion of the purchase price will come from available offshore cash and new debt. Our existing term loan will be repaid from available cash balances. The new debt will not be rated but will have terms similar to investment rate debt and covenants at a very similar to what we have now. The new credit facility will consists of a term loan of up to $2.5 billion, and a $500 million revolving line of credit. We're fully negotiated for the definitive loan documents with the Syndicate members and subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of the acquisition in accordance with its terms we fully expect all of the syndicate members to be part of the final lender  group. The term loan and any amount thrown under the line of credit will carry an interest rate of LIBOR plus the margin that is based on our leverage ratio. We currently expect that margin to be 200 basis points. 
I'm showing amounts on the revolver will carry a commitment fee of about 35 basis points, which will also vary according to our leverage ratio. The debt will not be funded until the acquisition closes. But we will be paying taking fees on the $3 billion commitment at an annualized rate of 35 basis points between now and then. The loan will have a 5-year term with half of the principle being paid quarterly over that period and the other half being paid at maturity. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for fiscal Q4. Absent the impact in Japan, we believe demand would have been flat to slightly down in line with historical seasonality. However, there are several factors that could alter that pattern, including our belief that half right suppliers will struggle to meet customer demand. Customers are still in discovery mode to establish which components may limit their ability to service their system-level customers. In fact, just prove to be the bottleneck we will be able to ship everything we can build. We estimate significant progress stabilizing our supply and are confident that we can supply our customers what we committed to them prior to March 11. We expect better than seasonal capacity mix-up, moderate price declines and some cost increases
for parts execution and expedite charges. 
Despite the fact that we're currently above our OpEx model, we continue to invest in our branded products portfolio, solid-state initiatives and fundamental technology capabilities. Our guidance does not include acquisition and financing related costs. Base on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $245 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million; we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.60 and $0.65 for the June quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.

That is one of the key values that has driven the WD share growth over the last 10 years. And our posture is to continue to deliver that value. Obviously, where that requires incremental cost, like all good partnerships, we want that to be a 2-way thing. Continuous price reduction in the marketplace is an ability we have to reduce prices as driven by our ability to consistently reduce cost. So cost reduction takes a backseat to securing availability such as securing types of components, being involved in more expensive transport costs to expedite, paying expedite fees, those kinds of things we share with our customers typically.

The sequential decline of course margins from 19.2 to 18.2 need a little bit better than what we had implied in our guidance. We pretty much saw the decline how we have forecasted them and again, it mainly came from segment mix, the branded businesses seasonally a bit down. And we had some absorption cost to deal with because we build few units in the March quarter than they did in the December quarter. And pricing overall probably came in a little bit better than we expected. I think we said on the call that we had like-for-like price declines in the model, our 5% and I would say they came in closer to 4.5%, so that's probably where the pickup came from. In terms of the CapEx, our priorities has not changed. Our capital first and foremost towards ensuring our flexibility to service the market, our technology advancement, risk mitigation and then we sold for incremental capacity. And we try to do the latter in as much but just in time session as we can and since volumes have come down a little bit, we're trying to be very prudent and try to invest as realtime as possible in capacity as we can."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q3 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer.

With me on our Q3 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. 
First and foremost, we were pleased to determine in early March that Western Digital employees in Japan, as well as those of Hitachi GST were all safe after the tragic events of last month. Those personally affected by these events continue to be in our thoughts. 
Like many technology companies, we have been busy dealing with the disruptions resulting from the events in Japan. We are also proceeding on plan with our acquisition of HGST and have made significant progress on that front. We are in the approval process with all required regulatory agencies. Our integration planning is well underway and we have successfully syndicated the loan financing associated with the transaction. We remain very excited about the potential of this acquisition. 
Industry shipments came in at 160 million units for the March quarter, slightly above our original expectation of 155 million units. As customers accelerated product purchases in the last three weeks of the quarter due to supply concerns as a result of the Japanese earthquake. Analyzing the effects of the events in Japan, on the technology industry generally, there were, and remain a number of supply chain challenges, which are impacting both demand and supply visibility in the June quarter and beyond.  
Tim will describe these in more detail. But I am pleased that the WD team with strong support from our suppliers, has mitigated the initial impact on our ability to support pre-earthquake customer share awards for the June quarter. We have now turned our attention to responding to customer upside requests for this quarter, which we believe are driven by unresolved supply chain issues at competitors and to fully supporting customer needs in the September quarter. We believe end customer demand for the June quarter in all markets for HDD's is tracking to seasonally normal patterns. 
However, there is uncertainty around the ability of our customers and the HDD industry to fully satisfy this demand due to supply chain challenges. In uncertain times like these, we believe a highly flexible and responsive WD business model is especially well-equipped to perform and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational challenges and highlights in the March quarter in greater detail. Tim?"

Entering the March quarter, we aligned our business with the 155 million unit TAM that we have forecasted in the January earnings call.

Entering the March quarter, we aligned our business with the 155 million unit TAM that we have forecasted in the January earnings call. Responding to the expected increase in TAM, triggered by the series of uncertain supply in the last few weeks of the quarter, our adaptable model enabled us to react rapidly to the upturn in demand and satisfy the actual TAM of 160 million units. 
Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected. Overall product capacity mix was relatively flat with tight cost management enabled us to come in at the high-end of our implied gross margin guidance. We shipped 49.8 million units in the March quarter, down 4.6% sequentially and 2.5% from the year ago period. While the overall market declined by 4.8%, and 2.3%, respectively. 
Revenues totaled $2.25 billion. Gross margin was at 18.2% and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $146 million. We generated strong cash flow from operations of $313 million. 
Now turning to the overall market. In the compute space, units decrease sequentially from 116 million to 112 million. And decreased year-on-year from 119 million. We believe that the softer demand in the March quarter was driven to some extent by the late supply of CPUs to PC ODMs. Commercial demand strength continued, while consumer demand remained subdued. 
Against this backdrop, WD shipped 36.3 million units into the compute space in the March quarter, compared to 37.8 million units in the December quarter, and 38.5 million units in the year ago quarter, as we maintained essentially flat market share in all three areas periods.
And the airline enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.4 million to 5.6 million units, and up from 5.2 million units year-on-year. Driven by the expansion of cloud computing, this market continues to offer further growth opportunity. The traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units remained flat with the December quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.4 million units, reflecting the continued strength of the commercial market. 
The shift to 2.5-inch SaaS continued, as a percentage of total market represented by this platform has now advanced to around 54% of the TAM. WD shipped 2.3 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the March quarter. 
Essentially flat with the December and year ago quarters. We continue to put the building blocks in place to increase our presence in the traditional enterprise space, and we're shipping out second-generation fast product to a limited customer set, and we continue to work on our third generation product. 
The HDD manufactures time in the branded product segment came in at 13 million units. Seasonally down from 14.7 million units in the December quarter and up from 10.7 million units in the year ago quarter, presenting continued evidence of strong demand for personal storage. 
The seasonal cadence of this market is such that sell-in exceeds sell-through during the December quarter. In order to have adequate inventory in place for the holiday and post-holiday sales, whereas sell-through exceeds sell-in during the March quarter as distributors and retailers lighten up on inventory in preparation for the seasonally weaker June quarter. 
WD shipped 6.4 million units into this market in the March quarter, down from 7.4 million units in the December quarter and up from 5.6 million units in the year ago quarter. We continue to compete strongly in this market segment where our brand equity, product lineup and differentiating features have earned us the leading position. 
In the DDR market segment, the TAM was 13.5 million units, down sequentially from 14.3 million, and up from 12.1 million in the year ago quarter. WD shipped 4.7 million units into this market in the March quarter, essentially flat with the December quarter and up slightly from 4.6 million in the year ago quarter. WDs product capabilities resonate with customers in this segment, and we continue to see growth opportunities as HDD's offer the best value proposition to store and enjoy video content. 
The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8 in strides. Inventories in the HDD supply-chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. 
Now turning to the June quarter. We believe that in an environment absent the impact of the Japanese earthquake, that the true demand for HDDs in the compute space would follow a seasonal demand patterns, and would be flat to down from the March quarter. However, given the likely impacts, we believe that HDD TAM in the June quarter will be supply constrained. Shortages at this point appear to be more acute in 2.5-inch drives but we expect the product will also be short in the 3.5-inch form factor. 
Assuming the customer demand is not impacted by an inability to get other components that they need to build their systems. There are multiple levels of the supply chain at which availability problems may occur, from base chemicals up to final district components. And issues at each levels are still being worked by us, our suppliers, and our customers. 
In the meantime, our customers are ordering what they can in order to reduce the number of their individual supply concerns. We are planning around a normal June quarter demand, and we have underpinned supply to satisfy that level of unit volume. We are now looking to support our customers with upside supply in response to their request as they try to bridge shortages from other HDD suppliers. 
As John indicated, it is in uncertain times like these that WD's flexible and responsive models and our consistency and execution enable us to serve our customers well. In our other served markets, we expect volumes in DDR to be up seasonally, branded products to be down, and enterprise segments to be flat. 
Now turning to our product line-up. We introduced new capacities for users of consumer network storage and high speed direct detach storage. We began populating our industry-leading My Book external drives with our 3 terabyte hard drives. Creative PC professionals and MAC enthusiasts, now can utilize the 6 terabyte My Book Studio Edition II storage systems to support their ever increasing production of HD content. This 2 drive storage system has 4 interfaces, including eSATA and FireWire 800 for the fastest transfer speeds, rate capability, and Apple Time Machine compatibility. 
Our fast My Book Live network drive was a total capacity of 3 terabytes now centralizes more media than ever before in consumers homes. We also added functionality to our WD TV Live media players, including CinemaNow, which provides users access to new release movies and TV episodes. New metrics features, including the ability to search for movies and get recommendations directly on users' HDTV, as well as support for enhanced audio with Dolby Digital Plus. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q3 financial performance, and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q4 guidance after this call. Our Q3 actual results was slightly above the upper end of the guidance range we provided during our January investor call.
Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $2.25 billion, down 15% from the prior year and 9% sequentially. Authorized shipments totaled 49.8 million units, down 3% from the prior year period and 5% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players, WD Life Wire Network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $50 million, up 8% from the prior year, and down 12% from the December quarter. 
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $45 per unit, down $6 from the year ago quarter, and $2 from the December quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $441 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter and 19% sequentially. There was no single customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically the regions contributed roughly the same relative percentage of revenue as in the December quarter, with Asia's sales continuing to represent the majority of our revenue. From a channel perspective, retails percentage of revenue declined along seasonal expectations, while our OEM percentage increased slightly. Our gross margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 25.2% in the year ago quarter, and 19.2% in the December quarter. 
The quarter-over-quarter reduction of gross margin by 100 basis points is a function of a seasonal decline in our branded products business and some cost of under absorption of our manufacturing assets due to a reduced build plan. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $252 million, including $10 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition of HGST. Excluding these acquisition-related expenses, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $242 million or 10.7% of revenue. This compares with $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the year ago quarter, and $235 million or 9.5% of revenue in the December quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product development and higher incentive accruals. 
Operating income was $158 million or 7% of revenue, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $168 million or 7.5% of revenue. This compares with $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $240 million or 9.7% of revenue in the December quarter. 
Net interest and other nonoperating income was $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $13 million or 8.2% of pretax income. Our net income totaled $146 million or $0.62 per share, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income totaled $156 million or $0.66 per share. This compares with $400 million or $1.71 per share and $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago and December quarters respectively. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables, 28 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 73 days of payables. We generated $313 million in cash flow from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $138 million. Capital expenditures for the March quarter totaled $175 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter totaled $151 million. 
We have lowered our forecast for capital expenditures and depreciation. We now expect our capital spending for the current fiscal year to be between $775 million and $800 million, including approximately $100 million for our 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditure to optimize the output from our Singapore media facility we acquired last year. 
Depreciation and amortization is now expected to be about $610 million for the current fiscal year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning carryover spending of up to $100 million for 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion in Singapore media facility optimization. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the third quarter and thereby reduced our debt balance to $325 million. We exited fiscal Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion, an increase of $120 million from the December quarter. 
Before I talk about our Q4 guidance, let me update you on the profits we made on the debt financing related to our planned acquisition of HGST. The cash portion of the purchase price will come from available offshore cash and new debt. Our existing term loan will be repaid from available cash balances. The new debt will not be rated but will have terms similar to investment rate debt and covenants that are very similar to what we have now.
The new credit facility will consist of a term loan of up to $2.5 billion, and a $500 million revolving line of credit. We've fully negotiated the definitive loan documents with the Syndicate members and subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of the acquisition in accordance with its terms, we fully expect all of the syndicate members to be part of the final lender group. 
The term loan and any amount thrown under the line of credit will carry an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our leverage ratio. We currently expect that margin to be 200 basis points. 
I'm showing amounts on the revolver would carry a commitment fee of about 35 basis points, which will also vary according to our leverage ratio. The debt will not be funded until the acquisition closes. But we will be paying ticking fees on the $3 billion commitment at an annualized rate of 35 basis points between now and then. The loan will have a 5-year term with half of the principle being paid quarterly over that period and the other half being paid at maturity. 
Let me now turn to our expectation for fiscal Q4. Absent the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we believe demand would have been flat to slightly down in line with historical seasonality. However, there are several factors that could alter that pattern, including our belief that hard drive suppliers will struggle to meet customer demand. Customers are still in discovery mode to establish which components may limit their ability to service their system-level customers. 
If hard drives prove to be the bottleneck, we will be able to ship everything we can build. We estimate significant progress stabilizing our supply, and are confident that we can supply our customers what we committed to them prior to March '11. We expect better than seasonal capacity mix-up, moderate price declines and some cost increases
for parts execution and expedite charges. 
Despite the fact that we're currently above our OpEx model, we continue to invest in our branded products portfolio, solid-state initiatives and fundamental technology capabilities. Our guidance does not include acquisition and financing related costs. 
Base on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $245 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million; we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.60 and $0.65 for the June quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses. 
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

The terms of and our ability to syndicate our new credit facility to be entered into in connection with our planned acquisition of HGST, and our financial results expectations for the June quarter including revenue gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share. 
These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 28, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. 
In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures as well as forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of HGST. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor summary, included as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively for the Form 8-K, we have furnished to the SEC today. Copies of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the investors relations section of our website. 
The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST exclude acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction. And following the closing of the transaction. Because these acquisition related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing of the transaction, we are unable to provide information about or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. 
Finally, as a reminder, until our acquisition of Hitachi GST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, so we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business nor its financial performance.

With me on our Q3 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. 
First and foremost, we were pleased to determine in early March that Western Digital employees in Japan, as well as those of Hitachi GST were all safe after the tragic events of last month. Those personally affected by these events continue to be in our thoughts. 
Like many technology companies, we have been busy dealing with the disruptions resulting from the events in Japan. We are also proceeding on plan with our acquisition of HGST and have made significant progress on that front. We are in the approval process with all required regulatory agencies. Our integration planning is well underway and we have successfully syndicated the loan financing associated with the transaction. We remain very excited about the potential of this acquisition. 
Industry shipments came in at 160 million units for the March quarter, slightly above our original expectation of 155 million units. As customers accelerated product purchases in the last 3 weeks the quarter due to supply concerns as a result of the Japanese earthquake. Analyzing the effects of the events in Japan, on the technology industry generally, there were, and remain a number of supply chain challenges, which are impacting both demand and supply visibility in the June quarter and beyond.  
Tim will describe these in more detail. But I am pleased that the WD team with strong support from our suppliers, has mitigated the initial impact on our ability to support pre-earthquake customer share awards for the June quarter. We have now turned our attention to responding to customer upside requests for this quarter, which we believe are driven by unresolved supply chain issues at competitors and to fully supporting customer needs in the September quarter. We believe end customer demand for the June quarter in all markets for HDDs is tracking to seasonally normal patterns. 
However, there is uncertainty around the ability of our customers and the HDD industry to fully satisfy this demand due to supply chain challenges. In uncertain times like these, we believe a highly flexible and responsive WD business model is especially well-equipped to perform and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational challenges and highlights in the March quarter in greater detail. Tim?"

Entering the March quarter, we aligned our business with the 155 million unit TAM that we have forecasted in the January earnings call. Responding to the unexpected increase in TAM, triggered by the series of uncertain supply in the last few weeks of the quarter, our adaptable model enabled us to react rapidly to the upturn in demand and satisfy the actual TAM of 160 million units. 
Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected. Overall product capacity mix was relatively flat with tight cost management enabled us to come in at the high-end of our implied gross margin guidance. We shipped 49.8 million units in the March quarter, down 4.6% sequentially and 2.5% from the year ago period. While the overall market declined by 4.8%, and 2.3%, respectively. 
Revenues totaled $2.25 billion. Gross margin was at 18.2% and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $146 million. We generated strong cash flow from operations of $313 million. 
Now turning to the overall market. In the compute space, units decreased sequentially from 116 million to 112 million. And decreased year-on-year from 119 million. We believe that the softer demand in the March quarter was driven to some extent by the late supply of CPUs to PC ODMs. Commercial demand strength continued, while consumer demand remained subdued. 
Against this backdrop, WD shipped 36.3 million units into the compute space in the March quarter, compared to 37.8 million units in the December quarter, and 38.5 million units in the year ago quarter, as we maintained essentially flat market share in all three periods.
And the airline enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.4 million to 5.6 million units, and up from 5.2 million units year-on-year. Driven by the expansion of cloud computing, this market continues to offer further growth opportunity. The traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units remained flat with the December quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.4 million units, reflecting the continued strength of the commercial market. 
The shift to 2.5-inch SaaS continued, as a percentage of total market represented by this platform has now advanced to around 54% of the TAM. WD shipped 2.3 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the March quarter. 
Essentially flat with the December and year ago quarters. We continue to put the building blocks in place to increase our presence in the traditional enterprise space, and we're shipping out second-generation SaaS product to a limited customer set, and we continue to work on our third generation product. 
The HDD manufacturers TAM in the branded product segment came in at 13 million units. Seasonally down from 14.7 million units in the December quarter and up from 10.7 million units in the year ago quarter, presenting continued evidence of strong demand for personal storage. 
The seasonal cadence of this market is such that sell-in exceeds sell-through during the December quarter. In order to have adequate inventory in place for the holiday and post-holiday sales, whereas sell-through exceeds sell-in during the March quarter as distributors and retailers lighten up on inventory in preparation for the seasonally weaker June quarter. 
WD shipped 6.4 million units into this market in the March quarter, down from 7.4 million units in the December quarter and up from 5.6 million units in the year ago quarter. We continue to compete strongly in this market segment where our brand equity, product lineup and differentiating features have earned us the leading position. 
In the DDR market segment, the TAM was 13.5 million units, down sequentially from 14.3 million, and up from 12.1 million in the year ago quarter. WD shipped 4.7 million units into this market in the March quarter, essentially flat with the December quarter and up slightly from 4.6 million in the year ago quarter. WD's product capabilities resonates with customers in this segment, and we continue to see growth opportunities as HDDs offer the best value proposition to store and enjoy video content. 
The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8 in strides. Inventories in the HDD supply-chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. 
Now turning to the June quarter. We believe that in an environment absent the impact of the Japanese earthquake, that the true demand for HDDs in the compute space would follow a seasonal demand patterns, and would be flat to down from the March quarter. However, given the likely impacts, we believe that HDD TAM in the June quarter will be supply constrained. Shortages at this point appear to be more acute in 2.5-inch drives but we expect the product will also be short in the 3.5-inch form factor. 
Assuming that customer demand is not impacted by an inability to get other components that they need to build their systems. There are multiple levels of the supply chain at which availability problems may occur, from base chemicals up to final district components. And issues at each levels are still being worked by us, our suppliers, and our customers. 
In the meantime, our customers are ordering what they can in order to reduce the number of their individual supply concerns. We are planning around a normal June quarter demand, and we have underpinned supply to satisfy that level of unit volume. We are now looking to support our customers with upside supply in response to their request as they try to bridge shortages from other HDD suppliers. 
As John indicated, it is in uncertain times like these that WD's flexible and responsive models and our consistency and execution enable us to serve our customers well. In our other served markets, we expect volumes in DDR to be up seasonally, branded products to be down, and enterprise segments to be flat. 
Now turning to our product line-up. We introduced new capacities for users of consumer network storage and high speed direct detach storage. We began populating our industry-leading My Book external drives with our 3 terabyte hard drives. Creative PC professionals and MAC enthusiasts, now can utilize the 6 terabyte My Book Studio Edition II storage systems to support their ever increasing production of HD content. This 2 drive storage system has 4 interfaces, including eSATA and FireWire 800 for the fastest transfer speeds, rate capability, and Apple Time Machine compatibility. 
Our fast My Book Live network drive with a total capacity of 3 terabytes now centralizes more media than ever before in consumers' homes. We also added functionality to our WD TV Live media players, including CinemaNow, which provides users access to new release movies and TV episodes. New Netflix features, including the ability to search for movies and get recommendations directly on users' HDTV, as well as support for enhanced audio with Dolby Digital Plus. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q3 financial performance, and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q4 guidance after this call. Our Q3 actual results was slightly above the upper end of the guidance range we provided during our January investor call.
Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $2.25 billion, down 15% from the prior year and 9% sequentially. Authorized shipments totaled 49.8 million units, down 3% from the prior year period and 5% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players, WD Life Wire Network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $50 million, up 8% from the prior year, and down 12% from the December quarter. 
Average hard drive selling price was approximately $45 per unit, down $6 from the year ago quarter, and $2 from the December quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $441 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter and 19% sequentially. There was no single customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically the regions contributed roughly the same relative percentage of revenue as in the December quarter, with Asia's sales continuing to represent the majority of our revenue. From a channel perspective, retails percentage of revenue declined along seasonal expectations, while our OEM percentage increased slightly. Our gross margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 25.2% in the year ago quarter, and 19.2% in the December quarter. 
The quarter-over-quarter reduction of gross margin by 100 basis points is a function of a seasonal decline in our branded products business and some cost of under absorption of our manufacturing assets due to a reduced build plan. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $252 million, including $10 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition of HGST. Excluding these acquisition-related expenses, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $242 million or 10.7% of revenue. This compares with $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the year ago quarter, and $235 million or 9.5% of revenue in the December quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product development and higher incentive accruals. 
Operating income was $158 million or 7% of revenue, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $168 million or 7.5% of revenue. This compares with $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $240 million or 9.7% of revenue in the December quarter. 
Net interest and other nonoperating income was $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $13 million or 8.2% of pretax income. Our net income totaled $146 million or $0.62 per share, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income totaled $156 million or $0.66 per share. This compares with $400 million or $1.71 per share and $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago and December quarters respectively. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables, 28 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 73 days of payables. We generated $313 million in cash flow from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $138 million. Capital expenditures for the March quarter totaled $175 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter totaled $151 million. 
We have lowered our forecast for capital expenditures and depreciation. We now expect our capital spending for the current fiscal year to be between $775 million and $800 million, including approximately $100 million for our 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditure to optimize the output from our Singapore media facility we acquired last year. 
Depreciation and amortization is now expected to be about $610 million for the current fiscal year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning carryover spending of up to $100 million for 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion in Singapore media facility optimization. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the third quarter and thereby reduced our debt balance to $325 million. We exited fiscal Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion, an increase of $120 million from the December quarter. 
Before I talk about our Q4 guidance, let me update you on the progress we made on the debt financing related to our planned acquisition of HGST. The cash portion of the purchase price will come from available offshore cash and new debt. Our existing term loan will be repaid from available cash balances. The new debt will not be rated but will have terms similar to investment rate debt and covenants that are very similar to what we have now.
The new credit facility will consist of a term loan of up to $2.5 billion, and a $500 million revolving line of credit. We've fully negotiated the definitive loan documents with the Syndicate members and subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of the acquisition in accordance with its terms, we fully expect all of the Syndicate members to be part of the final lender group. 
The term loan and any amount drawn under the line of credit will carry an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our leverage ratio. We currently expect that margin to be 200 basis points. 
Undrawn amounts on the revolver will carry a commitment fee of about 35 basis points, which will also vary according to our leverage ratio. The debt will not be funded until the acquisition closes. But we will be paying ticking fees on the $3 billion commitment at an annualized rate of 35 basis points between now and then. The loan will have a 5-year term with half of the principal being paid quarterly over that period and the other half being paid at maturity. 
Let me now turn to our expectation for fiscal Q4. Absent the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we believe demand would have been flat to slightly down in line with historical seasonality. However, there are several factors that could alter that pattern, including our belief that hard drive suppliers will struggle to meet customer demand. Customers are still in discovery mode to establish which components may limit their ability to service their system-level customers. 
If hard drives prove to be the bottleneck, we will be able to ship everything we can build. We estimate significant progress stabilizing our supply, and are confident that we can supply our customers what we committed to them prior to March '11. We expect better than seasonal capacity mix-up, moderate price declines and some cost increases
for parts substitution and expedite charges. 
Despite the fact that we're currently above our OpEx model, we continue to invest in our branded products portfolio, solid-state initiatives and fundamental technology capabilities. Our guidance does not include acquisition and financing related costs. 
Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $245 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million; we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.60 and $0.65 for the June quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.

Obviously, where that requires incremental cost, like all good partnerships, we want that to be a 2-way thing. Continuous price reduction in the marketplace is an ability we have to reduce prices is driven by an ability to consistently reduce cost.

The sequential decline of gross margins from 19.2 to 18.2 are indeed a little bit better than what we had implied in our guidance. We pretty much saw the decline exactly how we had forecasted them, and again, mainly came from a segment mix, the branded businesses seasonally a bit down. And we had some absorption cost to deal with because we built fewer units in the March quarter than we did in the December quarter. And pricing overall probably came in a little bit better than we expected. I think we said on the call that we had like-for-like price declines in the model of 5%, and I would say they came in closer to 4.5%, so that's probably where the pickup came from. In terms of the CapEx, our priorities have not changed. Our capital is geared first and foremost towards ensuring our flexibility to service the market, our technology advancement, risk mitigation, and then we sold for incremental capacity. And we try to do the latter in as much as a just-in-time fashion as we can. And since volumes have come down a little bit, we're trying to be very prudent and try to invest as realtime as possible in capacity as we can."

So there's -- then there's an issue of the continuing rolling blackouts in Japan, I mean there are a whole series of uncertainties. We're not fully convinced that they're fully understood yet. And you just need one thing that cannot be sourced that is essential to system build to alter the landscape. So I think there's going to be some uncertainty throughout the balance of this quarter because remember, most people are currently operating on parts in pipeline that were already in place prior to the earthquake. And so, the real true impact, I think, will begin to be much better framed as we get towards the end of May."

We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. 
In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as forward-looking statements of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST. Investors are encouraged to consider the reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures we provide during this call and those that are included in the investor information summary posted the Investor Relations section of our website. 
The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that could affect our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST excludes the acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction and following the close of the transaction. Because these acquisition-related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing the transaction, we are unable to provide information about our reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. 
Also, as a reminder, the acquisition of Hitachi GST closes, WD and Hitachi GST remain independent companies. So we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance today.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer.

With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. 
In the June quarter, we saw a stronger-than-anticipated demand with the hard drive industry shipping over 165 million units. This 4% quarter-on-quarter increase contrasts with historical seasonal patterns of 1% to 2% sequential contraction. We believe that the stronger demand was driven by increased adoption of sea freight in the PC supply chain, which creates a long-term leveling in all seasonal demand patterns, as well as supply continuity concerns in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake. 
The industry grew fiscal year volumes 4% to 657 million units, while WD again grew faster than the market at 6%, shipping 207 million hard drives for the year, a 1% share gain reaffirming customer preference for WD's value proposition. 
This was a tough comparison year for the PC and HDD industries, coming off the recessions snapback year of 2010 combined with a slowdown in consumer spending and increased competition for share of consumer spend from devices like smartphones and tablets. 
We believe that 2012 could be a stronger period for the industry and for WD for several reasons. An acceleration of the commercial PC refresh as part of an overall macroreinvestment cycle, the potential for better consumer confidence translating into stronger discretionary spending, the planned launch of redesigned feature-rich PCs enabled by Windows 8 and our continued favorable standing with customers as one of the preferred suppliers of the world's most cost-effective storage solutions for the massive amounts of content being generated on the client and in the cloud. 
In this context, it's important to consider some history. Throughout fiscal '11, we operated close to the bottom of our business model range. Others in the industry struggled even more reporting results below their published models. Historical cycles show that prolonged periods are below model performance are typically followed by return-to-business model parameters as suppliers and customers alike recognize the need for industry profitability to drive needed investment in both technology and capacity. WD has repeatedly outperformed as these cyclical corrections occur. 
Furthermore, upon completion of our acquisition of HGST, we will have a stronger position in the traditional enterprise market and improve solid state drive lineup and further cost advantage. Thus far, in the regulatory review process, to complete this transaction, we have received clearance from Brazil, Taiwan and Turkey, and we continue to work closely with the remaining agencies. 
As previously announced, we currently expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2011, and our integration planning activities continue on schedule. 
I would now turn it over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational highlights for the June quarter. Tim?"
314057,136881040,144275,"Western Digital Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth primarily driven by strength in",984,"Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth primarily driven by strength in OEM demand. We believe there were 2 main factors behind this. 
Margin focus across the PC market for lower financing and inventory carrying costs encouraged increased use of ocean freight leading to build schedules versus historical seasonal patterns. And fear of supply disruption from the Japan aftermath led to grow forward by OEM customers to create inventory buffer on the basis that it is better to be looking at this than looking for it. 
We now see an industry time for calendar 2011 of roughly 670 million units, with the September quarter in the range of 170 to 175 million. 
Now turning to WD's performance. We shipped 53.8 million units in the June quarter, up 8% sequentially and 8.2% from the year-ago period as we work successfully with our supplier partners to overcome post of challenges, again, providing a superior availability and value to our customer base. 
Moderation in ASP declines delivered revenue growth of 7% quarter on quarter and 1% year on year for the June quarter. 
Gross margins improved by 130 basis points to 19.5%. However, we need to make further progress on profitability as this margin level continues to be below our business model midpoint and some 300 basis points below the same period last year. 
Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected and were less than the seasonal norm. Average product capacity was up only moderately, but its higher volumes, type cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in above the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. 
Revenues totaled $2.4 billion. Net income was $158 million, and cash flow from operations improved sequentially from $313 million to $447 million. 
Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, units increased to 117 million from 113 million in the March quarter and were up from 111 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 39.2 million units into the compute space in the June quarter compared to the 36.3 million units in the March quarter and 37.1 million units in the year ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 1% both sequentially and year-on-year. 
And the enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.6 to 6.4 million units and up from 5.1 million units year on year. Cloud computing continuous to spar growth in this market. The traditional enterprise market has 8.3 million units, remained flat with the March quarter and was up year on year from 7.1 million units as demand in the commercial market remained robust. 
WD shipped 2.5 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the June quarter, up from approximately 2.3 million in both the March and year-ago quarters. 
In the traditional enterprise phase, we are servicing a limited customers set with our first- and second-generation SAT products, and we are on plan to bring our third-generation product to market within the calendar year. 
The HDD manufactures and the branded product segment came in at 12 million units, down from 13 million units in the March quarter and up from 9.8 million units in the year ago quarter as a sequential time reduction followed typical seasonal patterns. 
Year on year turn unit growth in this segment was strong. WD shipped 5.7 million units into this market in the June quarter, down from 6.4 million units in the March quarter and up from 5 million units in the year-ago quarter. 
Competition is particularly intense than the branded segments as competitors seek to improve their share positions, and we continue to compete strongly through differentiating product features and strong brand equity. 
In the DDR market segment, the time was an estimated 14.4 million units, up sequentially from 12.9 million in the March quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year ago quarter. WD shipped 6.5 million units at this market in the June quarter, up from 4.8 million in the March quarter and up from 5.3 million in the year-ago quarter. 
WD's product capabilities and ability to respond quickly to customer needs have just growth in this segment where HDD has offered an efficient and cost-effective solution for storing and retrieving video content. 
The remaining balance of the time is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. 
Inventories in the HDD supply chains exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. 
Now turning to the September quarter. The market visibility is cloudy both from a demand and supply viewpoint due to the supply uncertainty and full forward of demand that I mentioned earlier. In contrast to HDD supply chain inventories status, we believe that inventory levels continue to build in the PC OEM supply chain as a switch from airfreight the sea freight continued in an effort to save transportation costs. 
OEMs continue to pull product on the basis of contents about supply and their historical extrapolation of demand expectations for back-to-school and the holiday season. In our other serve markets in the September quarter, we expect typical seasonal patterns, which are a branded products volume increase, a DDR volume reduction and flattish volume in the enterprise segment. 
Now turning to our product lineup. We now shipping the WD Scorpio one terabyte at 2-disk, 2.5-inch drive, the first in the range of products that utilize our 500 gigabytes per platter technology. In our branded products segment, we continue to lead the industry and volume shipments of USB 3. In our consumer electronics segment, we released WD AV versions of our 2.5 terabytes and 3 terabytes SATA hard drives. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q4 financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Wolfgang?"

The summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which we will be updating with our Q1 guidance after this call. 
For the June quarter, revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Hard drive shipment totaled 53.8 million units, up 8% from both the prior year period and the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of WD TV media players, WD LiveWire network kits and solid-state drives totaled approximately $33 million, up 20% from the prior year and a seasonally down 34% from the March quarter. 
These results were above the upper end of the guidance we provided during our April investor call due primarily to our ability to meet unexpected customer demand during a period of uncertain industry supply capabilities. 
Hard drive average selling price was approximately order $44 per unit, down $3 from the year ago quarter and $1 from the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products was $382 million, down 4% from the year ago quarter due to an aggressive pricing, as well as a continued shift from 3.5- to 2.5-inch products. Revenue was down seasonality by 13% from the March quarter. 
There was one customer, Dell, that comprise 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, demand in Asia was particularly strong this quarter as 60% of revenue from 54% in the March quarter, while Americas and Europe each declined. 
Our decision to strongly support OEM customers in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake resulted in OEM sales representing 55% of revenues, up from 47% in the March quarter, while the distribution and retail channels each contributed lower percentages of revenue. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.5%, down from to 22.5% in the year-ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin by 130 basis points is a fraction term of pricing in the client-complete market, coupled with increased utilization of manufacturing assets due to higher volume. 
Like-for-like price decline was approximately 2% for the June quarter. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $297 million in the June quarter as compared to $242 million and $252 million in the year ago and March quarters, respectively. The June quarter included $32 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the prior year quarter included $27 million for litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. 
Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter, whereas $250 million or 9% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $242 million or 10.7% of revenue in the March quarter. 
The quarter-on-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product and technology development and higher incentive compensation expenses. 
Net interest in other nonoperating expense was $2 million, including $2 million of acquisition-related debt commitment fees. Excluding these fees, net interest and other nonoperating expense would have been 0. 
Tax expense for the June quarter was $12 million dollars or 7.1% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the June quarter totaled $158 million or $0.67 per share as compared to $265 million or $1.13 per share for the year-ago quarter and $146 million or $0.62 per share in the March quarter. The June quarter included a combined $35 million for acquisition-related expenses and litigation accruals, whereas the prior year quarter included $27 million of litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter totaled $193 million or $0.81 per share as compared to $292 million or $1.24 per share in the year ago quarter and $156 million or $0.66 per share in the March quarter. 
Turning to balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 0 days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 terms and 73 days of payables. We generated $447 million in cash from operations during the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $294 million, reflecting strong sales and tight effort management. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter totaled $153 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter totaled $115 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal '11 totaled $778 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '11 totaled $602 million. For fiscal '12, we expect capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our business model range of between 7% and 8% of revenue as we complete the 6- to 8-inch conversion of our wafer staff facility. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $650 million for fiscal '12. 
We made a $31 million debt repayment during the June quarter and, thereby, reduced our debt balance to $294 million. We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, an increase of $260 million from the March quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for the September quarter. As Jim mentioned, we forecast a total available market of between 170 and 175 million units, which is below historical seasonality as OEM have built some extra inventory in Q4 fiscal year '11 to ensure security of supply and optimized transportation costs. 
The actual will depend on the level of back-to-school sales and the expectation for PC demand for the holiday season. And the consequence decisions of PC OEMs on optimizing their ocean to airfreight mix and built plants. 
Market segment mix will reflect typical seasonal patterns, which will mean an increase in branded product shipments, a decrease in DDR product shipments and flat volume. 
Price declines are expected to be moderate. While cost pressures will continue, driven by a rare earth materials, logistics costs and foreign currency exposures. We will continue to work internally and with our supplier partners to find ways to offset these cost challenges. 
We continue to invest in innovation to support growth in new products and markets. Our guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses. 
Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $250 million excluding acquisition-related expenses. We expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $238 million. 
Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.90 and $1 for the September quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.

About 95% of the production is in China. 15 years ago, that was roughly 1/3 China, 1/3 U.S., 1/3 rest of the world. The year-on-year reductions in allocation quotas for export from China have been significant over the last 3 years, and the trajectory looks to continue. As the price has risen, there's more interest in the rest of the world in terms of reopening mines and processing plants to bring further supplies to the market. We continue to work very closely with our suppliers multitier in our supply chain to secure supply and to manage costs. We continue to focus on the controllables that we manage the design of the product and, therefore, the usage of these materials, the processing in the supply chain to manufacture the components where you acquire, and so we're working there on process efficiency and reutilization of scrap materials and so on. And through those various means, we work with our supply chains to moderate some of the influence of the raw material increases. We have not fully countervailed those pressures, and so we've gone to our customers, and we sought their help in reflecting -- in our pricing the cost increase, which we could not offset in other areas. And we'll continue to do that as we march into the future here. We'll continue to try to manage down usage, to improve efficiency and utilization throughout the chain and find other means where there are no overall control to continually address cons improvement, which is order of business, daily order of business here.

And the vulnerability is to a very rapid increase in pricing of the materials and recognized in these kinds of situations, there are 2 issues. One is the price rise that relates to the demand versus the supply equation, and we think we were held last quarter by the disarray in the Japanese automotive industry, which reduced demand for magnets in automotive temporarily. But that will come back as the supply chain and the automotive industry in Japan recovers on the semiconductor side primarily, that will enable recovery in the automotive build numbers, which will place an increased demand on the available magnetic materials. So that's one driver, potential driver for us. The other one is typically, when any traded commodity go short, we have financial interests that jump into that pool and attempt to make the commodity even sparser and make a profit by driving up that price. And while the fact that this is a Chinese-government-controlled quota system may help in that regard, there's always vulnerability to that effect as well.

People have made a call on that and the basis of historical extrapolation of demand. And they are continuing to out product on the ocean. They will wait until back-to-school of the season and in order to see back-to-school meets their expectations. And on the basis of that it it meets the expectation, they continue to put product on the ocean floor the holiday season, we believe. And if the back-to-school season is less than their expectations, they will more than likely switch to -- they'll watch for demand and then they'll switch probably to airfreight and always be able to satisfy the needs of the market. And that will happen in either direction. So based upon that, we believe that the inventory that was there at the beginning of the June quarter is still in there. We think there was a slight build, if anything, during the course of the June quarter. So consequently, we think that there is inventory out there, which is more a change in the way people are managing the way customers are managing their inventory than anything else. They're basically taking advantage of low financing rates and, of course, they're trying to avoid the air transportation costs. So consequently, we think with that in mind, there normally would have been what we would anticipate on a seasonal basis with historical trends and probably be up somewhere in the region of 10% to 12%. And on this scenario, we believe that some of that inventory would allow the growth that we are looking at, which is somewhere in the region of about 5% or so."

In perspective, the PC industry shifts over 1 million units a day. So and you consider 4- to 6-week difference in the supply chain air versus ocean to from Asia to Europe and the U.S. So if you go on the 4-week delta and take 10% movement between air and ocean, you're talking 4 or 5 million drives. So we're looking, I think we mentioned at we thought there were about 8 million drives mismatched between PCs. So through an drives sold in, I think we've added a couple of million units in the course of last quarter. So you probably looking there at a couple of weeks worth at the 20% level. I do think it's provided interest rates don't go crazy, and in the context of the current maturity of drive technologies relative to drive prices quarter-to-quarter and the system configurations and relative to the price points being hit in the market and the potential for significant price degradation quarter to quarter. I mean they are the things that influence the decision on air ocean. And so I suspect it is here to stay for at least for a while. And the advantages, it tends to level the seasonality, which allows us to ship the full year on a lower capital investment, so that's positive for everybody the chain from a cost and efficiency utilization perspective. But negative is that it reduces its ability and typically mixed reaction to downside a more severe short shock thing. As Tim this, our thinking on the upcoming quarter we see July and August pretty much locked in because people are building pre-back-to-school on the assumption that it will be normal and that therefore the holiday will be normal. Once we see in August what the back-to-school shipping like, then that will either continue to plan or the put the brakes on build, allow the ocean to flush through and then use air to catch up on these minor miscalculations. So we're a little cautious about September depending on the outcome of back-to-school."

I've got to say I was impressed by the overall industry capability demonstrated in the last quarter because immediately post-earthquake, I was more pessimistic about the industries and our ability to last quarter and we managed to do better than we anticipated. And it looks like many of our competitors also did the same. So it's a credit to the resilience of the supply chain and the inventiveness and dedication of all of the people involved."

These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 2, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. 
In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as forward-looking statements of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST. Investors are encouraged to consider the reconciliations of the differences between historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures we provide during this call and those that are included in the investor information summary posted the Investor Relations section of our website. 
The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that could affect our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST exclude the acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction and following the close of the transaction. Because these acquisition-related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing of the transaction, we are unable to provide information about our reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer.

With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. 
In the June quarter, we saw a stronger-than-anticipated demand with the hard drive industry shipping over 165 million units. This 4% quarter-on-quarter increase contrasts with historical seasonal patterns of 1% to 2% sequential contraction. We believe that the stronger demand was driven by increased adoption of sea freight in the PC supply chain, which creates a long-term leveling of seasonal demand patterns, as well as supply continuity concerns in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake. 
The industry grew fiscal year volumes 4% to 657 million units, while WD, again,grew faster than the market at 6%, shipping 207 million hard drives for the year, a 1% share gain reaffirming customer preference for WD's value proposition. 
This was a tough comparison year for the PC and HDD industries, coming off the recession snapback year of 2010, combined with the slowdown in consumer spending and increased competition for share of consumer spend from devices like smartphones and tablets. 
We believe that 2012 could be a stronger period for the industry and for WD for several reasons: An acceleration of the commercial PC refresh as part of an overall macroreinvestment cycle, the potential for better consumer confidence translating into stronger discretionary spending, the planned launch of redesigned feature-rich PCs enabled by Windows 8 and our continued favorable standing with customers as one of the preferred suppliers of the world's most cost-effective storage solutions for the massive amounts of content being generated on the client and in the cloud. 
In this context, it's important to consider some history. Throughout fiscal '11, we operated close to the bottom of our business model range. Others in the industry struggled even more, reporting results below their published models. Historical cycles show that prolonged periods of below model performance are typically followed by return-to-business model parameters as suppliers and customers alike recognize the need for industry profitability to drive needed investment in both technology and capacity. WD has repeatedly outperformed as these cyclical corrections occur. 
Furthermore, upon completion of our acquisition of HGST, we will have a stronger position in the traditional enterprise market and improve solid state drive lineup and further cost advantage. Thus far, in the regulatory review process, to complete this transaction, we have received clearance from Brazil, Taiwan and Turkey, and we continue to work closely with the remaining agencies. As previously announced, we currently expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2011, and our integration planning activities continue on schedule. 
I would now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational highlights for the June quarter. Tim?"

As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in",977,"Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in OEM demand. We believe there were 2 main factors behind this.  
Margin focus across the PC market were lower financing and inventory-carrying costs encouraged increased use of ocean freight, leading to pull-ins of built schedules versus historical seasonal patterns. And fear of supply disruption from the Japan aftermath led to pull-forwards by OEM customers to create inventory buffer on the basis that it is better to be looking at this than looking for it. We now see an industry TAM for calendar 2011 of roughly 670 million units, with the September quarter in the range of 170 million to  175 million. 
Now turning to WD's performance. We shipped 53.8 million units in the June quarter, up 8% sequentially and 8.2% from the year-ago period, as we work successfully with our supplier partners to overcome post earthquake challenges, again, providing superior availability and value to our customer base. Moderation in ASP declines delivered revenue growth of 7% quarter-on-quarter and 1% year-on-year for the June quarter. 
Gross margins improved by 130 basis points to 19.5%. However, we need to make further progress on profitability as this margin level continues to be below our business model midpoint and is some 300 basis points below the same period last year. 
Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected and were less than the seasonal norm. Average product capacity was up only moderately, but higher volumes, tight cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in above the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. 
Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, net income was $158 million, and cash flow from operations improved sequentially from $313 million to $447 million. 
Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, units increased to 117 million from 113 million in the March quarter and were up from 111 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 39.2 million units into the compute space in the June quarter compared to the 36.3 million units in the March quarter and 37.1 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 1% both sequentially and year-on-year. 
The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.6 million to 6.4 million units, and up from 5.1 million units year-on-year. Cloud computing continues to spur growth in this market. The traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units, remained flat with the March quarter and was up year-on-year from 7.1 million units as demand in the commercial market remained robust. WD shipped 2.5 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the June quarter, up from approximately 2.3 million in both the March and year-ago quarters. 
In the traditional enterprise phase, we are servicing a limited customers set with our first and second generation SAS products, and we are on plan to bring our third generation product to market within the calendar year. 
The HDD manufactures' TAM in the branded product segment came in at 12 million units, down from 13 million units in the March quarter and up from 9.8 million units in the year ago quarter, as a sequential time reduction followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year TAM unit growth in this segment was strong. WD shipped 5.7 million units into this market in the June quarter, down from 6.4 million units in the March quarter and up from 5 million units in the year-ago quarter. Competition is particularly intense in the branded segment, as competitors seek to improve their share positions, and we continue to compete strongly through differentiating product features and strong brand equity. 
In the DVR market segment, the TAM was an estimated 14.4 million units, up sequentially from 12.9 million in the March quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 6.5 million units into this market in the June quarter, up from 4.8 million in the March quarter and up from 5.3 million in the year-ago quarter. WD's product capabilities and ability to respond quickly to customer needs helped us grow in this segment where HDDs offer an efficient and cost-effective solution for storing and retrieving video content. 
The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chains exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. 
Now turning to the September quarter. The market visibility is cloudy both from a demand and supply viewpoint due to the supply uncertainty and pull forward of demand that I mentioned earlier. In contrast to the HDD supply chain inventory status, we believe that inventory levels continue to build in the PC OEM supply chain as a switch from air freight the sea freight continued in an effort to save transportation costs. OEMs continue to pull product on the basis of concerns about supply and their historical extrapolation of demand expectations for back-to-school and the holiday season. 
In our other served markets in the September quarter, we expect typical seasonal patterns, which are: A branded products volume increase, a DVR volume reduction and flattish volume in the Enterprise segment. 
Now turning to our product lineup. We now shipping the WD Scorpio 1 terabyte, a 2-disk, 2.5-inch drive, the first in the range of products that utilize our 500 gigabytes per platter technology. In our Branded Products segment, we continue to lead the industry in volume shipments of USB 3. In our Consumer Electronics segment, we released WD AV versions of our 2.5 terabytes and 3 terabytes SATA hard drives. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q4 financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Wolfgang?"

A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which we will be updating with our Q1 guidance after this call. 
For the June quarter, revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 53.8 million units, up 8% from both the prior-year period and the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players, WD Livewire Network Kits and solid-state drives totaled approximately $33 million, up 23% from the prior year and a seasonally down 34% from the March quarter. 
These results were above the upper end of the guidance we provided during our April investor call due primarily to our ability to meet unexpected customer demand during a period of uncertain industry supply capabilities. 
Hard drive average selling price was approximately $44 per unit, down $3 from the year-ago quarter and $1 from the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD Livewire products was $382 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter due to an aggressive pricing environment, as well as a continued shift from 3.5- to 2.5-inch products. Revenue was down seasonality by 13% from the March quarter. There was one customer, Dell, that comprise 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, demand in Asia was particularly strong this quarter as we grew to 60% of revenue from 54% in the March quarter, while Americas and Europe each declined. 
Our decision to strongly support OEM customers in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake resulted in OEM sales representing 55% of revenue, up from 47% in the March quarter, while the distribution and retail channels each contributed lower percentages of revenue. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.5%, down from to 22.5% in the year-ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin by 130 basis points is a function of firmer pricing in the client compute market, coupled with increased utilization of manufacturing assets due to higher volume. Like-for-like price decline was approximately 2% for the June quarter. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $297 million in the June quarter as compared to $242 million and $252 million in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively. The June quarter included $32 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million for litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. 
Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter, versus $215 million or 9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $242 million or 10.7% of revenue in the March quarter. The quarter-over-increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product and technology development and higher incentive compensation expenses. 
Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $2 million, including $2 million of acquisition-related debt commitment fees. Excluding these fees, net interest and other nonoperating expense would have been 0. 
Tax expense for the June quarter was $12 million dollars or 7.1% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the June quarter totaled $158 million or $0.67 per share as compared to $265 million or $1.13 per share for the year-ago quarter and $146 million or $0.62 per share in the March quarter. The June quarter included a combined $35 million for acquisition-related expenses and litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million of litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter totaled $193 million or $0.81 per share, as compared to $292 million or $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter and $156 million or $0.66 per share in the March quarter. 
Turning to balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 0 days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 turns and 73 days of payables. We generated $447 million in cash from operations during the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $294 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter totaled $153 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter totaled $150 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal '11 totaled $778 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '11 totaled $602 million. 
For fiscal '12, we expect capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our business model range of between 7% and 8% of revenue as we complete the 6- to 8-inch conversion of our wafer fab facility. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $650 million for fiscal '12. 
We made a $31 million debt repayment during the June quarter, and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $294 million. We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, an increase of $260 million from the March quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for the September quarter. As Tim mentioned, we forecast a total available market of between 170 million and 175 million units, which is below historical seasonality as OEMs have built some extra inventory in Q4 fiscal year '11 to ensure security of supply and optimized transportation costs. 
The actual TAM depend on the level of back-to-school sales and the expectation for PC demand for the holiday season, and the consequent decisions of PC OEMs on optimizing their ocean-to-air freight mix and build plants. 
Market segment mix will reflect typical seasonal patterns, which will mean an increase in branded product shipments, a decrease in DVR product shipments and flat enterprise volume. 
Price declines are expected to be moderate. While cost pressures will continue, driven by a rare earth materials, logistics costs and foreign currency exposures. We will continue to work internally and with our supplier partners to find ways to offset these cost challenges. 
We continue investing in innovation to support growth in new products and markets. Our guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses. 
Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $250 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. We expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.90 and $1 for the September quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.

About 95% of the production is in China. 15 years ago, that was roughly 1/3, China; 1/3, U.S.; 1/3, rest of the world. The year-on-year reductions in allocation quotas for export from China have been significant over the last 3 years, and the trajectory looks to continue. As the price has risen, there's more interest in the rest of the world in terms of reopening mines and processing plants to bring further supplies to the market. We continue to work very closely with our suppliers multi-tier in our supply chain to secure supply and to manage costs. We continue to focus on the controllables that we manage the design of the product, and therefore, the usage of these materials, the processing in the supply chain to manufacture the components where you acquire, and so we're working there on process efficiency and reutilization of scrap materials and so on. And through those various means, we work with our supply chain to moderate some of the influence of the raw material increases. We have not fully countervailed those pressures, and so we've gone to our customers, and we've sought their help in reflecting -- in our pricing the cost increase, which we could not offset in other areas. And we'll continue to do that as we march into the future here. We'll continue to try to manage down usage, to improve efficiency and utilization throughout the chain and to find other means within our overall control to continually address cost improvement, which is quarterly order of business, daily order of business here.

And recognize in these kinds of situations, there are 2 issues. One is the price rise that relates to the demand versus the supply equation. And we think we were helped last quarter by the disarray in the Japanese automotive industry, which reduced demand for magnets in automotive temporarily. But that will come back as the supply chain to the automotive industry in Japan recovers on the semiconductor side. Primarily, that will enable recovery in the automotive build numbers, which will place an increased demand on the available magnetic materials. So that's one driver, potential driver for us. The other one is typically, when any traded commodity go short, we get financial interests that jump into that pool and attempt to make the commodity even scarcer, and make a profit by driving up that price. And while the fact that this is a Chinese government-controlled quota system may help in that regard, there's always vulnerability to that effect as well. And we're working to try to manage all that.

People have made a call on that on the basis of historical extrapolation of demand. And they are continuing to put product on the ocean. They will wait until back-to-school season in order to see whether back-to-school meets their expectations. And on the basis of that, if it meets the expectations, they continue to put product on the ocean for the holiday season, we believe. And if the back-to-school season is less than their expectations, they will more than likely switch to -- they'll watch for demand and then they'll switch probably to air freight in order to be able to satisfy the needs of the market. And that will happen in either direction. So based upon that, we believe that the inventory that was there at the beginning of the June quarter is still in there. We think that there was a slight build, if anything, during the course of the June quarter. So consequently, we think that there is that extra inventory out there, which is more a change in the way people are managing, the way customers are managing their inventory than anything else. They're basically taking advantage of low financing rates and, of course, they're trying to avoid the air transportation costs. So consequently, we think that with that in mind, there normally would have been what we would anticipate on a seasonal basis with historical trends and probably be up somewhere in the region of 10% to 12%. And under this scenario, we believe that some of that inventory buffer that's in there would allow the growth that we are looking at, which is somewhere in the region of about 5% or so."

I think it's above 20% today, maybe in the 30% range  and rising. In perspective, the PC industry ships over 1 million units a day. So -- and you consider a 4- to 6-week difference in the supply chain air versus ocean to -- from Asia to Europe and the U.S. So if you go on the 4-week delta and take 10% movement between air and ocean, you're talking 4 million or 5 million drives. So we're looking, I think we mentioned at the end of March that we thought there were about 8 million drives out there, mismatch between PCs sold through and drives sold in, I think we've added a couple of million units during the course of the last quarter. So you're probably looking there at a couple of weeks worth at the 20% level. I do think it's -- provided interest rates don't go crazy, and in the context of the current maturity of drive technologies relative to drive prices quarter-to-quarter and the system configurations and relative to the price points being hit in the market and the potential for significant price degradation quarter-to-quarter. I mean they are the things that influence the decision on air-ocean. And so I suspect it is here to stay for at least for a while. And the advantages, it tends to level the seasonality, which allows us to ship the full year on a lower capital investment, so that's positive for everybody in the chain from a cost and efficiency utilization perspective. The negative is that it reduces its ability and typically mixed reaction to downside a more severe short sharp shock thing. As Tim described our thinking on the upcoming quarter, we see July and August pretty much locked in because people are building pre-back-to-school on the assumption that it will be normal and that at least be -- therefore, the holiday will be normal. Once we see in August what the back-to-school is shaping up like, then that will either continue to plan or the put the brakes on build, allow the ocean to flush through and then use air to catch up on any of these minor miscalculations, right? So we're a little cautious about September depending on the outcome of back-to-school."

There's still way, way too many people out there totally exposed in terms of backup. What we have seen is that the deployment of what I call the personal cloud, where the continuing appetite for consumption of rich content, whether that be on PCs, on tablets, is leading to a significant level of sales for personal storage to expand the storage available in the home. And parallel to that, we're seeing expansion of storage in the cloud, which is driving the growth in the nontraditional enterprise space. And so, the growth of outside the PC storage is reflecting the huge growth in petabyte demand and the creation of content, which is you're driving that 40% year-over-year growth in petabyte of storage demand. And one place it shows up is in the external storage. Now if we can do an effective marketing job of convincing people that and only do they need the incremental storage, but they need to back it all up, then we have an even brighter future out there to go turn that opportunity into financial performance."

These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 2, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. 
In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST. Investors are encouraged to consider the reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures we provide during this call and those that are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST exclude acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction and following the close of the transaction. Because these acquisition-related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing of the transaction, we are unable to provide information about or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer.

With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. 
In the June quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand with the hard drive industry shipping over 165 million units. This 4% quarter-on-quarter increase contrasts with historical seasonal patterns of 1% to 2% sequential contraction. We believe that the stronger demand was driven by increased adoption of sea freight in the PC supply chain, which creates a long-term leveling of seasonal demand patterns, as well as supply continuity concerns in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake. 
The industry grew fiscal year volumes 4% to 657 million units, while WD again grew faster than the market at 6%, shipping 207 million hard drives for the year, a 1% share gain reaffirming customer preference for WD's value proposition. 
This was a tough comparison year for the PC and HDD industries, coming off the recession snapback year of 2010, combined with the slowdown in consumer spending and increased competition for share of consumer spend from devices like smartphones and tablets. 
We believe that 2012 could be a stronger period for the industry and for WD for several reasons: An acceleration of the commercial PC refresh as part of an overall macro reinvestment cycle; the potential for better consumer confidence translating into stronger discretionary spending; the planned launch of redesigned, feature-rich PCs enabled by Windows 8 and our continued favorable standing with customers as one of the preferred suppliers of the world's most cost-effective storage solutions for the massive amounts of content being generated on the client and in the cloud. 
In this context, it's important to consider some history. Throughout fiscal '11, we operated close to the bottom of our business model range. Others in the industry struggled even more, reporting results below their published models. Historical cycles show that prolonged periods of below model performance are typically followed by a return-to-business model parameters as suppliers and customers alike recognize the need for industry profitability to drive needed investment in both technology and capacity. WD has repeatedly outperformed as these cyclical corrections occur. 
Furthermore, upon completion of our acquisition of HGST, we will have a stronger position in the traditional enterprise market, an improve solid state drive lineup and further cost advantage. Thus far, in the regulatory review process, to complete this transaction, we have received clearance from Brazil, Taiwan and Turkey, and we continue to work closely with the remaining agencies. As previously announced, we currently expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2011 and our integration planning activities continue on schedule. 
I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational highlights for the June quarter. Tim?"

As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in",973,"Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in OEM demand. We believe there were 2 main factors behind this.  
Margin focus across the PC market where lower financing and inventory-carrying costs encouraged increased use of ocean freight, leading to pull-ins of built schedules versus historical seasonal patterns. And fear of supply disruption from the Japan aftermath led to pull-forwards by OEM customers to create inventory buffer on the basis that it is better to be looking at it than looking for it. We now see an industry TAM for calendar 2011 of roughly 670 million units, with the September quarter in the range of 170 million to  175 million. 
Now turning to WD's performance. We shipped 53.8 million units in the June quarter, up 8% sequentially and 8.2% from the year-ago period, as we work successfully with our supplier partners to overcome post earthquake challenges, again, providing superior availability and value to our customer base. Moderation in ASP declines delivered revenue growth of 7% quarter-on-quarter and 1% year-on-year for the June quarter. 
Gross margins improved by 130 basis points to 19.5%. However, we need to make further progress on profitability as this margin level continues to be below our business model midpoint and is some 300 basis points below the same period last year. 
Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected and were less than the seasonal norm. Average product capacity was up only moderately, but higher volumes, tight cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in above the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. 
Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, net income was $158 million and cash flow from operations improved sequentially from $313 million to $447 million. 
Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, units increased to 117 million from 113 million in the March quarter and were up from 111 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 39.2 million units into the compute space in the June quarter compared to 36.3 million units in the March quarter and 37.1 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 1% both sequentially and year-on-year. 
The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.6 million to 6.4 million units, and up from 5.1 million units year-on-year. Cloud computing continues to spur growth in this market. The traditional enterprise market, at 8.3 million units, remained flat with the March quarter and was up year-on-year from 7.1 million units as demand in the commercial market remained robust. WD shipped 2.5 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the June quarter, up from approximately 2.3 million in both the March and year-ago quarters. 
In the traditional enterprise space, we are servicing a limited customer set with our first- and second-generation SAS products, and we are on plan to bring our third-generation product to market within the calendar year. 
The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the branded product segment came in at 12 million units, down from 13 million units in the March quarter and up from 9.8 million units in the year-ago quarter, as a sequential TAM reduction followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year TAM unit growth in this segment was strong. WD shipped 5.7 million units into this market in the June quarter, down from 6.4 million units in the March quarter and up from 5 million units in the year-ago quarter. Competition is particularly intense in the branded segment, as competitors seek to improve their share positions, and we continue to compete strongly through differentiating product features and strong brand equity. 
In the DVR market segment, the TAM was an estimated 14.4 million units, up sequentially from 12.9 million in the March quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 6.5 million units into this market in the June quarter, up from 4.8 million in the March quarter and up from 5.3 million in the year-ago quarter. WD's product capabilities and ability to respond quickly to customer needs helped us grow in this segment where HDDs offer an efficient and cost-effective solution for storing and retrieving video content. 
The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. 
Now turning to the September quarter. The market visibility is cloudy both from a demand and supply viewpoint due to the supply uncertainty and the pull forward of demand that I mentioned earlier. In contrast to the HDD supply chain inventory status, we believe that inventory levels continued to build in the PC OEM supply chain as the switch from air freight to sea freight continued in an effort to save transportation costs. OEMs continued to pull product on the basis of concerns about supply and their historical extrapolation of demand expectations for back-to-school and the holiday season. 
In our other served markets in the September quarter, we expect typical seasonal patterns, which are: A branded products volume increase; a DVR volume reduction and flattish volume in the Enterprise segment. 
Now turning to our product lineup. We are now shipping the WD Scorpio 1 terabyte, a 2-disk, 2.5-inch drive, the first in a range of products that utilize our 500 gigabytes-per-platter technology. In our Branded Products segment, we continue to lead the industry in volume shipments of USB 3. In our Consumer Electronics segment, we released WD AV versions of our 2.5 terabyte and 3 terabyte SATA hard drives. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q4 financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Wolfgang?"

A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which we will be updating with our Q1 guidance after this call. 
For the June quarter, revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 53.8 million units, up 8% from both the prior-year period and the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players, WD Livewire Network Kits and solid-state drives totaled approximately $33 million, up 23% from the prior year and seasonally down 34% from the March quarter. 
These results are above the upper end of the guidance we provided during our April investor call due primarily to our ability to meet unexpected customer demand during a period of uncertain industry supply capabilities. 
Hard drive average selling price was approximately $44 per unit, down $3 from the year-ago quarter and $1 from the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD Livewire products was $382 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter due to an aggressive pricing environment, as well as a continued shift from 3.5- to 2.5-inch products. Revenue was down seasonally by 13% from the March quarter. There was one customer, Dell, that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, demand in Asia was particularly strong this quarter as we grew to 60% of revenue from 54% in the March quarter, while Americas and Europe each declined. 
Our decision to strongly support OEM customers in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake resulted in OEM sales representing 55% of revenue, up from 47% in the March quarter, while the distribution and retail channels each contributed lower percentages of revenue. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.5%, down from 22.5% in the year-ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin by 130 basis points is a function of firmer pricing in the client compute market, coupled with increased utilization of manufacturing assets due to higher volume. Like-for-like price decline was approximately 2% for the June quarter. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $297 million in the June quarter as compared to $242 million and $252 million in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively. The June quarter included $32 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million for litigation accruals and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. 
Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter, versus $215 million or 9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $242 million or 10.7% of revenue in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product and technology development and higher incentive compensation expenses. 
Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $2 million, including $2 million of acquisition-related debt commitment fees. Excluding these fees, net interest and other nonoperating expense would have been 0. 
Tax expense for the June quarter was $12 million dollars or 7.1% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the June quarter totaled $158 million or $0.67 per share as compared to $265 million or $1.13 per share for the year-ago quarter and $146 million or $0.62 per share in the March quarter. The June quarter included a combined $35 million for acquisition-related expenses and litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million of litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter totaled $193 million or $0.81 per share, as compared to $292 million or $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter and $156 million or $0.66 per share in the March quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 0 days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 turns and 73 days of payables. We generated $447 million in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $294 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter totaled $153 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter totaled $150 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal '11 totaled $778 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '11 totaled $602 million. 
For fiscal '12, we expect capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our business model range of between 7% and 8% of revenue as we complete the 6- to 8-inch conversion of our wafer fab facility. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $650 million for fiscal '12. 
We made a $31 million debt repayment during the June quarter, and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $294 million. We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, an increase of $260 million from the March quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for the September quarter. As Tim mentioned, we forecast a total available market of between 170 million and 175 million units, which is below historical seasonality as OEMs have built some extra inventory in Q4 fiscal year '11 to ensure security of supply and optimized transportation costs. 
The actual TAM depend on the level of back-to-school sales and the expectation for PC demand for the holiday season and the consequent decisions of PC OEMs on optimizing their ocean-to-air freight mix and build plants. 
Market segment mix will reflect typical seasonal patterns, which will mean an increase in branded product shipments, a decrease in DVR product shipments and flat enterprise volume. 
Price declines are expected to be moderate while cost pressures will continue, driven by a rare earth materials, logistics costs and foreign currency exposures. We will continue to work internally and with our supplier partners to find ways to offset these cost challenges. 
We continue investing in innovation to support growth in new products and markets. Our guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses. 
Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $250 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. We expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.90 and $1 for the September quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.

About 95% of the production is in China. 15 years ago, that was roughly 1/3 China; 1/3 U.S.; 1/3 rest of world. The year-on-year reductions in allocation quotas for export from China have been significant over the last 3 years and the trajectory looks to continue. As the price has risen, there's more interest in the rest of the world in terms of reopening mines and processing plants to bring further supplies to the market. We continue to work very closely with our suppliers, multi-tier in our supply chain to secure supply and to manage cost. We continue to focus on the controllables, that we manage the design of the product and therefore, the usage of these materials. The processing in the supply chain, to manufacture the components where you acquire and so we're working there on process efficiency and reutilization of scrap materials and so on. And through those various means, we've worked with our supply chain to moderate some of the influence of the raw material increases. We have not fully counterveiled those pressures, and so we've gone to our customers and we've sought their help in reflecting, in our pricing, the cost increase which we could not offset in other areas.

But that will come back, as the supply chain to the automotive industry in Japan recovers on the semiconductor side, primarily, that will enable recovery in the automotive build numbers, which will place an increased demand on the available magnetic materials. So that's one driver, potential driver of cost. The other is typically, when any traded commodity goes short, we get financial interests that jump into that pool and attempt to make the commodity even scarcer and make a profit by driving up that price. And while the fact that this is a Chinese government-controlled quota system may help in that regard, there's always vulnerability to that effect as well. And we're working to try to manage all of that. And I think our customers fully understand that supply chain and those issues and fully understand the vital contribution of our technology to their businesses and we'll work it out."

What we believe is that the inventory that's being carried on the ocean, people have made a call on that on the basis of historical extrapolation of demand. And they are continuing to put product on the ocean. They will wait until back-to-school season in order to see whether back-to-school meets their expectations. And on the basis of that, if it meets the expectations, they'll continue to put product on the ocean for the holiday season, we believe. If the back-to-school season is less than their expectations, they will more than likely switch to -- they'll watch for demand and then they'll switch probably to air freight in order to be able to satisfy the needs of the market. And that will happen in either direction. So based upon that, we believe that the inventory that was there at the beginning of the June quarter is still in there. We think that there was a slight build, if anything, during the course of the June quarter. So consequently, we think that there is that extra inventory out there, which is more a change in the way people are managing, the way customers are managing their inventory than anything else. They're basically taking advantage of low financing rates and, of course, they're trying to avoid the air transportation costs. So consequently, we think that with that in mind, there normally would have been -- what we would anticipate on a seasonal basis with historical trends, probably be up somewhere in the region of 10% to 12%. And under this scenario, we believe that some of that inventory buffer that's in there would allow the growth that we are looking at, which is somewhere in the region of about 5% or so."

I think it's above 20% today, maybe in the 30% range and rising. In perspective, the PC industry ships over 1 million units a day. So -- and you consider a 4- to 6-week difference in the supply chain, air versus ocean to -- from Asia to Europe and the U.S. So if you go on the 4-week delta and take 10% movement between air and ocean, you're talking 4 million or 5 million drives. So we're looking, I think we mentioned at the end of March that we thought there were about 8 million drives out there, a mismatch between PCs sold through and drives sold in, I think we've added a couple of million units during the course of the last quarter. So you're probably looking there at a couple of weeks worth at the 20% level. I do think it's -- provided interest rates don't go crazy, and in the context of the current maturity of drive technologies relative to drive prices quarter-to-quarter and the system configurations and relative to the price points being hit in the market and the potential for significant price degradation quarter-to-quarter. I mean they are the things that influence the decision on air-ocean. And so I suspect it is here to stay for -- at least for a while. And the advantages, it tends to level the seasonality, which allows us to ship the full year on a lower capital investment, so that's positive for everybody in the chain from a cost and efficiency utilization perspective. The negative is that it reduces visibility and typically makes reaction to downside a more severe, short, sharp, shock thing. As Tim described our thinking on the upcoming quarter, we see July and August pretty much locked in because people are building pre-back-to-school on the assumption that it will be normal and that therefore, the holiday will be normal. Once we see in August what the back-to-school is shaping up like, then that will either continue to plan or they'll put the brakes on build, allow the ocean to flush through and then use air to catch up on any of these minor miscalculations, right? So we're a little cautious about September depending on the outcome of back-to-school."

There's still way, way too many people out there totally exposed in terms of backup. What we have seen is the deployment of what I call the personal cloud, where the continuing appetite for consumption of rich content, whether that be on PCs, on tablets, is leading to a significant level of sales for personal storage to expand the storage available in the home. And parallel to that, we're seeing expansion of storage in the cloud, which is driving the growth in the nontraditional enterprise space. And so, the growth of outside the PC storage is reflecting the huge growth in petabyte demand and the creation of content, which is you're driving that 40% year-over-year growth in petabytes of storage demand. And one place it shows up is in the external storage. Now if we can do an effective marketing job of convincing people that not only do they need that incremental storage, but they need to back it all up, then we have an even brighter future out there to go turn that opportunity into financial performance."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. In the June quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand with the hard drive indus",462,"Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. 
In the June quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand with the hard drive industry shipping over 165 million units. This 4% quarter-on-quarter increase contrasts with historical seasonal patterns of 1% to 2% sequential contraction. We believe that the stronger demand was driven by increased adoption of sea freight in the PC supply chain, which creates a long-term leveling of seasonal demand patterns, as well as supply continuity concerns in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake. 
The industry grew fiscal year volumes 4% to 657 million units, while WD again grew faster than the market at 6%, shipping 207 million hard drives for the year, a 1% share gain reaffirming customer preference for WD's value proposition. 
This was a tough comparison year for the PC and HDD industries, coming off the recession snapback year of 2010, combined with the slowdown in consumer spending and increased competition for share of consumer spend from devices like smartphones and tablets. 
We believe that 2012 could be a stronger period for the industry and for WD for several reasons: An acceleration of the commercial PC refresh as part of an overall macro reinvestment cycle; the potential for better consumer confidence translating into stronger discretionary spending; the planned launch of redesigned, feature-rich PCs enabled by Windows 8 and our continued favorable standing with customers as one of the preferred suppliers of the world's most cost-effective storage solutions for the massive amounts of content being generated on the client and in the cloud. 
In this context, it's important to consider some history. Throughout fiscal '11, we operated close to the bottom of our business model range. Others in the industry struggled even more, reporting results below their published models. Historical cycles show that prolonged periods of below model performance are typically followed by a return-to-business model parameters as suppliers and customers alike recognize the need for industry profitability to drive needed investment in both technology and capacity. WD has repeatedly outperformed as these cyclical corrections occur. 
Furthermore, upon completion of our acquisition of HGST, we will have a stronger position in the traditional enterprise market, an improved solid state drive lineup and further cost advantage. Thus far, in the regulatory review process, to complete this transaction, we have received clearance from Brazil, Taiwan and Turkey, and we continue to work closely with the remaining agencies. As previously announced, we currently expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2011 and our integration planning activities continue on schedule. 
I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational highlights for the June quarter. Tim?"
314057,136881040,144659,"Western Digital Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in",973,"Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in OEM demand. We believe there were 2 main factors behind this.  
Margin focus across the PC market where lower financing and inventory-carrying costs encouraged increased use of ocean freight, leading to pull-ins of built schedules versus historical seasonal patterns. And fear of supply disruption from the Japan aftermath led to pull-forwards by OEM customers to create inventory buffer on the basis that it is better to be looking at it than looking for it. We now see an industry TAM for calendar 2011 of roughly 670 million units, with the September quarter in the range of 170 million to  175 million. 
Now turning to WD's performance. We shipped 53.8 million units in the June quarter, up 8% sequentially and 8.2% from the year-ago period, as we work successfully with our supplier partners to overcome post earthquake challenges, again, providing superior availability and value to our customer base. Moderation in ASP declines delivered revenue growth of 7% quarter-on-quarter and 1% year-on-year for the June quarter. 
Gross margins improved by 130 basis points to 19.5%. However, we need to make further progress on profitability as this margin level continues to be below our business model midpoint and is some 300 basis points below the same period last year. 
Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected and were less than the seasonal norm. Average product capacity was up only moderately, but higher volumes, tight cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in above the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. 
Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, net income was $158 million and cash flow from operations improved sequentially from $313 million to $447 million. 
Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, units increased to 117 million from 113 million in the March quarter and were up from 111 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 39.2 million units into the compute space in the June quarter compared to 36.3 million units in the March quarter and 37.1 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 1% both sequentially and year-on-year. 
The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.6 million to 6.4 million units, and up from 5.1 million units year-on-year. Cloud computing continues to spur growth in this market. The traditional enterprise market, at 8.3 million units, remained flat with the March quarter and was up year-on-year from 7.1 million units as demand in the commercial market remained robust. WD shipped 2.5 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the June quarter, up from approximately 2.3 million in both the March and year-ago quarters. 
In the traditional enterprise space, we are servicing a limited customer set with our first- and second-generation SAS products, and we are on plan to bring our third-generation product to market within the calendar year. 
The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the branded product segment came in at 12 million units, down from 13 million units in the March quarter and up from 9.8 million units in the year-ago quarter, as a sequential TAM reduction followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year TAM unit growth in this segment was strong. WD shipped 5.7 million units into this market in the June quarter, down from 6.4 million units in the March quarter and up from 5 million units in the year-ago quarter. Competition is particularly intense in the branded segment, as competitors seek to improve their share positions, and we continue to compete strongly through differentiating product features and strong brand equity. 
In the DVR market segment, the TAM was an estimated 14.4 million units, up sequentially from 12.9 million in the March quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 6.5 million units into this market in the June quarter, up from 4.8 million in the March quarter and up from 5.3 million in the year-ago quarter. WD's product capabilities and ability to respond quickly to customer needs helped us grow in this segment where HDDs offer an efficient and cost-effective solution for storing and retrieving video content. 
The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. 
Now turning to the September quarter. The market visibility is cloudy both from a demand and supply viewpoint due to the supply uncertainty and the pull forward of demand that I mentioned earlier. In contrast to the HDD supply chain inventory status, we believe that inventory levels continued to build in the PC OEM supply chain as the switch from air freight to sea freight continued in an effort to save transportation costs. OEMs continued to pull product on the basis of concerns about supply and their historical extrapolation of demand expectations for back-to-school and the holiday season. 
In our other served markets in the September quarter, we expect typical seasonal patterns, which are: A branded products volume increase; a DVR volume reduction and flattish volume in the Enterprise segment. 
Now turning to our product lineup. We are now shipping the WD Scorpio 1 terabyte, a 2-disk, 2.5-inch drive, the first in a range of products that utilize our 500 gigabytes-per-platter technology. In our Branded Products segment, we continue to lead the industry in volume shipments of USB 3. In our Consumer Electronics segment, we released WD AV versions of our 2.5 terabyte and 3 terabyte SATA hard drives. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q4 financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Wolfgang?"

A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which we will be updating with our Q1 guidance after this call. 
For the June quarter, revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 53.8 million units, up 8% from both the prior-year period and the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players, WD Livewire Network Kits and solid-state drives totaled approximately $33 million, up 23% from the prior year and seasonally down 34% from the March quarter. 
These results are above the upper end of the guidance we provided during our April investor call due primarily to our ability to meet unexpected customer demand during a period of uncertain industry supply capabilities. 
Hard drive average selling price was approximately $44 per unit, down $3 from the year-ago quarter and $1 from the March quarter. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD Livewire products was $382 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter due to an aggressive pricing environment, as well as a continued shift from 3.5- to 2.5-inch products. Revenue was down seasonally by 13% from the March quarter. There was one customer, Dell, that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Geographically, demand in Asia was particularly strong this quarter as we grew to 60% of revenue from 54% in the March quarter, while Americas and Europe each declined. 
Our decision to strongly support OEM customers in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake resulted in OEM sales representing 55% of revenue, up from 47% in the March quarter, while the distribution and retail channels each contributed lower percentages of revenue. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.5%, down from 22.5% in the year-ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin by 130 basis points is a function of firmer pricing in the client compute market, coupled with increased utilization of manufacturing assets due to higher volume. Like-for-like price decline was approximately 2% for the June quarter. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $297 million in the June quarter as compared to $242 million and $252 million in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively. The June quarter included $32 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million for litigation accruals and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. 
Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter, versus $215 million or 9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $242 million or 10.7% of revenue in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product and technology development and higher incentive compensation expenses. 
Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $2 million, including $2 million of acquisition-related debt commitment fees. Excluding these fees, net interest and other nonoperating expense would have been 0. 
Tax expense for the June quarter was $12 million dollars or 7.1% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the June quarter totaled $158 million or $0.67 per share as compared to $265 million or $1.13 per share for the year-ago quarter and $146 million or $0.62 per share in the March quarter. The June quarter included a combined $35 million for acquisition-related expenses and litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million of litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter totaled $193 million or $0.81 per share, as compared to $292 million or $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter and $156 million or $0.66 per share in the March quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 0 days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 turns and 73 days of payables. We generated $447 million in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $294 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter totaled $153 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter totaled $150 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal '11 totaled $778 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '11 totaled $602 million. 
For fiscal '12, we expect capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our business model range of between 7% and 8% of revenue as we complete the 6- to 8-inch conversion of our wafer fab facility. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $650 million for fiscal '12. 
We made a $31 million debt repayment during the June quarter, and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $294 million. We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, an increase of $260 million from the March quarter. 
Let me now turn to our expectations for the September quarter. As Tim mentioned, we forecast a total available market of between 170 million and 175 million units, which is below historical seasonality as OEMs have built some extra inventory in Q4 fiscal year '11 to ensure security of supply and optimized transportation costs. 
The actual TAM depend on the level of back-to-school sales and the expectation for PC demand for the holiday season and the consequent decisions of PC OEMs on optimizing their ocean-to-air freight mix and build plants. 
Market segment mix will reflect typical seasonal patterns, which will mean an increase in branded product shipments, a decrease in DVR product shipments and flat enterprise volume. 
Price declines are expected to be moderate while cost pressures will continue, driven by a rare earth materials, logistics costs and foreign currency exposures. We will continue to work internally and with our supplier partners to find ways to offset these cost challenges. 
We continue investing in innovation to support growth in new products and markets. Our guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses. 
Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $250 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. We expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.90 and $1 for the September quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.

About 95% of the production is in China. 15 years ago, that was roughly 1/3 China; 1/3 U.S.; 1/3 rest of world. The year-on-year reductions in allocation quotas for export from China have been significant over the last 3 years and the trajectory looks to continue. As the price has risen, there's more interest in the rest of the world in terms of reopening mines and processing plants to bring further supplies to the market. We continue to work very closely with our suppliers, multi-tier in our supply chain to secure supply and to manage cost. We continue to focus on the controllables, that we manage the design of the product and therefore, the usage of these materials. The processing in the supply chain, to manufacture the components where you acquire and so we're working there on process efficiency and reutilization of scrap materials and so on. And through those various means, we've worked with our supply chain to moderate some of the influence of the raw material increases. We have not fully countervailed those pressures, and so we've gone to our customers and we've sought their help in reflecting, in our pricing, the cost increase which we could not offset in other areas. And we'll continue to do that as we march into the future here. We'll continue to try to manage down usage, to improve efficiency and utilization throughout the chain and find other means within our overall control to continually address cost improvement, which is quarterly order of business, daily order of business here.

And recognize in these kinds of situations, there are 2 issues. One is the price rise that relates to the demand versus the supply equation. And we think we were helped last quarter by the disarray in the Japanese automotive industry, which reduced demand for magnets in automotive temporarily. But that will come back, as the supply chain to the automotive industry in Japan recovers on the semiconductor side, primarily, that will enable recovery in the automotive build numbers, which will place an increased demand on the available magnetic materials. So that's one driver, potential driver of cost. The other is typically, when any traded commodity goes short, we get financial interests that jump into that pool and attempt to make the commodity even scarcer and make a profit by driving up that price. And while the fact that this is a Chinese government-controlled quota system may help in that regard, there's always vulnerability to that effect as well. And we're working to try to manage all of that. And I think our customers fully understand that supply chain and those issues and fully understand the vital contribution of our technology to their businesses and we'll work it out."

What we believe is that the inventory that's being carried on the ocean, people have made a call on that on the basis of historical extrapolation of demand. And they are continuing to put product on the ocean. They will wait until back-to-school season in order to see whether back-to-school meets their expectations. And on the basis of that, if it meets the expectations, they'll continue to put product on the ocean for the holiday season, we believe. If the back-to-school season is less than their expectations, they will more than likely switch to -- they'll watch for demand and then they'll switch probably to air freight in order to be able to satisfy the needs of the market. And that will happen in either direction. So based upon that, we believe that the inventory that was there at the beginning of the June quarter is still in there. We think that there was a slight build, if anything, during the course of the June quarter. So consequently, we think that there is that extra inventory out there, which is more a change in the way people are managing, the way customers are managing their inventory than anything else. They're basically taking advantage of low financing rates and, of course, they're trying to avoid the air transportation costs. So consequently, we think that with that in mind, there normally would have been -- what we would anticipate on a seasonal basis with historical trends, probably be up somewhere in the region of 10% to 12%. And under this scenario, we believe that some of that inventory buffer that's in there would allow the growth that we are looking at, which is somewhere in the region of about 5% or so."

I think it's above 20% today, maybe in the 30% range and rising. In perspective, the PC industry ships over 1 million units a day. So -- and you consider a 4- to 6-week difference in the supply chain, air versus ocean to -- from Asia to Europe and the U.S. So if you go on the 4-week delta and take 10% movement between air and ocean, you're talking 4 million or 5 million drives. So we're looking, I think we mentioned at the end of March that we thought there were about 8 million drives out there, a mismatch between PCs sold through and drives sold in, I think we've added a couple of million units during the course of the last quarter. So you're probably looking there at a couple of weeks worth at the 20% level. I do think it's -- provided interest rates don't go crazy, and in the context of the current maturity of drive technologies relative to drive prices quarter-to-quarter and the system configurations and relative to the price points being hit in the market and the potential for significant price degradation quarter-to-quarter. I mean they are the things that influence the decision on air-ocean. And so I suspect it is here to stay for -- at least for a while. And the advantages, it tends to level the seasonality, which allows us to ship the full year on a lower capital investment, so that's positive for everybody in the chain from a cost and efficiency utilization perspective. The negative is that it reduces visibility and typically makes reaction to downside a more severe, short, sharp, shock thing. As Tim described our thinking on the upcoming quarter, we see July and August pretty much locked in because people are building pre-back-to-school on the assumption that it will be normal and that therefore, the holiday will be normal. Once we see in August what the back-to-school is shaping up like, then that will either continue to plan or they'll put the brakes on build, allow the ocean to flush through and then use air to catch up on any of these minor miscalculations, right? So we're a little cautious about September depending on the outcome of back-to-school."

There's still way, way too many people out there totally exposed in terms of backup. What we have seen is the deployment of what I call the personal cloud, where the continuing appetite for consumption of rich content, whether that be on PCs, on tablets, is leading to a significant level of sales for personal storage to expand the storage available in the home. And parallel to that, we're seeing expansion of storage in the cloud, which is driving the growth in the nontraditional enterprise space. And so, the growth of outside the PC storage is reflecting the huge growth in petabyte demand and the creation of content, which is you're driving that 40% year-over-year growth in petabytes of storage demand. And one place it shows up is in the external storage. Now if we can do an effective marketing job of convincing people that not only do they need that incremental storage, but they need to back it all up, then we have an even brighter future out there to go turn that opportunity into financial performance."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. As you can imagine, the WD team has been consumed recently in dealing with the relentless flooding in Thailand and its significant impact on our employees, their families in our suppliers, as well as on the business infrastructure in the region. We are grateful that the WD employees in Thailand are safe at this time, although many of their lives and homes have been disrupted and damaged. This is a disaster of unprecedented scale, with over 317 fatalities so far reported, over 9 million people affected, 700,000 homes and 14,000 factories flooded and over 660,000 workers out of work. The overall impact to the people of Thailand is immeasurable and our hearts go out to them in these trying times. Having addressed the safety of our people, and put in place programs to continue supporting them in this crisis, we have now turned our focus and energies to maximizing our capability to meet our customers' needs in the near term and to return our operations to normal as soon as possible. Full recovery will be a multi-quarter challenge. We believe the unconstrained HDD demand for the December quarter is flat to slightly down from September quarter ship levels. Having said that, due to the concentration of HDD supply chain factories in various industrial parks in the flooded area, it is apparent that the HDD industry will be constrained in meeting that demand. Since WD has greater direct manufacturing exposure to the flooded areas, we believe the impact on our business in the short term will be greater than to other HDD manufacturers. In their remarks, Tim will provide a summary of how we're dealing with a operations challenges presented by the flooding and Wolfgang will provide a current quarter outlook. 
Turning back to the September quarter, it materialized very much along the lines we expected. Industry shipments came in at 176 million units, just about the high-end of our estimate entering the quarter. This is our record quarterly shipment level for the hard drive industry, demonstrating the value of hard drives in the overall digital universe, even in an environment of broad-based, low growth and global economic uncertainty. While the industry experienced a reasonable back-to-school season contributing to record quarterly shipments, the quarter-over-quarter growth was never the less muted by historical standards. We believe this is a reflection of the overall macro uncertainties, the slow growth being experienced in many mature markets and the PC industry's continued shift to a higher usage of sea freight instead of more expensive air freight, which is time shifted typical seasonal linearity. WD's financial results and share growth demonstrate continued strong execution at a time when we have also been highly focused on our planned acquisition of HGST. We continue our work with the regulatory authorities around the world to obtain approval of our planned acquisition of HGST. Our integration planning activities are progressing well. Although we believe of acquisition should be cleared unconditionally, we have submitted a proposed confidential remedy to the European Commission to address issues raised in the course of its review. We now expect the European Commission to issue its decision on the transaction by November 30. We anticipate the other agencies reviewing our transaction will make their final determination within a similar timeframe. Therefore, we are maintaining our target for closing the HGST acquisition by the end of the calendar year. Our analysis of the tremendous underlying long-term need for cost-effective mass storage in both developed and developing regions of the world underpins our continued enthusiasm for this business. We believe our model of providing high-quality product with speed, flexibility and low cost structure is a path to long-term success and shareholder value creation in this dynamic market. While the flooding in Thailand presents us with a series of daunting challenges during the next several quarters, I'm highly confident in the abilities of the dedicated WD team with its strong execution skills to complete our operations recovery effectively and efficiency. This is a short-term challenge in what we continue to believe is a great long-term opportunity for continued profitable growth at WD. Before turning the call over to Tim for his operations review, I wanted to pay tribute to the WD team for their heroic efforts in dealing with this adversity. A company either could not ask for a greater effort and commitment than we have seen from this team. Tim?"

Firstly, I would cover our fiscal Q1 performance and then give a status update on the impact of the time and flooding in our business. WD shipped 57.8 million units in the September quarter, up 7.4% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago period. As we stayed focused on executing well in our core businesses. There are value proposition continues to resonate with our customer base. Higher volumes, favorable mix, customers of a portion of our real-world material cost increases and minimal price declines delivered revenue growth of 12.1% quarter-on-quarter and 12.4% year-on-year. Gross margins improved by 60 basis points to 20.1%. Price declines for the quarter were at a minimum level and were less than the seasonal norm. Product mix was favorable. Effective cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in at the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. Revenues totaled $2.7 billion, net income was $239 million and cash flow from operations declined sequentially from $447 million to $352 million, as we invested funds in working capital to establish a solid entry foundation for the December quarter. Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, industry shipments increased to $119 million from $118 million in the June quarter and were up from $115 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 41.2 million units into the compute space in the September quarter compared to 39.2 million units in the June quarter and 37.5 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grow market share by approximately 30 basils points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year. Consumer activity was stronger, although did seasonal uptick is a more muted than we have seen historically been a typical fiscal Q1. The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 6.4 million to 6.8 million units and up from 5.8 million units year-on-year. This market is to benefit from the momentum of cloud computing. The traditional enterprise market at 7.9 million units was down from 8.3 million units in the June quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.2 million units. WD shipped 2.4 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the September quarter, down from approximately 2.5 million in the June quarter and up from 2.3 million units in the year-ago quarter. We remain on plan to bring our third generation 2.5-inch SAS product to market within the calendar year. HDD manufacturers shipments in the branded product segment came in at 14.4 million, up from 12 million units in the June quarter and up from 11.6 million units in the year-ago quarter, as a sequential demand increase followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year unit growth in this segment was a strong at 24.1%. WD shipped 7.1 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 5.7 million units in both the June and year-ago quarters. WD's strong brand equity and broad product line enabled us to recover some of the market share position that we had lost due to supply constraints in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake. In the DVR market segment, shipments were an estimated 14.1 million units, down sequentially from 14.4 million units in the June quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 7.2 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 6.5 million in the June quarter and up from 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our performance in this segment reflect strong customer preference for WD's appealing product lineup. Remaining balance of the industry shipments is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chains exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. Now turning to the December quarter. We believe that the unconstrained HDD demand TAM will be around 170 million units. We also believe that the industry will be supply-constrained just the flooding in Thailand and the concentration of HDD suppliers in factories in various industrial states in the flooded and flood-threatened areas. on August the specific impact of the shutting on our business. We suspended production in all of our Thailand facilities in the beginning of last week in order to protect our personnel and to move as much equipment as possible to locations less likely to incur water damage. At this point, we are thankful that all our employees are safe. And we moved much of the equipment, which had been situated on the ground floors to higher floors. Despite the efforts of our team, over the past weekend, rising water, which first penetrated the Bang Pa-in Industrial Park flood defenses inundated the company's manufacturing facilities there and submerged the remaining equipment on the ground floors. And other company manufacturing location in Thailand, Navanakorn Industrial Park, the park's flood defenses were breached among the working local time and water begun to flow into our buildings late on Tuesday night. The flooded buildings in Thailand include our HDD assembly test and slider facilities where substantial majority of our slider from edition capacity resides. In Thailand with the impairment flight shortages resulting from the above deception, we're also experiencing other shortages on component paths from vendors located in several Thai industrial parks that have already been inundated by the floods are have been affected by protective plant shut down. We are evaluating the situation on a continuous basis. But in order to get these facilities back up and running, we need to water level to stabilize after which point, it will take some period of time for the floods to recede. We're assessing our options so that we can safely begin working to accelerate the water removal and other extract and transfer the continued to clean rooms another location or prepare it for operation on-site. As a result of these activities, at this point in time, we estimate that our regular capacity and possibly our suppliers' capacity will be significantly constrained for several quarters. We are working with our suppliers to affect the recovery of their supply chain and to ramp existing capacity in other locations. We are proceeding with all the possible haste and ingenuity to address this situation because we are mindful of the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. We are also pursuing all possible options to maximize our Malaysian facilities throughput. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012."

As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and I will provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. For the September quarter, revenue was $2.7 billion, up 12% from the prior year ended June quarter. Average selling price was approximately $46 per unit, flat with the year-ago quarter and up $2 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products was $489 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to the continued strong customer preference for the WD brand. Branded product revenue was up 28% from the June quarter. There were no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. Demand in Asia remains strong at 59% of revenue, up from 54% in the prior year and down slightly from 60% in the June quarter. Europe came in at 22% of revenue, down slightly from 23% in the prior year but up from the 20% reported in the June quarter. Americas is 19% of revenue, was down from both last year's 23% and June's 20%. OEM sales represented 53% of revenue, up from 50% in the prior year. The OEM sales percentage was down slightly from June to 55%. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 18%, flat to the prior year but seasonally up from June's 16%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 20.1%, up from 18.2% in the year-ago quarter and 19.5% in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin is a function of an improved business segments and product mix. Overall, like-for-like costs increased slightly at higher cost of raw materials were not fully offset by facings in other areas. As outlined during our last investor call, we implemented a series of offsetting measures, including significantly increasing our use of ocean shipments, the full passing along a portion of these cost increases to our customers. Ultimately, this contributed to relatively flat like-for-like pricing between the June and September quarters. While we have achieved the gross margin level that was implied in our guidance, it is important to point out that we are still operating below the mid-point of our target business model. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $282 million for the September quarter as compared to $226 million and $297 million in the year-ago and June quarters, respectively. The September quarter included $18 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included the combined $32 million for these items. Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $264 million or 9.8% of revenue in the September quarter versus $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in product portfolio expansion and technology development. Net interest and other non-operating expense was $1 million, including $3 million for commitment fees and the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business. Excluding these fees, net interest and other non-operating income would have been $2 million. Net expense for the September quarter was $19 million or 7.4% of pretax income. This includes a $2 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals for settlement of IRS claims related to Cormac, the magnetic media company required in September of 2007. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $239 million or $1.01 per share as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share for the year-ago quarter and $158 million or $0.67 per share in the June quarter. September quarter included $21 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals. Whereas the June quarter included a combined $35 million for these items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter totaled $260 million or $1.10 per share as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year-ago quarter and $193 million or $0.81 per share in the June quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 1 day. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 terms and 72 days of payables. We generated a $352 million in cash from operations during the September quarter and our free cash flow totaled $218 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. We made a conscious decision to increase ocean shipments as an offset to the cost increase as we're experiencing for rare earth materials. This is reflected an increase of our finished goods inventory by $58 million. Capital expenditure for the September quarter totaled $134 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $158 million. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the September quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $263 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalent of $3.7 billion, an increase of $185 million from the June quarter. Approximately, $3 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore. Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the December quarter. From a market perspective, we believe that starting inventory in the distribution retail channels was very lean and we believe there were no further increases of the inventory levels that our OEM customers hold. We estimate that approximately 40% of all drive in the industry are produced in Thailand, with Western Digital being all ways at approximately 60%. With respect to our specific situation, there are a number of significant factors that are impacting our guidance and that will influence our financial performance in the December quarter. We've shut down our Thailand factories and are at this point, not in a position to establish when they will recommence operations. Furthermore, some of our key suppliers have ceased production as well and are significantly impacted. We are working diligently with them. But at this point in time, we do not yet fully understand the timeline further full recovery. Most of these conditions will likely continue into the March quarter and possibly beyond, possibly impacted negatively by the significant under absorption of our assets and infrastructure. We also expect to incur additional costs in restoring supply. We will also forego land oceans savings in favor of airfreight in order to increase immediate availability for our customers. On the OpEx aside, we will continue to invest in those areas such as our enterprise, FSP and branded line products business. We will continue to see acquisition-related expenditures during the quarter. We expect to incur unusual jobs and expenses related to the impact of the flooding on our operations, including items such as fixed asset impairments, inventory write-downs, charges related to cancellation of purchase order for excess materials, jobs for reclaim and recovery walk and foreign currency losses the second forward exchange contracts that exceed our current requirements. With this in mind, our guidance for the December quarter is as follows: This guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses that I just refer to. Further, this guidance reflects our current assessment of the Thailand situation. And as we've said, that situation and our understanding of its impact on our business continues to evolve. We expect hard drive shipments of between 22 million and 26 million units. This revenue to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $230 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses and unusual charges, pretax expense of approximately $10 million. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $234 million.

As we pointed out in the scripts, it is a very low situation and we are looking at the mechanical components of the ones that seem to be the most impacted at this stage when we look at the external components. In our own case, we're impacted internally through the slider fab because the vast majority of our products and of our internal sliders are made in Bang Pa-in at the ground floor, which is now inundated with water. We also process small percentage of WD wafers through a slider fab in the Philippines, which we will be ramping up. And in addition, you'll recall that our long-term model for finished heads is to purchase 10% to 20% from the merchant market. So what we see is in our case, the slider fab is the limiting situation. And we see mechanical components and motors significantly impacted.

The expected completion and the timing of our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, growth opportunities in the industry, our product offerings in the near-line enterprise market, OEM inventory levels and our financial results expectations for the December quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate share count and loss per share. 
These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 12, 2011.

And you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.
In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between historical GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in the Investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at westerndigital.com. 
The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with and following the planned acquisition of Hitachi to UST [ph], and unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Taiwan.
Because these acquisition-related and unusual expense items are not known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, until our acquisition of HGST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, so we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance. We ask that analysts limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. As you can imagine, the WD team has been consumed recently in dealing with the relentless flooding in Thailand and its significant impact on our employees, their families and our suppliers, as well as on the business infrastructure in the region. We are grateful that the WD employees in Thailand are safe at this time, although many of their lives and homes have been disrupted and damaged. This is a disaster of unprecedented scale, with over 317 fatalities so far reported, over 9 million people affected, 700,000 homes and 14,000 factories flooded and over 660,000 workers out of work. The overall impact to the people of Thailand is immeasurable and our hearts go out to them in these trying times. 
Having addressed the safety of our people and put in place programs to continue supporting them in this crisis, we have now turned our focus and energies to maximizing our capability to meet our customers' needs in the near term and to return our operations to normal as soon as possible. Full recovery will be a multi-quarter challenge. We believe the unconstrained HDD demand for the December quarter is flat to slightly down from September quarter ship levels. 
Having said that, due to the concentration of HDD supply chain factories in various industrial parks in the flooded area, it is apparent that the HDD industry will be constrained in meeting that demand. Since WD has greater direct manufacturing exposure to the flooded areas, we believe the impact on our business in the short term will be greater than to other HDD manufacturers. In their remarks, Tim will provide a summary of how we're dealing with a operations challenges presented by the flooding and Wolfgang will provide a current quarter outlook. 
Turning back to the September quarter, it materialized very much along the lines we expected. Industry shipments came in at 176 million units, just above the high-end of our estimate entering the quarter. This is a record quarterly shipment level for the hard drive industry, demonstrating the value of hard drives in the overall digital universe, even in an environment of broad-based, low growth and global economic uncertainty. 
While the industry experienced a reasonable back-to-school season contributing to record quarterly shipments, the quarter-over-quarter growth was never the less muted by historical standards. We believe this is a reflection of the overall macro uncertainties, the slow growth being experienced in many mature markets and the PC industry's continued shift to a higher usage of sea freight instead of more expensive air freight, which is time shifted typical seasonal linearity. 
WD's financial results and share growth demonstrate continued strong execution at a time when we have also been highly focused on our planned acquisition of HGST. We continue our work with the regulatory authorities around the world to obtain approval of our planned acquisition of HGST. Our integration planning activities are progressing well. Although we believe the acquisition should be cleared unconditionally, we have submitted a proposed confidential remedy to the European Commission to address issues raised in the course of its review. We now expect the European Commission to issue its decision on the transaction by November 30. We anticipate the other agencies reviewing our transaction will make their final determination within a similar timeframe. Therefore, we are maintaining our target for closing the HGST acquisition by the end of the calendar year. 
Our analysis of the tremendous underlying long-term need for cost-effective mass storage in both developed and developing regions of the world underpins our continued enthusiasm for this business. We believe our model of providing high-quality product with speed, flexibility and low cost structure is a path to long-term success and shareholder value creation in this dynamic market. 
While the flooding in Thailand presents us with a series of daunting challenges during the next several quarters, I'm highly confident in the abilities of the dedicated WD team with its strong execution skills to complete our operations recovery effectively and efficiency. This is a short-term challenge in what we continue to believe is a great long-term opportunity for continued profitable growth at WD. 
Before turning the call over to Tim for his operations review, I wanted to pay tribute to the WD team for their heroic efforts in dealing with this adversity. A company leader could not ask for a greater effort and commitment than we have seen from this team. Tim?"

Firstly, I would cover our fiscal Q1 performance and then give a status update on the impact of the Thailand flooding on our business. 
WD shipped 57.8 million units in the September quarter, up 7.4% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago period. As we stayed focused on executing well in our core businesses, where our value proposition continues to resonate with our customer base. Higher volumes, favorable mix passing [ph] to customers of a portion of our [indiscernible] material cost increases and minimal price declines delivered revenue growth of 12.1% quarter-on-quarter and 12.4% year-on-year. 
Gross margins improved by 60 basis points to 20.1%. Price declines for the quarter were at a minimal level and were less than the seasonal norm. Product mix was favorable. Effective cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in at the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. Revenues totaled $2.7 billion, net income was $239 million and cash flow from operations declined sequentially from $447 million to $352 million, as we invested funds and working capital to establish a solid entry foundation for the December quarter. 
Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, industry shipments increased to $119 million from $118 million in the June quarter and were up from $115 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 41.2 million units into the compute space in the September quarter compared to 39.2 million units in the June quarter and 37.5 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 30 basils points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year. Consumer activity was stronger, although this seasonal uptick was more muted than we have seen historically than is typical of fiscal Q1. 
The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 6.4 million to 6.8 million units and up from 5.8 million units year-on-year. This market continues to benefit from the momentum of cloud computing. The traditional enterprise market at 7.9 million units was down from 8.3 million units in the June quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.2 million units. WD shipped 2.4 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the September quarter, down from approximately 2.5 million in the June quarter and up from 2.3 million units in the year-ago quarter. 
We remain on plan to bring our third-generation, 2.5-inch SAS product to market within the calendar year. HDD manufacturer shipments in the Branded Product segment came in at 14.4 million units, up from 12 million units in the June quarter and up from 11.6 million units in the year-ago quarter as a sequential demand increase followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year unit growth in this segment was a strong at 24.1%. WD shipped 7.1 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 5.7 million units in both the June and year-ago quarters. 
WD's strong brand equity and broad product line enabled us to recover some of the market share position that we had lost due to supply constraints in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake. In the DVR market segment, shipments were an estimated 14.1 million units, down sequentially from 14.4 million units in the June quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 7.2 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 6.5 million in the June quarter and up from 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our performance in this segment reflects strong customer preference for WD's appealing product lineup.
The remaining balance of the industry shipments is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. Now turning to the December quarter. We believe that the unconstrained HDD demand TAM will be around 170 million units. We also believe that the industry will be supply-constrained just the flooding in Thailand and the concentration of HDD suppliers in factories in various industrial states in the flooded and flood-threatened areas. 
I'll now address the specific impact of the flooding on our business. We suspended production in all of our Thailand facilities from the beginning of last week in order to protect our personnel and to move as much equipment as possible to locations less likely to incur water damage. At this point, we are thankful that all our employees are safe. And we moved much of the equipment, which had been situated on the ground floors to higher floors. 
Despite the heroic efforts of our team, over the past weekend, rising water, which had first penetrated the Bang Pa-in Industrial Park flood defenses, inundated the company's manufacturing facilities there and submerged the remaining equipment on the ground floors. At the other company manufacturing location in Thailand, Navanakorn Industrial Park, the park's flood defenses were breached on Monday morning, local time, and water begun to flow into our buildings late on Tuesday night. 
The flooded buildings in Thailand include our HDD assembly test and slider facilities, where a substantial majority of our slider fabrication capacity resides. In Thailand with the intermittent slider shortages resulting from the above disruption, we're also experiencing other shortages on component paths from vendors located in several Thai industrial parks that have already been inundated by the floods or have been affected by protective plant shut downs. 
We are evaluating the situation on a continuous basis. But in order to get these facilities back up and running, we need the water level to stabilize, after which point, it will take some period of time for the floods to recede. We're assessing our options so that we can safely begin working to accelerate the water removal and either extract and transfer the equipment to clean rooms in another locations or prepare it for operation on-site. 
As a result of these activities, at this point in time, we estimate that our regular capacity and possibly our suppliers' capacity will be significantly constrained for several quarters. We are working with our suppliers to affect the recovery of their supply chain and to ramp existing capacity in other locations. We are proceeding with all the possible haste and ingenuity to address the situation because we are mindful of the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. We are also pursuing all possible options to maximize our Malaysian facility's throughput. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012."

As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and I will provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. 
For the September quarter, revenue was $2.7 billion, up 12% from the prior year ended June quarter. [indiscernible] average selling price was approximately $46 per unit, flat with the year-ago quarter and up $2 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products was $489 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to the continued strong customer preference for the WD brand. Branded products revenue was up 28% from the June quarter. There were no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Demand in Asia remains strong at 59% of revenue, up from 54% in the prior year and down slightly from 60% in the June quarter. Europe came in at 22% of revenue, down slightly from 23% in the prior year but up from the 20% reported in the June quarter. Americas is 19% of revenue, was down from both last year's 23% and June's 20%. 
OEM sales represented 53% of revenue, up from 50% in the prior year. The OEM sales percentage was down slightly from June's 55%. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 18%, flat to the prior year but seasonally up from June's 16%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 20.1%, up from 18.2% in the year-ago quarter and 19.5% in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin is a function of an improved business segments and product mix. Overall, like-for-like costs increased slightly as higher cost of rare earth materials were not fully offset by savings in other areas. 
As outlined during our last investor call, we implemented a series of offsetting measures, including significantly increasing our use of ocean shipments before passing along a portion of these cost increases to our customers. Ultimately, this contributed to relatively flat like-for-like pricing between the June and September quarter. 
While we have achieved the gross margin level that was implied in our guidance, it is important to point out that we are still operating below the mid-point of our target business model. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $282 million from the September quarter as compared to $226 million and $297 million in the year-ago and June quarters, respectively. 
The September quarter included $18 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included the combined $32 million for these items. Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $264 million or 9.8% of revenue in the September quarter versus $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in product portfolio expansion and technology development. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $1 million, including $3 million for commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business. Excluding these fees, net interest and other non-operating income would have been $2 million. Net expense for the September quarter was $19 million or 7.4% of pretax income. This includes a $2 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals for settlement of IRS claims related to Komag, the magnetic media company required in September of 2007. 
Our net income for the September quarter totaled $239 million or $1.01 per share, as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share for the year-ago quarter and $158 million or $0.67 per share in the June quarter. September quarter included $21 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included a combined $35 million for these items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter totaled $260 million or $1.10 per share as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year-ago quarter and $193 million or $0.81 per share in the June quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 1 day. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 72 days of payables. We generated a $352 million in cash from operations during the September quarter and our free cash flow totaled $218 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. We made a conscious decision to increase ocean shipments as an offset to the cost increase as we're experiencing for rare earth materials. This is reflected an increase of our finished goods inventory by $58 million. 
Capital expenditure for the September quarter totaled $134 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $158 million. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the September quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $263 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion, an increase of $185 million from the June quarter. Approximately, $3 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore. 
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the December quarter. From a market perspective, we believe that starting inventory in the distribution retail channels was very lean and we believe there were no further increases of the inventory levels that our OEM customers hold. We estimate that approximately 40% of all drives in the industry are produced in Thailand, with Western Digital being overweight at approximately 60%. 
With respect to our specific situation, there are a number of significant factors that are impacting our guidance and that will influence our financial performance in the December quarter. We've shut down our Thailand factories and are at this point, not in a position to establish when they will recommence operations. Furthermore, some of our key suppliers have ceased production as well and are significantly impacted. We are working diligently with them but at this point in time, we do not yet fully understand the timeline for their full recovery. Both of these conditions will likely continue into the March quarter and possibly beyond. Costs will be impacted negatively by the significant under-absorption of our assets and infrastructure. We also expect to incur additional costs in restoring supply. We will also forego land-ocean savings in favor of airfreight in order to increase immediate availability for our customers. 
On the OpEx aside, we will continue to invest in growth areas such as our enterprise, SFD [ph] and branded product business. We will continue to see acquisition-related expenditures during the quarter. We expect to incur unusual jobs and expenses related to the impact of the flooding on our operations, including items such as fixed asset impairments, inventory write-downs, charges related to cancellation of purchase order for excess materials, further charges for reclaim and recovery walk and foreign currency losses to settle forward exchange contracts that exceed our current requirements. 
With this in mind, our guidance for the December quarter is as follows: This guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses that I just referred to. Further, this guidance reflects our current assessment of the Thailand situation. And as we have said, that situation and our understanding of its impact on our business continues to evolve. 
We expect hard drive shipments of between 22 million and 26 million units. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $230 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses and unusual charges. We expect tax expense of approximately $10 million. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $234 million. Accordingly, we estimate a non-GAAP loss per share of between $1.10 and $1.50 for the December quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand.

We also process small percentage of WD wafers through a slider fab in the Philippines, which we will be ramping up. And in addition, you'll recall that our long-term model for our finished heads is to purchase 10% to 20% from the merchant market. So what we see is, in our case, the slider fab is the limiting situation. And we see mechanical components and motors significantly impacted. But we are not in a position to be able to provide insight into how that impacts the rest of the industry and it would be nearly speculative on our part at this stage."

It's still ongoing in terms of -- many supplier facilities are shut down in order to assure the safety or their employees and to allow time to try to protect equipment and so on. But those facilities may or may not be subsequently inundated and the surrounding roads and access may or may not be passable in the near future.

To begin, I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning industry demand in the December quarter and the industry's ability to meet that demand. The impact for the flooding in Thailand on the industry and on our business on the December quarter and beyond, including our HDD capacity, our planned operations, recovery efforts and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with these efforts, and our ability to complete these recovery efforts. The expected completion and the timing of our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, growth opportunities in the industry, our product offerings in the near-line enterprise market, OEM inventory levels and our financial results expectations for the December quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate share count and loss per share. 
These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 12, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. And you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.
In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between historical GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in the Investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at westerndigital.com. 
The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with and following the planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, and unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand.
Because these acquisition-related and unusual expense items are not known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, until our acquisition of HGST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, so we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance. We ask that analysts limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question. 
I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne."

This is a disaster of unprecedented scale, with over 317 fatalities so far reported, over 9 million people affected, 700,000 homes and 14,000 factories flooded and over 660,000 workers out of work. The overall impact to the people of Thailand is immeasurable and our hearts go out to them in these trying times. 
Having addressed the safety of our people and put in place programs to continue supporting them in this crisis, we have now turned our focus and energies to maximizing our capability to meet our customers' needs in the near term and to return our operations to normal as soon as possible. Full recovery will be a multi-quarter challenge. We believe the unconstrained HDD demand for the December quarter is flat to slightly down from September quarter ship levels. 
Having said that, due to the concentration of HDD supply chain factories in various industrial parks in the flooded area, it is apparent that the HDD industry will be constrained in meeting that demand. Since WD has greater direct manufacturing exposure to the flooded areas, we believe the impact on our business in the short term will be greater than to other HDD manufacturers. In their remarks, Tim will provide a summary of how we're dealing with a operations challenges presented by the flooding and Wolfgang will provide a current quarter outlook. 
Turning back to the September quarter, it materialized very much along the lines we expected. Industry shipments came in at 176 million units, just above the high-end of our estimate entering the quarter. This is a record quarterly shipment level for the hard drive industry, demonstrating the value of hard drives in the overall digital universe, even in an environment of broad-based, low growth and global economic uncertainty. 
While the industry experienced a reasonable back-to-school season contributing to record quarterly shipments, the quarter-over-quarter growth was nevertheless muted by historical standards. We believe this is a reflection of the overall macro uncertainties, the slow growth being experienced in many mature markets and the PC industry's continued shift to a higher usage of sea freight instead of more expensive air freight, which has time shifted typical seasonal linearity. 
WD's financial results and share growth demonstrate continued strong execution at a time when we have also been highly focused on our planned acquisition of HGST. We continue our work with the regulatory authorities around the world to obtain approval of our planned acquisition of HGST. Our integration planning activities are progressing well. Although we believe the acquisition should be cleared unconditionally, we have submitted a proposed confidential remedy to the European Commission to address issues raised in the course of its review. We now expect the European Commission to issue its decision on the transaction by November 30. We anticipate the other agencies reviewing our transaction will make their final determination within a similar timeframe. Therefore, we are maintaining our target for closing the HGST acquisition by the end of the calendar year. 
Our analysis of the tremendous underlying long-term need for cost-effective mass storage in both developed and developing regions of the world underpins our continued enthusiasm for this business. We believe our model of providing high-quality product with speed, flexibility and low cost structure is a path to long-term success and shareholder value creation in this dynamic market. 
While the flooding in Thailand presents us with a series of daunting challenges during the next several quarters, I'm highly confident in the abilities of the dedicated WD team with its strong execution skills to complete our operations recovery effectively and efficiency. This is a short-term challenge in what we continue to believe is a great long-term opportunity for continued profitable growth at WD. 
Before turning the call over to Tim for his operations review, I want to pay tribute to the WD team for their heroic efforts in dealing with this adversity. A company leader could not ask for a greater effort and commitment than we have seen from this team. Tim?"

Firstly, I would cover our fiscal Q1 performance and then give a status update on the impact of the Thailand flooding on our business. 
WD shipped 57.8 million units in the September quarter, up 7.4% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago period. As we stayed focused on executing well in our core businesses, where our value proposition continues to resonate with our customer base. Higher volumes, favorable mix, pass through to customers of a portion of our rare earth material cost increases and minimal price declines delivered revenue growth of 12.1% quarter-on-quarter and 12.4% year-on-year. 
Gross margins improved by 60 basis points to 20.1%. Price declines for the quarter were at a minimal level and were less than the seasonal norm. Product mix was favorable. Effective cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in at the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. Revenues totaled $2.7 billion, net income was $239 million and cash flow from operations declined sequentially from $447 million to $352 million, as we invested funds and working capital to establish a solid entry foundation for the December quarter. 
Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, industry shipments increased to $119 million from $118 million in the June quarter and were up from $115 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 41.2 million units into the compute space in the September quarter compared to 39.2 million units in the June quarter and 37.5 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 30 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year. Consumer activity was stronger, although this seasonal uplift was more muted than we have seen historically than is typical of fiscal Q1. 
The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 6.4 million to 6.8 million units and up from 5.8 million units year-on-year. This market continues to benefit from the momentum of cloud computing. The traditional enterprise market at 7.9 million units was down from 8.3 million units in the June quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.2 million units. WD shipped 2.4 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the September quarter, down from approximately 2.5 million in the June quarter and up from 2.3 million units in the year-ago quarter. 
We remain on plan to bring our third-generation, 2.5-inch SAS product to market within the calendar year. HDD manufacturer shipments in the Branded Product segment came in at 14.4 million units, up from 12 million units in the June quarter and up from 11.6 million units in the year-ago quarter as a sequential demand increase followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year unit growth in this segment was a strong at 24.1%. WD shipped 7.1 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 5.7 million units in both the June and year-ago quarters. 
WD's strong brand equity and broad product line enabled us to recover some of the market share position that we had lost due to supply constraints in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake. In the DVR market segment, shipments were an estimated 14.1 million units, down sequentially from 14.4 million units in the June quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 7.2 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 6.5 million in the June quarter and up from 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our performance in this segment reflects strong customer preference for WD's appealing product lineup.
The remaining balance of the industry shipments is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. Now turning to the December quarter. We believe that the unconstrained HDD demand TAM will be around 170 million units. We also believe that the industry will be supply-constrained due to the flooding in Thailand and the concentration of HDD suppliers and factories in various industrial states in the flooded and flood-threatened areas. 
I'll now address the specific impact of the flooding on our business. We suspended production in all of our Thailand facilities from the beginning of last week in order to protect our personnel and to move as much equipment as possible to locations less likely to incur water damage. At this point, we are thankful that all our employees are safe. And we moved much of the equipment, which had been situated on the ground floors to higher floors. 
Despite the heroic efforts of our team, over the past weekend, rising water, which had first penetrated the Bang Pa-in Industrial Park flood defenses, inundated the company's manufacturing facilities there and submerged the remaining equipment on the ground floors. At the other company manufacturing location in Thailand, Navanakorn Industrial Park, the park's flood defenses were breached on Monday morning, local time, and water began to flow into our buildings late on Tuesday night. 
The flooded buildings in Thailand include our HDD assembly test and slider facilities, where a substantial majority of our slider fabrication capacity resides. In parallel with the intermittent slider shortages resulting from the above disruption, we're also experiencing other shortages on component paths from vendors located in several Thai industrial parks that have already been inundated by the floods or have been affected by protective plant shut downs. 
We are evaluating the situation on a continuous basis. But in order to get these facilities back up and running, we need the water level to stabilize, after which point, it will take some period of time for the floods to recede. We're assessing our options so that we can safely begin working to accelerate the water removal and either extract and transfer the equipment to clean rooms in another locations or prepare it for operation on-site. 
As a result of these activities, at this point in time, we estimate that our regular capacity and possibly our suppliers' capacity will be significantly constrained for several quarters. We are working with our suppliers to affect the recovery of their supply chain and to ramp existing capacity in other locations. We are proceeding with all possible haste and ingenuity to address the situation because we are mindful of the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. We are also pursuing all possible options to maximize our Malaysian facility's throughput. 
I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012."

As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. 
For the September quarter, revenue was $2.7 billion, up 12% from the prior year ended June quarter. [indiscernible] average selling price was approximately $46 per unit, flat with the year-ago quarter and up $2 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products was $489 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to the continued strong customer preference for the WD brand. Branded products revenue was up 28% from the June quarter. There were no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Demand in Asia remains strong at 59% of revenue, up from 54% in the prior year and down slightly from 60% in the June quarter. Europe came in at 22% of revenue, down slightly from 23% in the prior year but up from the 20% reported in the June quarter. America with 19% of revenue, was down from both last year's 23% and June's 20%. 
OEM sales represented 53% of revenue, up from 50% in the prior year. The OEM sales percentage was down slightly from June's 55%. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 18%, flat to the prior year but seasonally up from June's 16%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 20.1%, up from 18.2% in the year-ago quarter and 19.5% in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin is a function of an improved business segment and product mix. Overall, like-for-like costs increased slightly as higher costs of rare earth materials were not fully offset by savings in other areas. 
As outlined during our last investor call, we implemented a series of offsetting measures, including significantly increasing our use of ocean shipments before passing along a portion of these cost increases to our customers. Ultimately, this contributed to relatively flat like-for-like pricing between the June and September quarter. 
While we have achieved the gross margin level that was implied in our guidance, it is important to point out that we are still operating below the mid-point of our target business model. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $282 million from the September quarter as compared to $226 million and $297 million in the year-ago and June quarters, respectively. 
The September quarter included $18 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included the combined $32 million for these items. Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $264 million or 9.8% of revenue in the September quarter versus $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in product portfolio expansion and technology development. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $1 million, including $3 million for commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business. Excluding these fees, net interest and other non-operating income would have been $2 million. Net expense for the September quarter was $19 million or 7.4% of pretax income. This includes a $2 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals for settlement of IRS claims related to Komag, the magnetic media company we acquired in September of 2007. 
Our net income for the September quarter totaled $239 million or $1.01 per share, as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share for the year-ago quarter and $158 million or $0.67 per share in the June quarter. September quarter included $21 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included a combined $35 million for these items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter totaled $260 million or $1.10 per share as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year-ago quarter and $193 million or $0.81 per share in the June quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 1 day. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 72 days of payables. We generated a $352 million in cash from operations during the September quarter and our free cash flow totaled $218 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. We made a conscious decision to increase ocean shipments as an offset to the cost increase as we're experiencing for rare earth materials. This is reflected an increase of our finished goods inventory by $58 million. 
Capital expenditure for the September quarter totaled $134 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $158 million. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the September quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $263 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion, an increase of $185 million from the June quarter. Approximately, $3 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore. 
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the December quarter. From a market perspective, we believe that starting inventory in the distribution retail channels was very lean and we believe there were no further increases of the inventory levels that our OEM customers hold. We estimate that approximately 40% of all drives in the industry are produced in Thailand, with Western Digital being overweight [ph] at approximately 60%. 
With respect to our specific situation, there are a number of significant factors that are impacting our guidance and that will influence our financial performance in the December quarter. We've shut down our Thailand factories and are at this point, not in a position to establish when they will recommence operations. Furthermore, some of our key suppliers have ceased production as well and are significantly impacted. We are working diligently with them but at this point in time, we do not yet fully understand the timeline for their full recovery. Both of these conditions will likely continue into the March quarter and possibly beyond. Costs will be impacted negatively by the significant under-absorption of our assets and infrastructure. We also expect to incur additional costs in restoring supply. We will also forego land-ocean savings in favor of airfreight in order to increase immediate availability for our customers. 
On the OpEx aside, we will continue to invest in growth areas such as our enterprise, SSD and branded product businesses. We will continue to see acquisition-related expenditures during the quarter. We expect to incur unusual charges and expenses related to the impact of the flooding on our operations, including items such as fixed asset impairments, inventory write-downs, charges related to cancellation of purchase order for excess materials, further charges for reclaim and recovery work and foreign currency losses to settle forward exchange contracts that exceed our current requirements. 
With this in mind, our guidance for the December quarter is as follows: This guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses that I just referred to. Further, this guidance reflects our current assessment of the Thailand situation. And as we have said, that situation and our understanding of its impact on our business continues to evolve. 
We expect hard drive shipments of between 22 million and 26 million units. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $230 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses and unusual charges. We expect tax expense of approximately $10 million. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $234 million. Accordingly, we estimate a non-GAAP loss per share of between $1.10 and $1.50 for the December quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand.

Obviously, you start at the last levels that were specified. Depreciation runs at about $160 million that you add back. For the capital that we've already received and that we are obligated to pay and that we'll pay, you can assume roughly $150 million. That does not include replacement capital. As Tim said, it's simply impossible for us to estimate that at the current point in time. As you know, we have about $31 million of scheduled debt repayments every quarter. And we do expect some impact on the working capital, in particular, as we support some of the suppliers that are hit very, very hard by this. If you assume $100 million impact just as a working assumption, you would see that our cash impact, based on the guidance we have given, is anywhere between $375 million and $475 million. And again, that excludes the one-time expenditures that we will incur for incremental services, replacement equipment, et cetera."
