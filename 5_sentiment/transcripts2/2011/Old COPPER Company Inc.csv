I'll start the call a little differently this morning.

After that, Kristin Hays, our Vice President of Investor Relations, will discuss our 2011 strategic initiatives followed with Michael providing quarterly and full year guidance. I will then join you back through the Q&A portion of the call. 
As you know, I'll ordinarily provide more insight and leave that to Michael and Kristin because I was a passenger on a car accident earlier this week. Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt but I've been left kind of beat up with some aches and bruises. In any case, I'm very glad to be on the call this morning. So outside my excited game of bumper cars this week, I'm happy to report as the results reported this morning demonstrate that 2010 was a very good year for JCPenney as we made significant progress toward the transformation of our company, in the eyes of our customers and working towards our goal of being a retail industry leader. 
Our holiday season was particularly strong. With the positive recession we have seen and initiatives that we've implemented, which really began to take hold of the latter part of the year. Importantly, the business is going well in 2011. 
We were particularly pleased with the performance of our Men's apparel and Women's businesses in the quarter. We also saw strength in our accessories and shoes and handbags businesses and of course, Sephora. Thanks to our sales performance, coupled with managing our gross margins to plan and better SG&A performance in the expense control, we were able to outperform our expectations at the bottom line. By leveraging our strong momentum we created in 2010, in order to move us closer and faster to our goal of being our retail industry leader. 
Over last several years we've infused great style in our assortments, delivered world-class customer service, introduced new and innovative retail technologies that made a JCPenney a retail leader in the digital age. And now, we have a new JCPenney brand logo that symbolizes this transformation. 
Our new logo continues to honor our rich legacy, reflecting the modern retail that we become. The logo will make its debut during our Spring Fashion launch on the Academy Awards this Sunday evening. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue."

I will first cover the highlights of our very solid fourth quarter and full year performance, and then we'll move on to 2011. As Mike mentioned, our financial results reflect the progress we made in 2010 and the continued work we are doing to transform the JCPenney brand in the minds of our customers and position JCPenney as the growth leader in the industry. 
This morning, we reported strong results for the fourth quarter. The company's comp store sales grew 4.5%, an increase for the fourth consecutive quarter and ahead of our expectations. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.09 per share, an impressive 30% growth over last year, and after the $0.08 of one-time charges in this year's number that we announced a few weeks ago. 
Our fourth quarter performance can be attributed to three factors. First, the company's growth initiatives growth topline sales. Second, we managed gross margins well and third, the team exhibited disciplined expense control. 
Total sales for the quarter grew 2.8% to $5.7 billion. As a percent of sales, gross margin was in line with our expectations and decreased approximately 60 basis points to 37.6% of sales. We are pleased with this result as we were up against the company's historic peak margins achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. 
SG&A for the quarter was better than we expected, at $1.46 billion or 25.7% sales. Lower SG&A was primarily driven by expense controls with salary and related benefits and marketing expenses coming in better than planned. Our tax rate was also lower at 35% due to a true up of our state tax reserves of the close of the year as various issues were resolved in favor of the company. 
Moving on to the full year performance. In 2010, comp store sales increased 2.5% in line with our guidance for an increase of low-single digits for the year. Total sales increased 1.2% for the year. Catalog sales added $454 million to our revenues in 2010. Going forward, we anticipate that the increasing contribution from our growth initiatives and sales from jcp.com will not only replace this revenue overtime but also significantly contribute to our topline growth. 
For the full year, the company's gross margin dollars increased $50 million over last year. As a percent of sales, gross margins decreased just 20 basis points to 39.2% when compared to last year's historic peak of 39.4%. 
SG&A was also well-controlled at approximately 30.1% of sales pick. This is about $32 million below a year ago and 60 basis points lower as a percent of sales. In 2010, we generated $158 million in free cash flow and continue to have a very strong balance sheet with flexibility to support the key components of our growth initiatives. 
Capital expenditures for the year were $499 million, in line with our plan and included investments in our digital initiatives, as well as two new JCPenney stores, 44 renovations, over 100 store updates and 76 new support inside JCPenney locations. Our year-end inventory levels are in line with expected sales trends and position us well as we head into the first half of 2011 with the expansion of Liz Claiborne into additional categories, the rollout of additional support inside JCPenney locations and sufficient levels of inventories to support our growth initiatives, which are non-comparable for the first half of 2011. Specifically, we ended the year with customer-facing inventory up about 5% year-over-year and approximately 6% on a total basis, which includes what we currently call, on the water inventory. 
In summary, JCPenney's 2010 results reflect the team's focus on the execution of our initiatives in order to deliver profitable sales growth while effectively managing gross margin and leveraging our SG&A. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Kristin to cover the company's key area of focus for 2011. I'll then come back in a moment to provide our financial outlook for 2011 before turning the call over for questions. Kristin?"

We are getting off to a fast start in 2011 as our teams continue to work hard to deliver profitable sales growth by focusing on four key areas. 
First, we will continue to deliver great style at compelling prices, heightening our style authority. We are doing this through offering a balance of the best private, exclusive and national brands. For example, we are expanding Liz Claiborne across a range of category and home, petite women sizes, and introducing activewear, dresses and swimwear this year. 
We are also expanding MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by the ALDO Group to an additional 500 doors. We're continuing to rollout support inside JCPenney and center core with 76 new locations opening this year. Finally, our new modern bride collection, which is a partnership with Condé Nast, got off to a great start for Valentine's Day. It is in bridal boutiques in 1,068 stores and on jcp.com. 
These attractions are exclusive to JCPenney and bring new customers to our stores and to jcp.com. We recognize that we have an opportunity to improve our sales productivity per net square foot primarily in the center core of our store. 
Our ability to deliver unparalleled value through offering stylish and quality merchandise at great prices sets us apart from our competitors and we fully intend to capitalize on this strength. 
Our second major area of focus is continuing to deliver a differentiated and industry-leading customer experience, delivering an interaction not just the transaction. We are giving our associates the tools to build loyalty through individualized memorable interactions with our customers. 
The value of the superior customer service is not new to us. We've been successfully focused on it for years with our customer first training and our customer satisfaction scores have been steadily on the rise. In January, we remained the top department store for the third year running in the annual NRS American Express Customer Choice Survey. We could not deliver on this important point of differentiation without highly engaged and talented associates and we appreciate their efforts. 
We also continue to expand our JCP rewards program, which has grown to 26 million members and these customers spend more per year than our average customer and shop with us more frequently. In the third area, we are focused on offering personalized, impactful digital experiences that allow us to connect with our customers in a different and more direct way. 
This starts with continuing to dramatically improve the shopping experience on jcp.com, which we've been doing by introducing guided navigation, launching a new mobile site, connecting with our customers through social media, bringing in digital coupons and other new features in addition to the rollout of Find More in our stores. 
Taken together with the changes we are making to our online merchandise assortment, our objective is to build upon the strong growth we experienced online in 2010 in order to grow jcp.com sales by double digits in 2011. 
Fourth, and very importantly, across our organization we are focused on continuing to optimize our resources and reduce expenses where appropriate. For example, we are continuing to optimize our marketing expense in order to get a better return on our spend with a new more localized approach and enhanced digital marketing. We will continue to develop our expense-minded culture and maintain rigorous cost disciplines including across our home office. We are driving efficiencies through our second-generation markdown and size optimization tools as well as the pulling RF ID to allow us to better control our inventory and turn it more effectively. 
We are also instituting new pricing tools to increase sales, profits and the customer's perception of value, enabling us to increase our AUR. And we will further capitalize on our jTime's store staffing tool to control salary dollars and continue to manage our SG&A expense. These initiatives come on top of the significant steps we announced last month to complete the wind down of catalog and streamline certain areas of the business. 
As we proceed these expense savings, we are also taking a number of important steps to mitigate the impact of input cost increases. We are leveraging supplier relationships that we've built over the years, which enable us to place orders for goods earlier than most other retailers. 
We are also capitalizing on our vertically integrated product team to optimize the product cycle through product engineering, strategic and alternative raw material acquisitions, advanced production planning and taking even greater control over the supply chain, especially overseas, where we have leverage that others don't, in order to reduce our shipping costs. 
At the same time, we've been testing price elasticity city for the past year to identify where we can opportunistically increase prices. In the better and best pricing tiers, we've had success in modestly increasing ticket in certain areas. 
And finally, we focus on increasing private and inclusive brands in our merchandise mix as we have the greatest control over cost and they allow us to best address our customers' needs for affordability. Even with lower price points in national brands, our private brand margin is a typically 300 to 500 basis points higher than our national brand. 
In short, these four key areas of focus are designed to deliver profitable sales growth, maintain margins while controlling our expenses and in the end, should enable JCPenney to return value to our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Michael to go over the company's financial outlook for 2011."

As a result, we are continuing to plan our business conservatively. Specifically, our outlook for 2011 is as follows. 
We are planning our same-store sales to increase low- to mid- single digits for the year. Similar with what we experienced in 2010, we expect total sales to increase approximately 300 basis points less than our comparable store sales. Again, I would like to remind you that this is due to the elimination of our Catalog and the Outlet business and this is a temporary impact. 
The gross margin rate is expected to be about flat year-over-year. As Kristin mentioned, we are managing pricing pressures in 2011 by adjusting our product mix, leveraging our sourcing capabilities and where appropriate, increasing prices. We believe we have the strategies in place to successfully navigate this play inflationary environment, which is a testament to our strength in sourcing goods and flexibility we have with our private brands. 
We will continue to aggressively manage SG&A in 2011 with expectations that will remain flat as a percent of sales year-over-year. Taking these parameters together, the company expects 2011 earnings to increase by about 45% to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 per share. This does not take into account the impact of our newly approved $900 million share repurchase program that we announced today. 
As noted in the earnings release we intend to repurchase common stock through an open-market program beginning in March. We will update our annual guidance when we report first quarter results in May as we will have better visibility to the impact of our share repurchase program on our earnings target. 
Finally, let me add two more quick notes on 2011. Our capital expenditures are planned at $650 million for the year, which includes investments in important planning and allocation such as size and markdown optimization, our digital initiatives, the expansion of MNG by Mango and Call it Spring, three new department stores, 70 renovations and the 76 new support inside JCPenney locations. 
Also the 2011 pension expense for our qualified pension plan will be $87 million or $0.22 per share for the year. This is a $134 million reduction from our 2010 expense. Looking at the first quarter specifically, we anticipate 3% to 5% growth in comp store sales. On a monthly basis, February is expected to be towards at the higher end of the range. March is expected to be negative and April is expected to be significantly better mostly due to the Easter holidays shifting into April reporting period of this year. 
As I mentioned overall for 2011, we expect gross margins to be about flat to last year with the first quarter remaining under pressure as we work to improve the company's AUR under our pricing strategies and initiatives such as the markdown optimization. Those initiatives really won't take hold until later in the year. 
In addition, margins in the first quarter will be negatively impacted as we cycle against the profitable tale of our last big book that was still active in the first quarter of 2010. This impact is not expected to continue beyond Q1. 
For the first quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.23 per share, which includes about $0.05 of some noncomparable items, including the renewal of our revolving credit facility which matures next year, charges related to the exit of Catalog and Outlet business that we announced earlier and modest expenses related to our new growth initiatives of the foundry, Gifting Grace and Clad. 
In summary, we are excited about the potential for additional growth in 2011. We expect the first quarter will be the smallest of the year and our earnings growth will accelerate after the first quarter as our initiatives take hold. 
Now we will open the call for questions."

I'm in the salary and related benefits and marketing, those are the biggest expenditures we had. And they came in not only better than what we would've expected but better than last year but it was also across a number of categories. I would say across the board, we did a great job in the organization managing our expenses. Our store managers made the right decisions throughout the quarter. Weather issues as an example in January, they made the right decisions because you're not going to have customer traffic. You don't have to staff at the same level. So those types of things that I think we did a very good job of the during the fourth quarter."

What we did learn also is in a better and best price points that really raised the price, let's say $1. We filled enough units to cover what we lost in the good price point and at better margins. So the behavior that we learned of the customer around that was that we can actually raise prices in certain categories on better invest items to make up for the loss of demand when you raised it and the opening price point. And what we are doing with those of learnings going forward in 2011 is that around the important key promotional times of Mother's Day and Father's Day and back-to-school, we understand that we can offer the opening price point of a $3.99 towel or $7.99 t-shirt and offer it during a promotional times, very important to have that compelling value to the customer.

I'm going to start the call a little differently this morning.

After that, Kristin Hays, our Vice President of Investor Relations, will discuss our 2011 strategic initiatives followed with Michael providing quarterly and full year guidance. I will then join back for the Q&A portion of the call. 
As you know, I would ordinarily provide more insight and we'll leave that to Michael and Kristin today because I was a passenger on a car accident earlier this week. Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt but I've been left kind of beat up with some aches and bruises. In any case, I'm very glad to be with you on the call this morning. So outside my exciting game of bumper cars this week, I'm happy to report as the results reported this morning demonstrate that 2010 was a very good year for JCPenney, as we made significant progress toward the transformation of our company in the eyes of our customers and working towards our goal of being a retail industry leader. 
Our holiday season was particularly strong reflecting the positive reception we have seen in the merchandising initiatives that we've implemented, which really began to take hold the latter part of the year. Importantly, they position us well going in 2011. 
We were particularly pleased with the performance of our Men's Apparel and Women's businesses in the quarter. We also saw strength in our Accessories and Shoes and Handbags businesses and of course, Sephora. Thanks to our sales performance, coupled with managing our gross margins to plan and better SG&A performance and expense control, we were able to outperform our expectations at the bottom line. We're leveraging on the strong momentum we created in 2010, in order to move us closer and faster to our goal of being a retail industry leader. 
Over the last several years we've infused great style in our assortments, delivered world-class customer service, introduced new and innovative retail technologies that made JCPenney a retail leader in the digital age. And now, we have a new JCPenney brand logo that symbolizes this transformation.  Our new logo continues to honor our rich legacy, while reflecting the modern retailer we've become. The logo will make its debut during our spring fashion ad launch and the Academy Awards this Sunday evening. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue."

I will first cover the highlights of our very solid fourth quarter and full year performance, and then we'll move on to 2011. As Mike mentioned, our financial results reflect the progress we made in 2010 and the continued work we are doing to transform the JCPenney brand in the minds of our customers and position JCPenney as a growth leader in the industry. 
This morning, we reported strong results for the fourth quarter. The company's comp store sales grew 4.5%, an increase for the fourth consecutive quarter and ahead of our expectations. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.09 per share, an impressive 30% growth over last year, and after the $0.08 of one-time charges in this year's number that we announced a few weeks ago. 
Our fourth quarter performance can be attributed to three factors. First, the company's growth initiatives grow top line sales. Second, we managed gross margins well and third, the team exhibited disciplined expense control. 
Total sales for the quarter grew 2.8% to $5.7 billion. As a percent of sales, gross margin was in line with our expectations and decreased approximately 60 basis points to 37.6% of sales. We are pleased with this result as we were up against the company's historic peak margins achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. 
SG&A for the quarter was better than we expected, at $1.46 billion or 25.7% of sales. Lower SG&A was primarily driven by expense controls with salary and related benefits and marketing expenses coming in better than planned. Our tax rate was also lower at 35% due to a true up of our state tax reserves at the close of the year as various issues were resolved in favor of the company. 
Moving on to the full year performance. In 2010, comp store sales increased 2.5% in line with our guidance for an increase of low-single digits for the year. Total sales increased 1.2% for the year. Catalog sales added $454 million to our revenues in 2010. Going forward, we anticipate that the increasing contribution from our growth initiatives and sales from jcp.com will not only replace this revenue over time but also significantly contribute to our top line growth. 
For the full year, the company's gross margin dollars increased $50 million over last year. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased just 20 basis points to 39.2% when compared to last year's historic peak of 39.4%. 
SG&A was also well-controlled at approximately 30.1% of sales. This is about $32 million below a year ago and 60 basis points lower as a percent of sales. In 2010, we generated $158 million in free cash flow and continue to have a very strong balance sheet with flexibility to support the key components of our growth initiatives. 
Capital expenditures for the year were $499 million, in line with our plan and included investments in our digital initiatives, as well as two new JCPenney stores, 44 renovations, over 100 store updates and 76 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations. Our year-end inventory levels are in line with expected sales trends and position us well as we head into the first half of 2011 with the expansion of Liz Claiborne into additional categories, the rollout of additional Sephora inside JCPenney locations and sufficient levels of inventory to support our growth initiatives, which are non-comparable for the first half of 2011. Specifically, we ended the year with customer-facing inventory up about 5% year-over-year and approximately 6% on a total basis, which includes what we currently call, on-the-water inventory. 
In summary, JCPenney's 2010 results reflect the team's focus on the execution of our initiatives in order to deliver profitable sales growth, while effectively managing gross margin and leveraging our SG&A. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Kristin, who will cover the company's key areas of focus for 2011. I'll then come back in a moment to provide our financial outlook for 2011 before turning the call over for questions. Kristin?"

We are getting off to a fast start in 2011 as our teams continue to work hard to deliver profitable sales growth by focusing on four key areas. 
First, we will continue to deliver great style at compelling prices, heightening our style authority. We're doing this through offering a balance of the best private, exclusive and national brands. For example, we are expanding Liz Claiborne across a range of categories in home, petites in women sizes, and introducing activewear, dresses and swimwear this year. 
We are also expanding MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by The ALDO Group to an additional 500 doors. We're continuing to rollout Sephora inside JCPenney and center core with 76 new locations opening this year. Finally, our new Modern Bride collection, which is a partnership with Condé Nast, got off to a great start for Valentine's Day. It is in bridal boutiques in 1,068 stores and on jcp.com. 
These attractions are exclusive to JCPenney and bring new customers to our stores and to jcp.com. We recognize that we have an opportunity to improve our sales productivity per net square foot primarily in the center core of our store. 
Our ability to deliver unparalleled value through offering stylish and quality merchandise at great prices sets us apart from our competitors and we fully intend to capitalize on this strength. 
Our second major area of focus is continuing to deliver a differentiated and industry-leading customer experience, delivering an interaction not just the transaction. We're giving our associates the tools to build loyalty through individualized memorable interactions with our customers. 
The value of superior customer service is not new to us. We've been successfully focused on it for years with our CustomerFIRST training and our customer satisfaction scores have been steadily on the rise. In January, we were named the top department store for the third year running in the annual NRF American Express Customer Choice Survey. We could not deliver on this important point of differentiation without highly engaged and talented associates and we appreciate their efforts. 
We also continue to expand our JCP Rewards program, which has grown to 26 million members and these customers spend more per year than our average customer and shop with us more frequently. In the third area, we are focused on offering personalized, impactful digital experiences that allow us to connect with our customers in a different and more direct way. 
This starts with continuing to dramatically improve the shopping experience on jcp.com, which we've been doing by introducing guided navigation, launching a new mobile site, connecting with our customers through social media, bringing in digital coupons and other new features in addition to the rollout of Find More in our stores. 
Taken together, with the changes we are making to our online merchandise assortment, our objective is to build upon the strong growth we experienced online in 2010 in order to grow jcp.com sales by double digits in 2011. 
Fourth and very importantly, across our organization we are focused on continuing to optimize our resources and reduce expenses where appropriate. For example, we are continuing to optimize our marketing expense in order to get a better return on our spend with a new more localized approach and enhanced digital marketing. We will continue to develop our expense-minded culture and maintain rigorous cost disciplines including across our home office. We are driving efficiencies through our second-generation markdown and size optimization tools, as well as deploying RFID to allow us to better control our inventory and turn it more effectively. 
We are also instituting new pricing tools to increase sales, profits and the customer's perception of value, enabling us to increase our AUR.  And we will further capitalize on our jTime's store staffing tool to control salary dollars and continue to manage our SG&A expense. These initiatives come on top of the significant steps we announced last month to complete the wind down of catalog and streamline certain areas of the business. 
As we pursue these expense savings, we are also taking a number of important steps to mitigate the impact of input cost increases. We are leveraging supplier relationships that we've built over the years, which enable us to place orders for goods earlier than most other retailers. 
We are also capitalizing on our vertically integrated product team to optimize the product cycle through product engineering, strategic and alternative raw material acquisitions, advanced production planning and taking even greater control over the supply chain, especially overseas, where we have leverage that others don't, in order to reduce our shipping costs. 
At the same time, we've been testing price elasticity for the past year to identify where we can opportunistically increase prices. In the better and best pricing tiers, we've had success in modestly increasing ticket in certain areas. 
And finally, we focus on increasing private and exclusive brands in our merchandise mix as we have the greatest control over cost and they allow us to best address our customers' needs for affordability. Even with lower price points than national brands, our private brand margin is typically 300 to 500 basis points higher than our national brand. 
In short, these four key areas of focus are designed to deliver profitable sales growth, maintain margins, while controlling our expenses. And in the end, should enable JCPenney to return value to our shareholders. 
Now, I will turn the call back over to Michael to go over the company's financial outlook for 2011."

As a result, we are continuing to plan our business conservatively. Specifically, our outlook for 2011 is as follows. 
We are planning our same-store sales to increase low- to mid- single digits for the year. Similar with what we experienced in 2010, we expect total sales to increase approximately 300 basis points less than our comparable store sales. Again, I would like to remind you that this is due to the elimination of our Catalog and the Outlet business and this is a temporary impact. 
The gross margin rate is expected to be about flat year-over-year.  As Kristin mentioned, we are managing pricing pressures in 2011 by adjusting our product mix, leveraging our sourcing capabilities and where appropriate, increasing prices. We believe we have the strategies in place to successfully navigate this inflationary environment, which is a testament to our strength in sourcing goods and flexibility we have with our private brands. 
We will continue to aggressively manage SG&A in 2011 with expectations that will remain flat as a percent of sales year-over-year. Taking these parameters together, the company expects 2011 earnings to increase by about 45% to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 per share. This does not take into account the impact of our newly approved $900 million share repurchase program that we announced today. 
As noted in the earnings release, we intend to repurchase common stock through an open-market program beginning in March. We will update our annual guidance when we report first quarter results in May, as we will have better visibility to the impact of our share repurchase program on our earnings target. 
Finally, let me add two more quick notes on 2011. Our capital expenditures are planned at $650 million for the year, which includes investments in important planning and allocation tools such as size and markdown optimization, our digital initiatives, the expansion of MNG by Mango and Call it Spring, three new department stores, 70 renovations and the 76 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations. 
Also the 2011 pension expense for our qualified pension plan will be $87 million or $0.22 per share for the year. This is a $134 million reduction from our 2010 expense. Looking at the first quarter specifically, we anticipate 3% to 5% growth in comp store sales. On a monthly basis, February is expected to be towards the higher end of the range, March is expected to be negative and April is expected to be significantly better mostly due to the Easter holidays shifting into April reporting period this year. 
As I mentioned overall for 2011, we expect gross margins to be about flat to last year, with the first quarter remaining under pressure as we work to improve the company's AUR under our pricing strategies and initiatives such as the markdown optimization. Those initiatives really won't take hold until later in the year. 
In addition, margins in the first quarter will be negatively impacted as we cycle against the profitable tail of our last Big Book that was still active in the first quarter of 2010. This impact is not expected to continue beyond Q1. 
For the first quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.23 per share, which includes about $0.05 of some non-comparable items, including the renewal of our revolving credit facility which matures next year, charges related to the exit of the Catalog and Outlet business that we announced earlier and modest expenses related to our new growth initiatives of The Foundry, Gifting Grace and CLAD. 
In summary, we are excited about the potential for additional growth in 2011. We expect the first quarter will be the smallest of the year and our earnings growth will accelerate after the first quarter as our initiatives take hold. 
Now, we will open the call for questions."

I would say across the board, we did a great job in the organization managing our expenses. Our store managers made the right decisions throughout the quarter. There was tough weather issues as an example in January, they made the right decisions because you're not going to have customer traffic. You don't have to staff at the same level.

We have, Chuck, been testing, I think, the Women's division are testing it in the spring of last year and we rolled out some testing company-wide over the summer. Overall, what we were seeing in a good price point when you raise prices, let's just say $1 on an opening price point, units did go down, which is what we would expect. And that's why it's important to test because you learn not only the pricing issues but also customer behavior around that. What we did learn also is in the better and best price points that when we raised the price, let's say $1. We filled enough units to cover what we lost in the good price point and at better margins. So the behavior that we learned of the customer around that was that we can actually raise prices in certain category on better and best items to make up for the loss of demand when you raised it and the opening price point. And what we're doing with those learnings going forward in 2011 is that around the important key promotional times of Mother's Day and Father's Day and back-to-school, we understand that we can offer the opening price point of a $3.99 towel or $7.99 t-shirt and offer it during that promotional time, when it's very important to have that compelling value to the customer. And then take the price back up during those non-promotional and appointment shopping times, and continue to sell enough at the better and best price points to make up for the change in demand at a higher price."

So the center core productivity as Mike said with modern shoes and handbags and Sephora inside JCPenney, improving cross shopping across those areas.

So we've worked with the Mango organization and we've modified a lot of things in the learnings. And we feel very good that our existing customers as they get more understanding of the brand will respond very well. Interestingly, when they buy the first purchase, they maybe buy 1.4 pieces. The second purchase is maybe additional piece. The third purchase an additional piece. So I think it's going to be a learning experience for the customers, as well as for us.

We intentionally got more promotional to drive the business, as well as our non-comparable clearance strategy had an impact in our promotional strategy. Our units for the year were up about 9.6%. Our transactions were up 7.5%. Our units per transaction were up 1.9%. So aside from a modest decline in AUR, our metrics are pretty strong and pretty much reflected in the comps. As we transition in 2011, we said, we're consciously going to work on improving our AUR for the variety of things that were mentioned. We believe that we continue to overperform in the opening price point items because we think that the strong merchandising performance we had in 2010 in Men's, Women's and Kids, particularly in the opening price points, that gives a lot of confidence that we're resonating not only the quality of the merchandise but also the presentation that's impactful and has work very well for us. So I think on the metrics, we feel we got it planned properly. The big unknown, of course, is the appetite for pricing  across all categories, all price points."

First of all, obviously by definition, catalog inventories is invisible to the customer because it's in a warehouse that we ship pieces to the stores. To the extent we start to align our inventory for online with the store inventory, it's much more effective to clear the inventory, we have extra inventory, these are the same items. It's much easier to clear in the store, much more profitably in our existing stores. So aside from furniture and some of the very big-ticket items or items that are not in our store inventory like, say, baby cribs and rolled goods and so forth. We feel much more confident about getting higher GP by clearing with our existing store footprint. I will say that our clearance strategy gives us some confidence that by having clearance on the floor everyday, the customer really enjoys that rather than these five or six big events a year. That also supports the idea that we can clear goods out of the dot-com space on the same basis."

We have a lot of merchandising rollouts with the Mango and Call it Spring and Sephora, as well as center core upgrades. We have a number of large remodels during the year as well.

We also have the normal capital investment and maintenance of our stores whether it's air-conditioning and roofing and escalators and so forth. But we believe that the $650 million that we've targeted is the correct investment for the year and balance across those areas. There are only three new stores. As to the good, better, best investments, I don't see a big shift from what we've done in the past. Obviously, to the extent that Mango and Call it Spring and initiatives like this overperformed that would tend to increase our penetration in the upper price points. But we know that of the cadence of our opening price point offers last year served us very well.

I will then join back for the Q&A portion of the call. 
As you know, I would ordinarily provide more insight and we'll leave that to Michael and Kristin today because I was a passenger on a car accident earlier this week. Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt but I've been left kind of beat up with some aches and bruises. In any case, I'm very glad to be with you on the call this morning. So outside my exciting game of bumper cars this week, I'm happy to report as the results reported this morning demonstrate that 2010 was a very good year for JCPenney, as we made significant progress toward the transformation of our company in the eyes of our customers and working towards our goal of being a retail industry leader. 
Our holiday season was particularly strong reflecting the positive reception we have seen in the merchandising initiatives that we've implemented, which really began to take hold the latter part of the year. Importantly, they positioned us well going in 2011. 
We were particularly pleased with the performance of our Men's Apparel and Women's businesses in the quarter. We also saw strength in our Accessories and Shoes and Handbags businesses and of course, Sephora. Thanks to our sales performance, coupled with managing our gross margins to plan and better SG&A performance and expense control, we were able to outperform our expectations at the bottom line. We're leveraging on the strong momentum we created in 2010, in order to move us closer and faster to our goal of being a retail industry leader. 
Over the last several years we've infused great style in our assortments, delivered world-class customer service, introduced new and innovative retail technologies that made JCPenney a retail leader in the digital age. And now, we have a new JCPenney brand logo that symbolizes this transformation.  Our new logo continues to honor our rich legacy, while reflecting the modern retailer we've become. The logo will make its debut during our spring fashion ad launch and the Academy Awards this Sunday evening. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue."

I will first cover the highlights of our very solid fourth quarter and full year performance, and then we'll move on to 2011. As Mike mentioned, our financial results reflect the progress we made in 2010 and the continued work we are doing to transform the JCPenney brand in the minds of our customers and position JCPenney as a growth leader in the industry. 
This morning, we reported strong results for the fourth quarter. The company's comp store sales grew 4.5%, an increase for the fourth consecutive quarter and ahead of our expectations. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.09 per share, an impressive 30% growth over last year, and after the $0.08 of one-time charges in this year's number that we announced a few weeks ago. 
Our fourth quarter performance can be attributed to three factors. First, the company's growth initiatives grow top line sales. Second, we managed gross margins well and third, the team exhibited disciplined expense control. 
Total sales for the quarter grew 2.8% to $5.7 billion. As a percent of sales, gross margin was in line with our expectations and decreased approximately 60 basis points to 37.6% of sales. We are pleased with this result as we were up against the company's historic peak margins achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. 
SG&A for the quarter was better than we expected, at $1.46 billion or 25.7% of sales. Lower SG&A was primarily driven by expense controls with salary and related benefits and marketing expenses coming in better than planned. Our tax rate was also lower at 35% due to a true up of our state tax reserves at the close of the year as various issues were resolved in favor of the company. 
Moving on to the full year performance. In 2010, comp store sales increased 2.5% in line with our guidance for an increase of low-single digits for the year. Total sales increased 1.2% for the year. Catalog sales added $454 million to our revenues in 2010. Going forward, we anticipate that the increasing contribution from our growth initiatives and sales from jcp.com will not only replace this revenue over time but also significantly contribute to our top line growth. 
For the full year, the company's gross margin dollars increased $50 million over last year. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased just 20 basis points to 39.2% when compared to last year's historic peak of 39.4%. 
SG&A was also well-controlled at approximately 30.1% of sales. This is about $32 million below a year ago and 60 basis points lower as a percent of sales. In 2010, we generated $158 million in free cash flow and continue to have a very strong balance sheet with flexibility to support the key components of our growth initiatives. 
Capital expenditures for the year were $499 million, in line with our plan and included investments in our digital initiatives, as well as two new JCPenney stores, 44 renovations, over 100 store updates and 76 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations. Our year-end inventory levels are in line with expected sales trends and position us well as we head into the first half of 2011 with the expansion of Liz Claiborne into additional categories, the rollout of additional Sephora inside JCPenney locations and sufficient levels of inventory to support our growth initiatives, which are non-comparable for the first half of 2011. Specifically, we ended the year with customer-facing inventory up about 5% year-over-year and approximately 6% on a total basis, which includes what we currently call, on-the-water inventory. 
In summary, JCPenney's 2010 results reflect the team's focus on the execution of our initiatives in order to deliver profitable sales growth, while effectively managing gross margin and leveraging our SG&A. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Kristin, who will cover the company's key areas of focus for 2011. I'll then come back in a moment to provide our financial outlook for 2011 before turning the call over for questions. Kristin?"

We are getting off to a fast start in 2011 as our teams continue to work hard to deliver profitable sales growth by focusing on four key areas. 
First, we will continue to deliver great style at compelling prices, heightening our style authority. We're doing this through offering a balance of the best private, exclusive and national brands. For example, we are expanding Liz Claiborne across a range of categories in home, petites in women sizes, and introducing activewear, dresses and swimwear this year. 
We are also expanding MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by The ALDO Group to an additional 500 doors. We're continuing to rollout Sephora inside JCPenney and center core with 76 new locations opening this year. Finally, our new Modern Bride collection, which is a partnership with Condé Nast, got off to a great start for Valentine's Day. It is in bridal boutiques in 1,068 stores and on jcp.com. 
These attractions are exclusive to JCPenney and bring new customers to our stores and to jcp.com. We recognize that we have an opportunity to improve our sales productivity per net square foot primarily in the center core of our store. 
Our ability to deliver unparalleled value through offering stylish and quality merchandise at great prices sets us apart from our competitors and we fully intend to capitalize on this strength. 
Our second major area of focus is continuing to deliver a differentiated and industry-leading customer experience, delivering an interaction not just the transaction. We're giving our associates the tools to build loyalty through individualized memorable interactions with our customers. 
The value of superior customer service is not new to us. We've been successfully focused on it for years with our CustomerFIRST training and our customer satisfaction scores have been steadily on the rise. In January, we were named the top department store for the third year running in the annual NRF American Express Customer Choice Survey. We could not deliver on this important point of differentiation without highly engaged and talented associates and we appreciate their efforts. 
We also continue to expand our JCP Rewards program, which has grown to 26 million members and these customers spend more per year than our average customer and shop with us more frequently. In the third area, we are focused on offering personalized, impactful digital experiences that allow us to connect with our customers in a different and more direct way. 
This starts with continuing to dramatically improve the shopping experience on jcp.com, which we've been doing by introducing guided navigation, launching a new mobile site, connecting with our customers through social media, bringing in digital coupons and other new features in addition to the rollout of Find More in our stores. 
Taken together, with the changes we are making to our online merchandise assortment, our objective is to build upon the strong growth we experienced online in 2010 in order to grow jcp.com sales by double digits in 2011. 
Fourth and very importantly, across our organization we are focused on continuing to optimize our resources and reduce expenses where appropriate. For example, we are continuing to optimize our marketing expense in order to get a better return on our spend with a new more localized approach and enhanced digital marketing. We will continue to develop our expense-minded culture and maintain rigorous cost disciplines including across our home office. We are driving efficiencies through our second-generation markdown and size optimization tools, as well as deploying RFID to allow us to better control our inventory and turn it more effectively. 
We are also instituting new pricing tools to increase sales, profits and the customer's perception of value, enabling us to increase our AUR.  And we will further capitalize on our jTime's store staffing tool to control salary dollars and continue to manage our SG&A expense. These initiatives come on top of the significant steps we announced last month to complete the wind down of catalog and streamline certain areas of the business. 
As we pursue these expense savings, we are also taking a number of important steps to mitigate the impact of input cost increases. We are leveraging supplier relationships that we've built over the years, which enable us to place orders for goods earlier than most other retailers. 
We are also capitalizing on our vertically integrated product team to optimize the product cycle through product engineering, strategic and alternative raw material acquisitions, advanced production planning and taking even greater control over the supply chain, especially overseas, where we have leverage that others don't, in order to reduce our shipping costs. 
At the same time, we've been testing price elasticity for the past year to identify where we can opportunistically increase prices. In the better and best pricing tiers, we've had success in modestly increasing ticket in certain areas. 
And finally, we focus on increasing private and exclusive brands in our merchandise mix as we have the greatest control over costs and they allow us to best address our customers' needs for affordability. Even with lower price points than national brands, our private brand margin is typically 300 to 500 basis points higher than our national brand. 
In short, these four key areas of focus are designed to deliver profitable sales growth, maintain margins, while controlling our expenses. And in the end, should enable JCPenney to return value to our shareholders. 
Now, I will turn the call back over to Michael to go over the company's financial outlook for 2011."

As we look to 2011, the consumer environment remains uncertain and budgets for the moderate customer we serve remain tight. As a result, we are continuing to plan our business conservatively.

As a result, we are continuing to plan our business conservatively. Specifically, our outlook for 2011 is as follows. 
We are planning our same-store sales to increase low- to mid- single digits for the year. Similar with what we experienced in 2010, we expect total sales to increase approximately 300 basis points less than our comparable store sales. Again, I would like to remind you that this is due to the elimination of our Catalog and the Outlet business and this is a temporary impact. 
The gross margin rate is expected to be about flat year-over-year.  As Kristin mentioned, we are managing pricing pressures in 2011 by adjusting our product mix, leveraging our sourcing capabilities and where appropriate, increasing prices. We believe we have the strategies in place to successfully navigate this inflationary environment, which is a testament to our strength in sourcing goods and flexibility we have with our private brands. 
We will continue to aggressively manage SG&A in 2011 with expectations that will remain flat as a percent of sales year-over-year. Taking these parameters together, the company expects 2011 earnings to increase by about 45% to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 per share. This does not take into account the impact of our newly approved $900 million share repurchase program that we announced today. 
As noted in the earnings release, we intend to repurchase common stock through an open-market program beginning in March. We will update our annual guidance when we report first quarter results in May, as we will have better visibility to the impact of our share repurchase program on our earnings target. 
Finally, let me add two more quick notes on 2011. Our capital expenditures are planned at $650 million for the year, which includes investments in important planning and allocation tools such as size and markdown optimization, our digital initiatives, the expansion of MNG by Mango and Call it Spring, three new department stores, 70 renovations and the 76 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations. 
Also the 2011 pension expense for our qualified pension plan will be $87 million or $0.22 per share for the year. This is a $134 million reduction from our 2010 expense. Looking at the first quarter specifically, we anticipate 3% to 5% growth in comp store sales. On a monthly basis, February is expected to be towards the higher end of the range, March is expected to be negative and April is expected to be significantly better mostly due to the Easter holidays shifting into April reporting period this year. 
As I mentioned overall for 2011, we expect gross margins to be about flat to last year, with the first quarter remaining under pressure as we work to improve the company's AUR under our pricing strategies and initiatives such as the markdown optimization. Those initiatives really won't take hold until later in the year. 
In addition, margins in the first quarter will be negatively impacted as we cycle against the profitable tail of our last Big Book that was still active in the first quarter of 2010. This impact is not expected to continue beyond Q1. 
For the first quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.23 per share, which includes about $0.05 of some non-comparable items, including the renewal of our revolving credit facility which matures next year, charges related to the exit of the Catalog and Outlet business that we announced earlier and modest expenses related to our new growth initiatives of The Foundry, Gifting Grace and CLAD. 
In summary, we are excited about the potential for additional growth in 2011. We expect the first quarter will be the smallest of the year and our earnings growth will accelerate after the first quarter as our initiatives take hold. 
Now, we will open the call for questions."

We have, Chuck, been testing, I think, the Women's division are testing it in the spring of last year and we rolled out some testing company-wide over the summer. Overall, what we were seeing in a good price point when you raise prices, let's just say $1 on an opening price point, units did go down, which is what we would expect. And that's why it's important to test because you learn not only the pricing issues but also customer behavior around that. What we did learn also is in the better and best price points that when we raised the price, let's say $1. We sold enough units to cover what we lost in the good price point and at better margins. So the behavior that we learned of the customer around that was that we can actually raise prices in certain category on better and best items to make up for the loss of demand when you raised it and the opening price point. And what we're doing with those learnings going forward in 2011 is that around the important key promotional times of Mother's Day and Father's Day and back-to-school, we understand that we can offer the opening price point of a $3.99 towel or $7.99 t-shirt and offer it during that promotional time, when it's very important to have that compelling value to the customer. And then take the price back up during those non-promotional and appointment shopping times, and continue to sell enough at the better and best price points to make up for the change in demand at the higher price."

The second purchase is maybe additional piece. The third purchase an additional piece. So I think it's going to be a learning experience for the customers, as well as for us. There really only five true fast fashion brands in the world. It's Zara, Uniqlo, Forever 21, H&M and Mango.

As we transition in 2011, we said, we're consciously going to work on improving our AUR for the variety of things that were mentioned. We believe that we continue to overperform in the opening price point items because we think that the strong merchandising performance we had in 2010 in Men's, Women's and Kids, particularly in the opening price points, that gives a lot of confidence that we're resonating not only the quality of the merchandise but also the presentation that's impactful and has work very well for us. So I think on the metrics, we feel we got it planned properly. The big unknown, of course, is the appetite for pricing  across all categories, all price points."

First of all, obviously by definition, catalog inventories is invisible to the customer because it's in a warehouse that we ship pieces to the stores. To the extent we start to align our inventory for online with the store inventory, it's much more effective to clear the inventory, we have extra inventory, so the same items.

So aside from furniture and some of the very big-ticket items or items that are not in our store inventory like, say, baby cribs and rolled goods and so forth. We feel much more confident about getting higher GP by clearing with our existing store footprint.

That also supports the idea we can clear goods out of the dot-com space on the same basis."

As to the good, better, best investments, I don't see a big shift from what we've done in the past. Obviously, to the extent that Mango and Call it Spring and initiatives like this overperformed that would tend to increase our penetration in the upper price points.

We have a great deal to cover so I'll keep our remarks brief and allow time for your questions. 
Overall, there are a few main points I'd like to make. First, our ability to deliver on our first quarter objectives, in fact, a little bit ahead to the progress we're making in transforming our company from a traditional department store to a retail industry leader. Second, our growth industry initiative performing very well and allowing us to drive the top line of our stores and on www.jcpenney.com. 
We are continuing to build on the accomplishments we set in motion over 18 months ago, which are focused on 4 key areas. First, continuing our style of authority by delivering style credibility for the balance of the best private and national brands. Second, we are delivering memorable customer interactions with highly engaged associates, inspire discovery and build loyalty with our customers. Third, to impact our digital experiences that are personalized and impactful. And fourth, by focusing on driving profitable growth through operational effectiveness. 
Based on actions we have taken to improve store execution, customer service and implement technology to streamline our processes like jTime and door to floor, as well as get out of businesses that are no longer delivering for us, we now have a foundation in place to accelerate a series of initiatives that will maximize operational effectiveness and profitability. Executing on these, which we started in the first quarter, is allowing us to achieve significant cost savings, which will grow in magnitude over the next several years in order to allow us to achieve our 5-year earnings target of $5 per share by 2014. 
So with that, let me give you some highlights of our first quarter. We continue to make significant strides in our style transformation with the opening of
[Audio Gap]
 including Modern Bride and sunglasses, and is anchored by support inside JCPenney. We see substantial upside to increasing our focus on these businesses to continue to increase in sales within our stores, as well as further reinforcing JCPenney as a style destination. 
At the same time, men's continues to drive to deliver strong results building on the momentum we've seen since last Father's Day as our customers are responding well to our new updated, modern merchandising offerings led by Claiborne and J. Ferrar. Children's is also a standout business as moms loved the styles and prices we offer on brands such as Carter's and our own billion dollar brand, Arizona. 
And in home, despite the ongoing softness in the housing market, which continues to impact our Furniture business, we are seeing very good performance in our soft home businesses. As we continue to make our stores more exciting and fun to shop, we remain as dedicated as ever to superior customer service. In addition to great associates, we will also this year, put our leading-edge technology to work with our new markdown and size optimization tools and the reduction of RFID across the number of stores, which will help us stay in stock on these key high SKU merchandise categories that customers are shopping in our stores. 
I also want to quickly mention our new Growth Brands Division. A few weeks ago, we of soft opened the first 10 Foundry Big & Tall Supply company stores, our first business under this new division. The Foundry website launched in April. And in the beginning of May, we opened 6 stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Fort in Kansas City. They carry a broad range of higher end great brands and operating in the Southeast experience design for the Big & Tall customer. Initial response has been terrific. 
Private and Growth brands businesses, the launch in the coming months, CLAD in August and Gifting Grace in September. These digital businesses will allow us to make use of the tremendous merchandising expertise we have in our company and to pursue significant long-term revenue streams. We are also proud to be partnering with the Hearst Corporation on these 2 new ventures. 
During the quarter, customers discovered the great style and price in our private brands typically offered in our good and better price points. This resulted in an AUR being down just 1% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. At the same time, transactions were up 10% as our compelling offer to have more customers to JCPenney. 
The areas of success we're seeing in our stores are being mirrored online at JCP.com of 6.6% with the strongest performance coming from men's and children's apparel and women's accessories. JCP.com profitability was impacted by free shipping offers, which impacted the sites' conversion rate in sales. All that aside, the business is gaining momentum and we're confident in our ability to deliver an incremental $1 billion of sales by 2014. 
As should I mention, our sourcing relationships continue to allow us to purchase and manufacture our inventory as price effectively as possible, while protecting our margins, we were able to offer customers many pricing options. National brands that they know and trust at better and best price points, as well as our well-known private brands that offer tremendous style and quality at our good and better price points. We have not found any price adversity from our customers to these merchandise areas as we have raised prices. 
We feel very good about our ability to maintain our smart pricing strategy in the back half of this year accordingly, planned on our 3% to 4% for the season. For 2012, there's still quite a bit of price volatility in the raw materials so it is a little too soon to determine the impact. 
As we work to drive the top line, our focus on significantly improving our expense structure and commitment to operational effectiveness was also very clear in the first quarter and it will only accelerate. A key element to this is tight inventory control, which we were able to execute during the central systems that underlie our business. We ended the quarter with total inventory up 6%. However, only 3.5% is this customer facing at this time. The remaining inventory is underwater, mostly Liz Claiborne product and basics is not comparable. We feel very comfortable that our inventory level as this will allow us to support our growth initiatives as well as improve inventory turn. 
Now turning to how we plan to accelerate operational effectiveness. As mentioned in our press release, we are currently in the second year of executing our 2010-2014 Long Range Plan for growth. And with that, we see opportunity to continue to grow sales by improving sales productivity in our stores and in JCP.com. To continued success of our growth initiatives and exclusive attractions like Liz Claiborne, support inside JCPenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring. 
We're also increasing profitability at an accelerated rate by optimizing our expense structure. So with these, we are implementing across the company initiatives that will maximize our operational effectiveness. We began this process about 18 months ago with initiatives like jTime for staffing models in our stores, Door to Floor, the discontinuation of our Catalog Outlet business and moving to enterprisewide inventory, tools like markdown utilization, RFID, implementation of our new digital platform and many, many more. The initial steps we'll take include: reducing our SG&A expense, plan to reduce our SG&A expense an additional $50 million, a portion of which is all even realize in the first quarter and we expect much more to come as we continue to reengineer our business in order to maximize our growth opportunities the next couple of years. We'll inform you more about these actions, which include reducing our gross marketing expenses, streamlining our operations and carrying out further process improvements in our stores and home office when we announce the second quarter results. There's great potential ahead on these fronts. Additionally, we started the restructuring of our supply-chain operations, which we can do based on having an enterprisewide visibility and availability of inventory, and these 2 will deliver a significant annualized cost savings coming on top of those are what we announced to you in January, with the wind down of our catalog business and operations related to that. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue, who will provide the numbers around our business during the quarter"
295624,131610822,129054,"J. C.

On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk about our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year.

On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk about our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. 
We're feeling confident in our long-term strategies and our execution is better than ever before as the combination of our top line growth initiatives, expense-minded culture and operational initiatives are beginning to deliver measurable results. We told you back in February that the first quarter in 2011 will be our smallest in terms of EPS growth. And while we exceeded our initial guidance and delivered solid results, I'm looking forward to outlining our expectations for the second quarter and beyond. 
The key takeaways for the first quarter were that: we reported $0.28 in EPS exceeding our guidance, merchandising initiatives continue to deliver sales growth, our gross margins were in line with expectations, we effectively managed expenses and launched a number of cost-saving restructuring initiatives, we completed our $900 million share buyback program in May and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
Now let's start with our top line. Driven by the continued success of our growth initiatives, the company's comparable store sales grew 3.8%, an increase for the fifth consecutive quarter and right at the midpoint of our guidance. Total sales for the quarter increased to $3.94 billion. As a percent of sales, gross margins came in line with expectations, decreasing approximately 90 basis points to 40.5% of sales. 
It's worth noting that gross margins generated for merchandise sales in our stores were ahead of plan as our growth initiatives delivered profitable sales as expected. But just as we told you, however, overall gross margins in the first quarter were negatively impacted because we cycled against the profitable tail of our last big one that was still active in the first quarter of 2010. 
We also had free shipping promotions on JCP.com that negatively impacted margins year-over-year. I would like to reiterate that our growth initiatives are not only driving top line growth, but also generating healthy gross profit, which will be more apparent going forward. 
SG&A for the quarter was better than expected at $1.28 billion or 32.5% of sales. Lower SG&A was primarily driven by our marketing optimization and home office expense-savings initiatives, which offset moderate expense increases related to the expansions of supporting inside JCPenney, as well as start-up costs associated with our Growth Plans division. 
As Mike said in his remarks, our expense savings initiatives are expected to reduce our SG&A run rate by over $50 million this year. A portion of this savings was realized in the first quarter with significantly more savings expected over the balance of this year and the next several years. 
Turning back to first quarter results. We reported lower-than-expected interest expense of $58 million in the first quarter. Contrary to our prior expectations, we do not write off the $9 million of capitalized costs related to the $750 million bank line of credit. Given that the facility was increased and all the banks in the old facility are in the new facility, the accounting rules require that we continue amortizing fees over the 5-year term of the new facility. 
To cover a few key balance sheet items, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. And earlier this month, we completed our $900 million share repurchase program. Since March, we repurchased 24.4 million shares at an average price of $36.96. We estimate that the shares repurchased in the first quarter added about $0.01 to the first quarter earnings per share. Our fully completed repurchase will have an accumulative impact of an estimated $0.02 per share in the second quarter and approximately $0.20 for the full year 2011. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $117 million, in line with expectations. And we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. As Mike already told you, we are working hard on effectively redesigning our cost structure in order to create a more nimble and profitable organization. To that effect and in addition to significantly reducing streamlining our SG&A expenses, we are completing the wind down of our catalog and outlet operations, which as announced in January, will deliver additional annualized savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million starting in 2012. Also we expect the restructuring of our supply-chain operations will benefit our operating income by about $25 million to $30 million in 2013 with approximately 1/2 of that benefit being achieved in 2012. 
Starting with the $3 million in the first quarter, we will incur charges for accelerated depreciation associated with the facilities we are planning to close, lease termination costs, as well as severance and outplacing services provided to the few hundred associates impacted by the restructuring. Remaining charges are currently estimated as follows: $12 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the second half of 2011 and $15 million over the course of 2012. 
Now let me share with you our few other planning assumptions for the second quarter. We anticipate 3% to 4% growth in comp store sales. The gross margin rate is expected to be relatively flat to slightly up in the second quarter. We are expecting SG&A to leverage and decrease as a percent of sales, even though we are anticipating a slight increase on our SG&A expenses largely due to expenses related to start up at the Growth Plans division. 
Real Estate and others is expected to reflect a net expense of $16 million, which includes $21 million of restructuring charges through that line item. Taking these parameters into account, for the second quarter, earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24 per share. To assist you with your modeling, our restructuring and noncomparable items are referred to on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. For the full year, the company expects 2011 earnings to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share including the impact of our share repurchase program as well as the restructuring charges. 
In summary, we're off to a great start this year and we are pleased with the progress that we've made and the potential in front of us. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

I think that free shipping is a matter of learning what is the best way to manage the top line versus the expense of shipping offers. I think as we transition the merchandise online to meet our store assortments, that will allow us to get better margins. A lot of our inventory online was conservative and traditional merchandise for the catalog shoppers and it's taken us a while to learn exactly how much we're going to be able to liquidate that portion of the demand and replace it with people to shopping in our stores.

It's not necessary to support the business the way we're running it going forward. We're also are able to liquidate some of our .COM clearance back to the stores as opposed to our outlet stores. So it's a sense of taking a fresh look at what our strategy going forward.  For example, right now, we would have to support .com with shoes in all 3 new warehouses and repurposed facilities. And going forward, we now have the systems capability to put all of the category in one warehouse or in 2 warehouse instead of 3. So that will have the effect of more in-stock in a single place to take care of customers but also increase our turn by carrying an average of less inventory overall."

Another example is Door to Floor, which was to how to get the goods on the selling floor faster and less in the stock room and actually get better visibility when it's coming to the store. So we are looking in a number of areas like that where we believe we'll have the opportunity to improve our performance, at the same time, have lower SG&A. Probably the single biggest opportunities in marketing as I mentioned, we think that we'll get a chunk of that this year, but we'll actually start to accelerate that improvement as we go forward. We have an ongoing lean process going on at the home office to look at ways to better run our business. So it's across a number of categories, no single category will be as big as the marketing category. And our stores selling, as I said has been dramatically improved by jTime, but we'll take another look are there other better ways to organize the way we staff our stores going forward."

That has been reflected in the past in our .com business. It was also reflected in our correct inventory in the warehouse. As we transitioned the inventory facing the customer to be the same inventory that's in the stores by best amount, there are some specialized businesses online like real goods for children's, cribs and so forth. The vast majority is the same inventory now that is in our stores.

So the difference will be like lower sales expectation in 2014 but maintaining the bottom line EPS forecast, which obviously improves and increase the quality of earnings because sales would not be at the level that we forecasted. We did not change the comp for the 5-year period. So all we're doing is calling out the fact that a year later, we are smarter as to what the current environment is for new store growth. We have an appetite for new stores that meet our total rate and when they have sufficient Penney's customers in the market, at the meantime, we're going to invest a lot of our CapEx into merchandise improvements in our stores attractions and renovations, and it will take a while for the growth branch group to build the kind of sales momentum to be the size of 70 new large stores would be."

So you're quite correct, if we don't have a CapEx budget for 2014 at this point except to say that by building large new stores there are more resources to allocate to other ways of growing the business."

We have a great deal to cover so I'll keep our remarks brief and allow time for your questions. 
Overall, there are few main points I'd like to make. First, our ability to deliver on our first quarter objectives, in fact, it might a little bit ahead, it reflects the progress we're making in transforming our company from a traditional department store to a retail industry leader. Second, our growth industries are performing very well and allowing us to drive the top line in our stores and on jcp.com. 
We're continuing to build on the accomplishments we set in motion over 18 months ago, which are focused on 4 key areas. First, we're continuing to assert our style authority by delivering great style of credibility for the balance of the best private and national brands. Second, we're delivering memorable customer interactions with the highly engaged associates, who inspire discovery and build loyalty with our customers. Third, to impact full digital experiences that are personalized and impactful. And fourth, by focusing on driving profitable growth through operational effectiveness. 
Based on actions we've taken to improve in-store execution, customer service and implement technology that streamline our processes like jTime and Door to Floor, as well as get out of businesses that are no longer delivering for us, we now have the foundation in place to accelerate a series of initiatives of a maximized operational effectiveness and profitability. Executing on these, which we started in the first quarter, is allowing us to achieve significant cost savings, which will grow in magnitude over the next several years in order to allow us to achieve our 5-year earnings target of $5 per share by 2014. 
So with that, let me give you some highlights of our first quarter. We continue to make significant strides in our style transformation with the opening of
[Audio Gap]
and mix [ph] footwear, fine jewelry including Modern Bride, and sunglasses, and is anchored by Sephora inside jcpenney. We see substantial upside to increasing our focus on these businesses to continue increasing the sales per script within our stores, as well as further reinforcing jcpenney as a style destination. 
At the same time, men's continues to drive -- deliver strong results. Building on the momentum we've seen since last Father's Day, as our customers are responding well to our new updated, modern merchandising offerings led by Claiborne and J. Ferrar. 
Children's is also a standout business. As moms loved the styles and prices we offer on brands such as Carter's and our own billion-dollar brand in Arizona. 
And in home, despite the ongoing softness in the housing market, which continues to impact our Furniture business, we are seeing very good performance in our soft home businesses. As we continue to make our stores more exciting and fun to shop, we remain as dedicated as ever to superior customer service. In addition to great associates, we will also this year put our leading-edge technology to work with our new markdown and size-optimization tools and the introduction of RFID across the number of stores, which will help us stay in stock on these key high SKU merchandise categories that our customers are shopping in our stores. 
I also want to quickly mention our new Growth Brands Division. A few weeks ago, we have soft-opened the first 10 Foundry Big & Tall Supply Co. stores, our first business is under this new division. The Foundry website launched in April. And at the beginning of May, we opened 6 stores in Dallas-Fort Worth area and 4 stores in Kansas City. They carry a broad range of higher-end great brands and offer unique shopping experience designed for just the Big & Tall customer. Initial response has been terrific. 
Our other 2 Growth Brands businesses that will launch in the coming months, CLAD in August and Gifting Grace in September. These digital businesses will allow us to make use of the tremendous merchandising expertise we have at our company and to pursue a significant long-term revenue streams. We are also proud to be partnering with the Hearst Corporation on these 2 new ventures. 
During the quarter, customers discovered the great style and price of our private brands typically offer our good and better price points. This resulted in AUR being down just 1% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. At the same time, transactions were up 10% as our compelling offer to have more customers with jcpenney. 
The areas of sales through Internet seeing in our stores are being mirrored online at jcp.com of 6.6% of the quarter, with the strongest performances coming from men's and children's apparel and women's accessories. jcp.com's profitability was impacted by free shipping offers, which impacted the sites' conversion rate in sales. All that aside, Printed business is gaining momentum and we're confident in our ability to deliver an incremental $1 billion of sales by 2014. 
I should mention our sourcing relationships continue to allow us to purchase and manufacture inventory as price-effectively as possible. While protecting our margins, we were able to offer customers many pricing options. National brands as they now entrusted better and best price points, as well as our well-known private brands that offer tremendous style and quality at our good and better price points. We have not found any price adversity from our customers to these merchandise areas as we've raised prices. 
We feel very good about our ability to maintain our smart pricing strategy in the back half of this year. Accordingly, we planned on our events [ph] only 3% to 4% for the season. For 2012, there's still quite a bit of price volatility in the raw materials so it's a little too soon to determine the impact. 
As we work to drive the top line, our focus on significantly improving our expense structure and commitment to operational effectiveness was also very clear in the first quarter, and it will only accelerate. A key element to this is tight inventory control, which we were able to execute during -- with the strength of the systems that underlie our business. 
We ended the quarter with total inventory of 6%. However, only 3.5% as customer pacing at this time. Remaining inventories are underwater, mostly consist of Liz Claiborne product and basics is not comparable. We feel very comfortable with our inventory levels as this will allow us to support our growth initiatives as well as improve inventory turn. 
Now turning to how we plan to accelerate operational effectiveness. As mentioned in our press release, we are currently in the second year of executing our 2010-2014 Long Range Plan for growth. And with that, we see opportunity to continue to grow sales by improving sales productivity in our stores and in on jcp.com. To the continued success of our growth initiatives and exclusive attractions like Liz Claiborne, Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring. We're also increasing profitability at an accelerated rate by optimizing our expense structure. 
So with these, we are implementing across the company initiatives that will maximize our operational effectiveness. We began this process about 18 months ago with initiatives like jTime for staffing models in our stores, Door to Floor, the discontinuation of our Catalog and Outlet businesses and moving to enterprise-wide inventory, tools like markdown optimization, RFID, implementation of our new digital platform and many, many more. 
The initial steps we can take include reducing our SG&A expense. This is to replan to reduce our SG&A expense an additional of $50 million, a portion of which is already been realized in the first quarter, and we expect much more to come as we continue to re-engineer our business in order to maximize our growth opportunities in the next couple of years. We'll inform you more about these actions, which include reducing our gross marketing expenses, streamlining our operations and carrying out further process improvements in our stores and home office when we announce the second quarter results. There is great potential ahead on these fronts. 
Additionally, we started the restructuring of our supply-chain operations, which we can do base on now having an enterprise-wide visibility and availability of inventory, and these 2 will deliver significant annualized cost savings coming on top of those already announced to you in January, with the wind down of our Catalog business and operation related to that. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue to provide the numbers around our business during the quarter."
295624,131610822,129254,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 16, 2011",2011-05-16,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk about our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. We're feeling confident in our long-te",1054,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk about our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. 
We're feeling confident in our long-term strategies and our execution is better than ever before as the combination of our top line growth initiatives, expense-minded culture and operational initiatives are beginning to deliver measurable results. We told you back in February that the first quarter of 2011 will be our smallest in terms of EPS growth. And while we exceeded our initial guidance and delivered solid results, I'm looking forward to outlining our expectation for the second quarter and beyond. 
The key takeaways for the first quarter were that we reported $0.28 in EPS exceeding our guidance, merchandising initiatives continue to deliver sales growth, our gross margins were in line with expectations, we effectively managed expenses and launched a number of cost-saving restructuring initiatives, we completed our $900 million share buyback program in May and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
Now let's start with our top line. Driven by the continued success of our growth initiatives, the company's comparable store sales grew 3.8%, an increase for the fifth consecutive quarter and right at the midpoint of our guidance. Total sales for the quarter increased to $3.94 billion. As a percent of sales, gross margins came in line with expectations, decreasing approximately 90 basis points to 40.5% of sales. 
It's worth noting that gross margins generated for merchandise sales in our stores were ahead of plan as our growth initiatives delivered profitable sales as expected. But just as we told you, however, overall gross margins in the first quarter were negatively impacted because we cycled against the profitable tail of our last Big Book that was still active in the first quarter of 2010. 
We also had free shipping promotions on jcp.com that negatively impacted margins year-over-year. I would like to reiterate that our growth initiatives are not only driving top line growth but are also generating healthy gross profit, which will be more apparent going forward. 
SG&A for the quarter was better than expected at $1.28 billion or 32.5% of sales. Lower SG&A was primarily driven by our marketing optimization and home office expense-savings initiatives, which offset moderate expense increases related to the expansions of Sephora inside jcpenney, as well as start-up costs associated with our Growth Brands Division. 
As Mike said in his remarks, our expense savings initiatives are expected to reduce our SG&A run rate by over $50 million this year. A portion of this savings was realized in the first quarter with significantly more savings expected over the balance of this year and the next several years. 
Turning back to first quarter results. We reported lower-than-expected interest expense of $58 million in the first quarter. Contrary to our prior expectations, we do not write off the $9 million capitalized costs related to the $750 million bank line of credit. Given that the facility was increased and all the banks in the old facility are in the new facility, the accounting rules require that we continue amortizing these fees over the 5-year term of the new facility. 
To cover a few balance sheet items, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash in short-term investments. And earlier this month, we completed our $900 million share repurchase program. Since March, we repurchased 24.4 million shares at an average price of $36.96. We estimate that the shares repurchased in the first quarter added about $0.01 to the first quarter earnings per share. Our fully completed repurchase will have accumulative impact of an estimated $0.02 per share in the second quarter and approximately $0.20 for the full year 2011. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $117 million, in line with expectations. And we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. As Mike already told you, we are working hard on effectively redesigning our cost structure in order to create a more nimble and profitable organization. To that effect and in addition to significantly reducing and streamlining our SG&A expenses, we are completing the wind down of our catalog and outlet operations, which was announced in January, will deliver additional annualized savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million starting in 2012. Also we expect the restructuring of our supply-chain operations will benefit our operating income by about $25 million to $30 million in 2013, with approximately 1/2 of that benefit being achieved in 2012. 
Starting with the $3 million in the first quarter, we will incur charges for accelerated depreciation associated with the facilities we are planning to close, lease termination costs, as well as severance and outplacing services provided to the few hundred associates impacted by the restructuring. Remaining charges are currently estimated as follows: $12 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the second half of 2011 and $15 million over the course of 2012. 
Now let me share with you a few other planning assumptions for the second quarter. We anticipate 3% to 4% growth in comp store sales. The gross margin rate is expected to be relatively flat to slightly up in the second quarter. We are expecting SG&A to leverage and decrease as a percent of sales, even though we're anticipating a slight increase on our SG&A expenses largely due to expenses related to the start up of the Growth Brands Division. 
Real Estate and others is expected to reflect a net expense of $16 million, which includes $21 million of restructuring charges along through that line item. Taking these parameters into account to the second quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24 per share. To assist you with your modeling, our restructuring and non-comparable items are referred to on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. 
For the full year, the company expects 2011 earnings to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share including the impact of our share repurchase program as well as the restructuring charges. 
In summary, we are off to a great start this year and we are pleased with the progress that we've made and the potential in front of us. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

I think that free shipping is a matter of learning what is the best way to manage the top line versus the expense of shipping offers. I think as we transition the merchandise online to be our store assortments, that will allow us to get better margins. A lot of our inventory online was conservative and traditional merchandise for the catalog shopper and it's taken us a while to learn exactly how much we're going to be able to liquidate that portion of the demand and replace it with people do shopping at our stores. So it actually progressed quite well in terms of margins throughout the quarter. So we're feeling a good place going forward.

It's not necessary to support the business the way we're running it going forward. It also, we are able to liquidate some of our .com clearance back to the stores as opposed to our outlet stores. So it's a sense of taking a fresh look at what also our strategy going forward. For example, right now, we could support -- we would have to support .com with shoes in all 3 new warehouses or at the re-purposed facilities. And going forward, we now have the systems capability to put all of the category in 1 warehouse or in 2 warehouses instead of 3. So that now will have the effect of being more in-stock in a single place to take care of customers but also increase our turn by carrying an average of less inventory overall."

So jTime, which matched our staffing to their customer traffic patterns like time segment, actually, reduced costs substantially across the biggest single expense we have which is store selling, that our customer service core has actually went up as a result. Another example is Door to Floor, which was to how to get the goods onto the selling floor faster and less in the stock room and actually get better visibility while it's coming to the store. So looking at a number of areas like that or we believe we'll have the opportunity to improve our performance, at the same time, have lower SG&A. Probably the single biggest opportunities in marketing, as I mentioned, we think that we'll get a chunk of that this year, but we'll actually start to accelerate that improvement as we go forward. We have an ongoing lean process going on to the home office to look at ways to better run our business. So it's across the number of categories, no single category would be as big as the marketing category. And our stores selling, as I've said, has been dramatically improved by jTime, but we'll take another look at are there better ways to organize the way we stuff our stores going forward."

So it gets a little complicated but essentially, a good portion of our Catalog business was from older customers buying conservative and traditional merchandise that shows instead of calling in their orders to the call center or sending a written form and chose to enter their order online, that has been reflected in the past in our .com business. It was also reflected in our direct inventory in the warehouse. As we've transitioned the inventory facing the customer to the same inventory that's in the stores by the best amount, there are some specialized businesses online like real goods for children's, cribs and so forth. The vast majority is the same inventory now that's in our stores. So we are up against some non-comparability in the first quarter of inventory levels that essentially had more of a catalog-feel to them than they made in stores.

We did not change the comp for the 5-year period. So all we're doing is calling out the fact that a year later, we're smarter as to what the current environment is for our new store growth. We have an appetite for new stores when they meet our hurdle rate and when they have sufficient Penney's customers in the market.

Out of those new communities there and where all the new housing was being developed in '06, '07, and early '08, those communities were not of houses in those communities today and we've taken a look at other formats. But at this point, we think the prudent thing to do is to streamline our cost structure so we're going to see the same bottom line without having to reach into less profitable opportunities on the CapEx side. So you're quite correct that we don't have a CapEx budget for 2014 at this point except to say by half building 2 of our large new stores, we'll have more resources to allocate to other ways of growing the business."

We have a great deal to cover so I'll keep our remarks brief and allow time for your questions. 
Overall, there are few main points I'd like to make. First, our ability to deliver on our first quarter objectives, in fact, come out a little bit ahead, reflects the progress we're making in transforming our company from a traditional department store to a retail industry leader. Second, our growth initiatives are performing very well and allowing us to drive the top line in our stores and on jcp.com. 
We're continuing to build on the accomplishments we set in motion over 18 months ago, which are focused on 4 key areas. First, we're continuing to assert our style authority by delivering great style of credibility for the balance of the best private and national brands. Second, we're delivering memorable customer interactions with the highly engaged associates, who inspire discovery and build loyalty with our customers. Third, through impactful digital experiences that are personalized and tactful. And fourth, by focusing on driving profitable growth through operational effectiveness. 
Based on actions we've taken to improve in-store execution, customer service and implement technology that streamline our processes like jTime and Door to Floor, as well as get out of businesses that are no longer delivering for us, we now have the foundation in place to accelerate a series of initiatives that will maximize operational effectiveness and profitability. Executing on these, which we started in the first quarter, is allowing us to achieve significant cost savings, which will grow in magnitude over the next several years in order to allow us to achieve our 5-year earnings target of $5 per share by 2014. 
So with that, let me give you some highlights of our first quarter. We continue to make significant strides in our style transformation with the opening of 23 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 292 MNG by Mango locations, and 100 Call it Spring shops, which in their initial days are seeing the same level of sales productivity per square foot as our Sephora shops. These are among the key growth initiatives of J. C. Penney. that are designed to make our stores and online business more exciting and drive our top line growth. We’re definitely achieving this in our women’s business which is a clear area of strength for us this past quarter and outperformed the industry. In fact this business delivered its highest ever per-square- foot sales performance as well as gross profit performance. We’ve seen a strong response to Liz Claiborne which continues to exceed our expectations and very importantly is bringing new shoppers to J. C. Penney. This is a market share we are taking away from others. Several of our private brands including Worthington and one of our billion-dollar private brands, St. Johns Bay are also delivering great performances. Additionally, the steps we’ve taken to drive the productivity of our center core businesses has been very successful. Our center core businesses includes fashion accessories, fashion jewelry, hosiery, handbags, footwear, fine jewelry including Modern Bride, and sunglasses, and is anchored by Sephora inside jcpenney. We see substantial upside to increasing our focus on these businesses to continue increasing the sales per square foot in our stores, as well as further reinforcing J. C. Penney as a style destination. 
At the same time, men's continues to drive -- deliver strong results. Building on the momentum we've seen since last Father's Day, as our customers are responding well to our new updated, modern merchandising offerings led by Claiborne and J. Ferrar. 
Children's is also a standout business. As moms love the styles and prices we offer on brands such as Carter's and our own billion-dollar brand, Arizona. 
And in home, despite the ongoing softness in the housing market, which continues to impact our furniture business, we are seeing very good performance in our soft home businesses. As we continue to make our stores more exciting and fun to shop, we remain as dedicated as ever to superior customer service. In addition to great associates, we will also this year put our leading-edge technology to work with our new markdown and size-optimization tools and the introduction of RFID across the number of stores, which will help us stay in stock on these key high SKU merchandise categories that our customers are shopping in our stores. 
I also want to quickly mention our new Growth Brands Division. A few weeks ago, we have soft-opened the first 10 Foundry Big & Tall Supply Co. stores, our first businesses under this new division. The Foundry website launched in April. And at the beginning of May, we opened 6 stores in Dallas-Fort Worth area and 4 stores in Kansas City. They carry a broad range of higher-end great brands and offer a unique shopping experience designed for just the big & tall customer. The initial response has been terrific. 
Our other 2 Growth Brands businesses that will launch in the coming months, CLAD in August and Gifting Grace in September. These digital businesses will allow us to make use of the tremendous merchandising expertise we have at our company and to pursue a significant long-term revenue streams. We are also proud to be partnering with the Hearst Corporation on these 2 new ventures. 
During the quarter, customers discovered the great style and price of our private brands typically offered at good and better price points. This resulted in AUR being down just 1% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. At the same time, transactions were up 10% as our compelling offer to have more customers with J. C. Penney. 
The areas of sales through Internet seeing in our stores are being mirrored online at jcp.com up 6.6% of the quarter, with the strongest performances coming from men's and children's apparel and women's accessories. jcp.com's profitability was impacted by free shipping offers, which impacted the site’s conversion rate in sales. All that aside, the Internet business is gaining momentum and we're confident in our ability to deliver an incremental $1 billion of sales by 2014. 
I should mention our sourcing relationships continue to allow us to purchase and manufacture inventory as price-effectively as possible. While protecting our margins, we were able to offer customers many pricing options. National brands as they now entrusted better and best price points, as well as our well-known private brands that offer tremendous style and quality at our good and better price points. We have not found any price adversity from our customers to these merchandise areas as we've raised prices. 
We feel very good about our ability to maintain our smart pricing strategy in the back half of this year. Accordingly, we planned down our units [ph] only 3% to 4% for the season. For 2012, there's still quite a bit of price volatility in the raw materials so it's a little too soon to determine the impact. 
As we work to drive the top line, our focus on significantly improving our expense structure and commitment to operational effectiveness was also very clear in the first quarter, and it will only accelerate. A key element to this is tight inventory control, which we were able to execute during -- with essential systems that underlie our business. 
We ended the quarter with total inventory up 6%. However, only 3.5% is customer pacing at this time. Remaining inventories are underwater [ph], mostly consisting of Liz Claiborne product and basics is not comparable. We feel very comfortable with our inventory levels as this will allow us to support our growth initiatives as well as improve inventory turn. 
Now turning to how we plan to accelerate operational effectiveness. As mentioned in our press release, we are currently in the second year of executing our 2010-2014 Long Range Plan for growth. And with that, we see opportunity to continue to grow sales by improving sales productivity in our stores and on jcp.com through the continued success of our growth initiatives and exclusive attractions like Liz Claiborne, Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring, while also increasing profitability at an accelerated rate by optimizing our expense structure. 
So with this, we are implementing across the company initiatives that will maximize our operational effectiveness. We began this process about 18 months ago with initiatives like jTime for staffing models in our stores, Door to Floor, the discontinuation of our Catalog and Outlet businesses and moving to enterprise-wide inventory, tools like markdown optimization, RFID, implementation of our new digital platform and many, many more. 
The initial steps we can take include reducing our SG&A expense. This is to re-plan to reduce our SG&A expense an additional of $50 million, a portion of which is already been realized in the first quarter, and we expect much more to come as we continue to re-engineer our business in order to maximize our growth opportunities in the next couple of years. We'll inform you more about these actions, which include reducing our gross marketing expenses, streamlining our operations and carrying out further process improvements in our stores and home office when we announce the second quarter results. There is great potential ahead on these fronts. 
Additionally, we started the restructuring of our supply-chain operations, which we can do based on now having an enterprise-wide visibility and availability of inventory, and these 2 will deliver significant annualized cost savings coming on top of those already announced to you in January, with the wind down of our Catalog business and operations related to that. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue to provide the numbers around our business during the quarter."
295624,131610822,129288,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 16, 2011",2011-05-16,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.

We're feeling confident in our long-te",1055,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk about our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. 
We're feeling confident in our long-term strategies and our execution is better than ever before as the combination of our top line growth initiatives, expense-minded culture and operational initiatives are beginning to deliver measurable results. We told you back in February that the first quarter of 2011 will be our smallest in terms of EPS growth. And while we exceeded our initial guidance and delivered solid results, I'm looking forward to outlining our expectation for the second quarter and beyond. 
The key takeaways for the first quarter were that we reported $0.28 in EPS exceeding our guidance, merchandising initiatives continue to deliver sales growth, our gross margins were in line with expectations, we effectively managed expenses and launched a number of cost-saving restructuring initiatives, we completed a $900 million share buyback program in May and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
Now let's start with our top line. Driven by the continued success of our growth initiatives, the company's comparable store sales grew 3.8%, an increase for the fifth consecutive quarter and right at the midpoint of our guidance. Total sales for the quarter increased to $3.94 billion. As a percent of sales, gross margins came in line with expectations, decreasing approximately 90 basis points to 40.5% of sales. 
It's worth noting that gross margins generated for merchandise sales in our stores were ahead of plan as our growth initiatives delivered profitable sales as expected. But just as we told you, however, overall gross margins in the first quarter were negatively impacted because we cycled against the profitable tail of our last Big Book that was still active in the first quarter of 2010. 
We also had free shipping promotions on jcp.com that negatively impacted margins year-over-year. I would like to reiterate that our growth initiatives are not only driving top line growth but are also generating healthy gross profit, which will be more apparent going forward. 
SG&A for the quarter was better than expected at $1.28 billion or 32.5% of sales. Lower SG&A was primarily driven by our marketing optimization and home office expense-savings initiatives, which offset moderate expense increases related to the expansions of Sephora inside jcpenney, as well as start-up costs associated with our Growth Brands Division. 
As Mike said in his remarks, our expense savings initiatives are expected to reduce our SG&A run rate by over $50 million this year. A portion of these savings was realized in the first quarter with significantly more savings expected over the balance of this year and the next several years. 
Turning back to first quarter results. We reported lower-than-expected interest expense of $58 million in the first quarter. Contrary to our prior expectations, we do not write off the $9 million of capitalized costs related to the $750 million bank line of credit. Given that the facility was increased and all the banks in the old facility are in the new facility, the accounting rules require that we continue amortizing these fees over the 5-year term of the new facility. 
To cover a few balance sheet items, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. And earlier this month, we completed our $900 million share repurchase program. Since March, we repurchased 24.4 million shares at an average price of $36.96. We estimate that the shares repurchased in the first quarter added about $0.01 to the first quarter earnings per share. Our fully completed repurchase will have accumulative impact of an estimated $0.02 per share in the second quarter and approximately $0.20 for the full year 2011. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $117 million, in line with expectations. And we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. As Mike already told you, we are working hard on effectively redesigning our cost structure in order to create a more nimble and profitable organization. To that effect and in addition to significantly reducing and streamlining our SG&A expenses, we are completing the wind down of our catalog and outlet operations, which was announced in January, will deliver additional annualized savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million starting in 2012. Also, we expect the restructuring of our supply-chain operations will benefit our operating income by about $25 million to $30 million in 2013, with approximately 1/2 of that benefit being achieved in 2012. 
Starting with the $3 million in the first quarter, we will incur charges for accelerated depreciation associated with the facilities we are planning to close, lease termination costs, as well as severance and outplacement services provided to the few hundred associates impacted by the restructuring. Remaining charges are currently estimated as follows: $12 million in the second quarter; $20 million in the second half of 2011; and $15 million over the course of 2012. 
Now let me share with you a few other planning assumptions for the second quarter. We anticipate 3% to 4% growth in comp store sales. The gross margin rate is expected to be relatively flat to slightly up in the second quarter. We are expecting SG&A to leverage and decrease as a percent of sales, even though we're anticipating a slight increase on our SG&A expenses largely due to expenses related to the start up of the Growth Brands Division. 
Real Estate and others is expected to reflect a net expense of $16 million, which includes $21 million of restructuring charges going through that line item. Taking these parameters into account to the second quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24 per share. To assist you with your modeling, our restructuring and non-comparable items are referred to on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. 
For the full year, the company expects 2011 earnings to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share including the impact of our share repurchase program as well as the restructuring charges. 
In summary, we are off to a great start this year and we are pleased with the progress that we've made and the potential in front of us. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

The last Big Book actually was quite profitable from a rate point of view, but we obviously felt that if we continue, it was not going to be profitable so that is a one-time situation. I think that free shipping is a matter of learning what is the best way to manage the top line versus the expense of shipping offers. I think as we transition the merchandise online to be our store assortments, that will allow us to get better margins. A lot of our inventory online was conservative and traditional merchandise for the catalog shopper and it's taken us a while to learn exactly how much we're going to be able to liquidate that portion of the demand and replace it with people who shop at our stores. So it actually progressed quite well in terms of margins throughout the quarter. So we're in a good place going forward.

So it's a sense of taking a fresh look at what is our store [ph] strategy going forward.

And going forward, we now have the systems capability to put all of the category in 1 warehouse or in 2 warehouses instead of 3.

So jTime, which matched our staffing to their customer traffic patterns like time segment, actually, reduced costs substantially across the biggest single expense we have which is store selling, that our customer service core has actually went up as a result. Another example is Door to Floor, which was to how to get the goods onto the selling floor faster and less in the stock room and actually get better visibility while it's coming to the store. So looking at a number of areas like that where we believe we'll have the opportunity to improve our performance, at the same time, have lower SG&A. Probably the single biggest opportunity is in marketing, as I mentioned, we think that we'll get a chunk of that this year, but we'll actually start to accelerate that improvement as we go forward. We have an ongoing lean process going on to the home office to look at ways to better run our business. So it's across the number of categories, no single category would be as big as the marketing category. And our stores selling, as I've said, has been dramatically improved by jTime, but we'll take another look at are there better ways to organize the way we staff our stores going forward."

I will say that since we're very strongly anchored in the best regional malls in the country, one can certainly argue at that regional malls that exist will get stronger because there won't be a larger regional malls built.

It was also reflected in our direct inventory in the warehouse. As we've transitioned the inventory facing the customer to the same inventory that's in the stores by the best amount, there are some specialized businesses online like real goods for children's, cribs and so forth. The vast majority is the same inventory now that's in our stores. So we are up against some non-comparability in the first quarter of inventory levels that essentially had more of a catalog-feel to them than they did stores.

And in the meantime, we're going to re-invest a lot of our CapEx into merchandise improvements in our stores attractions and renovations, and it will take a while for the Growth Brands group to start to build the kind of sales momentum to be the size of 70 new large stores would be."

Those new communities there and where all the new housing was being developed in '06, '07, and early '08, those communities are not building houses in those communities today and we've taken a look at other formats. But at this point, we think the prudent thing to do is to streamline our cost structure so we can achieve the same bottom line without having to reach into less profitable opportunities on the CapEx side. So you're quite correct that we don't have a CapEx budget for 2014 at this point except to say by have -- building fewer large new stores, we'll have more resources to allocate to other ways of growing the business."

We have a great deal to cover so I'll keep our remarks brief and allow time for your questions. 
Overall, there are a few main points I'd like to make. First, our ability to deliver on our first quarter objectives, in fact, come out a little bit ahead, reflects the progress we're making in transforming our company from a traditional department store to a retail industry leader. Second, our growth initiatives are performing very well and allowing us to drive the top line in our stores and on jcp.com. 
We're continuing to build on the accomplishments we set in motion over 18 months ago, which are focused on 4 key areas: First, we're continuing to assert our style authority by delivering great style of credibility for the balance of the best private and national brands; second, we're delivering memorable customer interactions with the highly engaged associates, who inspire discovery and build loyalty with our customers; third, through impactful digital experiences that are personalized and impactful; and fourth, by focusing on driving profitable growth through operational effectiveness. 
Based on actions we've taken to improve in-store execution, customer service and implement technology that streamline our processes like jTime and Door to Floor, as well as get out of businesses that are no longer delivering for us, we now have the foundation in place to accelerate a series of initiatives that will maximize operational effectiveness and profitability. Executing on these, which we started in the first quarter, is allowing us to achieve significant cost savings, which will grow in magnitude over the next several years in order to allow us to achieve our 5-year earnings target of $5 a share by 2014. 
So with that, let me give you some highlights of our first quarter. We continue to make significant strides in our style transformation with the opening of 23 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 292 MNG by Mango locations, and 100 Call it Spring shops, which in their initial days are seeing the same level of sales productivity per square foot as our Sephora shops. These are among the key growth initiatives of J. C. Penney. that are designed to make our stores and online business more exciting and drive our top line growth. We’re definitely achieving this in our women’s business which is a clear area of strength for us this past quarter and outperformed the industry. In fact this business delivered its highest ever first quarter store sales performance as well as gross profit performance. We’ve seen a strong response to Liz Claiborne which continues to exceed our expectations and very importantly is bringing new shoppers to J. C. Penney. This is a market share we are taking away from others. Several of our private brands including Worthington and one of our billion-dollar private brands, St. Johns Bay are also delivering great performances. Additionally, the steps we’ve taken to drive the productivity of our center core businesses has been very successful. Our center core businesses include fashion accessories, fashion jewelry, hosiery, handbags, footwear, fine jewelry including Modern Bride, and sunglasses, and is anchored by Sephora inside jcpenney. We see substantial upside to increasing our focus on these businesses to continue increasing the sales per square foot in our stores, as well as further reinforcing J. C. Penney as a style destination. 
At the same time, men's continues to drive -- deliver strong results. Building on the momentum we've seen since last Father's Day, as our customers are responding well to our new updated, modern merchandising offerings led by Claiborne and J. Ferrar. 
Children's is also a standout business. As moms love the styles and prices we offer on brands such as Carter's and our own billion-dollar brand, Arizona. 
And in home, despite the ongoing softness in the housing market, which continues to impact our furniture business, we are seeing very good performance in our soft home businesses. As we continue to make our stores more exciting and fun to shop, we remain as dedicated as ever to superior customer service. In addition to great associates, we will also this year put our leading-edge technology to work with our new markdown and size-optimization tools and the introduction of RFID across a number of stores, which will help us stay in stock on these key high SKU merchandise categories that our customers are shopping in our stores. 
I also want to quickly mention our new Growth Brands Division. A few weeks ago, we soft-opened the first 10 Foundry Big & Tall Supply Co. stores, our first businesses under this new division. The Foundry website launched in April. And at the beginning of May, we opened 6 stores in Dallas-Fort Worth area and 4 stores in Kansas City. They carry a broad range of higher-end great brands and offer a unique shopping experience designed for just the big & tall customer. The initial response has been terrific. 
Our other 2 Growth Brands businesses will launch in the coming months, CLAD in August and Gifting Grace in September. These digital businesses will allow us to make use of the tremendous merchandising expertise we have at our company and to pursue significant long-term revenue streams. We are also proud to be partnering with the Hearst Corporation on these 2 new ventures. 
During the quarter, customers discovered the great style and price of our private brands typically offered at our good and better price points. This resulted in AUR being down just 1% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. At the same time, transactions were up 10% as our compelling offer drove more customers to J. C. Penney. 
The areas of success that we're seeing in our stores are being mirrored online at jcp.com, up 6.6% for the quarter, with the strongest performances coming from men's and children's apparel and women's accessories. jcp.com's profitability was impacted by free shipping offers, which impacted the site’s conversion rate in sales. All that aside, our Internet business is gaining momentum and we're confident in our ability to deliver an incremental $1 billion of sales by 2014. 
I should mention our sourcing relationships continue to allow us to purchase and manufacture inventory as price-effectively as possible. While protecting our margins, we were able to offer customers many pricing options; national brands that they know and trust at better and best price points, as well as our well-known private brands that offer tremendous style and quality at our good and better price points. We have not found any price adversity from our customers to these merchandise areas as we've raised prices. 
We feel very good about our ability to maintain our smart pricing strategy in the back half of this year. Accordingly, we planned down our units only 3% to 4% for the season. For 2012, there's still quite a bit of price volatility in the raw materials so it's a little too soon to determine the impact. 
As we work to drive the top line, our focus on significantly improving our expense structure and commitment to operational effectiveness was also very clear in the first quarter, and it will only accelerate. A key element to this is tight inventory control, which we were able to execute during -- with essential systems that underlie our business. 
We ended the quarter with total inventory up 6%. However, only 3.5% of it is customer pacing at this time. The remaining inventory is on the water, mostly consisting of Liz Claiborne product and basics, that is not comparable. We feel very comfortable with our inventory levels as this will allow us to support our growth initiatives as well as improve inventory turn. 
Now turning to how we plan to accelerate our operational effectiveness. As mentioned in our press release, we are currently in the second year of executing our 2010-2014 Long Range Plan for growth. And with that, we see opportunity to continue to grow sales by improving sales productivity in our stores and on jcp.com through the continued success of our growth initiatives and exclusive attractions like Liz Claiborne, Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring, while also increasing profitability at an accelerated rate by optimizing our expense structure. 
So with this, we are implementing across the company initiatives that will maximize our operational effectiveness. We began this process about 18 months ago with initiatives like jTime for staffing models in our stores, Door to Floor, the discontinuation of our Catalog and Outlet businesses and moving to enterprise-wide inventory, tools like markdown optimization, RFID, implementation of our new digital platform and many, many more. 
The initial steps we'll take include reducing our SG&A expense. This year we plan to reduce our SG&A expense an additional $50 million, a portion of which has already been realized in the first quarter, and we expect much more to come as we continue to re-engineer our business in order to maximize our growth opportunities in the next several years. We'll inform you more about these actions, which include reducing our gross marketing expenses, streamlining our operations and carrying out further process improvements in our stores and home office when we announce the second quarter results. There is great potential ahead on these fronts. 
Additionally, we started the restructuring of our supply-chain operations, which we can do based on now having an enterprise-wide visibility and availability of inventory, and this, too, will deliver significant annualized cost savings coming on top of those already announced to you in January, with the wind down of our Catalog business and operations related to that. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue to provide the numbers around our business during the quarter."
295624,131610822,140197,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 16, 2011",2011-05-16,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk about our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. We're feeling confident in our long-te",1055,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will summarize the key components of our performance in the quarter and then talk about our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. 
We're feeling confident in our long-term strategies and our execution is better than ever before as the combination of our top line growth initiatives, expense-minded culture and operational initiatives are beginning to deliver measurable results. We told you back in February that the first quarter of 2011 will be our smallest in terms of EPS growth. And while we exceeded our initial guidance and delivered solid results, I'm looking forward to outlining our expectation for the second quarter and beyond. 
The key takeaways for the first quarter were that we reported $0.28 in EPS exceeding our guidance, merchandising initiatives continued to deliver sales growth, our gross margins were in line with expectations, we effectively managed expenses and launched a number of cost-saving restructuring initiatives, we completed a $900 million share buyback program in May and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
Now let's start with our top line. Driven by the continued success of our growth initiatives, the company's comparable store sales grew 3.8%, an increase for the fifth consecutive quarter and right in the midpoint of our guidance. Total sales for the quarter increased to $3.94 billion. As a percent of sales, gross margins came in line with expectations, decreasing approximately 90 basis points to 40.5% of sales. 
It's worth noting that gross margins generated for merchandise sales in our stores were ahead of plan as our growth initiatives delivered profitable sales as expected. But just as we told you, however, overall gross margins in the first quarter were negatively impacted because we cycled against the profitable tail of our last Big Book that was still active in the first quarter of 2010. 
We also had free shipping promotions on jcp.com that negatively impacted margins year-over-year. I would like to reiterate that our growth initiatives are not only driving top line growth but are also generating healthy gross profit, which will be more apparent going forward. 
SG&A for the quarter was better than expected at $1.28 billion or 32.5% of sales. Lower SG&A was primarily driven by our marketing optimization and home office expense-savings initiatives, which offset moderate expense increases related to the expansion of Sephora inside jcpenney, as well as start-up costs associated with our Growth Brands Division. 
As Mike said in his remarks, our expense savings initiatives are expected to reduce our SG&A run rate by over $50 million this year. A portion of these savings was realized in the first quarter with significantly more savings expected over the balance of this year and the next several years. 
Turning back to first quarter results. We reported lower-than-expected interest expense of $58 million in the first quarter. Contrary to our prior expectations, we did not write off the $9 million of capitalized costs related to the $750 million bank line of credit. Given that the facility was increased and all the banks in the old facility are in the new facility, the accounting rules require that we continue amortizing these fees over the 5-year term of the new facility. 
To cover a few balance sheet items, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. And earlier this month, we completed our $900 million share repurchase program. Since March, we repurchased 24.4 million shares at an average price of $36.96. We estimate that the shares repurchased in the first quarter added about $0.01 to the first quarter earnings per share. Our fully completed repurchase will have a cumulative impact of an estimated $0.02 per share in the second quarter and approximately $0.20 for the full year 2011. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $117 million, in line with expectations. And we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. As Mike already told you, we are working hard on effectively redesigning our cost structure in order to create a more nimble and profitable organization. To that effect and in addition to significantly reducing and streamlining our SG&A expenses, we are completing the wind down of our catalog and outlet operations, which as announced in January, will deliver additional annualized savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million starting in 2012. Also, we expect the restructuring of our supply-chain operations will benefit our operating income by about $25 million to $30 million in 2013, with approximately half of that benefit being achieved in 2012. 
Starting with the $3 million in the first quarter, we will incur charges for accelerated depreciation associated with the facilities we are planning to close, lease termination cost, as well as severance and outplacement services provided to the few hundred associates impacted by the restructuring. Remaining charges are currently estimated as follows: $12 million in the second quarter; $20 million in the second half of 2011; and $15 million over the course of 2012. 
Now let me share with you a few other planning assumptions for the second quarter. We anticipate 3% to 4% growth in comp store sales. The gross margin rate is expected to be relatively flat to slightly up in the second quarter. We are expecting SG&A to leverage and decrease as a percent of sales, even though we're anticipating a slight increase in our SG&A expenses largely due to expenses related to the startup of the Growth Brands Division. 
Real Estate and Other is expected to reflect a net expense of $16 million, which includes $21 million of restructuring charges going through that line item. Taking these parameters into account for the second quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24 per share. To assist you with your modeling, our restructuring and non-comparable items are referred to on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. 
For the full year, the company expects 2011 earnings to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share including the impact of our share repurchase program as well as the restructuring charges. 
In summary, we are off to a great start this year and we are pleased with the progress that we've made and the potential in front of us. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

I think that free shipping is a matter of learning what is the best way to manage the top line versus the expense of shipping offers. I think that as we transition the merchandise online to be our store assortments, that will allow us to get better margins. A lot of our inventory online was conservative and traditional merchandise for the catalog shopper and it's taken us a while to learn exactly how much we're going to be able to liquidate that portion of the demand and replace it with people that are shopping at our stores. So it actually progressed quite well in terms of margins throughout the quarter. So we feel we're in a good place going forward.

So we literally had 4 complete warehouses that were mirrored in terms of the number of SKUs and the assortments to support those 2 businesses. As we've gone now to a jcp.com/stores inventory alignment, we've been able to re-purpose one of the distribution centers to be no longer as focused on the Direct business so we went down to 3, and we think that will help our inventory turns. It's not necessary to support the business the way we're running it going forward. It also, we are able to liquidate some of our .com clearance back through the stores as opposed to our outlet stores. So it's a sense of taking a fresh look at what is our strategy going forward. For example, right now, we could support -- we would have to support .com with shoes in all 3 new warehouses or at the re-purposed facilities. And going forward, we now have the systems capability to put all of a category in 1 warehouse or in 2 warehouses instead of 3. So that now will have the effect of being more in-stock in a single place to take care of customers but also increase our turn by carrying an average of less inventory overall."

So jTime, which matched our staffing to their customer traffic patterns by time segment, actually reduced costs substantially across the biggest single expense we have which is store selling, that our customer service scores actually went up as a result. Another example is Door to Floor, which was to how to get the goods onto the selling floor faster and less in the stock room and actually get better visibility of what was coming to the store. So we're looking at a number of areas like that where we believe we'll have the opportunity to improve our performance, at the same time, have lower SG&A. Probably the single biggest opportunity is in marketing, as I mentioned. We think that we'll get a chunk of that this year, but we'll actually start to accelerate that improvement as we go forward. We have an ongoing lean process going on at the home office to look at ways to better run our business. So it's across the number of categories, no single category would be as big as the marketing category. And our store selling, as I said, has been dramatically improved by jTime, but we'll take another look at are there better ways to organize the way we staff our stores going forward."

But I think it's anybody's guess how quickly the commercial real estate business will return. I will say that since we're very strongly anchored in the best regional malls in the country, one can certainly argue that the regional malls that exist will get stronger because there won't be a lot of new regional malls built.

So it gets a little complicated but essentially, a good portion of our Catalog business was from older customers buying conservative and traditional merchandise that chose, instead of calling in their orders to the call center or sending in a written form, had chosen to enter their order online. That has been reflected in the past in our .com business. It was also reflected in our direct inventory in the warehouse. As we've transitioned the inventory facing the customer to be the same inventory that's in the stores by a vast amount, there are some specialized businesses online like wheeled goods for children's, cribs and so forth. The vast majority is the same inventory now that's in our stores. So we are up against some non-comparability in the first quarter of inventory levels that essentially had more of a catalog-feel to them than they did stores.

I think the area that's been most difficult has been Apparel because it was the one that was the most distorted by the conservative traditional inventory transition. We're now starting to see double-digit increases across all Apparel categories since Apparel is the biggest piece of our business in the stores, and we have about 27 million people that shop in our stores that were not yet shopping online with us because the inventory didn't match what they saw in the stores. We feel confident that we will be back on a growth trajectory. So we've gone through a massive transformation of what .com was when it was with essentially a different customer base.

As we've transitioned a good piece of our marketing into digital marketing obviously, we sorted exactly how we're using media. So I'd say the biggest single transition has been from preprint, their insert into newspapers, although still a large part of our program, the biggest single increase has been in digital media. In terms of the changes in cadence from month-to-month, we wouldn't necessarily message that except to say that we're up against the same calendar as a year ago in terms of Father's Day and back-to-school, so I don't see major shifts. I do--  would say that the last week of July last year was a difficult week for us because we were up against a very large non-comparable clearance event, so my guess is we'll have a better July than we did a year ago.

I think as we looked at 70 new large stores in 2014, as I mentioned earlier, our conclusion was given the current commercial real estate market that, that was unlikely.

So the difference would be a lower sales expectation in 2014 but maintaining the bottom line EPS forecast, which obviously improves an increase in the quality of earnings because sales would not be at the level that we had forecasted. We did not change the comp for the 5-year period. So all we're doing is calling out the fact that a year later, we're smarter as to what the current environment is for new store growth. We have an appetite for new stores when they meet our hurdle rate and when they have sufficient Penney's customers in the market.

Those new communities where all the new housing was being developed in '06, '07 and early '08, those communities are not building houses in those communities today and we've taken a look at other formats. But at this point, we think the prudent thing to do is to streamline our cost structure so we can achieve the same bottom line without having to reach into less profitable opportunities on the CapEx side. So you're quite correct that we don't have a CapEx budget for 2014 at this point except to say by building fewer large new stores, we'll have more resources to allocate to other ways of growing the business."

Mike and I are going to keep our comments brief with this morning's so we'll have more time for your questions. Overall, there a few main points I'd like to make. First of all, while the topline system versus were softer than initially planned, we effectively managed expenses, maintain our strong liquidity position and continued to transition our pricing and brands to excite existing customers and attract new customers. Second, our focus on building attractions to becoming a destination, which is where style is taking hold. Our identified growth initiatives, Liz Claiborne, support inside JCPenney, our tops business, modern shoes and handbags, fast fashion, modern bright fine jewelry, housewares and Center Core performing double-digit ahead of last year. With transactions being up 6.4% and our AUR essentially flat during the quarter, we're not trading down on our business, trading down on our quality or trading down our price but rather, we are trading up our attractions. 
We see opportunity growth sales by improving the productivity in our existing stores in jcp.com with the continued success of our growth initiatives and exclusive attractions like Liz Claiborne, Sephora  inside JCPenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by ALDO. 
In the second quarter, we opened 22 Sephora inside jcpenney locations and another 21 had a grand opening today, bringing our total locations to 297. Additionally, in the next few weeks, we'll have a total of 405 Call it Spring locations and 487 MNG by Mango locations, reinforcing JCPenney as a style destination. 
As part of our $650 million 2011 capital expenditures just program, we also completed approximately 500 store upgrades and 30 major renovations during the quarter, including the large renovation in our company's history at the JCPenney Roosevelt Field store in Long Island. Our ongoing renovation program, which is being rolled out across our fleet of stores is a key component of our transformation plan designed to make our stores more exciting and to continue improve our sales per square foot productivity. 
Turning now to our operational effectiveness initiatives. During the quarter, we accelerated the actions we are taking to significantly improve our expense structure. This is part of a multiyear operational effectiveness program that we put in place almost 2 years ago to reengineer our business, which will allow us to achieve our 5-year earnings target by 2014. 
As we stated in our first quarter press release, we expect to realize $50 million expense savings in fiscal 2011. $10 million was realized in the first quarter with $7 million saved in the second quarter. The remaining $33 million in savings were incurred in the back half, primarily in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date we've gotten out of the Catalog business, announced the closure of our clearance outlets, reorganized our supply chain and custom decorating operations, we're ensuring our marketing spend is productive and effective, we're rolling out in new process improvement technology like RFID, mark down and price optimization and we launched the new digital platform. Additionally, we're looking at the design and structure of the entire organization to ensure we have the right people in the right roles to reflect our future growth opportunities. In some situations, primarily to home office, we will staff organizations differently to meet the changing needs of our business. 
Part of the organizational redesign includes a voluntary early retirement program for select associates who will spend at least 20 years in the company are active participants in our pension fund and are 55 years of age or above. This voluntary program is not designed by all participants, enhance retirement benefit in exchange for voluntarily separating from the company. By making these changes, we will great opportunities to improve our processes and do things better, faster and more efficiently. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael, who will provide the numbers relating to our during the second quarter. Michael?"

This morning, we reported $0.07 of earnings per share, in line with our most recent guidance. Starting with our top line. 
Once again, our growth initiatives in sales for our private and exclusive brands drove the business as the company's comparable store sales grew 1.5% in the second quarter. Year-to-date, comp store sales are up 2.7% over last year. 
Total sales for the quarter declined slightly to $3.9 billion, largely reflecting the elimination of our Catalog business last year. Gross margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the softer-than-expected selling environment in May and June, which resulted in more promotional activity and more markdowns in the quarter. Compared to last year's historical peak, gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points to 38.3% of sales. 
SG&A for the quarter came in better than guidance, increasing $32 million year-over-year to $1.24 billion or 31.8% of sales. Lower-than-planned SG&A was primarily driven by effective management of our store labor hours and various home office savings initiatives. These items offset moderate expense increases related to the expansion of Sephora inside jcpenney as well as startup costs associated with our growth plans division. 
Also our effective tax rate, 41.7% was slightly higher than expected, largely due to the changes in certain state tax laws that took effect this year. We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and our free cash flow has improved approximately $90 million year-over-year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $295 million, in line with our expectations and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. We ended the quarter with our inventory of 2.3%, in line with our projected sales trend for the upcoming quarter. 
Now let me share with you our planning assumptions for the third quarter. We expect comp store sales to grow 2% to 3% in the third quarter. On a monthly basis, we expect August sales will be below this range as back-to-school selling season starting later again this year with customers continuing their pattern of shopping closer to need. 
September should be roughly in line with our quarterly guidance while October is expected to be a bit better. The gross margin rate is expected to be down slightly in the third quarter. Reflecting our focus on expense management, we are expecting SG&A to be flat to slightly lower year-over-year even with the additional expenses we expect to incur related to the expansions of Sephora  inside JCPenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring. 
The real estate and other line is expected to reflect that expense of about $11 million with $19 million of restructuring charges flowing through that line item. Taking all of these assumptions into account for the third quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share including previously disclosed charges of approximately $0.05 per share. 
Also as Mike mentioned in our ongoing effort to reduce expenses and streamline operations, we have begun a voluntary early retirement program or so-called burp. Eligible associates will have between September 1 and October 15 to decide if they want to participate in the program. We will release the number of associates who have elected to participate in the program as well as the operational efficiencies resulting from this program later in the year, likely with our third quarter earnings release. Our current Q3 earnings guidance does not include any impact from the burp but we will update you on the earnings impact later in the quarter as appropriate. 
Additionally, we may also incur additional one-time charges in the third quarter arising from the possible sale of the company's clearance outlet stores to a third party but that impact has not been included in our current guidance. As you'll recall earlier this year, we announced the plan to close the 19 outlet stores over the course of this year and next year. However, we are currently in negotiations to sell these outlet stores to a third party which may result in acceleration of some of their previously announced charges and will be incurred in the third quarter. We will keep you updated as appropriate on the impact of this potential sale. 
So the be clear we currently expect Q3 earnings to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share, including the previously disclosed restructuring charges of approximately $0.05. And this guidance does not include the impact of the burp or the sale of the outlets stores. 
As to the full year guidance, because the full year earnings impact resulting from a voluntary early retirement program, the ongoing restructuring initiatives and other home office initiatives including the changes in leadership, it is yet to be determined and because we expect the consumer environment remain uncertain, we believe it's prudent to provide guidance for the fourth quarter and full when with visibility into these matters has improved. As such, we're not providing full-year outlook at this time. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike"

Consumer climate is clearly uncertain and tumultuous in the last 10 days or so hasn't given core customer and middle income family any reason to be more confident. 
Due to our compelling value proposition now more than ever, our ability to offer great style and quality, compelling prices is sustainable, competitive advantage. Encouraging to us is our recent customer scorecard for the second quarter. That a significant improvement in price perception and value to the consumer. We also scored the largest increase in store for me, styles I like, new styles every time I visit and overall update and style for the store. Therefore, we remain cautiously optimistic about the back half of the year, especially as we head into the height of the back-to-school selling season as well as fall holiday. 
For the high penetration of private brands that continue to grow faster than the rest of the store in our high margin businesses. We have the unique ability to offer our customers quality merchandise at very sharp prices while protecting our margins. 
We are continuing to build on the accomplishments we set in motion almost 2 years ago, which were focused on 4 key areas. First, we continue to assert our style authority by delivering great style credibility with the balance of the best private and national brands. Second, we're giving a memorable customer interactions with the help of our highly engaged associates to inspire discovery and build loyalty with our customers. Third, we are increasing our reach through digital experiences that are personalized and impactful. And fourth, we're taking a significant strips to drive profitable growth with a focus on improving our operational effectiveness. 
Our focus on reengineering our business will allow us to achieve the 2014 earnings target we set out last year and move us closer to our goal of a being a retail estimate leader. 
Before I open up the call for questions, I'd like to give you an update on Ron Johnson. As planned, Ron joined our Board of Directors on August 1. And Ron and I visited stores and we took a trip with me to Asia to a Supplier Summit and individual needs of suppliers. Our time together has been and will continue to be very productive and we're looking forward to getting Ron a full time CEO in November 1. With that, operator, we'll take your questions."

So while we are getting good sell through on fresh merchandise, as a matter of fact, we continue to see very sharp price points being bestsellers, as well as the newness and fashion and Sephora  actually is the highest trending business in store.

Cotton prices are coming down or have come down. So we're a bit more optimistic in the second half of the spring that we'll get back to a more normalized cost structure. We believe that our suppliers have worked very hard with us to optimize what we will buy in terms of what portion of assortment and which price points. And in terms of the visibility to what we have in the back half we feel we have the right goods in route.

I think the MNG by Mango is 77 stores last year. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we have 500 stores by fall. It's getting great registration with the customer. The pricing is very sharp compared to other fast fashion concepts, we're the only department store that has true  fast fashion in the store and is attracting the 18- to 35-year-old customer segment that we're focused on. Call it Spring again, very much modern shoe assortment that's attracting younger demographic. We're way ahead of our expectations there across women's handbags and men's. Our support continues to be double-digit comps and leading brand launch. Our Modern Bride has been a pleasant surprise in terms of our engagement jewelry business, up over 20% comp as we rolled that out. American Living continues to be one of the top 10 brands. It's obviously more classic and traditional than some of the other that are focused more in the other customer. So we feel very good.

I think the good news is our costs of goods is such that we don't have to go up as much as some of our key competitors meet our objectives. So while we plan units down modestly, that means we don't have to put as much and it to meet our overall objectives but time will tell. This is a difficult unprecedented period of time, rising apparel inflation in 20 years so we expect in this environment there'll be a lot of learning for each of our competitors and us."

Michael and I are going to keep our comments brief this morning's, so we'll have more time for your questions. Overall, there a few main points I'd like to make. 
First of all, while the top line sales number were softer than initially planned, we effectively managed expenses, maintained our strong liquidity position and continued to transition our storefront of products and brands to excite existing customers and attract new customers. Second, our focus on building attractions to becoming a destination for discovering great style is taking hold. 
Our identified growth initiatives, Liz Claiborne, Sephora inside jcpenney, our tops business, modern shoes and handbags, fast fashion, Modern Bride fine jewelry, housewares and center core are performing double-digit ahead of last year. With transactions being up 6.4% and our AUR essentially flat during the quarter, we're not trading down our business, trading down our quality or trading down our price but rather, we're trading up our attractions. 
We see opportunity to grow sales by improving the productivity in our existing stores and jcp.com, with the continued success of our growth initiatives and exclusive attractions like Liz Claiborne, Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by ALDO. 
In the second quarter, we opened 22 Sephora inside jcpenney locations and another 21 had a grand opening today, bringing our total locations to 297. Additionally, in the next few weeks, we'll have a total of 405 Call it Spring locations and 487 MNG by Mango locations, reinforcing  jcpenney as a style destination. 
As part of our $650 million 2011 capital expenditures program, we also completed approximately 500 store updates and 20 major renovations during the quarter, including the largest renovation in our company's history at the jcpenney Roosevelt Field store in Long Island. Our ongoing renovation program, which is being rolled out across our fleet of stores is a key component of our transformation plan designed to make our stores more exciting and to continue to improve our sales per square foot productivity. 
Turning now to our operational effectiveness  initiatives. During the quarter, we accelerated the actions we are taking to significantly improve our expense structure. This is part of a multiyear operational effectiveness program that we put in place almost 2 years ago to reengineer our business, which will allow us to achieve our 5-year earnings target by 2014. 
As we stated in our first quarter press release, we expect to realize $50 million expense savings in fiscal 2011. $10 million was realized in the first quarter, with $7 million saved in the second quarter. The remaining $33 million in savings will occur in the back half, primarily in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we've gotten out of the Catalog business, announced the closure of our clearance outlets, reorganized our supply chain and custom decorating operations, we're ensuring our marketing spend is productive, competitive and effective, we're rolling out a new process improvement technologies like RFID, mark down and price optimization and we launched the new digital platform. Additionally, we're looking at the design and structure of our entire organization to ensure we have the right people in the right roles to reflect our future growth opportunities. In some situations, primarily at the home office, we will staff organizations differently to meet the changing needs of our business. 
Part of the organizational redesign includes a voluntary early retirement program for select associates, who have spent at least 20 years in the company, are active participants in our pension fund and are 55 years of age or above. This voluntary program is designed to provide eligible participants enhance retirement benefit in exchange for voluntarily separating from the company. By making these change, we will create opportunities to improve our processes and do things better, faster and more efficiently. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Michael, who will provide the numbers related to our business during the second quarter. Michael?"

This morning, we reported $0.07 in earnings per share, in line with our most recent guidance. Starting with our top line. 
Once again, our growth initiatives and sales of our private and exclusive brands drove the business as the company's comparable store sales grew 1.5% in the second quarter. Year-to-date, comp store sales are up 2.7% over last year. 
Total sales for the quarter declined slightly to $3.9 billion, largely reflecting the elimination of our Catalog business last year. Gross margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the softer-than-expected selling environment in May and June, which resulted in more promotional activity and more markdowns in the quarter. Compared to last year's historical peak, gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points to 38.3% of sales. 
SG&A for the quarter came in better than guidance, decreasing $32 million year-over-year to $1.24 billion or 31.8% of sales. Lower-than-planned SG&A was primarily driven by effective management of our store labor hours and various home office savings initiatives. These items offset moderate expense increases related to the expansion of Sephora inside jcpenney, as well as startup costs associated with our growth brands division. 
Also our effective tax rate, 41.7% was slightly higher than expected, largely due to the changes in certain state tax laws that took effect this year. We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and our free cash flow has improved approximately $90 million year-over-year. 
Capital expenditures through the second quarter were $295 million, in line with our expectations and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. We ended the quarter with our inventory up 2.3%, in line with our projected sales trend for the upcoming quarter. 
Now let me share with you our planning assumptions for the third quarter. We expect comp store sales will grow 2% to 3% in the third quarter. On a monthly basis, we expect August sales will be below this range as back-to-school selling season is starting later again this year, with customers continuing their pattern of shopping closer to need. 
September should be roughly in line with our quarterly guidance, while October is expected to be a bit better. The gross margin rate is expected to be down slightly in the third quarter. Reflecting our focus on expense management, we are expecting SG&A to be flat to slightly lower year-over-year even with the additional expenses we expect to incur related to the expansions of Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring. 
The real estate and other line is expected to reflect the net expense of about $11 million with $19 million of restructuring charges flowing through that line item. Taking all of these assumptions into account for the third quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share including previously disclosed charges of approximately $0.05 per share. 
Also as Mike mentioned, in our ongoing effort to reduce expenses and streamline operations, we have begun a Voluntary Early Retirement Program or so-called VERP. Eligible associates will have between September 1 and October 15 to decide if they want to participate in the program. We will release the number of associates who have elected to participate in the program, as well as the operational efficiencies resulting from this program later in the year, likely with our third quarter earnings release. Our current Q3 earnings guidance does not include any impact from the VERP but we will update you on the earnings impact later in the quarter as appropriate. 
Additionally, we may also incur additional onetime charges in the third quarter arising from the possible sale of the company's clearance outlet stores to a third party but that impact has not been included in our current guidance. As you recall, earlier this year, we announced the plan to close the 19 outlet stores over the course of this year and next year. However, we are currently in negotiations to sell these outlet stores to a third party, which may result in acceleration of some of the previously announced charges and would be incurred in the third quarter. We will keep you updated as appropriate on the impact of this potential sale. 
So to be clear, we currently expect Q3 earnings to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share, including the previously disclosed restructuring charges of approximately $0.05. And this guidance does not include the impact of the VERP or the sale of the outlet stores. 
As to the full year guidance, because the full year earnings impact resulting from our Voluntary Early Retirement Program, the ongoing restructuring initiatives and other home office initiatives including the changes in leadership, it is yet to be determined and because we expect the consumer environment to remain uncertain, we believe it is prudent to provide guidance for the fourth quarter and full year, when visibility into these matters has improved. As such, we are not providing full year outlook at this time. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike"

Consumer climate is clearly uncertain and the tumultuous last 10 days or so hasn't given our core customer, the middle income family any reason to be more confident. 
Due to our compelling value proposition now more than ever, our ability to offer great style and quality at compelling prices is sustainable, competitive advantage. Encouraging to us is our recent customer scorecard for the second quarter. We've had a significant improvement in price perception and value delivered to the consumer. We also scored the largest increase in store for me, styles I like, new styles every time I visit and overall update and style for the store. Therefore, we remain cautiously optimistic about the back half of the year, especially as we head into the height of the back-to-school selling season, as well as fall and holiday. 
With our high penetration of private brands that continue to grow faster than the rest of the store and our high margin businesses, we have a unique ability to offer our customers quality merchandise at very sharp prices, while protecting our margins. 
We are continuing to build on the accomplishments we set in motion almost 2 years ago, which were focused on 4 key areas: First, we're continuing to assert our style authority by delivering great style credibility, with a balance of the best private and national brands. Second, we're delivering on memorable customer interactions with the help of our highly-engaged associates, who inspire discovery and build loyalty with our customers. Third, we're increasing our reach through digital experiences that are personalized and impactful. And fourth, we're taking significant steps to drive profitable growth with a focus on improving our operational effectiveness. 
Our focus on reengineering our business will allow us to achieve the 2014 earnings target we set out last year, and move us closer toward our goal of being a retail industry leader. 
Before I open the call for questions, I'd like to give you an update on Ron Johnson. As planned, Ron joined our Board of Directors on August 1. And Ron and I have been visiting stores and he took a trip with me to Asia for our supplier summit and individual meetings with key suppliers. Our time together has been and will continue to be very productive, and we're all looking forward to getting Ron here full time as CEO in November 1. 
With that, operator, we'll take your questions."

So part of our caution is we still feel we're in the middle of that transformation. Over half of our dot-com business today is the home business and big-ticket home is the most troubled of our businesses. So while we're getting good sell-through on fresh merchandise, as a matter of fact, we continue to see very sharp price points being bestsellers, as well as the newness and fashion and Sephora actually is the highest trending business in the store. So we're optimistic about our ability to maintain margins but we still have the drag a bit of our dot-com business. So I would say in the first half and particularly in the second quarter, half of our decline in margin to last year was the effect of dot-com."

Our view is that marketing effectiveness is one of our key initiatives and part of that is again, is the transition away from the traditional catalog business into more print media, that's directed across stores, as well as dot-com. As mentioned about our voluntary early retirement program, that has a positive effect on SG&A that we are looking forward to. We won't know the full impact of that until people voluntarily step forward and say, they want to participate. We continue to look at ways to improve our processes in the store, as well as in home office by redesigning work. We are looking at our non-merchandise procurement, where we can save in terms of purchasing paper, print and other commodity items. So it's a comprehensive program, we believe, given the impact of the recession on virtually every business that faces the consumer, that we need to get our cost structure in line to be able to leverage, to get improved bottom line results and that's integral to our 5-year plan."

I think we benefited from having virtually no cost increases in the first half. And I would argue that our cost impact on the second half of the year is probably more muted than most. We got ahead of it. I think we benefited from suppliers helping us with managing production during down periods. But there's no question the cost of cotton impacted everyone particularly in categories like home or the portion of the good is much higher in cotton. Cotton prices are coming down or have come down. So we're a bit more optimistic in the second half of spring, that we'll get back to a more normalized cost structure. We believe that our suppliers have worked very hard with us to optimize the way we buy, in terms of what portion of the assortment, at which price points. And in terms of the visibility to what we have in the back half, we feel we have the right goods en route. There's not much flexibility of changing quantity, this close to the end of the year. But we're buying in the middle of spring at this point, and we feel good about our ability to work with suppliers to continue our competitive advantage in terms of sourcing, as well as private brand.

We're well over our early expectations and frankly, keep increasing our future commitments. We think that is resonating not only in the categories we were in before we went to the parent Liz Claiborne brand but we're also expanding categories, that's gone very well. I think the MNG by Mango is 77 stores last year. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll be up to 500 stores by fall. It's getting great registration with the customer. The pricing is very sharp compared to other fast fashion concepts, we're the only department store that has true fast fashion in the store and is attracting the 18- to 35-year-old customer segment that we are focused on. Call it Spring, again, very much modern shoe assortment that's attracting a younger demographic. We're way ahead of our expectations there across women's handbags and men's. Sephora continues to be double-digit comps and a leading brand launch. Our Modern Bride has been a pleasant surprise in terms of our engagement jewelry business, up over 20% comp, as we rolled that out. American Living continues to be one of the top 10 brands. It's obviously more classic and traditional than some of the other that are focused more in the younger customer. So we feel very good. As I said, we only had growth initiatives, we'd be up double-digit comps. So the other part of the business obviously is the -- more of the basic business that during a difficult economic climate, customers can defer."

I think there has been some willingness to pay a bit more for something that was fashionable and new and that's encouraging to us. I think the good news is our costs of goods is such that I don't think we have to go up as much as some of our key competitors to meet our objectives. So while we plan units down modestly, that means we don't have to go quite as much up in price to meet our overall objectives, but time will tell.

Michael and I are going to keep our comments brief this morning so we'll have more time for your questions. Overall, there a few main points I'd like to make. 
First of all, while the top line sales number was softer than initially planned, we effectively managed expenses, maintained our strong liquidity position and continued to transition our storefront of products and brands to excite existing customers and attract new customers. Second, our focus on building attractions to becoming a destination for discovering great style is taking hold. 
Our identified growth initiatives, Liz Claiborne, Sephora inside jcpenney, our tops business, modern shoes and handbags, fast fashion, Modern Bride fine jewelry, housewares and center core are performing double-digit ahead of last year. With transactions being up 6.4% and our AUR essentially flat during the quarter, we're not trading down our business, trading down our quality or trading down our price but rather, we're trading up our attractions. 
We see opportunity to grow sales by improving the productivity in our existing stores and jcp.com, with the continued success of our growth initiatives and exclusive attractions like Liz Claiborne, Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by ALDO. 
In the second quarter, we opened 22 Sephora inside jcpenney locations and another 21 had a grand opening today, bringing our total locations to 297. Additionally, in the next few weeks, we'll have a total of 405 Call it Spring locations and 487 MNG by Mango locations, reinforcing jcpenney as a style destination. 
As part of our $650 million 2011 capital expenditures program, we also completed approximately 500 store updates and 20 major renovations during the quarter, including the largest renovation in our company's history at the jcpenney Roosevelt Field store in Long Island. Our ongoing renovation program, which is being rolled out across our fleet of stores, is a key component of our transformation plan designed to make our stores more exciting and to continue to improve our sales per square foot productivity. 
Turning now to our operational effectiveness initiatives. During the quarter, we accelerated the actions we are taking to significantly improve our expense structure. This is part of a multiyear operational effectiveness program that we put in place almost 2 years ago to reengineer our business, which will allow us to achieve our 5-year earnings target by 2014. 
As we stated in our first quarter press release, we expect to realize $50 million expense savings in fiscal 2011. $10 million was realized in the first quarter, with $7 million saved in the second quarter. The remaining $33 million in savings will occur in the back half, primarily in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we've gotten out of the Catalog business, announced the closure of our clearance outlets, reorganized our supply chain and custom decorating operations, we're ensuring our marketing spend is productive, competitive and effective, we're rolling out new process improvement technologies like RFID, mark down and price optimization and we launched the new digital platform. Additionally, we're looking at the design and structure of our entire organization to ensure we have the right people in the right roles to reflect our future growth opportunities. In some situations, primarily at the home office, we will staff organizations differently to meet the changing needs of our business. 
Part of the organizational redesign includes a voluntary early retirement program for select associates who have spent at least 20 years in the company, are active participants in our pension fund and are 55 years of age or above. This voluntary program is designed to provide eligible participants enhanced retirement benefits in exchange for voluntarily separating from the company. By making these changes, we will create opportunities to improve our processes and do things better, faster and more efficiently. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Michael, who will provide the numbers related to our business during the second quarter. Michael?"

This morning, we reported $0.07 in earnings per share, in line with our most recent guidance. Starting with our top line.

This morning, we reported $0.07 in earnings per share, in line with our most recent guidance. 
Starting with our top line. Once again, our growth initiatives and sales of our private and exclusive brands drove the business as the company's comparable store sales grew 1.5% in the second quarter. Year-to-date, comp store sales are up 2.7% over last year. 
Total sales for the quarter declined slightly to $3.9 billion, largely reflecting the elimination of our Catalog business last year. Gross margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the softer-than-expected selling environment in May and June, which resulted in more promotional activity and more markdowns in the quarter. Compared to last year's historical peak, gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points to 38.3% of sales. 
SG&A for the quarter came in better than guidance, decreasing $32 million year-over-year to $1.24 billion or 31.8% of sales. Lower-than-planned SG&A was primarily driven by effective management of our store labor hours and various home office savings initiatives. These items offset moderate expense increases related to the expansion of Sephora inside jcpenney, as well as startup costs associated with our growth brands division. 
Also our effective tax rate, 41.7%, was slightly higher than expected, largely due to the changes in certain state tax laws that took effect this year. We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and our free cash flow has improved approximately $90 million year-over-year. 
Capital expenditures through the second quarter were $295 million, in line with our expectations, and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. We ended the quarter with our inventory up 2.3%, in line with our projected sales trend for the upcoming quarter. 
Now let me share with you our planning assumptions for the third quarter. We expect comp store sales will grow 2% to 3% in the third quarter. On a monthly basis, we expect August sales will be below this range as back-to-school selling season is starting later again this year, with customers continuing their pattern of shopping closer to need. 
September should be roughly in line with our quarterly guidance, while October is expected to be a bit better. The gross margin rate is expected to be down slightly in the third quarter. Reflecting our focus on expense management, we are expecting SG&A to be flat to slightly lower year-over-year, even with the additional expenses we expect to incur related to the expansions of Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango and Call it Spring. 
The real estate and other line is expected to reflect the net expense of about $11 million with $19 million of restructuring charges flowing through that line item. Taking all of these assumptions into account for the third quarter earnings, we expect to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share including previously disclosed charges of approximately $0.05 per share. 
Also as Mike mentioned, in our ongoing effort to reduce expenses and streamline operations, we have begun a Voluntary Early Retirement Program, or so-called VERP. Eligible associates will have between September 1 and October 15 to decide if they want to participate in the program. We will release the number of associates who have elected to participate in the program, as well as the operational efficiencies resulting from this program later in the year, likely with our third quarter earnings release. Our current Q3 earnings guidance does not include any impact from the VERP, but we will update you on the earnings impact later in the quarter as appropriate. 
Additionally, we may also incur additional onetime charges in the third quarter arising from the possible sale of the company's clearance outlet stores to a third party but that impact has not been included in our current guidance. As you recall, earlier this year we announced the plan to close the 19 outlet stores over the course of this year and next year. However, we are currently in negotiations to sell these outlet stores to a third party, which may result in acceleration of some of the previously announced charges and would be incurred in the third quarter. We will keep you updated as appropriate on the impact of this potential sale. 
So to be clear, we currently expect Q3 earnings to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share, including the previously disclosed restructuring charges of approximately $0.05. And this guidance does not include the impact of the VERP or the sale of the outlet stores. 
As to the full year guidance, because the full year earnings impact resulting from our Voluntary Early Retirement Program, the ongoing restructuring initiatives and other home office initiatives including the changes in leadership, it is yet to be determined and because we expect the consumer environment to remain uncertain, we believe it is prudent to provide guidance for the fourth quarter and full year, when visibility into these matters has improved. As such, we are not providing full year outlook at this time. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Consumer climate is clearly uncertain and the tumultuous last 10 days or so hasn't given our core customer, the middle-income family, any reason to be more confident. 
Due to our compelling value proposition now more than ever, our ability to offer great style and quality at compelling prices is sustainable, competitive advantage. Encouraging to us is our recent customer scorecard for the second quarter. We've had a significant improvement in price perception and value delivered to the consumer. We also scored the largest increase in store for me, styles I like, new styles every time I visit and overall update and style for the store. Therefore, we remain cautiously optimistic about the back half of the year, especially as we head into the height of the back-to-school selling season, as well as fall and holiday. 
With our high penetration of private brands that continue to grow faster than the rest of the store and our high margin businesses, we have a unique ability to offer our customers quality merchandise at very sharp prices, while protecting our margins. 
We are continuing to build on the accomplishments we set in motion almost 2 years ago, which were focused on 4 key areas: First, we're continuing to assert our style authority by delivering great style credibility, with a balance of the best private and national brands. Second, we're delivering on memorable customer interactions with the help of our highly engaged associates, who inspire discovery and build loyalty with our customers. Third, we're increasing our reach through digital experiences that are personalized and impactful. And fourth, we're taking significant steps to drive profitable growth with a focus on improving our operational effectiveness. 
Our focus on reengineering our business will allow us to achieve the 2014 earnings target we set out last year, and move us closer toward our goal of being a retail industry leader. 
Before I open the call for questions, I'd like to give you an update on Ron Johnson. As planned, Ron joined our Board of Directors on August 1. And Ron and I have been visiting stores and he took a trip with me to Asia for our supplier summit and individual meetings with key suppliers. Our time together has been and will continue to be very productive, and we're all looking forward to getting Ron here full time as CEO on November 1. 
With that, operator, we'll take your questions."

Over half of our dot-com business today is the home business and big-ticket home is the most troubled of our businesses. So while we're getting good sell-through on fresh merchandise, as a matter of fact, we continue to see very sharp price points being bestsellers, as well as the newness and fashion and Sephora actually is the highest trending business in the store. So we're optimistic about our ability to maintain margins, but we still have the drag a bit of our dot-com business.

Our view is that the customer expects the sharp price points. In this economic environment, we've been able to maintain those. I'm sure that had some impact on the customer scorecard in terms of perception of price. At the same time, we think we can get modest price improvement in the middle of our assortments, where fashion is driving the business and where the customer sees the value of something that's relevant to what they are wanting at this timeframe. So we will continue to look at somewhat less unit selling in the fall season but at higher average unit at retail. So I think our average unit at retail will be a competitive advantage in this environment."

Our view is that marketing effectiveness is one of our key initiatives and part of that is again, is the transition away from the traditional catalog business into more print media that's directed across stores, as well as dot-com. As mentioned about our voluntary early retirement program, that has a positive effect on SG&A that we are looking forward to. We won't know the full impact of that until people voluntarily step forward and say they want to participate. We continue to look at ways to improve our processes in the store, as well as in home office by redesigning work. We are looking at our non-merchandise procurement, where we can save in terms of purchasing paper, print and other commodity items. So it's a comprehensive program, we believe, given the impact of the recession on virtually every business that faces the consumer, but we need to get our cost structure in line to be able to leverage, to get improved bottom line results and that's integral to our 5-year plan."

There's over 12% comp in the aggregate of those initiatives in the first half, we expect those to continue. Liz Claiborne has been extremely successful, well beyond our projection. We see no reason why these would slow down in the back half. Our opening price point assortments are selling through very much at or above plan. The toughest businesses frankly have been in the middle of the basics assortments.

I think we benefited from having virtually no cost increases in the first half. And I would argue that our cost impact on the second half of the year is probably more muted than most. We got ahead of it. I think we benefited from suppliers helping us with managing production during down periods. But there's no question the cost of cotton impacted everyone, particularly in categories like home, where the portion of the good is much higher in cotton. Cotton prices are coming down or have come down. So we're a bit more optimistic in the second half of spring that we'll get back to a more normalized cost structure. We believe that our suppliers have worked very hard with us to optimize the way we buy, in terms of what portion of the assortment at which price points. And in terms of the visibility to what we have in the back half, we feel we have the right goods en route. There's not much flexibility of changing quantities this close to the end of the year, but we're buying in the middle of spring at this point, and we feel good about our ability to work with suppliers to continue our competitive advantage in terms of sourcing, as well as private brand.

That is yet, as you point out, that is a younger customer. So we don't think there's any inhibition to shopping with us online. They actually were buying our goods in the store, but shop somebody else online. So we still have a very robust dot-com business, it's just not growing overall because the 51% of it is home. And as the home furnishings and soft home take hold and we get better print media directed to those former catalog customers, we feel that we'll get to double-digit dot-com overall."

We're well over our early expectations and frankly, keep increasing our future commitments. We think that is resonating not only in the categories we were in before we went to the parent Liz Claiborne brand, but we're also expanding categories; that's gone very well. I think the MNG by Mango, we had 77 stores last year. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll be up to 500 stores by fall. It's getting great registration with the customer. The pricing is very sharp compared to other fast fashion concepts. We're the only department store that has true fast fashion in the store and is attracting the 18- to 35-year-old customer segment that we are focused on. Call it Spring, again, very much a modern shoe assortment that's attracting a younger demographic. We're way ahead of our expectations there across women's handbags and men's. Sephora continues to be double-digit comps and a leading brand launch. Our Modern Bride has been a pleasant surprise in terms of our engagement jewelry business, up over 20% comp, as we rolled that out. American Living continues to be one of the top 10 brands. It's obviously more classic and traditional than some of the other that are focused more in the younger customer. So we feel very good. As I said, if we only had growth initiatives, we'd be up double-digit comps. So the other part of the business obviously is the -- more of the basic business that during a difficult economic climate, customers can defer."

Michae",664,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. There are 3 of us on the call this morning, Michael Dastugue; Ron Johnson and myself. All over the call give you some color on this past quarter as well as our plans for the holiday shopping season. Michael will as usual give you a greater financial detail including our outlook for the balance of the year. And then Ron will say a few words now that he's officially taken the CEO helm. Let me start with our result for the quarter. 
It continues to be a difficult consumer environment and this was evident in mall traffic during the period, which was down 2.4% in all our sales performance. But our higher income customers responded very well to our attractions. Our moderate income customers delayed efforts to merchandise as they continue to shop closer to need. That said, it's too early to call a trend, we recently seen stronger sales in cold weather apparel and accessories as temperatures across the country became more seasonable. There were some bright spots during the quarter that bear noting. The Liz Claiborne brand remains a standout performer. Sephora is generating strong sales in every location, up double digits for the quarter and year-to-date. And work we've been doing to build our center core business is resonating evident in performance of our women's accessory business. 
We've also made significant progress in our organizational restructuring we began earlier this year, which is designed to reduce expenses and simplify our organization by reducing investments in areas of business that no longer contribute meaningfully to our overall financial performance. This includes the sale during the quarter at 15 outlet stores to SB the capital as well as that we took to reorganize our supply chain network and our initiatives to reduce SG&A expenses throughout the business. It also includes the work we've done to redesign jcpenney  from a people perspective to make our work at all levels of the organization more effective and nimble. As part of this work, we initiated voluntary early retirement program or VERP for associates who have been with the company for more than 20 years and were at least 55 years of age. Mike will provide more detail on the financial impact of this program in a few moments. 
I should note that even though as we focused on these import organizational changes, we have continued to make investments in the attractions to drive our business, including renovating our stores to showcase our attractions like MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by ALDO. 
During the quarter, we opened 405 new Call it Spring by ALDO shoe shops for a total of 505 locations, we opened 208 MNG by Mango shoves for a total now of over 505 stores and we opened additional 31 Sephora inside jcpenney shops for a year and total of 308 locations. 
We also accelerate our, to the Liz Claiborne family brands from Liz Claiborne Inc, so we can capture all the upside from the strong business. And at the same time, we took the opportunity to acquire the Monet fashion jewelry brand from them as well, which we'll launch in jcpenney in the fall of 2012. 
Outside our core jcpenney  brand, we continue to build our growth brand businesses, which include our 2 new additional concepts Gifting Grace and CLAD. Both websites launched last week and our strategic partnerships between JCPenney and the Hearst Corporation. 
Moving on to holiday. We feel very good about our merchandise offering and our gift assortments, which are stronger than ever. While still a tough consumer environment, we've planned our business accordingly and will be stocked at the right levels. This combined with our compelling marketing campaign and high level of consumer service we offer makes jcpenney  once again be positioned as the key holiday gift destination this Christmas season. With that I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dastugue for further information in the quarter. Michael?"
295624,142488450,191412,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2011",2011-11-14,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.11 per share excluding restructuring and management transition charges. This was in line with our most recent guidance. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to the",794,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.11 per share excluding restructuring and management transition charges. This was in line with our most recent guidance. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our release, which is available on our website. 
On a GAAP basis, our EPS this quarter is a loss of $0.67 per share and I will our go on the overall charges related to that loss in a moment. Overall, the quarter was more challenging than we planned. While our SG&A was well managed, sales and gross margins came in below our expectations. That said, we are continuing to take actions necessary to streamline restructuring organization to position us for the next phase of J. C. Penney's  transformation. 
Turning to our Q3 results. Comp store sales declined 1.6% in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comp store sales are up 1.2% over last year. SG&A for the quarter came in better than anticipated, decreasing $84 million year-over-year to $1.24 million from 31.2% of sales. This was driven primarily by our decrease in marketing spend, lower credit costs and benefits realized from our expense reduction initiatives. Gross margin, however, decreased approximately 160 basis points to 37.4% of sales. 
Our gross margin in the third quarter was impacted by the softer-than-expected selling environment which resulted in higher promotional activity and more markdowns in the quarter. We did continue to be in a strong financial position and end of the third quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Capital expenditures to the third quarter were about $469 million in line with our expectations and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. We ended the quarter with our inventory up 2.6%. So now let me take you through some charges we recorded this quarter. 
In aggregate, we reported $265 million of restructuring and administrative transition charges in the third quarter. As you recall, we announced on our second quarter call that J. C. Penney  offered a voluntary early retirement program for approximately 8,200 associates. That program closed on October 15. Close to 4,000 J. C. Penney  associates took advantage of this opportunity to retire from the company with an enhanced financial incentive. With 80% of the cash cost associated with the program being borne by our well-funded pension plan, we recorded a pretax charge of $179 million. 
As associates retire over the next year, we estimate this program to have a favorable impact of approximately $50 million on 2012 operating expenses with a slightly higher benefit realized in 2013. 
Next we reported one-time charges of approximately $30 million related to the sale of our outlet store business to SB Capital in October. This included expenses related to the disposition of inventory and severance for associates. The remaining charges, which are detailed in our earnings release are related to the process improvements in our home office and supply chain as well as management transition expenses. 
Also please note, we have broken out the restructuring and management transition charges this quarter as a separate line item on our P&L. At the same time, we reclassified  2 previous quarters of restructuring charges to conform with the current presentation. As a result, these charges no longer flow in real estate numbers 
Now let me share with you a few of our assumptions for the fourth quarter. We expect comparable store sales to be flat to up slightly in the fourth quarter and gross margins to be down modestly. Our SG&A is expected to be well-managed and slightly below last year's levels. As we continue with our restructuring efforts and transitions in leadership, we expect to incur additional charges in the fourth quarter of approximately $104 million. A portion of these charges will have an impact on our effective tax rate, in other words, they are not tax-deductible in the fourth quarter, which is and therefore, the tax rate will -- and is expected to be approximately 48%. As a result, on approximately $220 million average shares outstanding, we expect fourth quarter earnings before restructuring and management transition charges to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, including all of the restructuring and management transition charges, earnings for the fourth quarter are now expected to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.74 per share. Additionally, as we stated in our release this morning, we are in the process of executing a meaningful change in the way we approach pricing. Our guidance for the fourth quarter does not include any financial impacts we may incur as a result of these changes. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike"

Penney  in 2004, almost exactly 7 years ago this month, the company had just completed its turnaround. 
My #1 priority as CEO was to move J. C. Penney  out of the turnaround pace and then grow and begin the transformation of the brand. I'm particularly proud of the success we've achieved in 3 key areas as we've laid a strong foundation for the future of J. C. Penney. 
First, the attractions we've built: Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango, Call it Spring by ALDO, Modern Bride, People Style Watch and the acquisition of Liz Claiborne brand. These great brands have anchored J. C. Penney  dramatic style transformation and attracted new and younger customers to JCPenney, many of whom never shopped with us in the past. 
Second, customer service. I have enormous respect for our customers who are working hard everyday to provide for their families in spite of with economic challenges. Across our organization, I've seen tremendous dedication to ensure that we are meeting our customers' needs and when we can, making their lives a little easier in the process. 
Customers recognized this commitment and award us 3 years in a row as the #1 department store for customer service in the American Express Customers Choice Survey. 
And third, associate engagement. Over last 7 years we've transformed our culture. J. C. Penney now boasts an associate engagement scores at top of the retail industry and the top quartile U.S. companies, moving from 67% engagement, which is the average of the Gallup poll just a few short years ago to over 80% in 2011. People who work for people, not companies. That's why I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our associates for their tremendous dedication the work we've been together to bring new and exciting brands and attractions to our customers, while making our company a great place to work. 
I'd also like to thank those of you on the call whom I've met and spent time with over the years as you follow J. C. Penney, including of course, our shareholders who placed their fate in the company. I personally and we, as a company, from these interactions. 
As many CEOs will tell you the most important thing they can do in their roles to ensure there's an exceptional successor in place. That's certainly been my priority over the last couple of years. I'm very happy report that we realized that goal and we bring someone with Ron Johnson's caliber to J. C. Penney. 
Ron is one of the most talented retail executives in the United States. And a couple years ago identified as someone who has the right talent and vision and values to take J. C. Penney to the next level and approach him about joining us. Ron told at that point, it wasn't the right time. While I respect his position, it didn't stop us from coming back. And I'm delighted to say this time, it was right. 
Working very closely with Ron over the last 4 months has been very exciting and confirm my belief he's the right person to becoming forward. I'm enthusiastic about his ideas and his vision for the next phase of jcpenney. With that I'll turn the call over to Ron, who will say a few words."

While I'm 2 weeks into my tenure, if truth be told, I've spent considerable time with Mike and the teams during the past 4 months preparing for my new role. Mike and I have actually traveled throughout the world together, visiting stores and partners and developing strategy for jcpenney to win. I would like to publicly thank Mike for his incredible support during the transition and for his 7 years of service at jcpenney. Many of the things we will do in the years ahead will be built on the very solid foundation created by Mike and the teams during his tenure as CEO in the company. 
Now officially here leading jcpenney, I get more excited every day about the potential for jcpenney. Two weeks ago in November 1, my first day, I addressed all of our associates here in Plano. I told them that I'm not here to improve, I am here to transform. 
I shared with them that as America's first store, it is time to assert leadership, reclaim our birthright and become America's favorite store. The energy, excitement and enthusiasm that I received from our associates was overwhelming. It clearly showed me that they are ready to win. 
As Mike said, success begins with people and jcpenney  has great people, people who I know will be able to think differently and work creatively to take the company into the future. With this background, I'm working with our team to rethink, really to imagine everything we do. I am investing considerable energy and a strategic review of our products, our pricing and our promotional strategies in order to create an exceptional, a new, a better way for people to shop. I'm also want to review of our processes with the goal of simplifying our work so that everything we do will focus on efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders. And most importantly, I'm spending time getting in our teams. 
I feel very fortunate that Michael Francis, who I worked with Target for many years, has come onboard as President to help lead the charge. Michael's talents in merchandising and marketing are unmatched and the chance for him to direct all creative functions in jcpenney  will allow us to truly stand out in the marketplace. His energy level is contagious and the teams are responding immediately to his leadership. And his personal excitement of our joining jcpenney  demonstrates to me that the dream for jcpenney to become America's favorite store is within our grasp. 
Talent is a fuel of any company but especially so in a people-intensive business like retailing. I'm excited to announce this morning the addition of 2 exceptional leaders who will all also be joining jcpenney. This Wednesday, Diane Walker, will join our company as Chief Talent Officer. And on December 5, Mike Kramer will joining JCPenney as Chief Operating Officer. 
I worked with Mike and Diane at Apple and I believe they are 2 of the most talented leaders in the retail industry and I look forward to you getting to know them. Diane Walker has over 3 decades of experience as the most Senior HR Executive in a variety of companies and is a winner. 
He, in the department of our industry and was promoted to VP of HR at the, division at the age of 29. He then led Human Resources at General Mills Specialty Retail Division. In the early 1980s, which at that time included Eddie Bauer, Talbots and 3 other specialty retail stores. He then joined the GAP in 1996, working closely with Mickey and the GAP's presidents to build a talent engine that fuel the growth of the core GAP brand and help launch new concepts including GAP Kids, baby GAP, GAP international and a modernized Banana Republic. The talent supply chain then created and helped establish GAP as a world leader in specialty retail in the early 90s. Dan joined Apple as Chief Talent Officer at the same year I joined Apple. He led and built the global human resources team during a period where we saw the launch of the iPod, iTunes, a world-class Application division and the Apple retail stores. His ability to identify, develop and organize talent is unmatched and he is an unbelievably creative and transformational thinker. 
I am thrilled that I'll get the chance to work side-by-side with Dan again. Mike Kramer is leaving his position as CEO of J. C. Penney  team. At Kellwood, Mike oversaw a portfolio of nearly a dozen fashion brands, including Vans, Scotch and Soda and Rebecca Taylor. Prior to that, he was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Abercrombie and Fitch. 
I first worked with Mike when he was Vice President of Finance at Apple and CFO of retail stores. Mike joined me when we opened our first store and was there through the first 5 formative years of Apple's retail strategy. Mike is an unusual leader and that he combines extraordinary financial acumen with a strategic business perspective. A certified public accountant, he began his career with financial leadership roles at limited and in various divisions at PepsiCo. Since then he has worked in increasingly strategic roles at Apple, Abercrombie and Kellwood, culminating in his role as the Chief Executive Officer. 
He will bring an extraordinary wealth of experience with winning companies to J. C. Penney. And his most experienced with a wholesale company, managing a portfolio of established and emerging brands will be extremely valuable as we reimagine our merchandise portfolio. 
I am convinced that Michael Francis, Mike Kramer and Dan Walker combined with a talented team I've met and worked within the past 4 months at J. C. Penney  will have the courage, boldness and skill to rethink every aspect of our business as we transform J. C. Penney to become America's favorite store. I know you have a lot of questions about our plans to do that and I can't wait to share them with you. However, my approach will be to only talk publicly about our actions at the time we're taking them, not before. 
So with that, we will start shedding light on our strategic approach in late January when we will hold a meeting in New York for the investment community. We will be sending out invitations in the coming weeks with additional details but please block the morning of January 25 on your calendars. Again, I am the thrilled to officially be here now and look forward to meeting all of you in January. 
Since we'll address all long-term strategy questions in the January event I will turn the call back to Mike and Michael right now to handle the Q&A regarding Q3 performance in Q4 expectations"

It's not just about cost cutting. It's about making work simpler and our stores organization, the time management system, the store fore activities, those things have evolved so as in our past. Last several months we've been working on supply-chain improvements as we transitioned out the catalog business, we realized there are a lot of infrastructure, there's more catalog focused instead of dot-com focused. And quite honestly most of the year has been transitioning away from print media from a catalog perspective and more toward online. That has been much more painful than we anticipated. It's more than what we saw in CNBC this morning, housing is in depression not a recession. Half of our Online business and half of our Catalog business was home and that's hurt us. Our .com business margins has been hurt by the home business, which we obviously didn't anticipate would linger in this difficult positions for so long. So most of our process have been redesigned and making people's jobs easier and making more effective."

We still feel very strongly that we're underrepresented in that market so we thought it a strategic priority to the field. It's responding very well after the remodel has opened. So we will continue to have a robust renovation remodel strategy every time you put Sephora  in existing jcpenney store, it gives us the opportunity to remodel the center core. We continue to have 75 to 85 new Sephora locations in the coming year. So I think that we can afford to have that many, in our fields per year but we are committed to taking on the most important stores in making sure they're level of ambience our customers expect."

First is the year coming out of the first quarter, if you look at the mall traffic or if you look at the economy as a whole, we're about 400 basis points below the trendline coming out of the first quarter. So much of our margin compression over the last 2 quarters has been getting out of the goods that frankly there was no demand for as the economy gradually down closer to a flat line. We feel that we're past the worst of that. In terms of being able to modify the fourth quarter, we were able to pull back on this as we saw that deceleration. I think as I just mentioned just previously, our .com business was impacted negatively on margins so I'd say be combined about half of the margin miss was in .com, which was the cost of shipping, the home business deterioration and the other half was in markdowns to declare the goods that we felt needed to be in the right stock opposition coming in the fourth quarter. We're very satisfied with what we own today in terms of inventory is appropriate for the fourth quarter. I would say as to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we recently feel more confident about maintaining the margin flat or slightly down. Is that last year we had a very difficult margin for the fourth quarter, so we think we have upside to what would have been a normal fourth quarter that we're facing. I'm not prepared to talk about the go-forward strategy. As Ron mentioned, there's an opportunity to do that at the end of January. Fortunately, Ron and I had a lot of time together and feel very confident that on a forward-looking basis that you'll be very satisfied with the strategy."

So the market expense while some of our competitors actually increased their marketing during this period, we show this as a transition not to build a bigger hurdle climb in terms of promotion going forward. So we've been optimizing the way we use our marketing dollars whether it's the amount of preprints, the geographic, diversity we have in terms of customers' response to various types of media. So we don't see any difference in terms of the way we look at our cost savings in the fourth quarter than what we've seen in the first 3.

It's exceeding our expectations, so we feel very good about that. It bodes well for further Lancome partnership. As to the center core, we honestly believe that we have a huge opportunity in the center core. Most department stores, the highest productivity they have is in the center core because traditionally, we didn't have a comprehensive beauty offer. It was a disadvantage for jcpenney. And frankly, our apparel business was more productive than our accessories business. That doesn't make a lot of sense. So we believe this huge cross shopping opportunities between apparel customers that we now find in the center core are more attractive and accessories that are tied together with our apparel purchases. Our People Style Watch initiative has proven to us that customers want to buy the whole outfit. They particularly like the fact that when they get confidence by People Style Watch endorsing the things that we've put in the assortments. So what we call center core includes beauty, it includes fine jewelry, it includes women's accessories, in many cases, it includes women's shoes. These businesses are accretive to our overall productivity and are very profitable. So we've set that up in a number of stores at this point, it will take probably 2 to 3 years to get to all sorts of terms of the transformation of the center core businesses."

So I'm very optimistic about the quality of people we were able to attract people. We want people for a career. We don't want them for a week and I think our turnover has gone over 100%, which is pretty traditional in retail, down to the 60s.

The key will be making sure that our markdown levels are in markdown expectations and we really don't have an overhang at this point coming into the quarter.

My experience recently has been that there's a little bit disconnect between consumer spending and sentiments obviously is at all-time low. So consumers don't feel necessarily good about their current circumstance whether it's the cost of food and fuel or the expectation of the job situation or equity in their house. Having said that, our strongest business is Sephora, which is not a price promotion business. It's not something that people would necessarily see as a need but it's the excitement in the fashion and newness gets us a lot of encouragement that Liz Claiborne and Mango and Call it Spring and Sephora  and things that added, are stimulating the consumers that are seeing something they like in the store. So it think the main thing has been when the people feel more confident about kind of their general family budget and I think that may take some time. The environment doesn't lend itself at the moment to a lot of confidence because it's obviously a robust dialogue about futures entitlements and the future of budgets and the next year's election. I think we step to earn the business everyday by getting better service and adding merchandise that people want and make sure that we plan it properly. So I think anybody that's been a student of the current economic climate will say it's been a more protracted downturn than anybody expected but.

Because it looked like to us the data that we looked out was about 5% of your store base were malls that were putting out less than $150 a foot, which would imply may be the malls are very unproductive and maybe your stores aren't productive.

A number of relocations occurred in the last 3 or 4 years as we moved out of locations that had various difficulties whether it in the more mall or a particular store. So I really don't see an acceleration of closings. I think it's a question of analysis of performing this done year-over-year. I think if anything, new open, versus starting to reinvest in their properties again. And we stand a benefit from that to the extent they bring new anchors in, new ideas in, like an Apple store, for example. An Apple stores is the most productive thing that can happen to a mall. It attracts a broad range of customers, all those customers. All of those customers are opportunities for us. So I think our biggest opportunity frankly is the jcpenney brand. So to the extent we elevate the brand and get people to discover that we are we have style, we have quality, we have a very compelling price, that should appeal to a much broader audience."

There are 3 of us on the call this morning: Michael Dastugue; Ron Johnson and myself. I'll open the call by giving you some color on this past quarter as well as our plans for the holiday shopping season. Michael will as usual provide you a greater financial detail, including our outlook for the balance of the year. And then Ron will say a few words, now that he's officially taken the CEO helm. Let me start with our results for the quarter. 
It continues to be a difficult consumer environment, and this was evident in mall traffic during the period, which was down 2.4% in our sales performance. While our higher income customers responded very well to our attractions, our moderate income customers delayed their purchases of fall/winter merchandise as they continue to shop closer to need. That said, while it's a little too early to call a trend, we recently seen stronger sales in cold weather apparel and accessories as temperatures across the country became more seasonable. There were some bright spots during the quarter that bear noting. The Liz Claiborne brand remains a standout performer. Sephora is generating strong sales in every location, up double digits for the quarter and year-to-date. And work we've been doing to build our center core business is resonating, evident in the solid performance of our women's accessory businesses. 
We've also made significant progress in our organizational restructuring we began earlier this year, which is designed to reduce expenses and simplify our organization by reducing investments in areas of the business that no longer contribute meaningfully to our overall financial performance. This includes the sale during the quarter of 15 outlet stores to SB Capital, as well as steps we took to reorganize our supply chain network and our initiatives to reduce SG&A expenses throughout the business. It also includes the work we've done to redesign jcpenney from a people perspective to make our work at all levels of the organization more effective and nimble. As part of this work, we initiated a Voluntary Early Retirement Program or VERP for associates who have been with the company for more than 20 years and were at least 55 years of age. Mike will provide more detail on the financial impact of this program in a few moments. 
I should note that even though as we focus on these import organizational changes, we have continued to make investments in the attractions to drive our business, including renovating our stores to showcase our new attractions, like MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by ALDO. 
During the quarter, we opened 405 new Call it Spring by ALDO shoe shops for a total of 505 locations. We opened 208 MNG by Mango shops for a total now of 500 stores, and we opened additional 31 Sephora inside jcpenney shops for a year end total of 308 locations. 
We also accelerate our option to buy the Liz Claiborne family brands from Liz Claiborne Inc., so we can capture all the upside from the strong business. And at the same time, we took the opportunity to acquire the Monet fashion jewelry brand from them as well, which we'll launch in jcpenney in the fall of 2012. 
Outside our core jcpenney brand, we continue to build our growth brand businesses, which include our 2 new additional concepts, Gifting Grace and CLAD. Both websites launched last week and our strategic partnerships between jcpenney and the Hearst Corporation. 
Moving on to holiday. We feel very good about our merchandise offering and our gift assortments, which are stronger than ever. While it's still a tough consumer environment, we've planned our business accordingly and will be stocked at the right levels. This combined with our compelling marketing campaign and high level of consumer service we offer means jcpenney once again will be positioned to be a key holiday gift destination this Christmas season. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue for further information in the quarter. Michael?"
295624,142488450,191779,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2011",2011-11-14,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.11 per share, excluding restructuring and management transition charges. This was in line with our most recent guidance. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to the",796,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.11 per share, excluding restructuring and management transition charges. This was in line with our most recent guidance. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our release, which is available on our website. 
On a GAAP basis, our EPS this quarter is a loss of $0.67 per share, and I will go overall with the overall charges related to that loss in a few moments. Overall, the quarter was more challenging than we planned. While our SG&A was well managed, sales and gross margins came in below our expectations. That said, we are continuing to take actions necessary to streamline and restructure our organization to position us for the next phase of  jcpenney's transformation. 
Turning to our Q3 results. Comp store sales declined 1.6% in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comp store sales were up 1.2% over last year. SG&A for the quarter came in better than anticipated, decreasing $84 million year-over-year to $1.24 billion or 31.2% of sales. This was driven primarily by our decrease in marketing spend, lower credit costs and benefits realized from our expense reduction initiatives. Gross margin, however, decreased approximately 160 basis points to 37.4% of sales. 
Our gross margin in the third quarter was impacted by the softer-than-expected selling environment, which resulted in higher promotional activity and more markdowns in the quarter. We did continue to be in a strong financial position and ended the third quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $469 million in line with our expectations, and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. We ended the quarter with our inventory up 2.6%. So now let me take you through some of the charges we recorded this quarter. 
In aggregate, we recorded $265 million of restructuring and management transition charges in the third quarter. As you recall, we announced on our second quarter call that jcpenney offered a Voluntary Early Retirement Program to approximately 8,200 associates. That program closed on October 15, and close to 4,000 jcpenney associates took advantage of this opportunity to retire from the company with an enhanced financial incentive. With 80% of the cash costs associated with the program being borne by our well-funded pension plan, we recorded a pretax charge of $179 million. 
As associates retire over the next year, we estimate this program to have a favorable impact of approximately $50 million on 2012 operating expenses with a slightly higher benefit realized in 2013. 
Next, we recorded one-time charges of approximately $30 million related to the sale of our outlet store business to SB Capital in October. This included expenses related to the disposition of inventory and severance for associates. The remaining charges, which are detailed in our earnings release are related to the process improvements in our home office and supply chain as well as management transition expenses. 
Also please note, we have broken out the restructuring and management transition charges this quarter as a separate line item on our P&L. At the same time, we reclassified 2 previous quarters of restructuring charges to conform with the current presentation. As a result, these charges no longer flow through real estate and other.
Now let me share with you a few of our assumptions for the fourth quarter. We expect comparable store sales to be flat to up slightly in the fourth quarter and gross margins to be down modestly. Our SG&A is expected to be well managed and slightly below last year's levels. As we continue with our restructuring efforts and transitions in leadership, we expect to incur additional charges in the fourth quarter of approximately $104 million. A portion of these charges will have an impact on our effective tax rate. In other words, they are not tax deductible in the fourth quarter, which is -- and therefore, the tax rate will -- is expected to be approximately 48%. As a result, on approximately $220 million average shares outstanding, we expect fourth quarter earnings before restructuring and management transition charges to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, including all of the restructuring and management transition charges, earnings for the fourth quarter are now expected to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.74 per share. Additionally, as we stated in our release this morning, we are in the process of executing a meaningful change in the way we approach pricing. Our guidance for the fourth quarter does not include any financial impacts we may incur as the results of these changes. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike"

While I continue to serve for the next few months as Executive Chairman of jcpenney, this will be the last of 27 quarterly conference calls that I'll be on with you. As Chief Executive of one of America's largest retail companies for the past 7 years and a number of other senior leadership roles in the industry before that, I've had a bird's eye view of the direct impact the economy has had on the consumers' wallets. That's been particularly true here in jcpenney as we serve more than half of America's families every year. At the time I joined jcpenney in 2004, almost exactly 7 years ago this month, the company had just completed its turnaround. 
My #1 priority as CEO was to move jcpenney out of a turnaround phase and then grow and begin the transformation of the brand. I'm particularly proud of the success we've achieved in 3 key areas as we've laid a strong foundation for the future of jcpenney. 
First, the attractions we've built: Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango, Call it Spring by ALDO, Modern Bride, People Style Watch and the acquisition of Liz Claiborne brand. These great brands have anchored jcpenney's dramatic style transformation and attracted new and younger customers to jcpenney, many of whom who never shopped with us in the past. 
Second, customer service. I have enormous respect for our customers who are working hard every day to provide for their families in spite of great economic challenges. Across our organization, I've seen tremendous dedication to ensure that we're meeting our customers' needs and when we can, making their lives a little easier in the process.
Customers have recognized this commitment and honored us 3 years in a row as the #1 department store for customer service in the American Express/NRF Customers' Choice survey. 
And third, associate engagement. Over last 7 years we've transformed our culture. jcpenney now boasts an associate engagement score at top of the retail industry and the top quartile of all U.S. companies, moving from 67% engagement, which is about average of the Gallup poll just a few short years ago to over 80% in 2011. People work for people, not companies. That's why I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our associates for the tremendous dedication to the work we've done together to bring new and exciting brands and attractions to our customers while making our company a great place to work. 
I'd also like to thank those of you on the call whom I've met, spent time with over the years as you follow jcpenney, including, of course, our shareholders who placed their faith in our company. I personally and we, as a company, have greatly benefited from these interactions. 
As many CEOs will tell you the most important thing they can do in their roles to ensure there's an exceptional successor in place. That's certainly been my priority over the last couple of years. I'm very happy report that we've realized that goal, and we bring someone with Ron Johnson's caliber to jcpenney. 
Ron is one of the most talented retail executives in the United States and a couple years ago, identified as someone who has the right talent and vision and values to take jcpenney to the next level and approached him about joining us. Ron told me at that point, it wasn't the right time. While I respect his position, it didn't stop us from coming back. And I'm delighted to say this time, it was right. 
Working very closely with Ron over the last 4 months has been very exciting and confirmed my belief he's the right person to lead the company forward. I'm enthusiastic about his ideas and his vision for the next phase of jcpenney. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron, who will say a few words."

It is great to have officially begun my duties here at jcpenney. While I'm 2 weeks into my tenure, if truth be told, I've spent considerable time with Mike and the team during the past 4 months preparing for my new role. Mike and I have actually traveled throughout the world together, visiting stores and partners and developing strategy for jcpenney to win. I would like to publicly thank Mike for his incredible support during the transition and for his 7 years of service at jcpenney. Many of the things we will do in the years ahead will be built on the very solid foundation created by Mike and the team during his tenure as CEO of this company. 
Now officially here leading jcpenney, I get more excited every day about the potential for jcpenney. Two weeks ago in November 1, my first day, I addressed all of our associates here in Plano. I told them that I am not here to improve, I am here to transform. 
I shared with them that as America's first store, it is time to assert leadership, reclaim our birthright and become America's favorite store. The energy, excitement and enthusiasm that I received from our associates was overwhelming. It clearly showed me that they are ready to win. 
As Mike said, success begins with people, and jcpenney has great people, people who I know will be able to think differently and work creatively to take the company into the future. With this background, I'm working with our team to rethink, really to reimagine everything we do. I am investing considerable energy and a strategic review of our product, our pricing and our promotional strategies in order to create an exceptional, a new, a better way for people to shop. I am also launching a review of our processes with the goal of simplifying our work, so that everything we do will focus on efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders. And most importantly, I'm spending time getting to know our teams. 
I feel very fortunate that Michael Francis, who I worked with at Target for many years, has come on board as President to help lead the charge. Michael's talents in merchandising and marketing are unmatched, and the chance for him to direct all creative functions at jcpenney will allow us to truly stand out in the marketplace. His energy level is contagious, and the teams are responding immediately to his leadership. And his personal excitement of our joining jcpenney demonstrates to me that the dream for jcpenney to become America's favorite store is within our grasp. 
Talent is a fuel of any company but especially so in a people-intensive business like retailing. I'm excited to announce this morning the addition of 2 exceptional leaders who will all also be joining jcpenney. This Wednesday, Dan Walker will join our company as Chief Talent Officer. And on December 5, Mike Kramer will join jcpenney as Chief Operating Officer. 
I worked with Mike and Dan at Apple, and I believe they are 2 of the most talented leaders in the retail industry, and I look forward to you getting to know them. Dan Walker has over 3 decades of experience as the most senior HR executive in a variety of companies, and he's a winner. 
He cut his teeth in the department industry and was promoted to VP of HR at Lazarus, a division of Federated at the age of 29. He then led Human Resources at General Mills Specialty Retail division in the early 1980s, which at that time included Eddie Bauer, Talbots and 3 other specialty retail stores. He then joined the GAP in 1986, working closely with Mickey and the GAP's presidents to build the talent engine that fuel the growth of the core GAP brand and help launch new concepts, including GAPKids, babyGap, GAP International and a modernized Banana Republic. The talent supply chain model Dan created helped establish GAP as a world leader in specialty retail in the early 90s. Dan joined Apple as Chief Talent Officer at the same year I joined Apple. He led and built the global human resources team during a period where we saw the launch of the iPod, iTunes, a world-class application division and the Apple retail stores. His ability to identify, develop and organize talent is unmatched, and he is an unbelievably creative and transformational thinker. 
I am thrilled that I'll get the chance to work side by side with Dan again. Mike Kramer is leaving his position as CEO of Kellwood to join the jcpenney team. At Kellwood, Mike oversaw a portfolio of nearly a dozen fashion brands, including Vince, Scotch & Soda and Rebecca Taylor. Prior to that, he was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Abercrombie and Fitch. 
I first worked with Mike when he was Vice President of Finance at Apple and CFO of the retail stores. Mike joined me when we opened our first store and was there through the first 5 formative years of Apple's retail strategy. Mike is an unusual leader and that he combines extraordinary financial acumen with a strategic business perspective. A certified public accountant, he began his career with financial leadership roles at limited and in various divisions at PepsiCo. Since then, he has worked in increasingly strategic roles at Apple, Abercrombie and Kellwood, culminating in his role as the Chief Executive Officer. 
He will bring an extraordinary wealth of experience with winning companies to jcpenney. And he's most experienced with a wholesale company, managing a portfolio of established and emerging brands will be extremely valuable as we reimagine our merchandise portfolio. 
I am convinced that Michael Francis, Mike Kramer and Dan Walker, combined with a talented team I've met and worked with in the past 4 months at jcpenney, will have the courage, boldness and skill to rethink every aspect of our business as we transform jcpenney to become America's favorite store. I know you have a lot of questions about our plans to do that, and I can't wait to share them with you. However, my approach will be to only talk publicly about our actions at the time we're taking them, not before. 
So with that, we will start shedding light on our strategic approach in late January when we will hold a meeting in New York for the investment community. We will be sending out invitations in the coming weeks with additional details, but please block the morning of January 25 on your calendars. Again, I am thrilled to officially be here now and look forward to meeting all of you in January. 
Since we'll address all long-term strategy questions at the January event, I will turn the call back to Mike and Michael right now to handle the Q&A regarding Q3 performance in Q4 expectations"

It's not just about cost cutting. It's about trying to make work simpler in our stores -- organization, the time management system, these Door to Floor activities, those things have also -- in our past. For the last several months, we've been working on supply chain improvements. As we transitioned out the catalog business, we realized there are a lot of infrastructure. There's more catalog focused instead of dotcom focused. And quite honestly, most of the year has been transitioning away from print media from a catalog perspective and more toward online. That's been much more painful than we anticipated. As Warren Buffett said on CNBC this morning, housing is in a depression, not a recession. Half of our online business and half of our catalog business was home, and that's hurt us. Our dotcom business margins have been hurt by the home business, which we obviously didn't anticipate would linger in this difficult positions for so long. So most of our process things have been redesigned in making people's jobs easier and making them more effective."

We still feel very strongly that we're underrepresented in that market, so we felt it was a strategic priority to do Roosevelt Field. It's responding very well after the remodel has opened. So we will continue to have a robust renovation remodel strategy. Every time we put a Sephora in an existing jcpenney store, it gives us the opportunity to remodel the center core. We continue to have 75 to 85 new Sephora locations in the coming year. So I think that we can afford to have that many Roosevelt Fields per year, but we're committed to taking on the most important stores in making sure they're at the level of ambience that our customers expect."

So much of our margin compression over the last 2 quarters has been getting out of the goods that frankly there was no demand for as the economy ratcheted down closer to a flat line. We feel that we're past the worst of that. In terms of being able to modify the fourth quarter, we were able to pull back on goods as we saw that deceleration. I think as I mentioned just recently -- just previously, our dotcom business was impacted negatively on margins, so I would say if you combine about half of the margin miss was in dotcom, which was the cost of shipping. The home business deterioration and the other half was in markdowns to declare the goods that we felt needed to be in the right stock position coming in the fourth quarter. We're very satisfied with what we own today in terms of inventory as appropriate for the fourth quarter. I would say as to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we recently feel more confident about maintaining the margin flat or slightly down. It's that last year we had a very difficult margin for the fourth quarter, so we think we have upside to what would have been a normal fourth quarter that we're facing. I'm not prepared to talk about the go-forward strategy. As Ron mentioned, there's an opportunity to do that at the end of January. Fortunately, Ron and I had a lot of time together.

So I think that we have every reason to believe at this point in time in the fourth quarter that we're on track to achieve our AUR expectations, and that we'll have the units necessary to take care of Christmas. But I think costs come down modestly going into spring, and we're up against much higher cotton costs a year ago. But I don't think it'll ever go back -- maybe ever is a long time, but I don't think it's going to go back soon to the previous cotton prices, I think the social costs and other aspects of sourcing in Asia have taken a step in the wrong direction from a cost point of view."

We identified $50 million of savings we've committed to in this -- for this fiscal year. We're going to achieve that or slightly better. So the market expense while some of our competitors actually increased their marketing during this period, we chose as a transition not to build a bigger hurdle climb in terms of promotion going forward. So we've been optimizing the way we use our marketing dollars, whether it's the amount of preprints, the geographic diversity we have in terms of how customers respond to various types of media. So we don't see any difference in terms of the way we would look at our cost savings in the fourth quarter than what we've seen in the first 3.

It's exceeding our expectations, so we feel very good about that. It bodes well for further Lancome partnership. As to the center core, we honestly believe that we have a huge opportunity in the center core. Most department stores, the highest productivity they have is in the center core because traditionally, it didn't really have a comprehensive beauty offer. It was a disadvantage for jcpenney, and frankly our apparel business was more productive than our accessories business. That doesn't make a lot of sense. So we believe these huge cross-shopping opportunities between apparel customers that will find the center core more attractive and accessories that are tied together with our apparel purchases. Our People Style Watch initiative has proven to us that customers want to buy the whole outfit. They particularly like the fact when they get confidence by People Style Watch endorsing the things that we've put in the assortments. So what we call center core includes beauty, it includes fine jewelry, it includes women's accessories. In many cases, it includes women's shoes. These businesses are accretive to our overall productivity and are very profitable. So we've set that up in a number of stores at this point. It will take probably 2 to 3 years to get to all stores in terms of the transformation of the center core businesses."

So we're excited for people who were able to take advantage of that. We're also excited about the opportunity that we're seeing a huge influx of people that are willing and want to have a career with us. I think that the nature of our store staffing has been such that we've been able to put better customer service in place by having more people when customers are in the store and modifying the staffing when there's less traffic. So I think the reason our customer service scores keep getting better, so we're actually giving the customer a better experience. So I'm very optimistic about the quality of people we were able to attract. We want people for a career. We don't want them for a week, and I think our turnover has gone from over 100%, which is pretty traditional in retail, down to the 60s.

We had a modest improvement or a modest increase in the cost of goods, and that's what we're looking to offset by higher average unit retails. So we're on track as I said earlier. We know that we need to get modest single-digit improvements in AUR in the fourth quarter, and we have every anticipation of getting it. The key will be making sure that our markdown levels are within our markdown expectations, and we don't really have an overhang at this point coming into the quarter. We've had an overhang through the second and third quarter due to the falloff in demand by everybody in the general retail sector. So I'd say, we're only 2 weeks into the quarter, so it's a little difficult to declare victory, but we're certainly on the right trendline at this point."

My experience recently has been that there's a little bit of a disconnect between consumer spending and sentiments. Sentiment is at virtually an all-time low. So consumers don't feel necessarily good about their current circumstance, whether it's the cost of food and fuel or the expectation of the job situation or the equity in their house. Having said that, our strongest business is Sephora, which is not a price promotion business. It's not a -- something that people would necessarily see as a need, but it's the excitement in the fashion and newness gives us a lot of encouragement that Liz Claiborne and Mango and Call it Spring and Sephora and things that we've added are stimulating to consumers that are seeing something they like in the store. So I think the main thing has been when the people feel more confident about kind of general -- their general family budget, and I think that may take some time. The political environment doesn't lend itself at the moment to a lot of confidence because it's in obviously a robust dialogue about the future entitlements and the future of budgets and the next year's election. I think we'd step to earn the business everyday by getting better service and having merchandise that people want and to make sure we plan it properly. So I think anybody that's been a student of the current economic climate will say it's been a more protracted downturn than anybody expected. But I think our sense is we're not slipping back into a double dip because more or less we're bumping along the top of the waves."

I think the difficulty has been that we've earned it by being a very large catalog retailer, and we've had to transform it while the locomotive was going down the track. So it's been very painful in the last several years. It's been a negative factor in our comps because we include that in our comp stores, but I do think it will be accretive going forward. So I think we've aligned the fashion offerings that we have in the store that customers are enjoying at the point of sale. Those are now largely available online, and we have 27 million customers in apparel that buy our apparel in the store that don't shop with us online, they're shopping some place else.

We're the only department store that really has a true fast fashion retail offer. When we started doing business with them, they had 12 locations in the United States, largely unknown in the United States but well-known in Europe and throughout the rest of the world. Their alternative was to go out and find retail space, which would take them a decade to get to the same presentation, the same representations they've been able to achieve with us in a year. So it's a win-win from our perspective. We give our customer choices, and they get exposure against their key competitors. I would say that the -- it's resonated the best on the coast that typically is where the tourist customer is located and has encountered Mango in other places. I think that this fall, the pricing is now at the MNG level pricing that we knew it needs to be at the beginning when they had a few stores that reflected more to Mango pricing, which is somewhat higher. I think they were quite satisfied that they have the wherewithal in terms of design expertise and the supply chain and response time to give our customers newness and fashion on a regular basis, so it's been very well received. I think we're attracting customers that would not have shopped with us, and they're the most shop -- cross-shopping with Sephora, Call it Spring and Mango. So it tells us that the younger 18- to 40-year-old age range is the customer that Mango is attracting."

So our existing customers are our best place to look for additional volume. Half of the families in America is a very large footprint, so I think that's probably the biggest opportunity. Having said that, the new things we've added have attracted the young customers. We know that there's over 0.25 million new customers came that never bought in jcpenney before that bought Liz Claiborne, so we know those are new customers. And I think we can trace the other attractions of having a similar expectation. So I don't think there's a lot of risk in terms of the changes being made. The risk is clearly not the downside. I think the opportunity is in the upside, people finding a broader range of merchandise, more excitement, price merchandise and a customer experience that we think has been certainly recognized by American Express.

A number of relocations occurred in the last 3 or 4 years as we moved out of locations that had various difficulties, whether it's the mall or a particular store. So I really don't see an acceleration of closings. I think it's a question of analysis of how they're performing, tests done every year. I think, if anything, the well-financed mall developers are starting to reinvest in their properties again. And we stand a benefit from that to the extent they bring new anchors in, new ideas in, like an Apple store, for example. An Apple store is the most productive thing that can happen to a mall. It attracts a broad range of customers, all of those customers. All those customers are opportunities for us. So I think our biggest opportunity frankly is the jcpenney brand. So to the extent we elevate the brand and get people to discover who we are that we have style, we have quality, we have a very compelling price, that should appeal to a much broader audience."

There are 3 of us on the call this morning: Michael Dastugue; Ron Johnson and myself. I'll open the call by giving you some color on this past quarter as well as our plans for the holiday shopping season. Michael will as usual provide you a greater financial detail, including our outlook for the balance of the year. And then Ron will say a few words, now that he's officially taken the CEO helm. Let me start with our results for the quarter. 
It continues to be a difficult consumer environment, and this was evident in mall traffic during the period, which was down 2.4% in our sales performance. While our higher income customers responded very well to our attractions, our moderate income customers delayed their purchases of fall/winter merchandise as they continue to shop closer to need. That said, while it's a little too early to call a trend, we recently seen stronger sales in cold weather apparel and accessories as temperatures across the country became more seasonable. There were some bright spots during the quarter that bear noting. The Liz Claiborne brand remains a standout performer. Sephora is generating strong sales in every location, up double digits for the quarter and year-to-date. And the work we've been doing to build our center core business is resonating, evident in the solid performance of our women's accessory businesses. 
We've also made significant progress in our organizational restructuring we began earlier this year, which is designed to reduce expenses and simplify our organization by reducing investments in areas of the business that no longer contribute meaningfully to our overall financial performance. This includes the sale during the quarter of 15 outlet stores to SB Capital, as well as steps we took to reorganize our supply chain network and our initiatives to reduce SG&A expenses throughout the business. It also includes the work we've done to redesign jcpenney from a people perspective to make our work at all levels of the organization more effective and nimble. As part of this work, we initiated a Voluntary Early Retirement Program, or VERP, for associates who have been with the company for more than 20 years and were at least 55 years of age. Mike will provide more detail on the financial impact of this program in a few moments. 
I should note that even though as we focus on these import organizational changes, we have continued to make investments in the attractions to drive our business, including renovating our stores to showcase our new attractions, like MNG by Mango and Call it Spring by ALDO. 
During the quarter, we opened 405 new Call it Spring by ALDO shoe shops for a total of 505 locations. We opened 208 MNG by Mango shops for a total now of 500 stores, and we opened additional 31 Sephora inside jcpenney shops for a year end total of 308 locations. 
We also accelerate our option to buy the Liz Claiborne family brands from Liz Claiborne Inc., so we can capture all the upside from the strong business. And at the same time, we took the opportunity to acquire the Monet fashion jewelry brand from them as well, which we'll launch in jcpenney in the fall of 2012. 
Outside our core jcpenney brand, we continue to build our growth brand businesses, which include our 2 new additional concepts, Gifting Grace and CLAD. Both websites launched last week and our strategic partnerships between jcpenney and the Hearst Corporation. 
Moving on to holiday. We feel very good about our merchandise offering and our gift assortments which are stronger than ever. While it's still a tough consumer environment, we've planned our business accordingly and will be stocked at the right levels. This combined with our compelling marketing campaign and high level of consumer service we offer means jcpenney once again will be positioned to be a key holiday gift destination this Christmas season. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael Dastugue for further information in the quarter. Michael?"
295624,142488450,191864,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2011",2011-11-14,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.11 per share, excluding restructuring and management transition charges. This was in line with our most recent guidance. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to the",796,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.11 per share, excluding restructuring and management transition charges. This was in line with our most recent guidance. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our release, which is available on our website. 
On a GAAP basis, our EPS this quarter is a loss of $0.67 per share, and I will go overall with the overall charges related to that loss in a few moments. Overall, the quarter was more challenging than we planned. While our SG&A was well managed, sales and gross margins came in below our expectations. That said, we are continuing to take actions necessary to streamline and restructure our organization to position us for the next phase of jcpenney's transformation. 
Turning to our Q3 results. Comp store sales declined 1.6% in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comp store sales were up 1.2% over last year. SG&A for the quarter came in better than anticipated, decreasing $84 million year-over-year to $1.24 billion or 31.2% of sales. This was driven primarily by our decrease in marketing spend, lower credit costs and benefits realized from our expense reduction initiatives. Gross margin, however, decreased approximately 160 basis points to 37.4% of sales. 
Our gross margin in the third quarter was impacted by the softer-than-expected selling environment, which resulted in higher promotional activity and more markdowns in the quarter. We do continue to be in a strong financial position and ended the third quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $469 million in line with our expectations, and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. We ended the quarter with our inventory up 2.6%. So now let me take you through some of the charges we recorded this quarter. 
In aggregate, we recorded $265 million of restructuring and management transition charges in the third quarter. As you recall, we announced on our second quarter call that jcpenney offered a Voluntary Early Retirement Program to approximately 8,200 associates. That program closed on October 15, and close to 4,000 jcpenney associates took advantage of this opportunity to retire from the company with an enhanced financial incentive. With 80% of the cash costs associated with the program being borne by our well-funded pension plan, we recorded a pretax charge of $179 million. 
As associates retire over the next year, we estimate this program to have a favorable impact of approximately $50 million on 2012 operating expenses with a slightly higher benefit realized in 2013. 
Next, we recorded one-time charges of approximately $30 million related to the sale of our outlet store business to SB Capital in October. This included expenses related to the disposition of inventory and severance for associates. The remaining charges, which are detailed in our earnings release are related to the process improvements in our home office and supply chain as well as management transition expenses. 
Also please note, we have broken out the restructuring and management transition charges this quarter as a separate line item on our P&L. At the same time, we reclassified 2 previous quarters of restructuring charges to conform with the current presentation. As a result, these charges no longer flow through real estate and other.
Now let me share with you a few of our assumptions for the fourth quarter. We expect comparable store sales to be flat to up slightly in the fourth quarter and gross margins to be down modestly. Our SG&A is expected to be well managed and slightly below last year's levels. As we continue with our restructuring efforts and transitions in leadership, we expect to incur additional charges in the fourth quarter of approximately $104 million. A portion of these charges will have an impact on our effective tax rate. In other words, they are not tax deductible in the fourth quarter, which is -- and therefore, the tax rate will -- is expected to be approximately 48%. As a result, on approximately $220 million average shares outstanding, we expect fourth quarter earnings before restructuring and management transition charges to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, including all of the restructuring and management transition charges, earnings for the fourth quarter are now expected to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.74 per share. Additionally, as we stated in our release this morning, we are in the process of executing a meaningful change in the way we approach pricing. Our guidance for the fourth quarter does not include any financial impacts we may incur as the results of these changes. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike"

While I continue to serve for the next few months as Executive Chairman of jcpenney, this will be the last of 27 quarterly conference calls that I'll be on with you. As Chief Executive of one of America's largest retail companies for the past 7 years and a number of other senior leadership roles in the industry before that, I've had a bird's eye view of the direct impact the economy has had on the consumers' wallets. That's been particularly true here in jcpenney as we serve more than half of America's families every year. At the time I joined jcpenney in 2004, almost exactly 7 years ago this month, the company had just completed its turnaround. 
My #1 priority as CEO was to move jcpenney out of a turnaround phase and then grow and begin the transformation of the brand. I'm particularly proud of the success we've achieved in 3 key areas as we've laid a strong foundation for the future of jcpenney. 
First, the attractions we've built: Sephora inside jcpenney, MNG by Mango, Call it Spring by ALDO, Modern Bride, People Style Watch and the acquisition of Liz Claiborne brand. These great brands have anchored jcpenney's dramatic style transformation and attracted new and younger customers to jcpenney, many of whom who never shopped with us in the past. 
Second, customer service. I have enormous respect for our customers who are working hard every day to provide for their families in spite of great economic challenges. Across our organization, I've seen tremendous dedication to ensure that we're meeting our customers' needs and when we can, making their lives a little easier in the process.
Customers have recognized this commitment and honored us 3 years in a row as the #1 department store for customer service in the American Express/NRF Customers' Choice survey. 
And third, associate engagement. Over last 7 years we've transformed our culture. jcpenney now boasts an associate engagement score at top of the retail industry and the top quartile of all U.S. companies, moving from 67% engagement, which is about average of the Gallup poll just a few short years ago to over 80% in 2011. People work for people, not companies. That's why I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our associates for the tremendous dedication to the work we've done together to bring new and exciting brands and attractions to our customers while making our company a great place to work. 
I'd also like to thank those of you on the call whom I've met, spent time with over the years as you follow jcpenney, including, of course, our shareholders who placed their faith in our company. I personally and we, as a company, have greatly benefited from these interactions. 
As many CEOs will tell you the most important thing they can do in their roles to ensure there's an exceptional successor in place. That's certainly been my priority over the last couple of years. I'm very happy report that we've realized that goal, and we bring someone with Ron Johnson's caliber to jcpenney. 
Ron is one of the most talented retail executives in the United States and a couple years ago, identified as someone who has the right talent and vision and values to take jcpenney to the next level and approached him about joining us. Ron told me at that point, it wasn't the right time. While I respect his position, it didn't stop us from coming back. And I'm delighted to say this time, it was right. 
Working very closely with Ron over the last 4 months has been very exciting and confirmed my belief he's the right person to lead the company forward. I'm enthusiastic about his ideas and his vision for the next phase of jcpenney. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron, who will say a few words."

It is great to have officially begun my duties here at jcpenney. While I'm 2 weeks into my tenure, if truth be told, I've spent considerable time with Mike and the team during the past 4 months preparing for my new role. Mike and I have actually traveled throughout the world together, visiting stores and partners and developing strategy for jcpenney to win. I would like to publicly thank Mike for his incredible support during the transition and for his 7 years of service at jcpenney. Many of the things we will do in the years ahead will be built on the very solid foundation created by Mike and the team during his tenure as CEO of this company. 
Now officially here leading jcpenney, I get more excited every day about the potential for jcpenney. Two weeks ago in November 1, my first day, I addressed all of our associates here in Plano. I told them that I am not here to improve, I am here to transform. 
I shared with them that as America's first store, it is time to assert leadership, reclaim our birthright and become America's favorite store. The energy, excitement and enthusiasm that I received from our associates was overwhelming. It clearly showed me that they are ready to win. 
As Mike said, success begins with people, and jcpenney has great people, people who I know will be able to think differently and work creatively to take the company into the future. With this background, I'm working with our team to rethink, really to reimagine everything we do. I am investing considerable energy and a strategic review of our product, our pricing and our promotional strategies in order to create an exceptional, a new, a better way for people to shop. I am also launching a review of our processes with the goal of simplifying our work, so that everything we do will focus on efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders. And most importantly, I'm spending time getting to know our teams. 
I feel very fortunate that Michael Francis, who I worked with at Target for many years, has come on board as President to help lead the charge. Michael's talents in merchandising and marketing are unmatched, and the chance for him to direct all creative functions at jcpenney will allow us to truly stand out in the marketplace. His energy level is contagious, and the teams are responding immediately to his leadership. And his personal excitement about joining jcpenney demonstrates to me that the dream for jcpenney to become America's favorite store is within our grasp. 
Talent is a fuel of any company but especially so in a people-intensive business like retailing. I'm excited to announce this morning the addition of 2 exceptional leaders who will all also be joining jcpenney. This Wednesday, Dan Walker will join our company as Chief Talent Officer. And on December 5, Mike Kramer will join jcpenney as Chief Operating Officer. 
I worked with Mike and Dan at Apple, and I believe they are 2 of the most talented leaders in the retail industry, and I look forward to you getting to know them. Dan Walker has over 3 decades of experience as the most senior HR executive in a variety of companies, and he's a winner. 
He cut his teeth in the department industry and was promoted to VP of HR at the Lazarus division of Federated at the age of 29. He then led Human Resources at General Mills Specialty Retail division in the early 1980s, which at that time included Eddie Bauer, Talbots and 3 other specialty retail stores. He then joined the GAP in 1986, working closely with Mickey and the GAP's presidents to build the talent engine that fuel the growth of the core GAP brand and help launch new concepts, including GAPKids, babyGap, GAP International and a modernized Banana Republic. The talent supply chain model Dan created helped establish GAP as a world leader in specialty retail in the early 90s. Dan joined Apple as Chief Talent Officer at the same year I joined Apple. He led and built the global human resources team during a period where we saw the launch of the iPod, iTunes, a world-class application division and the Apple retail stores. His ability to identify, develop and organize talent is unmatched, and he is an unbelievably creative and transformational thinker. 
I am thrilled that I'll get the chance to work side by side with Dan again. Mike Kramer is leaving his position as CEO of Kellwood to join the jcpenney team. At Kellwood, Mike oversaw a portfolio of nearly a dozen fashion brands, including Vince, Scotch & Soda and Rebecca Taylor. Prior to that, he was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Abercrombie and Fitch. 
I first worked with Mike when he was Vice President of Finance at Apple and CFO of the retail stores. Mike joined me when we opened our first store and was there through the first 5 formative years of Apple's retail strategy. Mike is an unusual leader in that he combines extraordinary financial acumen with a strategic business perspective. A certified public accountant, he began his career with financial leadership roles at limited and in various divisions at PepsiCo. Since then, he has worked in increasingly strategic roles at Apple, Abercrombie and Kellwood, culminating in his role as the Chief Executive Officer. 
He will bring an extraordinary wealth of experience with winning companies to jcpenney. And he's most experienced with a wholesale company, managing a portfolio of established and emerging brands will be extremely valuable as we reimagine our merchandise portfolio. 
I am convinced that Michael Francis, Mike Kramer and Dan Walker, combined with a talented team I've met and worked with in the past 4 months at jcpenney, will have the courage, the boldness and skill to rethink every aspect of our business as we transform jcpenney to become America's favorite store. I know you have a lot of questions about our plans to do that, and I can't wait to share them with you. However, my approach will be to only talk publicly about our actions at the time we're taking them, not before. 
So with that, we will start shedding light on our strategic approach in late January when we will hold a meeting in New York for the investment community. We will be sending out invitations in the coming weeks with additional details, but please block the morning of January 25 on your calendars. Again, I am thrilled to officially be here now and look forward to meeting all of you in January. 
Since we'll address all long-term strategy questions at the January event, I will turn the call back to Mike and Michael right now to handle the Q&A regarding Q3 performance and Q4 expectations"

It's not just about cost cutting. It's about trying to make it work simpler in our stores, organization, the time management system, these Door to Floor activities, those things have also -- in our past. For the last several months, we've been working on supply chain improvements. As we transitioned out the catalog business, we realized we have a lot of infrastructure. There's more catalog focused instead of dotcom focused. And quite honestly, most of the year has been transitioning away from print media from a catalog perspective and more toward online. That's been much more painful than we anticipated. As Warren Buffett said on CNBC this morning, housing is in a depression, not a recession. Half of our online business and half of our catalog business was home, and that's hurt us. Our dotcom business margins have been hurt by the home business, which we obviously didn't anticipate would linger in this difficult position for so long. So most of our process things have been redesigned in making people's jobs easier and making them more effective."

So much of our margin compression over the last 2 quarters has been getting out of the goods that frankly there was no demand for as the economy ratcheted down closer to a flat line. We feel that we're past the worst of that. In terms of being able to modify the fourth quarter, we were able to pull back on goods as we saw that deceleration. I think as I mentioned just recently -- just previously, our dotcom business was impacted negatively on margins, so I would say if you combine about half of the margin miss was in dotcom, which was the cost of shipping. The home business deterioration and the other half was in markdowns to declare the goods that we felt needed to be in the right stock position coming in the fourth quarter. We're very satisfied with what we own today in terms of inventory as appropriate for the fourth quarter. I would say as to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we recently feel more confident about maintaining the margin flat or slightly down. It's that last year we had a very difficult margin for the fourth quarter, so we think we have upside to what would have been a normal fourth quarter that we're facing. I'm not prepared to talk about the go-forward strategy. As Ron mentioned, there's an opportunity to do that at the end of January. Fortunately, Ron and I had a lot of time together. I feel very confident that on a forward-looking basis that you'll be very satisfied with the strategy."

So we feel that we're on track the first couple weeks in November, we're seeing the kind of increase in AUR that we planned. And we're seeing the corresponding decrease in units that we planned. So I think that we have every reason to believe at this point in time in the fourth quarter that we're on track to achieve our AUR expectations, and that we'll have the units necessary to take care of Christmas. But I think costs come down modestly going into spring, and we're up against much higher cotton costs a year ago. But I don't think it'll ever go back -- maybe ever is a long time, but I don't think it's going to go back soon to the previous cotton prices, I think the social costs and other aspects of sourcing in Asia have taken a step in the wrong direction from a cost point of view."

We identified $50 million of savings we've committed to in this -- for this fiscal year. We're going to achieve that or slightly better. So the market expense while some of our competitors actually increased their marketing during this period, we chose as a transition not to build a bigger hurdle climb in terms of promotion going forward. So we've been optimizing the way we use our marketing dollars, whether it's the amount of preprints, the geographic diversity we have in terms of how customers respond to various types of media. So we don't see any difference in terms of the way we would look at our cost savings in the fourth quarter than what we've seen in the first 3. These cost savings were taken even in the phase of increased costs for additional Sephora locations Mango, Call it Spring and so forth. So we feel that we're -- we've got a good foundation of cost control, and there'll be obviously more opportunities going forward."

It's exceeding our expectations, so we feel very good about that. It bodes well for further Lancome partnership. As to the center core, we honestly believe that we have a huge opportunity in the center core. Most department stores, the highest productivity they have is in the center core because we traditionally, it didn't really have a comprehensive beauty offer. It was a disadvantage for jcpenney, and frankly our apparel business was more productive than our accessories business. That doesn't make a lot of sense. So we believe these huge cross-shopping opportunities between apparel customers that will find the center core more attractive and accessories that are tied together with our apparel purchases. Our People Style Watch initiative has proven to us that customers want to buy the whole outfit. They particularly like the fact when they get confidence by People Style Watch endorsing the things that we've put in the assortments. So what we call center core includes beauty, it includes fine jewelry, it includes women's accessories. In many cases, it includes women's shoes. These businesses are accretive to our overall productivity and are very profitable. So we've set that up in a number of stores at this point. It will take probably 2 to 3 years to get to all stores in terms of the transformation of the center core businesses."

So we're excited for people who were able to take advantage of that. We're also excited about the opportunity that we're seeing a huge influx of people that are willing and want to have a career with us. I think that the nature of our store staffing has been such that we've been able to put better customer service in place by having more people when customers are in the store and modifying the staffing when there's less traffic. So I think the reason our customer service scores keep getting better, so we're actually giving the customer a better experience. So I'm very optimistic about the quality of people we were able to attract. We want people for a career. We don't want them for a week, and I think our turnover has gone from over 100%, which is pretty traditional in retail, down to the 60s.

My experience recently has been that there's a little bit of disconnect between consumer spending and sentiments. Sentiment is at virtually an all-time low. So consumers don't feel necessarily good about their current circumstance, whether it's the cost of food and fuel or the expectation of the job situation or the equity in their house. Having said that, our strongest business is Sephora, which is not a price promotion business. It's not a -- something that people would necessarily see as a need, but it's the excitement in the fashion and newness gives us a lot of encouragement that Liz Claiborne and Mango and Call it Spring and Sephora and things that we've added are stimulating to consumers that are seeing something they like in the store. So I think the main thing has been, when do people feel more confident about kind of general -- their general family budget, and I think that may take some time. The political environment doesn't lend itself at the moment to a lot of confidence because it's in obviously a robust dialogue about the future entitlements and the future of budgets and the next year's election.

So we still have a very large Internet business. I think the difficulty has been that we've earned it by being a very large catalog retailer, and we've had to transform it while the locomotive was going down the track. So it's been very painful in the last several years. It's been a negative factor in our comps because we include that in our comp stores, but I do think it will be accretive going forward. So I think we've aligned the fashion offerings that we have in the store that customers are enjoying at the point of sale. Those are now largely available online, and we have 27 million customers in apparel that buy our apparel in the store that don't shop with us online, they're shopping someplace else. So the logic will be if they start to shop with us online, we have a big upside with our dotcom customer."

We're the only department store that really has a true fast fashion retail offer. When we started doing business with them, they had 12 locations in the United States, largely unknown in the United States but well known in Europe and throughout the rest of the world. Their alternative was to go out and find retail space, which would take them a decade to get to the same presentation, the same representations they've been able to achieve with us in a year. So it's a win-win from our perspective. We give our customer choices, and they get exposure against their key competitors. I would say that the -- it's resonated the best on the coast that typically is where the tourist customer is located and has encountered Mango in other places. I think that this fall, the pricing is now at the MNG level pricing that we knew it needs to be at the beginning when they had a few stores that reflected more to Mango pricing, which is somewhat higher. I think they were quite satisfied that they have the wherewithal in terms of design expertise and the supply chain and response time to give our customers newness and fashion on a regular basis, so it's been very well received. I think we're attracting customers that would not have shopped with us, and they're the most shop -- cross-shopping with Sephora, Call it Spring and Mango. So it tells us that the younger 18- to 40-year-old age range is the customer that Mango is attracting."

And I think that in the long run, it will have been time well spent and effort rewarded by what can be built upon the foundation."

So an extra visit means an enormous amount to get about between 4 and 6 visits depending where there's a mall store or not mall store. So our existing customers are our best place to look for additional volume. Half of the families in America is a very large footprint, so I think that's probably the biggest opportunity. Having said that, the new things we've added have attracted the young customers. We know that there's over 0.25 million new customers came that never bought in jcpenney before that bought Liz Claiborne, so we know those are new customers. And I think we can trace the other attractions of having a similar expectation. So I don't think there's a lot of risk in terms of the changes being made. The risk is clearly not the downside. I think the opportunity is in the upside, people finding a broader range of merchandise, more excitement, price merchandise and a customer experience that we think has been certainly recognized by American Express. And in our survey, they're going to get a great customer service when they buy that merchandise. So we're confident that the underrepresented market, the 18- to 35-year old is starting to discover jcpenney, and we'll speak more about it."

Is there an ongoing assessment to potentially more store closings?

A number of relocations occurred in the last 3 or 4 years as we moved out of locations that had various difficulties, whether it's the mall or a particular store. So I really don't see an acceleration of closings. I think it's a question of analysis of how they're performing, tests done every year. I think, if anything, the well-financed mall developers are starting to reinvest in their properties again. And we stand to benefit from that to the extent they bring new anchors in, new ideas in, like an Apple store, for example, an Apple store is the most productive thing that can happen to a mall. It attracts a broad range of customers, all of those customers. All those customers are opportunities for us. So I think our biggest opportunity frankly is the jcpenney brand. So to the extent we elevate the brand and get people to discover who we are that we have style, we have quality, we have a very compelling price, that should appeal to a much broader audience."
