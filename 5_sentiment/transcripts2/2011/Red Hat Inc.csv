We continue to monitor the situation and are collaborating with our local team on how to best support relief efforts. 
Now, I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a record year for Red Hat and the above was highlighted by revenue and profitability that were well above our guidance. Here, just a few of our financial highlights. Record billings of $318 million for the quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Q4 revenue was up 25% year-over-year and every quarter this year, we grew faster than 20% on a year-over-year basis. 110 basis point improvement in our operating margin for fiscal 2011, even while we continued to invest aggressively in our key growth initiatives, mainly through hiring in sales and engineering. Finally, we delivered record operating cash flow for the quarter and for the fiscal year. I want to thank our global team of Red Hat Associates for their strong execution that drove these outstanding results. With record bookings and billings in the fourth quarter, we are on a clear path to becoming the first pure play open source company to achieve $1 billion in revenue during our next fiscal year, a milestone achievement for Red Hat and the open source community. 
Red Hat's growth indicates that we are continuing to gain market share. Our growth reflects strong demand from customers who are modernizing their data centers and preparing their infrastructure for cloud computing. The competence of portfolio that Red Hat has developed with platform, virtualization and middleware products provides enterprise customers with a foundation to deploy the next-generation IT infrastructure. Red Hat is recognized as one of the leading providers of value among all IT vendors and we believe that we are well-positioned to again deliver double-digit organic growth in fiscal 2012. 
Let me now share a few of the business highlights from Q4. First, our platform offerings had a tremendous quarter, with record billings and the highest Q4 growth rate in three years. We experienced broad demand across our top verticals, as well as from new mainstream customers. From a competitive perspective, we won many deals this quarter against other operating systems, including UNIX, Windows, clones and other Linux brands. An interesting example was a win with the Qatar Stock Exchange, where we replaced Windows with RHEL. The customer cited better security and reliability as two of the main considerations. This adds another exchange to the list of the world's equity trading platforms that use Linux. 
Our middleware solutions also had a strong quarter as companies reassessed their traditional vendors and are increasingly choosing Red Hat's higher value alternatives. In December, IBC published a commission white paper surveying a number of large U.S. enterprises that switched to JBoss. On average, the companies in the study reduced time and developer hours to develop custom applications. They reduced their infrastructure and management costs and were able to develop 50% more applications per year. Over a three-year period, these companies generated an ROI of over 500% and paid back their initial investments in less than six months. 
In the cloud space, we grew the number of customers using our RHEV product to over 500. We announced the availability of RHEL on Fujitsu's on-demand virtual system service. And we closed a renewal this quarter with a large cloud provider that was a 300% increase from their prior commitment. 
Moving onto renewals, for the quarter, we renewed 24 of the top 25 deals scheduled to renew this quarter and those that renewed did so at over 130% of the prior year's value. For the year, we were at 99 out of 100, with an upsell of well over 120% of the prior-year value. This clearly demonstrates the value our largest customers see in their relationship with Red Hat. 
Before turning the call over to Charlie, let me summarize some of the results from our key growth initiatives. As a reminder, these are multiyear initiatives designed to position Red Hat for the future. First, we continue to expand our marketing and Commercial capabilities to further drive adoption outside of our core verticals, in industries such as logistics, healthcare, transportation, retail and energy. And for the second year in a row, we experienced over 150% growth within these mainstreams verticals and our quarterly top 30 deals as compared to last year. Second, we are pleased with the results of our free to pay conversion program this year. In the fourth quarter, we had two six-figure deals that included a free to pay component, along with several others that were closed during the year. Our third strategic initiative is to further enhance our wealth to market distribution model and I'm pleased to announce that for the full-year FY '11, we reached our goal of a 60/40 split between channel and direct sales. Our fourth and final initiative is to execute on our technology roadmap to enable us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position. This year, we launched several major releases of our core products. In addition to our flagship Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 operating system, we launched the JBoss enterprise application server 5.1. JBoss Enterprise 5.1, JBoss Portal 5.0, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2 and our Cloud Foundations strategy. In May, we will hold our Red Hat Summit in JBoss World in Boston where we will be updating our users on new developments in our product roadmap. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our fiscal 2011 results. Red Hat continues to gain mind share and wallet share. I believe that Red Hat is well positioned as we are strategically at the center of several major technology trends in the data center. Once again, I want to thank each of our Red Hat Associates around the globe for their hard work that delivered these great results. I'm confident that they will remain focused on delivering value for our customers and stakeholders in the year ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."

In the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand across all geographies and products and solid execution as well. Our report today reflects listed quarterly billings in excess of $300 million, annual billings in excess of $1 billion and deferred revenue above $750 million. As Jim discussed, we believe that we are clearly on a path to becoming the first share play open source company to achieve $1 billion in revenue. In percentage terms, quarterly billings grew more than 30%, total revenue grew 25%, operating income grew over 30% and operating cash flow grew over 20%, all compared to last year's strong fourth quarter results. In addition to growing throughout the economic recession, our fiscal 2011 performance shows that Red Hat's value proposition is equally compelling for our customers as the economic climate and IT spending environment improve. Our results also indicate that we continue to gain market share. Importantly, we accomplished these quarterly and annual results while continuing to invest for the future. For example, during fiscal 2011, we added substantially to our engineering support and sales staff, including overlay teams to drive further adoption of our middleware, virtualization and cloud computing solutions. In total, we ended the year with over 3,750 employees. We also invested in our partner program to expand our international reach. We acquired Makara to build upon our cloud foundation strategy with platform as a service technology and we delivered major releases of our product portfolio. We believe these investments will position Red Hat for continued growth in fiscal 2012 and beyond, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Let's discuss the financial results. We're pleased to report another record quarter for both bookings and billings. Billings growth accelerated each quarter from our first quarter as we added new customers and expanded our strategic position in data centers around the globe. This acceleration led to Q4 billings growth that was the fastest in 12 quarters. Let me share with you a few of the statistics from the top 30 deals in the quarter. We had for the first time ever, all of the top 30 deals were greater than $1 million, 67% higher than the previous record. One deal was over $5 million and 11 or 37% of the top 30 deals included a middleware component and five of those were exclusively middleware. We experienced solid demand across all of our core verticals, as well as more mainstream customers, such as healthcare and energy. As I've done on other year end calls, I'll add a few additional statistics about bookings. To be clear, some of the prior years, we will not be updating milestone bookings achievements in reporting bookings statistics on a quarterly basis. We had strong double-digit bookings growth every quarter this year, which led to a milestone year of total bookings over $1 billion, up over 20% year-over-year. The average contract duration for the year was very close to last year at just under 21 months. But interestingly, we have seen an increase in customer willingness to pay for long-term deals upfront, including long-term deals through channel partners. This change is reflected in the renewed growth in long-term deferred revenue after almost two years with little change. Our off balance sheet backlog, that is the portion of customer contract to be built in the future, behaved in similar fashion to last year. We ended the year with backlog in excess of $190 million, of which approximately $120 million is expected to be built in fiscal year '12. As a refresher, bookings that are billed increased deferred revenue and bookings that are not billed increased off balance sheet backlog. It should be apparent that the increase in long-term deferred revenue limits growth of off balance sheet backlog. 
Our billings proxy for Q4 set a new record of $318 million, up 31% year-over-year and the highest growth in three years. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue shown on the cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rates on deferred revenue. 
Moving on to bookings by channel and geography, our Q4 bookings mix was 59% from the channel and 41% from direct sales versus a very similar 60/40 split in the Q3 and for the year. This split reflects the investment we've made in our channel business over the last few years. Our geographic split remains little changed, with 57% in the Americas, 27% from EMEA and 16% from APAC, essentially in line with Q3's split, which was 56%, 28% and 16% respectively. For the year, we saw strong 20% plus growth in every region. 
Now, let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $245 million, up 25% from the prior year and well above the high end of our guidance, which was $236 million. Strong demand, better linearity and sales execution overall, including better than expected up selling and cross-selling were important factors. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $209 million, up 24% from the prior year. Subscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 86% of total revenue in Q4. Training and Services revenue was $35 million, up 33% from the year-ago quarter and down over $1 million sequentially as a result of holiday downtime in customer sites around the globe. This performance is slightly better than our guidance from the third quarter earnings call. 
Now, I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation expense, amortization expense and for fiscal year '10, a litigation settlement. Overall gross margin was 84.2% for Q4, in line sequentially and down from the prior year due to higher services in the mix of our services margins overall. Subscription gross margin remained consistent with last year and last quarter at 93.8%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $145 million, up 3% sequentially, up 19% from the prior year. In Q4, we continued to hire aggressively for sales, engineering and support and we expanded our marketing programs. Q4 non-GAAP operating income increased 31% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 24.9%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. Net interest income was less than $2 million, down approximately $500,000 from the prior year, principally due to lower interest rates. Other income, which is primarily net investment gains and losses and foreign exchange was a loss of approximately $1 million, down $1 million from Q3 and down $5 million from Q4 of last year. Our annual effective tax rate is 30% for both GAAP non-GAAP results, lower than the 35% which we have been estimating in earlier quarters. As a consequence, the Q4 tax rate is unusually low at 17% in order to adjust to this annual rate. The lower rate includes the benefit of approximately $0.02 a share from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D Tax Credit, which I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. And as well as other changes to our state and foreign taxes, which are likely to be more permanent. I'll discuss this further when I get to guidance. 
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is $0.26, up 37% compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share last year of $0.19 in the fourth quarter. 
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. We repurchased approximately $11 million of Red Hat common stock in Q4, which brings total purchases to $90 million for the fiscal year. We have approximately $220 million of authorization remaining on our repurchase plan. We are pleased with the consistency of our days sales outstanding, which we believe is a function of the satisfaction level of our customers. DSO was 50 days for Q4 versus 56 days last year. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue. This improvement in DSO was helped by good sales linearity in the quarter. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $772 million, an increase of $126 million or 20% over the prior year end. This increase was $92 million in current deferred revenue and $34 million in long-term deferred revenue. As a follow-up to my comments about bookings and customers' willingness to pay up front, please note that long-term deferred revenue grew 21% for fiscal year '11 compared to virtually no growth last year. Excluding foreign currency rate changes, the year-over-year change in deferred revenue as shown on the cash flow statement was $113 million, that's up 36%. 
Moving to the statement of cash flows, we produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $95 million and full year operating cash flow of $291 million, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. 
Now, to briefly recap and summarize highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $909 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of guidance. Subscription revenue grew to $773 million, an increase of 21% while services grew 24%, well above the historic services revenue growth rate of 5% to 10%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 27% and non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 110 basis points to 24.8%. We ramped hiring and investments for growth all year long as we said we would. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 and exceeded the high end of guidance of $0.74, which I provided at the start of the year. This week of $0.09 is roughly half of operating income and half from a better tax situation. Overall, it was a great year. Now, I want to shift to fiscal 2012 guidance. Since foreign exchange rates are still somewhat volatile, let me say that this guidance is based on yesterday's euro and yen rates. I'm not trying to forecast those foreign exchange rates. I'm simply pegging guidance at that point. While revenue may increase or decrease if foreign exchange rates change, please keep in mind that changes in operating income as a result of currency swings are generally much smaller. 
As for guidance, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,070,000,000 for fiscal 2012, representing an annual growth rate of up to 18% in U.S. dollars. This growth rate assumes that subscriptions will grow faster than services revenue and that service revenue growth will slow. We believe that we can again expand our full-year non-GAAP operating margin and we are targeting approximately 25.7% while also investing in future growth opportunities. I'm estimating full year net interest income of approximately $6 million or $1.5 million a quarter, which is a very modest reduction from fiscal year 2011. However, please note that I'm not expecting any net investment gains and other income. We have good news on the tax front. Many of the changes in the fiscal year '11 tax rate are likely to positively impact us for a number of years. As a result, the estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 is 31%, 400 basis points lower than most models. We will continue to report non-GAAP net income and EPS using our expected non-GAAP tax rate. There is additional good news on the cash tax front. That is, we still expect our cash tax rate to be about 5% throughout fiscal year 2012, principally as a result of stock compensation deductions. We have large tax credits carryforward but due to the amount of stock compensation deductions available, few of these tax credits are likely to be utilized in fiscal year '12, but rather will be carried forward to be used in future years. Assuming a 31% tax rate, at approximately 200 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.94 to $0.96 a share. As you work through your models, keep in mind the differences in other income and taxes between fiscal year '11 and fiscal year '12. On a GAAP basis, we estimate quarterly stock compensation expense of approximately $20 million and quarterly amortization expense of approximately $5 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year of between $330 million to $340 million. I expect additional cash flow of $35 million to $40 million, not included in GAAP operating cash flow, which is related to tax savings from excess tax benefits from stock compensation. This will be recorded in our cash from financing activities line as it has been for the past few years. CapEx is still expected to be relatively modest at less than 5% of revenue in the $40 million or $50 million range. 
Finally, looking at Q1, we offer the following guidance. Revenue is estimated to be between $252 million and $255 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is estimated to be approximately 24.5% to 24.9%, reflecting higher sales and marketing costs for new hires and costs related to the Red Hat Summit to be held in early May. Using my earlier estimates of quarterly interest income of $1.5 million and a 31% tax rate, non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.21 to $0.22. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon large payments or receipts. Following up on Jim's comments about Japan, let me add that all of our associates are safe and our offices in Tokyo and Osaka are undamaged and fully operational. Customer support for Japan has continued uninterrupted as a result of tremendous work by our associates in Japan and elsewhere. However, many Japanese businesses have experienced problems and others are still assessing the impact. Because of our subscription model, I expect no significant effect on Q1 revenue but it is probable that we may have some delay in Q1 Japanese billings, possibly up to $5 million. We will assess future quarters as more information becomes known. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our results for the fiscal year 2011 and we believe that we're well-positioned to gain market share and grow. We are continuing to invest in areas, such as virtualization, cloud computing and middleware but we're also prudently managing costs. We are optimistic about this fiscal year and the forward-looking pipeline continues to look strong.

Before I begin, I would like to express my deepest sympathies to the people of Japan and our Red Hat Associates and their families. We continue to monitor the situation and are collaborating with our local team on how to best support relief efforts. 
Now, I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a record year for Red Hat and above was highlighted by revenue and profitability that were well above our guidance. Here are just a few of our financial highlights. Record billings of $318 million for the quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Q4 revenue was up 25% year-over-year and every quarter this year, we grew faster than 20% on a year-over-year basis. 110 basis point improvement in our operating margin for fiscal 2011, even while we continue to invest aggressively in our key growth initiatives, mainly through hiring in sales and engineering. Finally, we delivered record operating cash flow for the quarter and for the fiscal year. 
I want to thank our global team of Red Hat Associates for their strong execution that drove these outstanding results. With record bookings and billings in the fourth quarter, we are on a clear path to becoming the first pure play open source company to achieve $1 billion in revenue during our next fiscal year, a milestone achievement for Red Hat and the open source community. 
Red Hat's growth indicates that we are continuing to gain market share. Our growth reflects strong demand from customers who are modernizing their data centers and preparing their infrastructure for cloud computing. The comprehensive portfolio that Red Hat has developed with platform, virtualization and middleware products provides enterprise customers with a foundation to deploy the next-generation IT infrastructure. Red Hat is recognized as one of the leading providers of value among all IT vendors and we believe that we are well-positioned to again deliver double-digit organic growth in fiscal 2012. 
Let me now share a few of the business highlights from Q4. First, our platform offerings had a tremendous quarter, with record billings and the highest Q4 growth rate in three years. We experienced broad demand across our top verticals, as well as from new mainstream customers. From a competitive perspective, we won many deals this quarter against other operating systems, including UNIX, Windows, clones and other Linux brands. An interesting example was a win with the Qatar Stock Exchange, where we replaced Windows with RHEL. The customer cited better security and reliability as two of the main considerations. This adds another exchange to the list of the world's equity trading platforms that use Linux. 
Our middleware solutions also had a strong quarter as companies reassessed their traditional vendors and are increasingly choosing Red Hat's higher value alternatives. In December, IDC published a commission white paper surveying a number of large U.S. enterprises that switched to JBoss. On average, the companies in the study reduced time and developer hours to develop custom applications. They reduced their infrastructure and management costs and were able to develop 50% more applications per year. Over a three-year period, these companies generated an ROI of over 500% and paid back their initial investments in less than six months. 
In the cloud space, we grew the number of customers using our RHEV product to over 500. We announced the availability of RHEL on Fujitsu's On-Demand Virtual System Service. And we closed a renewal this quarter with a large cloud provider that was a 300% increase from their prior commitment. 
Moving onto renewals. For the quarter, we renewed 24 of the top 25 deals scheduled to renew this quarter and those that renewed did so at over 130% of the prior year's value. For the year, we were 99 out of 100, with an upsell of well over 120% of the prior-year value. This clearly demonstrates the value our largest customers see in relationship with Red Hat. 
Before turning the call over to Charlie, let me summarize some of the results from our key growth initiatives. As a reminder, these are multiyear initiatives designed to position Red Hat for the future. First, we continue to expand our marketing and Commercial capabilities to further drive adoption outside of our core verticals, in industries such as logistics, healthcare, transportation, retail and energy. And for the second year in a row, we experienced over 150% growth within these mainstreams verticals and our quarterly top 30 deals as compared to last year. Second, we are pleased with the results of our free-to-paid conversion program this year. 
In the fourth quarter, we had two six-figure deals that included a free to pay component, along with several others that were closed during the year. Our third strategic initiative is to further enhance our routes-to-market distribution model. And I'm pleased to announce that for the full-year FY '11, we reached our goal of a 60/40 split between channel and direct sales. Our fourth and final initiative is to execute on our technology roadmap to enable us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position. This year, we launched several major releases of our core products. In addition to our flagship, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 operating system, we launched the JBoss Enterprise application server 5.1. JBoss Enterprise SOA Suite 5.1, JBoss Portal 5.0, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2 and our Cloud Foundations strategy. In May, we will hold our Red Hat Summit in JBoss World in Boston where we will be updating our users on new developments in our product roadmap. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our fiscal 2011 results. Red Hat continues to gain mind share and wallet share. I believe that Red Hat is well positioned as we are strategically at the center of several major technology trends in the data center. Once again, I want to thank each of our Red Hat Associates around the globe for their hard work that delivered these great results. I'm confident that they will remain focused on delivering value for our customers and stakeholders in the year ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."

In the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand across all geographies and products and solid execution as well. Our report today reflects this with quarterly billings in excess of $300 million, annual billings in excess of $1 billion and deferred revenue of over $750 million. As Jim discussed, we believe that we are clearly on a path to becoming the first, pure-play open source company to achieve $1 billion on revenue. In percentage terms, quarterly billings grew more than 30%, total revenue grew 25%, operating income grew over 30% and operating cash flow grew over 20%, all compared to last year's strong fourth quarter results. 
In addition to growing throughout the economic recession, our fiscal 2011 performance shows that Red Hat's value proposition is equally compelling for our customers as the economic climate and IT spending environment improve. Our results also indicate that we continue to gain market share. Importantly, we accomplished these quarterly and annual results while continuing to invest for the future. For example, during fiscal 2011, we added substantially to our engineering support and sales staff, including overlay teams to drive further adoption of our middleware, virtualization and cloud computing solutions. 
In total, we ended the year with over 3,750 employees. We also invested in our partner program to expand our international reach. We acquired Makara to build upon our cloud foundation strategy with platform as a service technology and we delivered major releases of our product portfolio. We believe these investments will position Red Hat for continued growth in fiscal 2012 and beyond, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Let's discuss the financial results. We're pleased to report another record quarter for both bookings and billings. Billings growth accelerated each quarter from our first quarter, as we added new customers and expanded our strategic position in data centers around the globe. This acceleration led to Q4 billings growth that was the fastest in 12 quarters. Let me share with you a few of the statistics from the top 30 deals in the quarter. 
We had for the first time ever, all of the top 30 deals were greater than $1 million, 67% higher than the previous record. One deal is over $5 million and 11 or 37% of the top 30 deals included a middleware component and five of those were exclusively middleware. We experienced solid demand across all of our core verticals, as well as more mainstream customers such as healthcare and energy. As I've done on other year end calls, I'll add a few additional statistics about bookings. 
To be clear, some of the prior years, we will not be updating milestone bookings achievements or reporting booking statistics on a quarterly basis. We had strong double-digit bookings growth every quarter this year, which led to a milestone year of total bookings over $1 billion, up over 20% year-over-year. The average contract duration for the year was very close to last year's, just under 21 months. But interestingly, we have seen an increase in customer willingness to pay for long-term deals upfront, including long-term deals through channel partners. This change is reflected in the renewed growth and long-term deferred revenue after almost two years with little change. Our off balance sheet backlog, that is the portion of customer contract to be built in the future, behaved in similar fashion to last year. We ended the year with backlog in excess of $190 million, of which approximately $120 million is expected to be built in fiscal year '12. As a refresher, bookings that are billed increased deferred revenue and bookings that are not billed increased off balance sheet backlog. It should be apparent that the increase in long-term deferred revenue limits growth of off balance sheet backlog. 
Our billings proxy for Q4 set a new record at $318 million, up 31% year-over-year and the highest growth in three years. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue shown on the cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rates on deferred revenue. 
Moving on to bookings by channel and geography, our Q4 bookings mix was 59% from the channel and 41% from direct sales versus a very similar 60/40 split in Q3 and for the year. This split reflects the investment we've made in our channel business over the last few years. Our geographic split remains little change, with 57% from the Americas, 27% from EMEA and 16% from APAC, essentially in line with Q3's split, which was 56%, 28% and 16% respectively. For the year, we saw strong 20% plus growth in every region. 
Now, let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $245 million, up 25% from the prior year and well above the high end of our guidance, which was $236 million. Strong demand, better linearity and sales execution overall, including better-than-expected up selling and cross-selling were important factors. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $209 million, up 24% from the prior year. Subscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 86% of total revenue in Q4. Training and Services revenue was $35 million, up 33% from the year-ago quarter and down over $1 million sequentially as a result of holiday downtime in customer sites around the globe. This performance is slightly better than our guidance from the third quarter earnings call. 
Now, I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation expense, amortization expense and for fiscal year '10, a litigation settlement. Overall gross margin was 84.2% for Q4, in line sequentially and down from the prior year due to higher services in the mix of lower services margins overall. Subscription gross margin remained consistent with last year and last quarter at 93.8%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $145 million, up 3% sequentially, and up 19% from the prior year. In Q4, we continued to hire aggressively for sales, engineering and support and we've expanded our marketing programs. 
Q4 non-GAAP operating income increased 31% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 24.9%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. Net interest income was less than $2 million, down approximately $500,000 from the prior year, principally due to lower interest rates. Other income, which is primarily net investment gains and losses and foreign exchange was a loss of approximately $1 million, down $1 million from Q3 and down $5 million from Q4 of last year. Our annual effective tax rate is 30% for both GAAP non-GAAP results, rather than the 35%, which we have been estimating in earlier quarters. As a consequence, the Q4 tax rate is unusually low at 17% in order to adjust to this annual rate. The lower rate includes the benefit of approximately $0.02 a share from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D Tax Credit, which I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. And as well as other changes to our state and foreign taxes, which are likely to be more permanent. I'll discuss this further when I get to guidance. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is $0.26, up 37% compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share last year of $0.19 in the fourth quarter. 
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. We repurchased approximately $11 million of Red Hat common stock in Q4, which brings total purchases to $90 million for the fiscal year. We have approximately $220 million of authorization remaining on our repurchase plan. We are pleased with the consistency of our days sales outstanding, which we believe is a function of the satisfaction level of our customers. DSO was 50 days for Q4 versus 56 days last year. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue. This improvement in DSO was helped by good sales linearity in the quarter. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $772 million, an increase of $126 million or 20% over the prior year end. This increase was $92 million in current deferred revenue and $34 million in long-term deferred revenue. As a follow-up to my comments about bookings and customers' willingness to pay up front, please note that long-term deferred revenue grew 21% for fiscal year '11 compared to virtually no growth last year. Excluding foreign currency rate changes, the year-over-year change in deferred revenue as shown on the cash flow statement was $113 million, that's up 36%. 
Moving to the statement of cash flows, we produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $95 million and full year operating cash flow of $291 million, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. 
Now, to briefly recap and summarize highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $909 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of guidance. Subscription revenue grew to $773 million, an increase of 21%, while services grew 24%, well above the historic services revenue growth rate of 5% to 10%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 27% and non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 110 basis points to 24.8%. We ramped hiring and investments for growth all year long as we said we would. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 and exceeded the high end of guidance of $0.74, which I provided at the start of the year. This beat of $0.09 is roughly half of the operating income and half from a better tax situation. Overall, it was a great year. Now, I want to shift to fiscal 2012 guidance. Since foreign exchange rates are still somewhat volatile, let me say that this guidance is based upon yesterday's euro and yen rates. I'm not trying to forecast those foreign exchange rates, I'm simply pegging guidance at that point. While revenue may increase or decrease if foreign exchange rates change, please keep in mind that changes in operating income as a result of currency swings are generally much smaller. 
As for guidance, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,070,000,000 for fiscal 2012, representing an annual growth rate of up to 18% in U.S. dollars. This growth rate assumes that subscriptions will grow faster than services revenue and that service revenue growth will slow. We believe that we can again expand our full-year non-GAAP operating margin and we are targeting approximately 25.7%, while also investing in future growth opportunities. I'm estimating full year net interest income of approximately $6 million or $1.5 million a quarter, which is a very modest reduction from fiscal year 2011. However, please note that I'm not expecting any net investment gains and other income. We have good news on the tax front. Many of the changes in the fiscal year '11 tax rate are likely to positively impact us for a number of years. As a result, the estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 is 31%, 400 basis points lower than most models. 
We will continue to report non-GAAP net income and EPS using our expected GAAP tax rate. There is additional good news on the cash tax front. That is, we still expect our cash tax rate to be about 5% throughout fiscal year 2012, principally as a result of stock compensation deductions. We have large tax credits carryforward but due to the amount of stock compensation deductions available, few of these tax credits are likely to be utilized in fiscal year '12, but rather will be carried forward to be used in future years. Assuming a 31% tax rate and approximately 200 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.94 to $0.96 a share. 
As you work through your models, keep in mind the differences in other income and taxes between fiscal year '11 and fiscal year '12. On a GAAP basis, we estimate quarterly stock compensation expense of approximately $20 million and quarterly amortization expense of approximately $5 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year of between $330 million to $340 million. I expect additional cash flow of $35 million to $40 million, not included in GAAP operating cash flow, which is related to tax savings from excess tax benefits from stock compensation. This will be recorded in our cash from financing activities line as it has been for the past few years. CapEx is still expected to be relatively modest at less than 5% of revenue in the $40 million or $50 million range. 
Finally, looking at Q1, we offer the following guidance. Revenue is estimated to be between $252 million and $255 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is estimated to be approximately 24.5% to 24.9%, reflecting higher sales and marketing costs from new hires and costs related to the Red Hat Summit to be held in early May. Using my earlier estimates of quarterly interest income of $1.5 million and a 31% tax rate, non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.21 to $0.22. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon large payments or receipts. Following up on Jim's comments about Japan, let me add that all of our associates are safe and our offices in Tokyo and Osaka are undamaged and fully operational. Customer support for Japan has continued uninterrupted as a result of tremendous work by our associates in Japan and elsewhere. However, many Japanese businesses have experienced problems and others are still assessing the impact. Because of our subscription model, I expect no significant effect on Q1 revenue, but it is probable that we may have some delay in Q1 Japanese billings, possibly up to $5 million. We will assess future quarters as more information becomes known. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our results for the fiscal year 2011 and we believe that we're well-positioned to gain market share and grow. We are continuing to invest in areas, such as virtualization, cloud computing and middleware but we're also prudently managing costs. We are optimistic about this fiscal year and the forward-looking pipeline continues to look strong.

Obviously, for the long term, having our customers kind of working with us across the range of their infrastructure. So their hypervisor as well, we believe, allows us to add significantly more value to the infrastructure. It's a significantly lower cost alternative, it's a higher-performance alternative. And overall, our business is about taking share in the data center. And the higher value of Red Hat infrastructure can be, the more value we add and the more overall our infrastructure grows. And so we believe that a Red Hat Virtualization solution, which is significantly higher value than it's alternative, along with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, is a more powerful model that drives the customer to see the greater value and it still allows us to grow more quickly.

Now, I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a record year for Red Hat and above was highlighted by revenue and profitability that were well above our guidance. Here are just a few of our financial highlights. Record billings of $318 million for the quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Q4 revenue was up 25% year-over-year and every quarter this year, we grew faster than 20% on a year-over-year basis. 110 basis point improvement in our operating margin for fiscal 2011, even while we continue to invest aggressively in our key growth initiatives, mainly through hiring in sales and engineering. Finally, we delivered record operating cash flow for the quarter and for the fiscal year. 
I want to thank our global team of Red Hat Associates for their strong execution that drove these outstanding results. With record bookings and billings in the fourth quarter, we are on a clear path to becoming the first pure play open source company to achieve $1 billion in revenue during our next fiscal year, a milestone achievement for Red Hat and the open source community. 
Red Hat's growth indicates that we are continuing to gain market share. Our growth reflects strong demand from customers who are modernizing their data centers and preparing their infrastructure for cloud computing. The comprehensive portfolio that Red Hat has developed with platform, virtualization and middleware products provides enterprise customers with a foundation to deploy the next-generation IT infrastructure. Red Hat is recognized as one of the leading providers of value among all IT vendors and we believe that we are well-positioned to again deliver double-digit organic growth in fiscal 2012. 
Let me now share a few of the business highlights from Q4. First, our platform offerings had a tremendous quarter, with record billings and the highest Q4 growth rate in three years. We experienced broad demand across our top verticals, as well as from new mainstream customers. From a competitive perspective, we won many deals this quarter against other operating systems, including UNIX, Windows, clones and other Linux brands. An interesting example was a win with the Qatar Stock Exchange, where we replaced Windows with RHEL. The customer cited better security and reliability as two of the main considerations. This adds another exchange to the list of the world's equity trading platforms that use Linux. 
Our middleware solutions also had a strong quarter as companies reassessed their traditional vendors and are increasingly choosing Red Hat's higher value alternatives. In December, IDC published a commission white paper surveying a number of large U.S. enterprises that switched to JBoss. On average, the companies in the study reduced time and developer hours to develop custom applications. They reduced their infrastructure and management costs and were able to develop 50% more applications per year. Over a three-year period, these companies generated an ROI of over 500% and paid back their initial investments in less than six months. 
In the cloud space, we grew the number of customers using our RHEV product to over 500. We announced the availability of RHEL on Fujitsu's On-Demand Virtual System Service. And we closed a renewal this quarter with a large cloud provider that was a 300% increase from their prior commitment. 
Moving onto renewals. For the quarter, we renewed 24 of the top 25 deals scheduled to renew this quarter, and those that renewed did so at over 130% of the prior year's value. For the year, we were 99 out of 100, with an upsell of well over 120% of the prior-year value. This clearly demonstrates the value our largest customers see in relationship with Red Hat. 
Before turning the call over to Charlie, let me summarize some of the results from our key growth initiatives. As a reminder, these are multiyear initiatives designed to position Red Hat for the future. First, we continue to expand our marketing and commercial capabilities to further drive adoption outside of our core verticals, in industries such as logistics, healthcare, transportation, retail and energy. And for the second year in a row, we experienced over 150% growth within these mainstreams verticals and our quarterly top 30 deals as compared to last year. Second, we are pleased with the results of our free-to-paid conversion program this year. 
In the fourth quarter, we had two six-figure deals that included a free to pay component, along with several others that were closed during the year. Our third strategic initiative is to further enhance our routes-to-market distribution model. And I'm pleased to announce that for the full-year FY '11, we reached our goal of a 60/40 split between channel and direct sales. Our fourth and final initiative is to execute on our technology roadmap to enable us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position. This year, we launched several major releases of our core products. In addition to our flagship, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 operating system, we launched the JBoss Enterprise application server 5.1. JBoss Enterprise SOA Suite 5.1, JBoss Portal 5.0, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2 and our Cloud Foundations strategy. In May, we will hold our Red Hat Summit in JBoss World in Boston where we will be updating our users on new developments in our product roadmap. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our fiscal 2011 results. Red Hat continues to gain mind share and wallet share. I believe that Red Hat is well positioned as we are strategically at the center of several major technology trends in the data center. Once again, I want to thank each of our Red Hat Associates around the globe for their hard work that delivered these great results. I'm confident that they will remain focused on delivering value for our customers and stakeholders in the year ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."

In the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand across all geographies and products and solid execution as well. Our report today reflects this with quarterly billings in excess of $300 million, annual billings in excess of $1 billion and",2438,"Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand across all geographies and products and solid execution as well. Our report today reflects this with quarterly billings in excess of $300 million, annual billings in excess of $1 billion and deferred revenue of over $750 million. As Jim discussed, we believe that we are clearly on a path to becoming the first, pure-play open source company to achieve $1 billion on revenue. In percentage terms, quarterly billings grew more than 30%, total revenue grew 25%, operating income grew over 30% and operating cash flow grew over 20%, all compared to last year's strong fourth quarter results. 
In addition to growing throughout the economic recession, our fiscal 2011 performance shows that Red Hat's value proposition is equally compelling for our customers as the economic climate and IT spending environment improve. Our results also indicate that we continue to gain market share. Importantly, we accomplished these quarterly and annual results while continuing to invest for the future. For example, during fiscal 2011, we added substantially to our engineering support and sales staff, including overlay teams to drive further adoption of our middleware, virtualization and cloud computing solutions. 
In total, we ended the year with over 3,750 employees. We also invested in our partner program to expand our international reach. We acquired Makara to build upon our cloud foundation strategy with platform as a service technology and we delivered major releases of our product portfolio. We believe these investments will position Red Hat for continued growth in fiscal 2012 and beyond, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Let's discuss the financial results. We're pleased to report another record quarter for both bookings and billings. Billings growth accelerated each quarter from our first quarter, as we added new customers and expanded our strategic position in data centers around the globe. This acceleration led to Q4 billings growth that was the fastest in 12 quarters. Let me share with you a few of the statistics from the top 30 deals in the quarter. 
We had for the first time ever, all of the top 30 deals were greater than $1 million, 67% higher than the previous record. One deal is over $5 million and 11 or 37% of the top 30 deals included the middleware component and five of those were exclusively middleware. We experienced solid demand across all of our core verticals, as well as more mainstream customers such as healthcare and energy. As I've done on other year end calls, I'll add a few additional statistics about bookings. 
To be clear, some of the prior years, we will not be updating milestone bookings achievements or reporting booking statistics on a quarterly basis. We had strong double-digit bookings growth every quarter this year, which led to a milestone year of total bookings over $1 billion, up over 20% year-over-year. The average contract duration for the year was very close to last year's, at just under 21 months. But interestingly, we have seen an increase in customer willingness to pay for long-term deals upfront, including long-term deals through channel partners. This change is reflected in the renewed growth and long-term deferred revenue after almost two years with little change. Our off balance sheet backlog, that is the portion of customer contract to be billed in the future, behaved in similar fashion to last year. We ended the year with backlog in excess of $190 million, of which approximately $120 million is expected to be billed in fiscal year '12. As a refresher, bookings that are billed increased deferred revenue and bookings that are not billed increased off balance sheet backlog. It should be apparent that the increase in long-term deferred revenue limits growth of off balance sheet backlog. 
Our billings proxy for Q4 set a new record at $318 million, up 31% year-over-year and the highest growth in three years. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue shown on the cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rates on deferred revenue. 
Moving on to bookings by channel and geography, our Q4 bookings mix was 59% from the channel and 41% from direct sales versus a very similar 60/40 split in Q3 and for the year. This split reflects the investment we've made in our channel business over the last few years. Our geographic split remains little changed, with 57% from the Americas, 27% from EMEA and 16% from APAC, essentially in line with Q3's split, which was 56%, 28% and 16% respectively. For the year, we saw strong 20% plus growth in every region. 
Now, let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $245 million, up 25% from the prior year and well above the high end of our guidance, which was $236 million. Strong demand, better linearity and sales execution overall, including better-than-expected up selling and cross-selling were important factors. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $209 million, up 24% from the prior year. Subscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 86% of total revenue in Q4. Training and Services revenue was $35 million, up 33% from a year-ago quarter and down over $1 million sequentially as a result of holiday downtime in customer sites around the globe. This performance is slightly better than our guidance from the third quarter earnings call. 
Now, I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation expense, amortization expense and for fiscal year '10, a litigation settlement. Overall gross margin was 84.2% for Q4, in line sequentially and down from the prior year due to higher services in the mix and lower services margins overall. Subscription gross margin remained consistent with last year and last quarter at 93.8%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $145 million, up 3% sequentially, and up 19% from the prior year. In Q4, we continued to hire aggressively for sales, engineering and support and we've expanded our marketing programs. 
Q4 non-GAAP operating income increased 31% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 24.9%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. Net interest income was less than $2 million, down approximately $500,000 from the prior year, principally due to lower interest rates. Other income, which is primarily net investment gains and losses and foreign exchange was a loss of approximately $1 million, down $1 million from Q3 and down $5 million from Q4 of last year. Our annual effective tax rate is 30% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, rather than the 35%, which we have been estimating in earlier quarters. As a consequence, the Q4 tax rate is unusually low at 17% in order to adjust to this annual rate. The lower rate includes the benefit of approximately $0.02 a share from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D Tax Credit, which I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. And as well as other changes to our state and foreign taxes, which are likely to be more permanent. I'll discuss this further when I get to guidance. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is $0.26, up 37% compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share last year of $0.19 in the fourth quarter. 
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. We repurchased approximately $11 million of Red Hat common stock in Q4, which brings total purchases to $90 million for the fiscal year. We have approximately $220 million of authorization remaining on our repurchase plan. We are pleased with the consistency of our days sales outstanding, which we believe is a function of the satisfaction level of our customers. DSO was 50 days for Q4 versus 56 days last year. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue. This improvement in DSO was helped by good sales linearity in the quarter. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $772 million, an increase of $126 million or 20% over the prior year end. This increase was $92 million in current deferred revenue and $34 million in long-term deferred revenue. As a follow-up to my comments about bookings and customers' willingness to pay up front, please note that long-term deferred revenue grew 21% for fiscal year '11 compared to virtually no growth last year. Excluding foreign currency rate changes, the year-over-year change in deferred revenue as shown on the cash flow statement was $113 million, that's up 36%. 
Moving to the statement of cash flows, we produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $95 million and full year operating cash flow of $291 million, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. 
Now, to briefly recap and summarize highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $909 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of guidance. Subscription revenue grew to $773 million, an increase of 21%, while services grew 24%, well above the historic services revenue growth rate of 5% to 10%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 27% and non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 110 basis points to 24.8%. We ramped hiring and investments for growth all year long as we said we would. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 and exceeded the high end of guidance of $0.74, which I provided at the start of the year. This beat of $0.09 is roughly half from operating income and half from a better tax situation. Overall, it was a great year. Now, I want to shift to fiscal 2012 guidance. Since foreign exchange rates are still somewhat volatile, let me say that this guidance is based upon yesterday's euro and yen rates. I'm not trying to forecast those foreign exchange rates, I'm simply pegging guidance at that point. While revenue may increase or decrease if foreign exchange rates change, please keep in mind that changes in operating income as a result of currency swings are generally much smaller. 
As for guidance, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,070,000,000 for fiscal 2012, representing an annual growth rate of up to 18% in U.S. dollars. This growth rate assumes that subscriptions will grow faster than services revenue and that service revenue growth will slow. We believe that we can again expand our full-year non-GAAP operating margin and we are targeting approximately 25.7%, while also investing in future growth opportunities. I'm estimating full year net interest income of approximately $6 million or $1.5 million per quarter, which is a very modest reduction from fiscal year 2011. However, please note that I'm not expecting any net investment gains and other income. We have good news on the tax front. Many of the changes in the fiscal year '11 tax rate are likely to positively impact us for a number of years. As a result, the estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 is 31%, 400 basis points lower than most models. 
We will continue to report non-GAAP net income and EPS using our expected GAAP tax rate. There is additional good news on the cash tax front. That is, we still expect our cash tax rate to be about 5% throughout fiscal year 2012, principally as a result of stock compensation deductions. We have large tax credits carryforward but due to the amount of stock compensation deductions available, few of these tax credits are likely to be utilized in fiscal year '12, but rather will be carried forward to be used in future years. Assuming a 31% tax rate and approximately 200 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.94 to $0.96 a share. 
As you work through your models, keep in mind the differences in other income and taxes between fiscal year '11 and fiscal year '12. On a GAAP basis, we estimate quarterly stock compensation expense of approximately $20 million and quarterly amortization expense of approximately $5 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year of between $330 million to $340 million. I expect additional cash flow of $35 million to $40 million, not included in GAAP operating cash flow, which is related to tax savings from excess tax benefits from stock compensation. This will be recorded in our cash from financing activities line as it has been for the past few years. CapEx is still expected to be relatively modest at less than 5% of revenue in the $40 million or $50 million range. 
Finally, looking at Q1, we offer the following guidance. Revenue is estimated to be between $252 million and $255 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is estimated to be approximately 24 1/2% to 24.9%, reflecting higher sales and marketing costs from new hires and costs related to the Red Hat Summit to be held in early May. Using my earlier estimates of quarterly interest income of $1.5 million and a 31% tax rate, non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.21 to $0.22. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon large payments or receipts. Following up on Jim's comments about Japan, let me add that all of our associates are safe and our offices in Tokyo and Osaka are undamaged and fully operational. Customer support for Japan has continued uninterrupted as a result of tremendous work by our associates in Japan and elsewhere. However, many Japanese businesses have experienced problems and others are still assessing the impact. Because of our subscription model, I expect no significant effect on Q1 revenue, but it is probable that we may have some delay in Q1 Japanese billings, possibly up to $5 million. We will assess future quarters as more information becomes known. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our results for the fiscal year 2011 and we believe that we're well-positioned to gain market share and grow. We are continuing to invest in areas, such as virtualization, cloud computing and middleware but we're also prudently managing costs. We are optimistic about this fiscal year and the forward-looking pipeline continues to look strong.

In Q1, we had several important technology, partner, product and customer announcements. Many of them were made during our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit and JBoss World, which hosted a record number of attendees in May. The vision for the future that we shared with our customers and partners is one where customers will be able to choose to run their applications on their metal, virtualization, private cloud or among multiple certified public clouds. 
Let me highlight just a few points that further articulate our strategy around the shift to cloud computing and what we are doing to allow Red Hat and our customers to benefit from this important shift. First, we announced Red Hat CloudForms. This offering is designed to bring true infrastructure-as-a-service functionality to the CIO for on-premise and off-premise cloud deployment. The goal of this Infrastructure-as-a-Service technology for managing hybrid clouds is to provide companies the ability to maintain significant control over the underlying infrastructure. CloudForms is intended to be a comprehensive resource management solution that will offer a unique approach to application lifecycle management, dynamic image and template-based application stacks, as well as next-generation operational management tools. We are currently working with select customers on this new set of technologies. 
Next, we announced OpenShift, a platform-as-a-service offering currently available in developed or preview format. OpenShift is a set of leading edge cloud services, enabling developers to build, host and readily scale applications in the cloud. This service enables the development and deployment of applications written in multiple frameworks and languages in a cloud infrastructure managed by Red Hat and run on Red Hat technologies. OpenShift is designed for rapid cloud deployment of applications, which can reduce resource needs and time to develop applications as compared with traditional application development. With a rich choice of frameworks, the Red Hat certified ecosystem of RHEL and JBoss and the open APIs of Deltacloud, OpenShift allows developers to take advantage of the power of open-source software in what it brings to the cloud. We believe that these new Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service solutions further enhance our position as a strategic vendor for cloud technologies and the clear market leader from an open source perspective. Within public clouds, we renewed deals and expanded our relationships with a number of large public cloud customers over the last 2 quarters, including an expanded relationship with Amazon Web Services, IBM and NTT. And in Q1, we also announced several new cloud provider wins from around the globe, including Dnshosting.it, an Italian-based cloud data center services provider, Australia-based provider Evolution Systems, Nordic cloud provider Exxonus and the Cyber Integration Center at Harris Corp. We also continued to take a leadership role in driving open source development and standards with a number of our ecosystem partners. In Q1, we jointly announced the creation of the Open Virtualization Alliance for OVA. The OVA Consortium is governed by IT vendors, including HP, IBM, Intel and Red Hat. The consortium is committed to fostering the adoption of open virtualization technologies, primarily Kernel-based Virtual Machine or KVM, the backbone of Red Hat Enterprise's virtualization. This group of leading IT vendors will encourage interoperability and the expansion of ecosystem around KVM in order to provide enterprise customers with improved choice, performance and price for virtualization. KVM is being recognized not only as the hypervisor for Linux but more importantly the future of open source alternatives for the cloud. We also continued to invest in and innovate our core products, that are the building blocks for cloud-enabled infrastructure. In Q1, we released the latest version of our award-winning Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system and RHEL 6.1. RHEL 6.1 provides more enterprise reliability, performance and control throughout the data center. RHEL6 is already established as a performance leader, serving as virtual guest and hypervisor host. And finally, I want to recognize our innovation award winners who are clearly driving the leading edge of commercial use of Red Hat technologies. These innovators are reducing costs, creating innovative new products and services and increasing their competitive advantage. From creating innovative computing goods to carving out costs, Red Hat is proud to collaborate with our customers on innovative solutions. With that, let me turn the call back over to Charlie."

The strong demand we experienced this quarter came in part from enterprise customers who are looking to Red Hat to upgrade and modernize their IT infrastructure. The demand for our solutions is evident in our top 25 renewal metrics and our top 30 deal metrics. From a renewal perspective, I'm pleased to report that all of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal in the first quarter not only renewed but they did so at a total value access of 130% of the original value. The top 30 deals set a Q1 record for deals over $1 million. In the quarter, we had 14 deals over $1 million or greater, including one deal in excess of $5 million. Cross-selling and up selling was strong and all of our top 30 deals in Q1 were above $500,000. Within the top 30, approximately 40% included middleware component, with 5 being standalone middleware deals. 
Now, let's turn to our financial performance. Bookings from the channel generated 63% of our Q1 volume and 37% came from direct sales versus a 59%:41% split in Q1. This split reflects strong execution by our channel team, continuing to drive demand through our partners and strong sales in our government customer base. In terms of geography, 56% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. I would like to commend our Japanese associates, who in spite of adversity, did an outstanding job supporting customers and growing their business. Our billings proxy for the quarter was $266 million, up 28% year-over-year. Compared to Q1 a year ago, billings were up $58 million, reflecting the strong sales execution and improved IT spending environment. The billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue, plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now, let's shift to the income statement. First quarter revenue was $265 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, 8% sequentially and well above our expectation. This sequential growth rate is the highest in 3 years. The drivers of our total revenue growth were both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was again up 26% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $226 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, contributed 85% of total revenue. Training and services component of revenue was $39 million, up 30% from last year and up 10% sequentially. This strong performance included the anticipated seasonal boost, with high demand for training and continued demand for new projects with the consulting component led to better-than-expected results. This is encouraging since this type of business generally leads to additional future subscriptions. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% in Q1. Subscription gross margin was 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%, returning to more normal levels than last quarter and pretty much in line with Q1 over a year ago. Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses, we continued to focus spending on growth opportunities. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $159 million, up 9% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Spending for Q1 included marketing expenses related to Red Hat Summit and JBoss World. This event was held in the second quarter last year. Also included program expenses for the launch of new technologies, opening sales offices in several additional countries and substantial additions to our sales force. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $66 million, producing an operating margin of 25.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially, 30 basis points year-over-year and better than our guidance. Net interest income was in line with last year and the $1.5 million which we had guided. Our estimated annual effective tax rate is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.24, which is $0.02 higher than our guidance and up 33% compared to last year. Despite higher volatility, the average euro and yen rates for the first quarter were almost right on the foreign exchange rates which we used to set guidance. However, if the first quarter had been at the same foreign exchange rates since Q1 last year, revenue would've been $9 million lower, expenses about $6 million lower than we reported and which would've resulted in about $3 million lower operating income. 
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.27 billion. Since the start of the fiscal year, we have used cash to repurchase approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock for $34 million, including approximately $19 million or 437,000 shares in Q1. The remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is now $186 million. Quarterly operating cash flow of $90 million was up 49% from Q1 last year. An important factor in this result was healthy opening receivables and strong collections. FX-adjusted DSOs continued to be in good shape. They're unchanged at 53 days from the year ago quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $786 million, an increase of $116 million or 26% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 25% in U.S. dollar terms while long-term deferred revenue grew 29% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $14 million from last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, currency volatility has remained high, so let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $573 million, had real growth in Q1 of $3 million and increased an additional $8 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $584 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $200 million, had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately $2 million but benefited by changes in foreign exchange spot rates by $4 million, ending Q1 at $202 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $1 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Now, I'd like to turn to guidance. First, it goes without saying that the global macroeconomic environment is still troubled, and in many ways, under stress. It is clear that this produces greater uncertainty in forecasting demand and foreign exchange rates. Well, I don't forecast foreign exchange rates so for the purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the year stayed constant at a rate applicable for Q1, which were 1 euro was $1.43 and 82 yen to $1. As I mentioned previously, these rates were also very near the rates I used to set guidance at the start of the year. With those assumptions in mind, I offer the following awkwardly revised outlook. Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $270 million to $272 million. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 25.4% to 25.6% area and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.24 to $0.25 a share, assuming the same 31% tax rate. Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that in your work estimating cash flow, you use beginning accounts receivable balances as a starting point. As for the full year, given our strong Q1 actual results and Q2 guidance well above expectations, we are comfortable raising our revenue guidance to a range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion and our non-GAAP EPS range to $0.98 to $1 a share. Our full year non-GAAP operating margin target of around 25.7% and operating cash flow guidance remain unchanged as it is our intention to continue to invest for growth as we explained at length at our Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in May. In summary, the company continues to execute well and manage for growth. We're off the strong start and we'll continue to invest in our portfolio of growth opportunities, including cloud computing technologies. Operator, I would now like to turn it back over to you for the first question."

I don't think it's appropriate at this point to change our full year cash flow estimate. We're only in the first quarter and as I said, we intend to continue to invest for growth. The second part of your question about renewals, we have consistently done very well on the top renewals. And as we discussed at analyst day, we've made many efforts to improve our renewals on the much smaller deals and deals through distribution and those efforts are continuing. And then the last part of your question about RHEL6, I think RHEL6 is off to good start. I don't know that it necessarily will cause the renewal rate to improve.

So I haven't seen the same momentum in terms of making sure you get 20%, 30% quarter-to-quarter more people, 35% on the new products also. The reason I say is you probably have about 8 months of window opportunity to literally capture the future because the competition, as I mentioned, Cisco-certified engineers, Microsoft-certified engineers, are literally looking for jobs right now and you can be very forceful and probably take those skills into your own domain by having some certifications, because right now in the valley, finding the people with the right skills is a little bit difficult.

In Q1, we had several important technology, partner, product and customer announcements. Many of them were made during our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit and JBoss World, which hosted a record number of attendees in May. The vision for the future that we shared with our customers and partners is one where customers will be able to choose to run their applications on their metal, virtualization, private cloud or among multiple certified public clouds. 
Let me highlight just a few points that further articulate our strategy around the shift to cloud computing and what we are doing to allow Red Hat and our customers to benefit from this important shift. First, we announced Red Hat CloudForms. This offering is designed to bring true Infrastructure-as-a-Service functionality to the CIO for on-premise and off-premise cloud deployment. The goal of this Infrastructure-as-a-Service technology for managing hybrid clouds is to provide companies the ability to maintain significant control over the underlying infrastructure. 
CloudForms is intended to be a comprehensive resource management solution that will offer a unique approach to application lifecycle management, dynamic image and template-based application stacks as well as next-generation operational management tools. We are currently working with select customers on this new set of technologies. 
Next, we announced OpenShift, a Platform-as-a-Service offering currently available in developer preview format. OpenShift is a set of leading edge cloud services, enabling developers to build, host and readily scale applications in the cloud. This service enables the development and deployment of applications written in multiple frameworks and languages in a cloud infrastructure managed by Red Hat and run on Red Hat technologies. OpenShift is designed for rapid cloud deployment of applications, which can reduce resource needs and time to develop applications as compared with traditional application development. 
With a rich choice of frameworks, the Red Hat-certified ecosystem of RHEL and JBoss and the open APIs of Deltacloud, OpenShift allows developers to take advantage of the power of open-source software and what it brings to the cloud. We believe that these new Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service solutions further enhance our position as a strategic vendor for cloud technologies and the clear market leader from an open source perspective. 
Within public clouds, we renewed deals and expanded our relationships with a number of large public cloud customers over the last 2 quarters, including an expanded relationship with Amazon Web Services, IBM and NTT. And in Q1, we also announced several new cloud provider wins from around the globe, including Dnshosting.it, an Italian-based cloud data center services provider; Australia-based provider Evolution Systems; Nordic cloud provider Exxonus [ph] and the Cyber Integration Center at Harris Corporation. 
We also continued to take a leadership role in driving open source development and standards with a number of our ecosystem partners. In Q1, we jointly announced the creation of the Open Virtualization Alliance, or OVA. The OVA consortium is governed by IT vendors, including HP, IBM, Intel and Red Hat. The consortium is committed to fostering the adoption of open virtualization technologies, primarily Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or KVM, the backbone of Red Hat Enterprise's virtualization. This group of leading IT vendors will encourage interoperability and the expansion of the ecosystem around KVM in order to provide enterprise customers with improved choice, performance and price for virtualization. KVM is being recognized not only as the hypervisor for Linux, but more importantly, the future of open source alternatives for the cloud. 
We also continued to invest in and innovate our core products that are the building blocks for a cloud-enabled infrastructure. In Q1, we released the latest version of our award-winning Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system in RHEL 6.1. RHEL 6.1 provides more enterprise reliability, performance and control throughout the data center. RHEL 6 is already established as a performance leader, serving as virtual guest and hypervisor host. 
And finally, I want to recognize our innovation award winners who are clearly driving the leading edge of commercial use of Red Hat technologies. These innovators are reducing costs, creating innovative new products and services and increasing their competitive advantage. From creating innovative computing grids to carving out costs, Red Hat is proud to collaborate with our customers on innovative solutions. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Charlie."
33679,133638928,137564,"Red Hat, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 22, 2011",2011-06-22,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Paul. The strong demand we experienced this quarter came in part from enterprise customers who are looking to Red Hat to upgrade and modernize their IT infrastructure. The demand for our solutions is evident in our top 25 renewal metrics and our t",1355,"Thanks, Paul. The strong demand we experienced this quarter came in part from enterprise customers who are looking to Red Hat to upgrade and modernize their IT infrastructure. The demand for our solutions is evident in our top 25 renewal metrics and our top 30 deal metrics. From a renewal perspective, I'm pleased to report that all of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal in the first quarter not only renewed, but they did so at a total value access of 130% of the original value. The top 30 deals set a Q1 record for deals over $1 million. 
In the quarter, we had 14 deals over $1 million or greater, including one deal in excess of $5 million. Cross-selling and up selling was strong, and all of our top 30 deals in Q1 were above $500,000. Within the top 30, approximately 40% included middleware component, with 5 being standalone middleware deals. 
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Bookings from the channel generated 63% of our Q1 volume and 37% came from direct sales, versus a 59%-41% split in Q1. This split reflects strong execution by our channel team, continuing to drive demand through our partners and strong sales in our government customer base. 
In terms of geography, 56% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. I would like to commend our Japanese associates, who, in spite of adversity, did an outstanding job supporting customers and growing their business. Our billings proxy for the quarter was $266 million, up 28% year-over-year. Compared to Q1 a year ago, billings were up $58 million, reflecting the strong sales execution and improved IT spending environment. The billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue, plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. First quarter revenue was $265 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, 8% sequentially and well above our expectation. This sequential growth rate is the highest in 3 years. 
The drivers of our total revenue growth were both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was, again, up 26% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $226 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constituted 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $39 million, up 30% from last year and up 10% sequentially. This strong performance included the anticipated seasonal boost, but high demand for training and continued demand for new projects with the consulting component led to better-than-expected results. This is encouraging since this type of business generally leads to additional future subscriptions. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% in Q1. Subscription gross margin was 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%, returning to more normal levels than last quarter and pretty much in line with Q1 of a year ago. 
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. We continue to focus spending on growth opportunities. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $159 million, up 9% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Spending for Q1 included marketing expenses related to Red Hat Summit and JBoss World. This event was held in the second quarter last year. Also included program expenses for the launch of new technologies, opening sales offices in several additional countries and substantial additions to our sales force. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $66 million, producing an operating margin of 25.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially, 30 basis points year-over-year and better than our guidance. Net interest income was in line with last year and the $1.5 million which we had guided. Our estimated annual effective tax rate is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.24, which is $0.02 higher than our guidance and up 33% compared to last year. 
Despite higher volatility, the average euro and yen rates for the first quarter were almost right on the foreign exchange rates which we used to set guidance. However, if the first quarter had been at the same foreign exchange rates since Q1 last year, revenue would have been $9 million lower, expenses about $6 million lower than we reported and which would have resulted in about $3 million lower operating income. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.27 billion. Since the start of the fiscal year, we have used cash to repurchase approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock for $34 million, including approximately $19 million or 437,000 shares in Q1. The remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is now $186 million. 
Quarterly operating cash flow of $90 million was up 49% from Q1 last year. An important factor in this result was healthy opening receivables and strong collections. FX-adjusted DSOs continued to be in good shape. They're unchanged at 53 days from the year ago quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $786 million, an increase of $116 million or 26% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 25% in U.S. dollar terms, while long-term deferred revenue grew 29% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $14 million from last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, currency volatility has remained high, so let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. 
Short term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $573 million, had real growth in Q1 of $3 million and increased an additional $8 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $584 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $200 million, had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately $2 million but benefited by changes in foreign exchange spot rates by $4 million, ending Q1 at $202 million. The total increase in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $1 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. First, it goes without saying that the global macroeconomic environment is still troubled, and in many ways, under stress. It is clear that this produces greater uncertainty in forecasting demand and foreign exchange rates. Well, I don't forecast foreign exchange rates, so for purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the year stayed constant at a rate applicable for Q1, which were EUR 1 was $1.43 and JPY 82 to $1. As I mentioned previously, these rates were also very near the rates I used to set guidance at the start of the year. 
With those assumptions in mind, I offer the following publicly revised outlook. Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $270 million to $272 million. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 25.4% to 25.6% area and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.24 to $0.25 a share, assuming the same 31% tax rate. Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that in your work estimating cash flow, you use beginning accounts receivable balances as a starting point. 
As for the full year, given our strong Q1 actual results and Q2 guidance well above expectations, we are comfortable raising our revenue guidance to a range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion and our non-GAAP EPS range to $0.98 to $1 a share. Our full year non-GAAP operating margin target of around 25.7% and operating cash flow guidance remain unchanged as it is our intention to continue to invest for growth as we explained at length at our Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in May. 
In summary, the company continues to execute well and manage for growth. We're off to a strong start, and we'll continue to invest in our portfolio of growth opportunities, including cloud computing technologies. Operator, I would now like to turn it back over to you for the first question."

And secondly, wondering if you can give us an update on how the nonrenewals are turning out to be renewals.

The first question about cash flow in Q1, we obviously did well in Q1 cash flow, but frankly, I don't forecast quarterly cash flow.

I don't think it's appropriate at this point to change our full year cash flow estimate. We're only in the first quarter, and as I said, we intend to continue to invest for growth. The second part of your question about renewals, we have consistently done very well on the top renewals. And as we discussed at Analyst Day, we've made many efforts to improve our renewals on the much smaller deals and deals through distribution, and those efforts are continuing. And then the last part of your question about RHEL 6. I think RHEL 6 is off to a good start. I don't know that it necessarily will cause the renewal rate to improve, but we've had a very good renewal rate in any case."

So I haven't seen the same momentum in terms of making sure we get 20%, 30% quarter-to-quarter more people certified on the new products also. The reason I say is you have probably about 8 months of window of opportunity to literally capture the future because the competition, as I mentioned, Cisco-certified engineers, Microsoft-certified engineers, are literally looking for jobs right now and you can be very forceful and probably take those skills into your own domain by having some certifications. Because right now, in the value at least, finding the people with the right skills is a little bit difficult. And I think if we get the same momentum you had, say, 8 years back, getting people certified would be a good strategy moving forward. Wondering what are your thoughts on that."

In Q1, we had several important technology, partner, product and customer announcements. Many of them were made during our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit and JBoss World, which hosted a record number of attendees in May. The vision for the future that we shared with our customers and partners is one where customers will be able to choose to run their applications on bare metal, virtualization, private cloud or among multiple certified public clouds. 
Let me highlight just a few points that further articulate our strategy around the shift to cloud computing and what we are doing to allow Red Hat and our customers to benefit from this important shift. First, we announced Red Hat CloudForms. This offering is designed to bring true Infrastructure-as-a-Service functionality to the CIO for on-premise and off-premise cloud deployment. The goal of this Infrastructure-as-a-Service technology for managing hybrid clouds is to provide companies the ability to maintain significant control over the underlying infrastructure. 
CloudForms is intended to be a comprehensive resource management solution that will offer a unique approach to application lifecycle management, dynamic image and template-based application stacks as well as next-generation operational management tools. We are currently working with select customers on this new set of technologies. 
Next, we announced OpenShift, a Platform-as-a-Service offering currently available in developer preview format. OpenShift is a set of leading edge cloud services, enabling developers to build, host and readily scale applications in the cloud. This service enables the development and deployment of applications written in multiple frameworks and languages in a cloud infrastructure managed by Red Hat and run on Red Hat technologies. OpenShift is designed for rapid cloud deployment of applications, which can reduce resource needs and time to develop applications as compared with traditional application development. 
With a rich choice of frameworks, the Red Hat-certified ecosystem of RHEL and JBoss and the open APIs of Deltacloud, OpenShift allows developers to take advantage of the power of open-source software and what it brings to the cloud. We believe that these new Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service solutions further enhance our position as a strategic vendor for cloud technologies and the clear market leader from an open source perspective. 
Within public clouds, we renewed deals and expanded our relationships with a number of large public cloud customers over the last 2 quarters, including an expanded relationship with Amazon Web Services, IBM and NTT. And in Q1, we also announced several new cloud provider wins from around the globe, including Dnshosting.it, an Italian-based cloud data center services provider; Australia-based provider Evolution Systems; Nordic cloud provider Exxonus [ph] and the Cyber Integration Center at Harris Corporation. 
We also continued to take a leadership role in driving open source development and standards with a number of our ecosystem partners. In Q1, we jointly announced the creation of the Open Virtualization Alliance, or OVA. The OVA consortium is governed by IT vendors, including HP, IBM, Intel and Red Hat. The consortium is committed to fostering the adoption of open virtualization technologies, primarily Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or KVM, the backbone of Red Hat Enterprise's virtualization. This group of leading IT vendors will encourage interoperability and the expansion of the ecosystem around KVM in order to provide enterprise customers with improved choice, performance and price for virtualization. KVM is being recognized not only as the hypervisor for Linux but, more importantly, the future of open source alternatives for the cloud. 
We also continued to invest in and innovate our core products that are the building blocks for a cloud-enabled infrastructure. In Q1, we released the latest version of our award-winning Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system in RHEL 6.1. RHEL 6.1 provides more enterprise reliability, performance and control throughout the data center. RHEL 6 is already established as a performance leader, serving as virtual guest and hypervisor host. 
And finally, I want to recognize our innovation award winners who are clearly driving the leading edge of commercial use of Red Hat technologies. These innovators are reducing costs, creating innovative new products and services and increasing their competitive advantage. From creating innovative computing grids to carving out costs, Red Hat is proud to collaborate with our customers on innovative solutions. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Charlie."

The strong demand we experienced this quarter came in part from enterprise customers who are looking to Red Hat to upgrade and modernize their IT infrastructure. The demand for our solutions is evident in our top 25 renewal metrics and our top 30 deal metrics. From a renewal perspective, I'm pleased to report that all of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal in the first quarter not only renewed, but they did so at a total value in excess of 130% of the original value. The top 30 deals set a Q1 record for deals over $1 million. 
In the quarter, we had 14 deals over $1 million or greater, including one deal in excess of $5 million. Cross-selling and up-selling was strong, and all of our top 30 deals in Q1 were above $500,000. Within the top 30, approximately 40% included middleware component, with 5 being standalone middleware deals. 
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Bookings from the channel generated 63% of our Q1 volume, and 37% came from direct sales, versus a 59%-41% split in Q1. This split reflects strong execution by our channel team, continuing to drive demand through our partners and strong sales in our government customer base. 
In terms of geography, 56% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific. I would like to commend our Japanese associates, who, in spite of adversity, did an outstanding job supporting customers and growing their business. Our billings proxy for the quarter was $266 million, up 28% year-over-year. Compared to Q1 a year ago, billings were up $58 million, reflecting the strong sales execution and improved IT spending environment. The billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. First quarter revenue was $265 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, 8% sequentially and well above our expectation. This sequential growth rate is the highest in 3 years. 
The drivers of our total revenue growth were both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was, again, up 26% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $226 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constituted 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $39 million, up 30% from last year and up 10% sequentially. This strong performance included the anticipated seasonal boost, but high demand for training and continued demand for new projects with the consulting component led to better-than-expected results. This is encouraging since this type of business generally leads to additional future subscriptions. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% in Q1. Subscription gross margin was 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%, returning to more normal levels than last quarter and pretty much in line with Q1 of a year ago. 
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. We continue to focus spending on growth opportunities. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $159 million, up 9% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Spending for Q1 included marketing expenses related to Red Hat Summit and JBoss World. This event was held in the second quarter last year. Also included program expenses for the launch of new technologies, opening sales offices in several additional countries and substantial additions to our sales force. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $66 million, producing an operating margin of 25.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially, 30 basis points year-over-year and better than our guidance. Net interest income was in line with last year and the $1.5 million which we had guided. Our estimated annual effective tax rate is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.24, which is $0.02 higher than our guidance and up 33% compared to last year. 
Despite higher volatility, the average euro and yen rates for the first quarter were almost right on the foreign exchange rates which we used to set guidance. However, if the first quarter had been at the same foreign exchange rates as Q1 last year, revenue would have been $9 million lower, expenses about $6 million lower than we reported and which would have resulted in about $3 million lower operating income. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.27 billion. Since the start of the fiscal year, we have used cash to repurchase approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock for $34 million, including approximately $19 million or 437,000 shares in Q1. The remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is now $186 million. 
Quarterly operating cash flow of $90 million was up 49% from Q1 last year. An important factor in this result was healthy opening receivables and strong collections. FX-adjusted DSOs continued to be in good shape. They're unchanged at 53 days from the year ago quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $786 million, an increase of $160 million or 26% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 25% in U.S. dollar terms, while long-term deferred revenue grew 29% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $14 million from last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, currency volatility has remained high, so let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. 
Short term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $573 million, had real growth in Q1 of $3 million and increased an additional $8 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $584 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $200 million, had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately $2 million but benefited by changes in foreign exchange spot rates by $4 million, ending Q1 at $202 million. The total increase in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $1 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. First, it goes without saying that the global macroeconomic environment is still troubled and, in many ways, under stress. It is clear that this produces greater uncertainty in forecasting demand and foreign exchange rates. Well, I don't forecast foreign exchange rates, so for purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the year stay constant at the rates applicable for Q1, which were EUR 1 was $1.43 and JPY 82 to $1. As I mentioned previously, these rates were also very near the rates I used to set guidance at the start of the year. 
With those assumptions in mind, I offer the following upwardly revised outlook. Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $270 million to $272 million. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 25.4% to 25.6% area, and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.24 to $0.25 a share, assuming the same 31% tax rate. Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that in your work estimating cash flow, you use beginning accounts receivable balances as a starting point. 
As for the full year, given our strong Q1 actual results and Q2 guidance well above expectations, we are comfortable raising our revenue guidance to a range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion and our non-GAAP EPS range to $0.98 to $1 a share. Our full year non-GAAP operating margin target of around 25.7% and operating cash flow guidance remain unchanged as it is our intention to continue to invest for growth as we explained at length at our Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in May. 
In summary, the company continues to execute well and manage for growth. We're off to a strong start, and we'll continue to invest in our portfolio of growth opportunities, including cloud computing technologies. Operator, I would now like to turn it back over to you for the first question."

I don't think it's appropriate at this point to change our full year cash flow estimate. We're only in the first quarter, and as I said, we intend to continue to invest for growth. The second part of your question about renewals, we have consistently done very well on the top renewals.

So I haven't seen the same momentum in terms of making sure we get 20, 30 person quarter-to-quarter more people certified on the new products also. The reason I say is you have probably about 8 months of window of opportunity to literally capture the future because the competition, as I mentioned, Cisco-certified engineers, Microsoft-certified engineers, are literally looking for jobs right now, and you can be very forceful and probably take those skills into your own domain by having some certifications. Because right now, in the value at least, finding the people with the right skills is a little bit difficult.

Red Hat Associates around the globe executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results. While the macroeconomic environment remains volatile, we continue to experience broad demand for our open-source solutions in every major geography during the second quarter. We saw significant upselling within our top deals and we added a number of large wins from customers who migrated away from proprietary products and other Linux distributions. Customers are increasingly turning to Red Hat as they look to modernize their data center infrastructure and fundamentally change the way they deliver IT services. 
Let me review some of the highlights from our second quarter which, combined with strong demand heading into the second half of this year, provides us with confidence to again raise our full year growth outlook as Charlie will explain later. First, sales execution was once again strong in Q2 and we delivered accelerating year-over-year organic revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our 27% revenue growth to the first half of this year had significantly outpaced last year's 20% first half growth. Given our investments in sales and marketing and R&D are clearly paying off. Second, even with this focused investment for growth, we continued to deliver leverage, which enabled our operating income significantly outpace revenue. Our operating income is up 41% in Q2 and up 35% in the first half of this year. 
Third, we continue to drive strong cash flow growth, with operating cash flow up 20% for the quarter and 34% for the first half of the year. I'm also pleased to report that all of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal in the second quarter not only renewed but they did sell at a total value of over 150% of the original value. This was our strongest upsell percentage since we started tracking this metric, which is usually in the 120% to 130% range. Customers across a variety of segments and geographies contributed to this record. The value and innovation that customers receive from a Red Hat subscription is a key demand driver for us in both good times and in challenging ones. For instance, this quarter, one of our largest renewals and upsells came from a technology firm that has been a staunch proponent of UNIX for several decades. Given the value, performance and capabilities of RHEL, they now have a substantial deployment in their internal infrastructure. From a demand perspective, it is clear from our results that there's a fundamental shift happening in the way IT is being delivered. Recently, the former U.S. CIO, Vivek Kundra, wrote an article that demonstrates this need for change. His article spells out the issues government agencies faced when purchasing, deploying and maintaining inefficient software and hardware. To combat these issues, government agencies are now shifting away from the older model of customized, deeply integrated IT purchases, which often came with heavy maintenance fees and the need for specialized IT staff and expensive customization. Rather, they choose a new model that relies on modularity, reuse, flexibility and the interoperability of systems that they control and are not locked into. 
Open source is in the sweet spot and the U.S. government's IT reform effort and cloud-first policy our example of open-source and Red Hat can enable the change. It is not just the U.S. government that's embracing open source solutions. We're seeing governments around the world choosing open source to solve the issues associated with traditional IT deployments. Our research indicates that more than 40 countries have adopted policies that promote a fair playing field for open source or emphasize technology neutrality for open source when compared to proprietary software, notably in the U.K., India, Brazil and Australia. This type of validation enables Red Hat to win and strengthen relationships with a government stamp of approval. The issues in Kundra's article are not isolated to governments but are very similar to discussions I've had with enterprise customers around the world. This change in IT decision-making is also bolstered by the increasingly younger generation of IT leaders who are not collected to the old model of enterprise software purchases. These customers want to partner with Red Hat to reduce costs while modernizing their IT infrastructure to enable applications to run on bare metal, virtualized and in the cloud. 
Now, let me provide an update of some of our virtualization and cloud computing highlights initiatives. This quarter, Telstra, Australia's leading Telecommunications and information services company, joined our expanding ecosystem of cloud computing providers who have partnered with Red Hat to provide a choice for enterprise customers in the cloud. Telstra's joined our Red Hat certified cloud provider program that provides a reliable, scalable, supported and consistent environment for Enterprise Cloud deployment. In Q2, we announced the next generation of Red Hat's virtualization management product, RHEV 3 in Beta. RHEV 3 adds new features and important capabilities focused on performance, memory and scalability for managing virtual guests. RHEV 3 now runs as a Java application on our JBoss Middleware and on our RHEL platform with an updated KVM hypervisor. We've also built a partner ecosystem with top ISPs to provide an excellent solutions for customers who are seeking choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions. We expect to release the GA version of RHEV 3 later this year. We also announced that OpenShift, our platform-as-a-service offering, now supports Java EE 6. OpenShift was the first in the industry to deliver JEE 6, simplifying how developers build and deploy applications up in the cloud. 
At Red Hat Summit, we jointly announced the creation of the open virtualization alliance or OVA with a number of industry partners. The consortium is committed to fostering the adoption of open-source virtualization technologies, primarily the KVM hypervisor, in driving industrywide adoption. The OVA membership has now grown to over 200 technology companies, including some of the largest technology companies in the world. This broad membership of technology leaders to cloud startups is backing KVM as an enterprise class hypervisor for both on-premise and cloud deployments. We are pleased with the solid progress on these important initiatives as we continue to build out our cloud offerings in the ecosystem. 
On a final note, last month, Linux celebrated its 20th anniversary and I want to recognize the contribution of Linus Richard Stallman and the other early trailblazers of open source. Without open source and the collaborative development model, many of the key technologies that make our lives more productive and interesting would not exist. This year, Red Hat will be the first open-source company to surpass $1 billion in revenue. With cloud computing still in its early stages and new disruptive shifts in data center architecture, we believe that the open-source movement and Red Hat are well-positioned for future growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,139987678,169089,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2011",2011-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. We have a number financial highlights in what overall is a very strong quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced billings growth of 30%, our highest Q2 billings growth rate in 6 years. At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its current",1522,"Thank you, Jim. We have a number financial highlights in what overall is a very strong quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced billings growth of 30%, our highest Q2 billings growth rate in 6 years. At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its current size. Revenue growth of 28%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 41%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 53%, total deferred revenue growth of 25% and operating cash flow growth of 20% for the quarter and 34% year-to-date. As Jim mentioned earlier, we remain well positioned to capitalize on the modernization of enterprise data centers. Our strong and accelerating growth particularly when compared to our competitors shows a market share shift to Red Hat. Our top 30 deal metrics provide further evidence of Red Hat's market share gains where we saw significant increases from existing customers and new wins. The top 30 deals set a Q2 record for deals over $1 million. For only the second time in our history, all the top deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million and 3 exceeded $5 million. Approximately 40% of the top 30 deals include a Middleware component, with 2 being stand-alone Middleware deals. The 2 largest industry verticals represented within the top 30 deals were financial services and local, state and Federal governments from around the world. While investors have been concerned about IT spending in these sectors, the strength of our value proposition is further reinforced by the fact that these 2 sectors were important contributors to our accelerated and better-than-expected growth. It's probably not surprising since both of these verticals are actively trying to reduce costs and we help them do that. 
Now, let's turn to our financial performance. Bookings from the channel generated 57% of our Q2 volume and 43% came from direct sales versus 63%, 37% split in Q1, somewhat from last quarter because a couple of the largest deals were closed by the direct sales team. In terms of geography, 58% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 17% from Asia Pacific, with 20% plus growth across all geographies. Our billings proxy for the quarter was $304 million, up 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong market demand, market share gains and a slight lengthening of average contract duration to greater than 21 months. Our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now, let's shift to the income statement. Second quarter revenue was $281 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, also well above our guidance. For the first time, on a trailing 12-month basis, our billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $238 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constitute 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 28% from last year and up 10% sequentially. We continued to see good demand for services, which generally leads to additional future subscriptions. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for Q2. Subscription gross margin was 94% and training and services gross margin was 33%, in line with the second quarter of a year ago. 
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses, we continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering, leading to Q2 non-GAAP operating expense of $161 million, up 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. At the same time, the operating leverage continues to improve. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $76 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, up 210 basis points sequentially and 250 basis points year-over-year, and better than our guidance. Net interest and other income of $2.5 million is in line with guidance on Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.29, which is $0.04 higher than our guidance, up 53% compared to last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. In Q2, there was a discrete tax benefit of $2 million, which contributed $0.01 to our earnings per share. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $0.28 a share. 
Looking at the foreign exchange impact to our income statement, the average year end yen rates for the second quarter were in line with the foreign exchange rates we use for guidance and very close to the first quarter rates for that matter. However, if the second quarter had then the same foreign exchange rates as Q2 last year, revenue would've been $13 million lower and expenses $9 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $4 million lower operating income. 
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash investments of $1.3 billion. In the second quarter, we used cash to repurchase approximately 890,000 shares of common stock for $38 million. The remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is now $163 million. Operating cash flow of $77 million was up 20% from Q2 of last year. Strong sales execution, good linearity in the quarter and strong collections contributed to this strong cash flow performance. Foreign exchange adjusted DSOs continue to be in good shape of 53 days consistent with last quarter compared to 49 days from the year-ago quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $813 million, an increase of $163 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 24% in U.S. dollar terms while long-term deferred revenue grew 27% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $27 million from last quarter. 
Let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $584 million, had real growth in Q2 of $14 million and increased an additional $3 million as a result of changes in foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q2 at $601 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $202 million, had a real increase in Q2 of approximately $9 million and benefited by changes in foreign exchange spot rates by $1 million, ending Q2 at $212 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $23 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Now, I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast foreign exchange rates, for purposes of guidance, I simply put a stake in the ground and assume that foreign exchange rates for Q3 and Q4 will be where they were yesterday, that is the euro about $1.36 and the yen about 77 to $1. That means the assumed euro is about 5% weaker than the Q2 average rate while the yen rate is about 1% stronger. From a fundamental perspective, we are mindful of the global economic turmoil and the stock market volatility remains high. Despite these conditions, we are significantly raising our full year guidance based on our strong first-half results, combined with the ongoing momentum of our global sales pipeline. We have demonstrated in the past that we can see, succeed in up and down markets because of the value we deliver to customers and the cost savings we help them achieve. We are raising our full year revenue guidance by about $45 million to a range of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion and our non-GAAP EPS range to $1.03 to $1.05 a share. From a dollar perspective, operating income is expected to exceed original estimates based on the significant increase in revenue projected. While there is potential to exceed our original full year non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 25.7%, we are sticking to that target at this time as it continues to be our intention to invest for growth. As you know, from the past, we do not typically adjust our cash flow guidance into a year. However, based upon the strong performance in the first half of fiscal year and our current outlook, we are raising our operating cash flow estimate for the fiscal year by $20 million to a range of $350 million to $360 million. Keep in mind that we will also produce approximately $35 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities. For Q3, revenue is estimated to be approximately $288 million to $290 million. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 25% area and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.25 to $0.26 a share, assuming a 31% tax rate. In summary, our associates and partners continue to execute well in delivering value and innovation for customers. This is a primary contributor to our market share gains and exceptional financial results. Operator, I'd now like to turn it back over to you for the first question."

So it's come back this quarter to a little bit closer to where it has been in at least the 4 quarters prior to Q1 of this year. This is the average contract duration. In terms of the billing duration, it typically follows fairly close to the contract duration. Just a reminder, when we do long-term deals through our partners, they typically build the entire thing in advance and when we do deals direct sometimes, they bill in advance and sometimes they bill over the longer period. But the change in long-term deferred revenue you can see for the quarter, we added $9 million in real increase and $1 million in foreign exchange. It's fairly consistent with what we saw from the bookings change and duration."

So they're buying multiple products. And there's significant expansion, even within the existing products today that they have. And you asked a little bit about pricing change, RHEL pricing change. Really, at this point, still does not have much impact in these numbers. It's almost all volume related. So, really good cross-selling and strong demand with many of the large accounts continued to deploy significantly in excess of the original contracted amounts, which then result in true ups in growth of those customers. The second part of the question about the growth versus margin expansion, I have my views consistent with Jim and I will let Jim talk about that."

And we often see customers in a number of these deals, as Charlie said, have a Middleware component. What's happening is companies start with RHEL, sees its value and start adding additional products. Some of that's virtualization. A lot of that's Middleware as well. And as we've added additional Middleware products, that certainly allowed those accounts to continue to grow. So we were seeing absolute volumes of core Linux growing but a lot of it is a lot of these big accounts are expanding the breadth of the products that they're buying from us. In terms of the margin versus growth, certainly we're focused on growth. At the same time, we continue to be comfortable that we can, especially as we continue to accelerate our growth rate, we can continue to invest heavily in the business and still return reasonable margins. So obviously, it depends on the opportunities in front of us. I think as you can see, the mix in our line items, we've been able to deliver margin improvement by reducing G&A and actually, as a percentage of revenue, and actually maintaining our often increasing sales and marketing and R&D as a percent of revenue over the last couple of years. So we'll continue to make those trade-offs going forward. But obviously, the best of both worlds is to take it out of the back office end drop it into the bottom-line and reinvest. And I think we've been very effective in doing that."

So cloud forms will help manage at a slightly higher level and it's compatible with EC2, obviously read and others.

We have a whole partner enabler program up and ready to pull up and we'll be rolling that out as well. So a lot of interest from partners in it because of the professional services component that goes along with virtualization. And so, we've just been really getting the product out and generating initial demand."

Red Hat Associates around the globe executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results. While the macroeconomic environment remained volatile, we continue to experience broad demand for our open source solutions in every major geography during the second quarter. We drove significant upselling within our top deals and we added a number of large wins from customers who migrated away from proprietary products and other Linux distributions. Customers are increasingly turning to Red Hat as they look to modernize their data center infrastructure and fundamentally change the way they deliver IT services. 
Let me review some of the highlights for our second quarter, which combined with strong demand heading into the second half of this year, provides us with confidence to again raise our full year growth outlook, as Charlie will explain later. 
First, sales execution was once again strong in Q2 and we delivered accelerating year-over-year organic revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our 27% revenue growth to the first half of this year had significantly outpaced last year's 20% first half growth, given our investments in sales and marketing and R&D are clearly paying off. 
Second, even with this focused investment for growth, we continue to deliver leverage, which enabled our operating income to significantly outpace revenue. Our operating income is up 41% in Q2 and up 35% in the first half of this year. 
Third, we continue to drive strong cash flow growth with operating cash flow up 20% for the quarter and 34% for the first half of the year. I'm also pleased to report that all of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal in the second quarter, not only renewed, but they did sell at a total value of over 150% of the original value. This was our strongest upsell percentage since we started tracking this metric, which is usually in the 120% to 130% range. Customers across a variety of segments and geographies contributed to this record. 
The value and innovation that customers receive from a Red Hat subscription is a key demand driver for us in both good times and in challenging ones. For instance, this quarter, one of our largest renewals and upsell came from a technology firm that has been a staunch proponent of UNIX for several decades. Given the value, performance and capabilities of RHEL, they have now -- have a substantial deployment in their internal infrastructure. 
From a demand perspective, it is clear from our results that there's a fundamental shift happening in the way IT is being delivered. Recently, the former U.S. CIO, Vivek Kundra, wrote an article that demonstrates this need for change. His article spells out the issues government agencies face when purchasing, deploying and maintaining inefficient software and hardware. To combat these issues, government agencies are now shifting away from the older model of customized, deeply integrated IT purchases, which often came with heavy maintenance fees and the need for specialized IT staff and expensive customization. Rather, they choose a new model that relies on modularity, reuse, flexibility and the interoperability of systems that they control and are not locked into. 
Open source is in the sweet spot and the U.S. government's IT reform effort and cloud-first policy are examples [indiscernible]. Open source and Red Hat can enable that change. It is not just the U.S. government that's embracing open source solutions. We're seeing governments around the world choosing open source to solve the issues associated with traditional IT deployments. Our research indicates that more than 40 countries have adopted policies that promote a fair playing field for open source or emphasize technology neutrality for open source when compared to proprietary software, notably in the U.K., India, Brazil and Australia. This type of validation enables Red Hat to win and strengthen relationships with a government stamp of approval. 
The issues in Kundra's article are not isolated to governments but are very similar to discussions I've had with enterprise customers around the world. This change in IT decision-making is also bolstered by the increasingly younger generation of IT leaders who are not leaded to the old model of enterprise software purchases. These customers want to partner with Red Hat to reduce costs while modernizing their IT infrastructure to enable applications to run on bare metal, virtualized and in the cloud. 
Now let me provide an update on some of our virtualization and cloud computing highlights and initiatives. This quarter, Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications and information services company, joined our expanding ecosystem of cloud computing providers who have partnered with Red Hat to provide a choice for enterprise customers in the cloud. Telstra has joined our Red Hat certified cloud provider program that provides a reliable, scalable, supported and consistent environment for enterprise cloud deployments. 
In Q2, we announced the next generation of Red Hat's virtualization management product, RHEV 3 in Beta. RHEV 3 adds new features and important capabilities focused on performance, memory and scalability for managing virtual guests. RHEV 3 now runs as a Java application on our JBoss Middleware and on our RHEL platform with an updated KVM hypervisor. We've also built a partner ecosystem with top ISPs to provide an excellent solutions for customers who are seeking choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions. We expect to release the GA version of RHEV 3 later this year. We also announced that OpenShift, our platform-as-a-service offering, now supports Java EE 6. OpenShift was the first had the industry to deliver JEE 6, simplifying how developers build and deploy applications in the cloud. 
At Red Hat Summit, we jointly announced the creation of the Open Virtualization Alliance or OVA with a number of industry partners. The consortium is committed to fostering the adoption of open source virtualization technologies, primarily the KVM hypervisor, in driving industrywide adoption. The OVA membership has now grown to over 200 technology companies, including some of the largest technology companies in the world. This broad membership of technology leaders to cloud startups is backing KVM as an enterprise class hypervisor for both on-premise and cloud deployments. We are pleased with the solid progress on these important initiatives as we continue to build out our cloud offerings and ecosystems.
On a final note, last month, Linux celebrated its 20th anniversary, and I want to recognize the contribution of Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman and the other early trailblazers of open source. Without open source and the collaborative development model, many of the key technologies that make our lives more productive and interesting would not exist. This year, Red Hat will be the first open source company to surpass $1 billion in revenue. With cloud computing still in its early stages and new disruptive shifts in data center architecture, we believe that the open source movement and Red Hat are well-positioned for future growth. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,139987678,169122,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2011",2011-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim.

At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its current",1531,"Thank you, Jim. We have a number financial highlights in what was overall a very strong quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced billings growth of 30%, our highest Q2 billings growth rate in 6 years. At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its current size; revenue growth of 28%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 41%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 53%, total deferred revenue growth of 25% and operating cash flow growth of 20% for the quarter and 34% year-to-date. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the modernization of enterprise data centers. Our strong and accelerating growth, particularly when compared to our competitors, shows a market share shift to Red Hat. Our top 30 deal metrics provide further evidence of Red Hat's market share gains where we saw significant increases from existing customers and new wins. The top 30 deals set a Q2 record for deals over $1 million. For only the second time in our history, all the top deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million and 3 exceeded $5 million. 
Approximately 40% of the top 30 deals include a Middleware component with 2 being stand-alone Middleware deals. The 2 largest industry verticals represented within the top 30 deals were financial services and local, state and federal governments from around the world. While investors have been concerned about IT spending in these sectors, the strength of our value proposition is further reinforced by the fact that these 2 sectors were important contributors to our accelerated and better-than-expected growth. It's probably not surprising since both of these verticals are actively trying to reduce costs and we help them do that. 
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Bookings from the channel generated 57% of our Q2 volume and 43% came from direct sales versus a 63%-37% split in Q1, directed up somewhat from last quarter because a couple of the largest deals were closed by the direct sales team. In terms of geography, 58% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 17% from Asia Pacific with 20-plus percent growth across all geographies. 
Our billings proxy for the quarter was $304 million, up 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong market demand, market share gains and a slight lengthening of average contract duration to greater than 21 months. Our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. Second quarter revenue was $281 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, also well above our guidance. For the first time, on a trailing 12-month basis, our billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $238 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constitute 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 28% from last year and up 10% sequentially. We continued to see good demand for services, which generally leads to additional future subscriptions. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for Q2. Subscription gross margin was 94% and training and services gross margin was 33%, in line with the second quarter of a year ago. 
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. We continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering, leading to Q2 non-GAAP operating expense of $161 million, up 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. At the same time, the operating leverage continues to improve. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $76 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, up 210 basis points sequentially and 250 basis points year-over-year and better than our guidance. Net interest and other income of $2.5 million is in line with guidance on Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.29, which is $0.04 higher than our guidance, up 53% compared to last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. In Q2, there was a discrete tax benefit of $2 million, which contributed $0.01 to our earnings per share. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $0.28 a share. 
Looking at the foreign exchange impact to our income statement. The average year and yen rates for the second quarter were in line with the foreign exchange rates we use for guidance and very close to the first quarter rates for that matter. However, if the second quarter had then the same foreign exchange rates as Q2 last year, revenue would've been $13 million lower and expenses $9 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $4 million lower operating income. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash investments of $1.3 billion. In the second quarter, we used cash to repurchase approximately 890,000 shares of common stock for $38 million. The remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is now $163 million. Operating cash flow of $77 million was up 20% from Q2 of last year. Strong sales execution, good linearity in the quarter and strong collections contributed to the strong cash flow performance. Foreign exchange adjusted DSOs continued to be in good shape of 53 days, consistent with last quarter and compared to 49 days from the year ago quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $813 million, an increase of $163 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 24% in U.S. dollar terms, while long-term deferred revenue grew 27% from 1 year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $27 million from last quarter. 
Let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $584 million, had real growth in Q2 of $14 million and increased an additional $3 million as a result of changes in foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q2 at $601 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $202 million, had a real increase in Q2 of approximately $9 million and benefited by changes in foreign exchange spot rates by $1 million, ending Q2 at $212 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $23 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast foreign exchange rates, for purposes of guidance, I simply put a stake in the ground and assume that foreign exchange rates for Q3 and Q4 will be where they were yesterday, that is the euro about $1.36 and the yen about JPY 77 to the dollar. That means the assumed euro rate is about 5% weaker than the Q2 average rate, while the yen rate is about 1% stronger. 
From a fundamental perspective, we are mindful of the global economic turmoil and that stock market volatility remains high. Despite these conditions, we are significantly raising our full year guidance based on our strong first-half results, combined with the ongoing momentum of our global sales pipeline. We have demonstrated in the past that we can see -- succeed in up and down markets because of the value we deliver to customers and the cost savings we help them achieve. We are raising our full year revenue guidance by about $45 million to a range of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion and our non-GAAP EPS range to $1.03 to $1.05 a share. 
From a dollar perspective, operating income is cruelly expected to exceed original estimates based upon the significant increase on revenue projected. While there is potential to exceed our original full year non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 25.7%, we are sticking to that target at this time as it continues to be our intention to invest for growth. As you know, from the past, we do not typically adjust our cash flow guidance into a year. However, based upon the strong performance in the first half of fiscal year and our current outlook, we are raising our operating cash flow estimate for the fiscal year by $20 million to a range of $350 million to $360 million. Keep in mind that we will also produce approximately $35 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities. For Q3, revenue is estimated to be approximately $288 million to $290 million, operating margin is estimated to be in the 25% area and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.25 to $0.26 a share, assuming a 31% tax rate. 
In summary, our associates and partners continue to execute well in delivering value and innovation for customers. This is a primary contributor to our market share gains and exceptional financial results.

I think perhaps some of that could be due to the RHEL 6 levers. I think you had some pricing enhancement, but you also had the free-to-fee leverage as you embark on this transition. I'm just wondering if you could talk to how sustainable this pick up in same-store sales could be as you embark on the RHEL 6 cycle going forward. If I could indulge you on a growth versus margin expansion question, a lot of SaaS companies going through extra record revenue growth would seem to be willing to sacrifice their margins in return for higher revenue growth. How do you look at that trade-off as you have these opportunities being presented to you? That's it for me."

We typically have been in the 120%, 130%, but what I saw in the deals this quarter, much larger deals, as you saw, that all of them in the top 30 were over $1 million, much greater amount of cross-selling. 40% of those deals had a JBoss component, so they're buying multiple products. And there's a significant expansion even within the existing products today that they have. And you asked a little bit about the pricing change, RHEL pricing change. Really, at this point, it still does not have much impact on these numbers. It's almost all volume related, so really good cross-selling and strong demand. Many of the large accounts continued to deploy significantly in excess of the original contracted amounts, which then result in, which in true ups in growth for those customers. The second part of the question about the growth versus margin expansion, I have my views opportunity consistent with Jim, but I'll let Jim talk about that."

And we often see customers in a number of these deals, as Charlie said, have a Middleware component. What's happening is companies start with RHEL, sees its value and start adding additional products. Some of that's virtualization. A lot of that's Middleware as well. And as we've added additional Middleware products, that certainly allowed those accounts to continue to grow. So we were seeing absolute volumes of core Linux growing, but a lot of it is -- a lot of these big accounts are expanding the breadth of the products that they're buying from us. In terms of the margin versus growth, certainly, we're focused on growth. At the same time, we continue to be comfortable that we can, especially as we continue to accelerate our growth rate, we can continue to invest heavily in the business and still return reasonable margins. So obviously, it depends on the opportunities in front of us. I think as you can see the mix in our line items, we've been able to deliver margin improvement by reducing G&A and actually as a percentage of revenue and actually maintaining or often increasing sales and marketing and R&D as a percent of revenue over the last couple of years. So we'll continue to make those trade-offs going forward. But obviously, the best of both worlds is take it out of the back office and drop it to the bottom line and reinvest. And I think we've been very effective in doing that."

But what I'd say is, anecdotally, we're just seeing a massive number of requests for POCs as people got a chance to see RHEV 3. As you said, there are some large customers who are upset with that other virtualization player. There are pricing changes. There are a number of Linux shops who really want a Linux-based management tool.

And so obviously, because it is not for sale, I'll really believe all the kudos when people start writing these checks, right? So again, I think we have a great position. We got a lot of momentum. If it's a language that runs in a Java virtual machine, we have, by far, the best alternative out there. And we're having some great pick up in usage. But again, right now it's free, so we'll see how that goes. CloudForms, I think at least the customers that I have talked to and the feedback we've gotten has been positive in the sense of we're not trying to compete with, say, EC2 or other lower-level management platforms, right? So cloud forms will help manage it at slightly higher level and it's compatible with EC2, obviously RHEV and others. And so getting good feedback on continuing to push a truly layered modular architecture. But again, that's not out yet and I'll believe it when I see the real revenue numbers once it's out in GA."

And I guess what I said pretty much every time is we see incremental improvement. We've never seen a step function change. But things, different activities like cleaning the data, different approaches with our sales force, employing third-parties to help with renewals over the long tail of the small customers, particularly in the SMB market, those things are producing results. From a dollar perspective, the results probably are still relatively small. But from a customer retention on the real small account, it's important because these small accounts will grow to be medium-sized accounts and large accounts in the years ahead. Like I said, the short answer is, we believe we'll continue to make incremental improvements in our renewal rates on the SMB end of the spectrum."

We're watching it carefully, especially on the small deals and how it makes up the base. Not only can those become larger customers, but the impact long term in our business is multiplicative. By renewing something this year that would not have renewed before, that's something next year we have that we can go renew, right? So you can imagine the multiplicative effect over the year or so. But based on our analysis, a few points change in the renewal rates in those small deals. Five years from now is a very material impact on revenue. So as Charlie said, yes, these are newer initiatives, they're going well, seeing steady improvement and feeling really good about it."

We're in the fourth inning on that. We're going to the IDC data, say, seventh or eighth. And just to give you an example, I was with a couple of our very large banking customers and where -- they have very large deployments of RHEL in the investment banking side. Most of the customers I was talking to this week also have large commercial banking operations. And they had barely started on Linux on the commercial banking side. But what they wanted to talk about is how they do that and how they deploy that faster. And if you look at the infrastructures I'm talking about, they had as much on 4 on the commercial side available on the investment banking side. We barely even touched those. If you look at telcos, there's a set of telco workloads that we have moved over to Linux. But there is so much in the core operating systems and building systems I know that we have yet to get. And so at least when I talked to our sales force and they look at the kind of multi-year pipeline, it's huge. You have whole markets, like Korea, that has barely even started on Linux, right?

Red Hat Associates around the globe executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results. While the macroeconomic environment remained volatile, we continue to experience broad demand for our open source solutions in every major geography during the second quarter. We drove significant upselling within our top deals and we added a number of large wins from customers who migrated away from proprietary products and other Linux distributions. Customers are increasingly turning to Red Hat as they look to modernize their data center infrastructure and fundamentally change the way they deliver IT services. 
Let me review some of the highlights for our second quarter, which combined with strong demand heading into the second half of this year, provides us with confidence to again raise our full year growth outlook, as Charlie will explain later. 
First, sales execution was once again strong in Q2 and we delivered accelerating year-over-year organic revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our 27% revenue growth to the first half of this year had significantly outpaced last year's 20% first half growth, given our investments in sales and marketing and R&D are clearly paying off. 
Second, even with this focused investment for growth, we continue to deliver leverage, which enabled our operating income to significantly outpace revenue. Our operating income is up 41% in Q2 and up 35% in the first half of this year. 
Third, we continue to drive strong cash flow growth with operating cash flow up 20% for the quarter and 34% for the first half of the year. I'm also pleased to report that all of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal in the second quarter, not only renewed, but they did sell at a total value of over 150% of the original value. This was our strongest upsell percentage since we started tracking this metric, which is usually in the 120% to 130% range. Customers across a variety of segments and geographies contributed to this record. 
The value and innovation that customers receive from a Red Hat subscription is a key demand driver for us in both good times and in challenging ones. For instance, this quarter, one of our largest renewals and upsell came from a technology firm that has been a staunch proponent of UNIX for several decades. Given the value, performance and capabilities of RHEL, they have now -- have a substantial deployment in their internal infrastructure. 
From a demand perspective, it is clear from our results that there's a fundamental shift happening in the way IT is being delivered. Recently, the former U.S. CIO, Vivek Kundra, wrote an article that demonstrates this need for change. His article spells out the issues government agencies face when purchasing, deploying and maintaining inefficient software and hardware. To combat these issues, government agencies are now shifting away from the older model of customized, deeply integrated IT purchases, which often came with heavy maintenance fees and the need for specialized IT staff and expensive customization. Rather, they choose a new model that relies on modularity, reuse, flexibility and the interoperability of systems that they control and are not locked into. 
Open source is in the sweet spot and the U.S. government's IT reform effort and cloud-first policy are examples [indiscernible]. Open source and Red Hat can enable that change. It is not just the U.S. government that's embracing open source solutions. We're seeing governments around the world choosing open source to solve the issues associated with traditional IT deployments. Our research indicates that more than 40 countries have adopted policies that promote a fair playing field for open source or emphasize technology neutrality for open source when compared to proprietary software, notably in the U.K., India, Brazil and Australia. This type of validation enables Red Hat to win and strengthen relationships with a government stamp of approval. 
The issues in Kundra's article are not isolated to governments but are very similar to discussions I've had with enterprise customers around the world. This change in IT decision-making is also bolstered by the increasingly younger generation of IT leaders who are not leaded to the old model of enterprise software purchases. These customers want to partner with Red Hat to reduce costs while modernizing their IT infrastructure to enable applications to run on bare metal, virtualized and in the cloud. 
Now let me provide an update on some of our virtualization and cloud computing highlights and initiatives. This quarter, Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications and information services company, joined our expanding ecosystem of cloud computing providers who have partnered with Red Hat to provide a choice for enterprise customers in the cloud. Telstra has joined our Red Hat certified cloud provider program that provides a reliable, scalable, supported and consistent environment for enterprise cloud deployments. 
In Q2, we announced the next generation of Red Hat's virtualization management product, RHEV 3 in Beta. RHEV 3 adds new features and important capabilities focused on performance, memory and scalability for managing virtual guests. RHEV 3 now runs as a Java application on our JBoss Middleware and on our RHEL platform with an updated KVM hypervisor. We've also built a partner ecosystem with top ISPs to provide an excellent solutions for customers who are seeking choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions. We expect to release the GA version of RHEV 3 later this year. We also announced that OpenShift, our platform-as-a-service offering, now supports Java EE 6. OpenShift was the first pad in the industry to deliver JEE 6, simplifying how developers build and deploy applications in the cloud. 
At Red Hat Summit, we jointly announced the creation of the Open Virtualization Alliance or OVA with a number of industry partners. The consortium is committed to fostering the adoption of open source virtualization technologies, primarily the KVM hypervisor, in driving industrywide adoption. The OVA membership has now grown to over 200 technology companies, including some of the largest technology companies in the world. This broad membership of technology leaders to cloud startups is backing KVM as an enterprise class hypervisor for both on-premise and cloud deployments. We are pleased with the solid progress on these important initiatives as we continue to build out our cloud offerings and ecosystems.
On a final note, last month, Linux celebrated its 20th anniversary, and I want to recognize the contribution of Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman and the other early trailblazers of open source. Without open source and the collaborative development model, many of the key technologies that make our lives more productive and interesting would not exist. This year, Red Hat will be the first open source company to surpass $1 billion in revenue. With cloud computing still in its early stages and new disruptive shifts in data center architecture, we believe that the open source movement and Red Hat are well-positioned for future growth. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,139987678,169246,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2011",2011-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. We have a number of financial highlights in what was overall a very strong quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced billings growth of 30%, our highest Q2 billings growth rate in 6 years. At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its curr",1533,"Thank you, Jim. We have a number of financial highlights in what was overall a very strong quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced billings growth of 30%, our highest Q2 billings growth rate in 6 years. At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its current size; revenue growth of 28%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 41%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 53%, total deferred revenue growth of 25% and operating cash flow growth of 20% for the quarter and 34% year-to-date. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the modernization of enterprise data centers. Our strong and accelerating growth, particularly when compared to our competitors, shows a market share shift to Red Hat. Our top 30 deal metrics provide further evidence of Red Hat's market share gains where we saw significant increases from existing customers and new wins. The top 30 deals set a Q2 record for deals over $1 million. For only the second time in our history, all the top deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million and 3 exceeded $5 million. 
Approximately 40% of the top 30 deals include a Middleware component with 2 being stand-alone Middleware deals. The 2 largest industry verticals represented within the top 30 deals were financial services and local, state and federal governments from around the world. While investors have been concerned about IT spending in these sectors, the strength of our value proposition is further reinforced by the fact that these 2 sectors were important contributors to our accelerated and better-than-expected growth. It's probably not surprising since both of these verticals are actively trying to reduce costs and we help them do that. 
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Bookings from the channel generated 57% of our Q2 volume and 43% came from direct sales versus a 63%-37% split in Q1, directed up somewhat from last quarter because a couple of the largest deals were closed by the direct sales team. In terms of geography, 58% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 17% from Asia Pacific with 20-plus percent growth across all geographies. 
Our billings proxy for the quarter was $304 million, up 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong market demand, market share gains and a slight lengthening of average contract duration to greater than 21 months. Our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. Second quarter revenue was $281 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, also well above our guidance. For the first time, on a trailing 12-month basis, our billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $238 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constitute 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 28% from last year and up 10% sequentially. We continued to see good demand for services, which generally leads to additional future subscriptions. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for Q2. Subscription gross margin was 94% and training and services gross margin was 33%, in line with the second quarter of a year ago. 
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. We continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering, leading to Q2 non-GAAP operating expense of $161 million, up 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. At the same time, the operating leverage continues to improve. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $76 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, up 210 basis points sequentially and 250 basis points year-over-year and better than our guidance. Net interest and other income of $2.5 million is in line with guidance on Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.29, which is $0.04 higher than our guidance, up 53% compared to last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. In Q2, there was a discrete tax benefit of $2 million, which contributed $0.01 to our earnings per share. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $0.28 a share. 
Looking at the foreign exchange impact to our income statement. The average euro and yen rates for the second quarter were in line with the foreign exchange rates we use for guidance and very close to the first quarter rates for that matter. However, if the second quarter had then the same foreign exchange rates as Q2 last year, revenue would've been $13 million lower and expenses $9 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $4 million lower operating income. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash investments of $1.3 billion. In the second quarter, we used cash to repurchase approximately 890,000 shares of common stock for $38 million. The remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is now $163 million. Operating cash flow of $77 million was up 20% from Q2 of last year. Strong sales execution, good linearity in the quarter and strong collections contributed to the strong cash flow performance. Foreign exchange adjusted DSOs continued to be in good shape of 53 days, consistent with last quarter and compared to 49 days from the year ago quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $813 million, an increase of $163 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 24% in U.S. dollar terms, while long-term deferred revenue grew 27% from 1 year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $27 million from last quarter. 
Let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $584 million, had real growth in Q2 of $14 million and increased an additional $3 million as a result of changes in foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q2 at $601 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $202 million, had a real increase in Q2 of approximately $9 million and benefited by changes in foreign exchange spot rates by $1 million, ending Q2 at $212 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $23 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast foreign exchange rates, for purposes of guidance, I simply put a stake in the ground and assume that foreign exchange rates for Q3 and Q4 will be where they were yesterday, that is the euro about $1.36 and the yen about JPY 77 to the dollar. That means the assumed euro rate is about 5% weaker than the Q2 average rate, while the yen rate is about 1% stronger. 
From a fundamental perspective, we are mindful of the global economic turmoil and that stock market volatility remains high. Despite these conditions, we are significantly raising our full year guidance based on our strong first-half results, combined with the ongoing momentum of our global sales pipeline. We have demonstrated in the past that we can see -- succeed in up and down markets because of the value we deliver to customers and the cost savings we help them achieve. We are raising our full year revenue guidance by about $45 million to a range of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion and our non-GAAP EPS range to $1.03 to $1.05 a share. 
From a dollar perspective, operating income is cruelly expected to exceed our original estimates based upon the significant increase on revenue projected. While there is potential to exceed our original full year non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 25.7%, we are sticking to that target at this time as it continues to be our intention to invest for growth. As you know, from the past, we do not typically adjust our cash flow guidance into a year. However, based upon the strong performance in the first half of fiscal year and our current outlook, we are raising our operating cash flow estimate for the fiscal year by $20 million to a range of $350 million to $360 million. Keep in mind that we will also produce approximately $35 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities. For Q3, revenue is estimated to be approximately $288 million to $290 million, operating margin is estimated to be in the 25% area and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.25 to $0.26 a share, assuming a 31% tax rate. 
In summary, our associates and partners continue to execute well in delivering value and innovation for customers. This is a primary contributor to our market share gains and exceptional financial results.

In terms of the billing duration, it typically follows fairly close to the contract duration. Just a reminder, when we do long-term deals through partners, they typically build the entire thing in advance. And when we do deals direct, sometimes they're billed in advance and they're sometimes billed over a longer period. But the change in long-term deferred revenue, you can see for the quarter, we added $9 million in real increase and $1 million in foreign exchange.

And there's a significant expansion even within the existing products today that they have. And you asked a little bit about the pricing change, RHEL pricing change. Really, at this point, it still does not have much impact on these numbers. It's almost all volume related, so really good cross-selling and strong demand. Many of the large accounts continued to deploy significantly in excess of the original contracted amounts, which then result in, which in true ups in growth for those customers.

What's happening is companies start with RHEL, sees its value and start adding additional products. Some of that's virtualization. A lot of that's Middleware as well. And as we've added additional Middleware products, that certainly allowed those accounts to continue to grow. So we were seeing absolute volumes of core Linux growing, but a lot of it is -- a lot of these big accounts are expanding the breadth of the products that they're buying from us. In terms of the margin versus growth, certainly, we're focused on growth. At the same time, we continue to be comfortable that we can, especially as we continue to accelerate our growth rate, we can continue to invest heavily in the business and still return reasonable margins. So obviously, it depends on the opportunities in front of us. I think as you can see the mix in our line items, we've been able to deliver margin improvement by reducing G&A and actually as a percentage of revenue and actually maintaining or often increasing sales and marketing and R&D as a percent of revenue over the last couple of years. So we'll continue to make those trade-offs going forward. But obviously, the best of both worlds is take it out of the back office and drop it to the bottom line and reinvest. And I think we've been very effective in doing that."

And so obviously, because it is not for sale, I'll really believe all the kudos when people start writing these checks, right? So again, I think we have a great position. We got a lot of momentum. If it's a language that runs in a Java virtual machine, we have, by far, the best alternative out there. And we're having some great pick up in usage. But again, right now it's free, so we'll see how that goes. CloudForms, I think at least the customers that I have talked to and the feedback we've gotten has been positive in the sense of we're not trying to compete with, say, EC2 or other lower-level management platforms, right?

And so I do think we're starting to get more commercial attention from ISVs and I think on the margin that helps. Secondly, we've actually worked to start build out a much broader, deeper, richer set of certifications around JBoss.

We're in the fourth inning on that. We're going to the IDC data, say, seventh or eighth. And just to give you an example, I was with a couple of our very large banking customers and where -- they have very large deployments of RHEL in the investment banking side. Most of the customers I was talking to this week also have large commercial banking operations. And they had barely started on Linux on the commercial banking side. But what they wanted to talk about is how they do that and how they deploy that faster. And if you look at the infrastructures I'm talking about, they had as much on 4 on the commercial side available on the investment banking side. We barely even touched those. If you look at telcos, there's a set of telco workloads that we have moved over to Linux. But there is so much in the core operating systems and building systems I know that we have yet to get. And so at least when I talked to our sales force and they look at the kind of multi-year pipeline, it's huge. You have whole markets, like Korea, that has barely even started on Linux, right? So -- and you look forward. There's a lot out there. And I can't think those numbers with you with IDC, but we are working very hard to understand why our sales force is still positive relative to IDC or Gartner."

Red Hat Associates around the globe executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results. While the macroeconomic environment remained volatile, we continue to experience broad demand for our open source solutions in every major geography during the second quarter. We drove significant upselling within our top deals and we added a number of large wins from customers who migrated away from proprietary products and other Linux distributions. Customers are increasingly turning to Red Hat as they look to modernize their data center infrastructure and fundamentally change the way they deliver IT services. 
Let me review some of the highlights for our second quarter, which combined with strong demand heading into the second half of this year, provides us with confidence to again raise our full year growth outlook, as Charlie will explain later. 
First, sales execution was once again strong in Q2 and we delivered accelerating year-over-year organic revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our 27% revenue growth to the first half of this year had significantly outpaced last year's 20% first half growth, given our investments in sales and marketing and R&D are clearly paying off. 
Second, even with this focused investment for growth, we continue to deliver leverage, which enabled our operating income to significantly outpace revenue. Our operating income is up 41% in Q2 and up 35% in the first half of this year. 
Third, we continue to drive strong cash flow growth with operating cash flow up 20% for the quarter and 34% for the first half of the year. I'm also pleased to report that all of our top 25 deals that were up for renewal in the second quarter, not only renewed, but they did sell at a total value of over 150% of the original value. This was our strongest upsell percentage since we started tracking this metric, which is usually in the 120% to 130% range. Customers across a variety of segments and geographies contributed to this record. 
The value and innovation that customers receive from a Red Hat subscription is a key demand driver for us in both good times and in challenging ones. For instance, this quarter, one of our largest renewals and upsell came from a technology firm that has been a staunch proponent of UNIX for several decades. Given the value, performance and capabilities of RHEL, they have now -- have a substantial deployment in their internal infrastructure. 
From a demand perspective, it is clear from our results that there's a fundamental shift happening in the way IT is being delivered. Recently, the former U.S. CIO, Vivek Kundra, wrote an article that demonstrates this need for change. His article spells out the issues government agencies face when purchasing, deploying and maintaining inefficient software and hardware. To combat these issues, government agencies are now shifting away from the older model of customized, deeply integrated IT purchases, which often came with heavy maintenance fees and the need for specialized IT staff and expensive customization. Rather, they choose a new model that relies on modularity, reuse, flexibility and the interoperability of systems that they control and are not locked into. 
Open source is in the sweet spot and the U.S. government's IT reform effort and cloud-first policy are examples [indiscernible]. Open source and Red Hat can enable that change. It is not just the U.S. government that's embracing open source solutions. We're seeing governments around the world choosing open source to solve the issues associated with traditional IT deployments. Our research indicates that more than 40 countries have adopted policies that promote a fair playing field for open source or emphasize technology neutrality for open source when compared to proprietary software, notably in the U.K., India, Brazil and Australia. This type of validation enables Red Hat to win and strengthen relationships with a government stamp of approval. 
The issues in Kundra's article are not isolated to governments but are very similar to discussions I've had with enterprise customers around the world. This change in IT decision-making is also bolstered by the increasingly younger generation of IT leaders who are not leaded to the old model of enterprise software purchases. These customers want to partner with Red Hat to reduce costs while modernizing their IT infrastructure to enable applications to run on bare metal, virtualized and in the cloud. 
Now let me provide an update on some of our virtualization and cloud computing highlights and initiatives. This quarter, Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications and information services company, joined our expanding ecosystem of cloud computing providers who have partnered with Red Hat to provide a choice for enterprise customers in the cloud. Telstra has joined our Red Hat certified cloud provider program that provides a reliable, scalable, supported and consistent environment for enterprise cloud deployments. 
In Q2, we announced the next generation of Red Hat's virtualization management product, RHEV 3 in Beta. RHEV 3 adds new features and important capabilities focused on performance, memory and scalability for managing virtual guests. RHEV 3 now runs as a Java application on our JBoss Middleware and on our RHEL platform with an updated KVM hypervisor. We've also built a partner ecosystem with top ISPs to provide an excellent solutions for customers who are seeking choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions. We expect to release the GA version of RHEV 3 later this year. We also announced that OpenShift, our platform-as-a-service offering, now supports Java EE 6. OpenShift was the first pad in the industry to deliver JEE 6, simplifying how developers build and deploy applications in the cloud. 
At Red Hat Summit, we jointly announced the creation of the Open Virtualization Alliance or OVA with a number of industry partners. The consortium is committed to fostering the adoption of open source virtualization technologies, primarily the KVM hypervisor, in driving industrywide adoption. The OVA membership has now grown to over 200 technology companies, including some of the largest technology companies in the world. This broad membership of technology leaders to cloud startups is backing KVM as an enterprise class hypervisor for both on-premise and cloud deployments. We are pleased with the solid progress on these important initiatives as we continue to build out our cloud offerings and ecosystems.
On a final note, last month, Linux celebrated its 20th anniversary, and I want to recognize the contribution of Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman and the other early trailblazers of open source. Without open source and the collaborative development model, many of the key technologies that make our lives more productive and interesting would not exist. This year, Red Hat will be the first open source company to surpass $1 billion in revenue. With cloud computing still in its early stages and new disruptive shifts in data center architecture, we believe that the open source movement and Red Hat are well-positioned for future growth. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,139987678,169570,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2011",2011-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. We have a number of financial highlights in what was overall a very strong quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced billings growth of 30%, our highest Q2 billings growth rate in 6 years. At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its curr",1533,"Thank you, Jim. We have a number of financial highlights in what was overall a very strong quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced billings growth of 30%, our highest Q2 billings growth rate in 6 years. At that time, Red Hat was 1/4 of its current size; revenue growth of 28%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 41%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 53%, total deferred revenue growth of 25% and operating cash flow growth of 20% for the quarter and 34% year-to-date. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the modernization of enterprise data centers. Our strong and accelerating growth, particularly when compared to our competitors, shows a market share shift to Red Hat. Our top 30 deal metrics provide further evidence of Red Hat's market share gains where we saw significant increases from existing customers and new wins. The top 30 deals set a Q2 record for deals over $1 million. For only the second time in our history, all the top deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million and 3 exceeded $5 million. 
Approximately 40% of the top 30 deals include a Middleware component with 2 being stand-alone Middleware deals. The 2 largest industry verticals represented within the top 30 deals were financial services and local, state and federal governments from around the world. While investors have been concerned about IT spending in these sectors, the strength of our value proposition is further reinforced by the fact that these 2 sectors were important contributors to our accelerated and better-than-expected growth. It's probably not surprising since both of these verticals are actively trying to reduce costs and we help them do that. 
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Bookings from the channel generated 57% of our Q2 volume and 43% came from direct sales versus a 63%-37% split in Q1, directed up somewhat from last quarter because a couple of the largest deals were closed by the direct sales team. In terms of geography, 58% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 17% from Asia Pacific with 20-plus percent growth across all geographies. 
Our billings proxy for the quarter was $304 million, up 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong market demand, market share gains and a slight lengthening of average contract duration to greater than 21 months. Our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. Second quarter revenue was $281 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, also well above our guidance. For the first time, on a trailing 12-month basis, our billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 28% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $238 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constitute 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 28% from last year and up 10% sequentially. We continued to see good demand for services, which generally leads to additional future subscriptions. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for Q2. Subscription gross margin was 94% and training and services gross margin was 33%, in line with the second quarter of a year ago. 
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. We continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering, leading to Q2 non-GAAP operating expense of $161 million, up 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. At the same time, the operating leverage continues to improve. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $76 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, up 210 basis points sequentially and 250 basis points year-over-year and better than our guidance. Net interest and other income of $2.5 million is in line with guidance on Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.29, which is $0.04 higher than our guidance, up 53% compared to last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. In Q2, there was a discrete tax benefit of $2 million, which contributed $0.01 to our earnings per share. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $0.28 a share. 
Looking at the foreign exchange impact to our income statement. The average euro and yen rates for the second quarter were in line with the foreign exchange rates we use for guidance and very close to the first quarter rates for that matter. However, if the second quarter had then the same foreign exchange rates as Q2 last year, revenue would've been $13 million lower and expenses $9 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $4 million lower operating income. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash investments of $1.3 billion. In the second quarter, we used cash to repurchase approximately 890,000 shares of common stock for $38 million. The remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is now $163 million. Operating cash flow of $77 million was up 20% from Q2 of last year. Strong sales execution, good linearity in the quarter and strong collections contributed to the strong cash flow performance. Foreign exchange adjusted DSOs continued to be in good shape of 53 days, consistent with last quarter and compared to 49 days from the year ago quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $813 million, an increase of $163 million or 25% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 24% in U.S. dollar terms, while long-term deferred revenue grew 27% from 1 year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $27 million from last quarter. 
Let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $584 million, had real growth in Q2 of $14 million and increased an additional $3 million as a result of changes in foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q2 at $601 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $202 million, had a real increase in Q2 of approximately $9 million and benefited by changes in foreign exchange spot rates by $1 million, ending Q2 at $212 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $23 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast foreign exchange rates, for purposes of guidance, I simply put a stake in the ground and assume that foreign exchange rates for Q3 and Q4 will be where they were yesterday, that is the euro about $1.36 and the yen about JPY 77 to the dollar. That means the assumed euro rate is about 5% weaker than the Q2 average rate, while the yen rate is about 1% stronger. 
From a fundamental perspective, we are mindful of the global economic turmoil and that stock market volatility remains high. Despite these conditions, we are significantly raising our full year guidance based on our strong first-half results, combined with the ongoing momentum of our global sales pipeline. We have demonstrated in the past that we can see -- succeed in up and down markets because of the value we deliver to customers and the cost savings we help them achieve. We are raising our full year revenue guidance by about $45 million to a range of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion and our non-GAAP EPS range to $1.03 to $1.05 a share. 
From a dollar perspective, operating income is cruelly expected to exceed our original estimates based upon the significant increase on revenue projected. While there is potential to exceed our original full year non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 25.7%, we are sticking to that target at this time as it continues to be our intention to invest for growth. As you know, from the past, we do not typically adjust our cash flow guidance into a year. However, based upon the strong performance in the first half of fiscal year and our current outlook, we are raising our operating cash flow estimate for the fiscal year by $20 million to a range of $350 million to $360 million. Keep in mind that we will also produce approximately $35 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities. For Q3, revenue is estimated to be approximately $288 million to $290 million, operating margin is estimated to be in the 25% area and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.25 to $0.26 a share, assuming a 31% tax rate. 
In summary, our associates and partners continue to execute well in delivering value and innovation for customers. This is a primary contributor to our market share gains and exceptional financial results.

In terms of the billing duration, it typically follows fairly close to the contract duration. Just a reminder, when we do long-term deals through partners, they typically build the entire thing in advance. And when we do deals direct, sometimes they're billed in advance and they're sometimes billed over a longer period. But the change in long-term deferred revenue, you can see for the quarter, we added $9 million in real increase and $1 million in foreign exchange. It's fairly consistent with what we saw from the bookings change and duration."

And there's a significant expansion even within the existing products today that they have. And you asked a little bit about the pricing change, RHEL pricing change. Really, at this point, it still does not have much impact on these numbers. It's almost all volume related, so really good cross-selling and strong demand. Many of the large accounts continued to deploy significantly in excess of the original contracted amounts, which then result in, which in true ups in growth for those customers.

And we often see customers in a number of these deals, as Charlie said, have a Middleware component. What's happening is companies start with RHEL, sees its value and start adding additional products. Some of that's virtualization. A lot of that's Middleware as well. And as we've added additional Middleware products, that certainly allowed those accounts to continue to grow. So we were seeing absolute volumes of core Linux growing, but a lot of it is -- a lot of these big accounts are expanding the breadth of the products that they're buying from us. In terms of the margin versus growth, certainly, we're focused on growth. At the same time, we continue to be comfortable that we can, especially as we continue to accelerate our growth rate, we can continue to invest heavily in the business and still return reasonable margins. So obviously, it depends on the opportunities in front of us. I think as you can see the mix in our line items, we've been able to deliver margin improvement by reducing G&A and actually as a percentage of revenue and actually maintaining or often increasing sales and marketing and R&D as a percent of revenue over the last couple of years. So we'll continue to make those trade-offs going forward. But obviously, the best of both worlds is take it out of the back office and drop it to the bottom line and reinvest. And I think we've been very effective in doing that."

But what I'd say is, anecdotally, we're just seeing a massive number of requests for POCs as people got a chance to see RHEV 3. As you said, there are some large customers who are upset with that other virtualization player. There are pricing changes. There are a number of Linux shops who really want a Linux-based management tool.

So cloud forms will help manage it at slightly higher level and it's compatible with EC2, obviously RHEV and others.

We've always had thousands and thousands of ISV relationships of certified ISV vendors. It seems over the last year, and this is more anecdotal, but seeing how strategic we are becoming to some ISVs, I think ISVs are going from just certifying on RHEL to actually wanting to go to market and work together, if there's kind of this view among many ISVs that Windows and RHEL will be the 2 winning operating systems. And so I do think we're starting to get more commercial attention from ISVs and I think on the margin that helps. Secondly, we've actually worked to start build out a much broader, deeper, richer set of certifications around JBoss. And that was an investment we started making about 18 months ago, which I do think is paying off as we have much better both kind of attention and a set of certifications on the JBoss side from ISVs."

But things, different activities like cleaning the data, different approaches with our sales force, employing third-parties to help with renewals over the long tail of the small customers, particularly in the SMB market, those things are producing results. From a dollar perspective, the results probably are still relatively small. But from a customer retention on the real small account, it's important because these small accounts will grow to be medium-sized accounts and large accounts in the years ahead.

And just to give you an example, I was with a couple of our very large banking customers and where -- they have very large deployments of RHEL in the investment banking side. Most of the customers I was talking to this week also have large commercial banking operations. And they had barely started on Linux on the commercial banking side. But what they wanted to talk about is how they do that and how they deploy that faster. And if you look at the infrastructures I'm talking about, they had as much on 4 on the commercial side available on the investment banking side. We barely even touched those. If you look at telcos, there's a set of telco workloads that we have moved over to Linux. But there is so much in the core operating systems and building systems I know that we have yet to get.

Market demand for Red Hat remains strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our cu",1096,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. Market demand for Red Hat remains strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our customers. The combination of these factors contributed to strong year-over-year organic growth across each of our key financial metrics, including billings, revenue, operating income and cash flow, leading to results that were at or above the high end of our expectations for every metric. 
Even in a challenging global economy, demand for Red Hat's innovative solutions continue to benefit from customers who are driving productivity gains and agility across their organizations by investing in their IT infrastructure. 
Now let me provide some recent business highlights. Our big news this quarter was the further expansion of our market opportunity and footprint in the data center by entering the storage space via the acquisition of the open source software company, Gluster Inc. This software-only solution addresses storage of unstructured data spanning from bare metal to virtualized instances and in cloud deployments. This $4 billion addressable market, which is growing rapidly, is a great place for Red Hat to enter the big data world and provide storage in the cloud. 
Storage is complementary to our business since with our core infrastructure stack and is aligned with our enterprise customer base. Also, the Gluster technology has me excited. It is a software solution for solving the scale out storage problem. It's open sourced with a vibrant community and fits well with our cloud vision of being able to deploy applications anywhere. It's already used by companies like Pandora and Limelight for their unstructured data needs. 
The cut to IT landscape is changing, storage architectures are changing, too. Traditional hardware-based storage solutions present a problem for customers who are now faced with having to replicate data in multiple cloud, including on-premise and public. There's a need for a common storage solution for customer data, whether that data -- wherever that data maybe. Because Gluster is software-based, it's a great solution for the challenge of storage in the cloud. 
For example, you can't ship hardware to Amazon to run on top of their cloud but you can move the Gluster solution into a virtual machine instance running on a public cloud. Gluster provides choice. It's already available on Amazon's Cloud, and we are driving innovation to enable it with other cloud offerings. The Gluster technology, now known as Red Hat Storage, will be a foundation to bring products to market that not only provide a compelling value and performance proposition but solve some of the new challenges of storing the explosion of unstructured data. 
I'm pleased to announce that we rapidly completed integration and launched the first Red Hat-branded storage product earlier this month. It is an enterprise-ready product hardened by our engineering team running on RHEL and supported by the broader Red Hat team. It is initially launched in North America, and our plan is to take this product global as we build out our sales and support team over the next year. 
Open source technologies like Red Hat Storage are not only disrupting antiquated expensive IT products in the market today but more importantly, they are providing solutions to the new challenges facing enterprises. 
On the product front, we also continue to evolve our overall set of core solutions for the data center. We launched the latest version of our flagship operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2. RHEL 6.2 includes significant improvements  in virtualization, resource management and high-availability. The enhancements in RHEL 6.2 is designed to increase performance and scalability for running enterprise workloads across physical, virtual and cloud computing environments. 
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization or RHEV 3.0, the next generation of RHEV virtualization management product, continues to proceed well through the product delivery process. RHEV 3 which runs as a Java application on JBoss middleware and RHEL is currently in public beta. The customer reaction has been very positive. Since the public release, we have seen significant downloads from customers who are looking for choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions for their virtual infrastructure. We expect out general availability of RHEV 3.0 later this quarter. 
Also during this quarter, we continued to take an active leadership role in the open-source community. Here are a few highlights. We announced our participation in the Open Compute Project established by Facebook, with the goal to building one of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. We released Fedora 16, our community-supported open-sourced Linux distribution. As a vehicle for the initial integration of cutting-edge technology, Fedora enables us to vet nascent capabilities in areas such as cloud and virtualization. 
We've also increased our activity in the Open Stack community by way of joining the core development team, integration into Facebook and with the acquisition of Gluster. The Open Virtualization Alliance continues to thrive in support of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization's core Hypervisor technology, KVM. While over 200 industry leaders have joined the alliance in support of KVM since May. 
As a final highlight, Red Hat was recognized by Forbes as one of their Top 10 Most Innovative Growth Companies, providing our customers with proven innovative solutions that drive greater performance, increases the loyalty of our customers. This high level of trust and loyalty that Red Hat -- that customers have placed in Red Hat is evident in our largest deals that renewed last quarter. Once again, we renewed 25 out of 25 deals, and they did sell at a total value of over 130% of the original value. 
This rate of upsell is particularly promising since it includes some of our largest financial services deals from 3 years ago. This is a sector that is not fully recovered from the recession but continues to increase collaboration and purchases with Red Hat to drive innovation, performance and cost savings. 
In summary, we continue to expand Red Hat's market leadership position by providing innovative open source solutions with strong ROIs for the enterprise customer. I want to thank our associates around the globe for their hard work that continue to produce exceptional results for our shareholders. 
I also want to recognize Alex Pinchev, our Head of Global Sales, for his service to Red Hat, and we wish him great success at his new position. Alex will be leaving Red Hat next month to become CEO of Kronos, a Red Hat partner. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,143832151,202732,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 19, 2011",2011-12-19,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D. Here are just a few of the fina",1741,"Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D. 
Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year:  Organic billings and revenue growth of 23%, total deferred revenue growth of 20%, even faster growth and profitability and cash flow with non-GAAP operating income growth of 36%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 40% and operating cash flow growth of 36%. We're continuing to bring market share in the data center. With focused spending and investing in Q3, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver expanding profitability and cash flow margins. 
These metrics are some of the highest in our sector when compared to other successful software companies when they reach the $1 billion revenue mark. Our top 30 deal metrics for the quarter provide further evidence of Red Hat's execution. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we set a record for deals over $1 million. 27 of the top 30 deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million, a 69% increase over Q3 of last fiscal year, and 5 deals exceeded $5 million, a new quarterly record. 
Approximately 40% of our top deals include a middleware component, with 4 being standalone middleware deals. All 4 standalone middleware deals were over $1 million. 
The 3 largest verticals represented in the top 30 deals were financial services, technology and governments around the world. We continue to see large deals and growth potential across a number of verticals, including those that are facing greater macro challenges. 
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Channel bookings generated 64% of our Q3 volume, and 36% came from direct sales versus a 57%/43% split in Q2. Some of our largest deals this quarter came through the channel in the Americas, somewhat skewing the channel and geographic mix in that direction. 
In terms of geography, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 16% from Asia-Pacific compared to 58%, 25%, 17% split last quarter. We continued to see solid performance in each geography with double-digit growth across all regions. However, as I just mentioned, on a relative basis, Americas was a higher percentage this quarter as a result of a number of large deals and the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to virtually every other currency. 
Our billings proxy for the quarter was $322 million, up 23% year-over-year, representing 6 straight quarters of 20%-plus growth. This is the highest Q3 billings growth rate in 4 years. Average contract duration continues to be approximately 21 months. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. Third quarter revenue was $290 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 24% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $247 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constituted 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 18% from last year and up 1% sequentially. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for the third quarter. Subscription gross margin was steady at 94%, and training and services gross margin showed nice improvement of 38% and 33% last quarter. Higher services margin were driven by better performance and better utilization rates in both consulting and training. 
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses, we continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering. Within Q3, non-GAAP operating expense of $169 million, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. We added over 250 net new employees during the quarter, including over 60 from the acquisition of Gluster. 
Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $79 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, in line sequentially but up 260 basis points year-over-year. This was well above our guidance as a result of better performance from our Servers business and continued operational efficiencies from our G&A team. We're just at the beginning of our building out our storage effort, and I'll have more to say about this in my comments on guidance. 
Net interest and other income of $2 million is in line with guidance in Q3 last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.28, which is $0.02 higher than the high end of our guidance and up 40% compared to last year. 
Most foreign currencies weakened against the dollar in Q3 and have continued that trend to date. Looking at the impact of foreign exchange in our income statement, if Q3 had been at the same foreign exchange rate as Q2, revenue would have been $5 million higher, expenses $4 million higher and operating income higher -- $1 million higher than we expected, that we reported, sorry. In Q3 -- if Q3 have been reported using the same FX rates as Q3 last year, revenue would have been $2 million lower, expenses $1 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $1 million lower operating income. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow of $97 million was up 36% from Q3 last year. Strong growth in net income and deferred revenue contributed to the strong cash flow performance. FX adjusted DSO was 60 days, up from last quarter and the year-ago quarter but still within our target range. Accounts receivable and DSO were both up at November 30 due to the large number of high-value deals that closed towards the end of the quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $820 million, an increase of $134 million or 20% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 20% in U.S. dollar terms while long-term deferred revenue grew 19% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $6 million from last quarter. Exchange rate changes were significant quarter-over-quarter so let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. 
Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $602 million had real growth in Q3 of $25 million and decreased $17 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $610 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $212 million, had a real increase in Q3 of approximately $7 million and was hurt by changes in FX spot rates by $9 million, ending Q3 at $210 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact to currency changes was $32 million and can be found in our statement of cash flows. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast FX rates for purposes of guidance, I will use FX rates for Q4 based upon where they were yesterday, that is the euro at $1.30 and the yen at JPY 78 to the dollar. Compared to the exchange rates I used when I last gave guidance and the rates used in most recent analyst models of Red Hat, euro is now 5% weaker and the yen is 1% weaker. Despite the global economic turmoil, continuous stock market volatility and the FX rate assumptions which I just mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance on several key financial metrics based on year-to-date results and the ongoing momentum of our business. 
While these FX rate assumptions negatively impact Q4 revenue by approximately $4 million versus my last guidance, we remain reasonably naturally hedged with offshore expenses, thus resulting in minimal net P&L impact. With these FX assumptions, Q4 revenue is estimated to be approximately $289 million to $292 million, meaning that despite the currency changes, we still expect to be near the high end of my previous revenue guidance for the full year. 
As a reminder, to those of you building models, our service business normally declines sequentially in Q4 as a result of holiday downtime at our customers. We expect the same this year with a sequential service revenue decline of $2 million to $3 million. 
Operating income and margins continued to beat our estimates in Q3 and year-to-date. As a result, we are again raising guidance for operating margin and earnings per share. We expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to exceed 26%, a more than 120 basis points increase from the prior year. Q4 operating margin is expected to be approximately 25.5%, reflecting investments as we ramp up our Storage business as described in our October 4th conference call. 
Q4 non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.26 to $0.27, and full year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07 to $1.08. Again, we are assuming a 31% effective tax rate excluding the discrete tax benefit that we recorded in the second quarter. 
As you know, I do not guide toward cash flow. However, in light of the continued strong cash flow, it appears evident that our annual operating cash flow will exceed $360 million, the previous high end of our guidance. I believe it's appropriate to once again raise our operating cash flow estimate for this fiscal year by another $15 million to a range of $370 million to $375 million. 
As a reminder, we will also produce approximately $33 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities. 
In summary, we continue to execute well and deliver consistent growth in all of our financial metrics. We believe we're well-positioned to continue to deliver value and innovation for our customers and results for our shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to remind our financial community about the 2012 Analyst Day, which will be held during the Red Hat Summit in JBoss World June 26 to June 29 in Boston. Please save the date and invitations with more details will be forthcoming.

So I don't think you're out of line with that suggestion. On the part of the question was anything a little different, you heard me comment in terms of receivables and DSOs being a little bit higher. We have -- our linearity of quarterly bookings historically in a good quarter is 25%, 25%, 50% in terms of monthly split.

I would just -- I would recommend that you do that as well. But I would point you back, we feel very good about the natural hedge we have on our business that we -- our revenues expenses are naturally hedged to a reasonable degree so that currency fluctuations do not have any significant impact on the net P&L.

If we were at a low growth rate, our bookings in our revenues would be quite similar. So today, we are paying the commercial expenses to generate the bookings and the billings level you see. So yes, just slowing growth rate would drive through a revenue number that was closer to our billings number, right? So if our revenue numbers were billings already, you would add quite a bit to our margins.

Market demand for Red Hat remained strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our c",1096,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. Market demand for Red Hat remained strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our customers. The combination of these factors contributed to strong year-over-year organic growth across each of our key financial metrics, including billings, revenue, operating income and cash flow, leading to results that were at or above the high end of our expectations for every metric.
Even in a challenging global economy, demand for Red Hat's innovative solutions continue to benefit from customers, who are driving productivity gains and agility across their organizations by investing in their IT infrastructure.
Now let me provide some recent business highlights. Our big news this quarter was the further expansion of our market opportunity and footprint in the data center by entering the storage space via the acquisition of the open source software company, Gluster, Inc. This software-only solution addresses storage of unstructured data spanning from bare metal to virtualized instances and in cloud deployments. This $4 billion addressable market, which is growing rapidly, is a great place for Red Hat to enter the big data world and provide storage in the cloud.
Storage is complementary to our business, fits with our core infrastructure stack and is aligned with our enterprise customer base. Also, the Gluster technology has me excited. It is a software solution for solving the scale-out storage problem. It's open source with a vibrant community and fits well with our cloud vision of being able to deploy applications anywhere. It's already used by companies like Pandora and Limelight for their unstructured data needs.
Because the IT landscape is changing, storage architectures are changing, too. Traditional hardware-based storage solutions present a problem for customers who are now faced with having to replicate data in multiple cloud, including on-premise and public. There's a need for a common storage solution for customer data, whether that data -- wherever that data maybe. Because Gluster is software-based, it's a great solution for the challenge of storage in the cloud.
For example, you can't ship hardware to Amazon to run on top of their cloud but you can move the Gluster solution into a virtual machine instance running on a public cloud. Gluster provides choice. It's already available on Amazon's Cloud, and we are driving innovation to enable it with other cloud offerings. The Gluster technology, now known as Red Hat Storage, will be a foundation to bring products to market that not only provide a compelling value and performance proposition but solve some of the new challenges of storing the explosion of unstructured data.
I'm pleased to announce that we rapidly completed integration and launched the first Red Hat-branded storage product earlier this month. It is an enterprise-ready product hardened by our engineering team running on RHEL and supported by the broader Red Hat team. It is initially launched in North America, and our plan is to take this product global as we build out our sales and support team over the next year.
Open source technologies like Red Hat Storage are not only disrupting antiquated expensive IT products in the market today but more importantly, they are providing solutions to the new challenges facing enterprises.
On the product front, we also continue to evolve our overall set of core solutions for the data center. We launched the latest version of our flagship operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2. RHEL 6.2 includes significant improvements  in virtualization, resource management and high-availability. The enhancements in RHEL 6.2 are designed to increase performance and scalability for running enterprise workloads across physical, virtual and cloud computing environments.
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization or RHEV 3.0, the next generation of Red Hat's virtualization management product, continues to proceed well through the product delivery process. RHEV 3, which runs as a Java application on JBoss middleware and RHEL is currently in public beta. The customer reaction has been very positive. Since the public release, we have seen significant downloads from customers who are looking for choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions for their virtual infrastructure. We expect out general availability of RHEV 3.0 later this quarter.
Also during this quarter, we continued to take an active leadership role in the open-source community. Here are a few highlights. We announced our participation in the Open Compute Project established by Facebook, with the goal to building one of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. We released Fedora 16, our community-supported open source Linux distribution. As a vehicle for the initial integration of cutting-edge technology, Fedora enables us to vet nascent capabilities in areas such as cloud and virtualization.
We've also increased our activity in the OpenStack community by way of joining the core development team, integration into Facebook and with the acquisition of Gluster. The Open Virtualization Alliance continues to thrive in support of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization's core hypervisor technology, KVM, while over 200 industry leaders have joined the alliance in support of KVM since May.
As a final highlight, Red Hat was recognized by Forbes as one of their Top 10 Most Innovative Growth Companies, providing our customers with proven innovative solutions that drive greater performance, increases the loyalty of our customers. This high level of trust and loyalty that Red Hat -- that customers have placed in Red Hat is evident in our largest deals that renewed last quarter. Once again, we renewed 25 out of 25 deals, and they did so at a total value of over 130% of the original value.
This rate of upsell is particularly promising since it includes some of our largest financial services deals from 3 years ago. This is a sector that has not fully recovered from the recession but continues to increase its collaboration and purchases with Red Hat to drive innovation, performance and cost savings.
In summary, we continue to extend Red Hat's market leadership position by providing innovative open source solutions with strong ROIs for the enterprise customer. I want to thank our associates around the globe for their hard work that continue to produce exceptional results for our shareholders.
I also want to recognize Alex Pinchev, our Head of Global Sales, for his service to Red Hat, and we wish him great success at his new position. Alex will be leaving Red Hat next month to become CEO of Kronos, a Red Hat partner.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,143832151,202778,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 19, 2011",2011-12-19,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D.Here are just a few of the finan",1742,"Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D.
Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year:  Organic billings and revenue growth of 23%, total deferred revenue growth of 20%, even faster growth and profitability and cash flow with non-GAAP operating income growth of 36%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 40% and operating cash flow growth of 36%. We're continuing to gain market share in the data center. With focused spending and investing in Q3, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver expanding profitability and cash flow margins.
These metrics are some of the highest in our sector when compared to other successful software companies when they reach the $1 billion in revenue mark. Our top 30 deal metrics for the quarter provide further evidence of Red Hat's execution. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we set a record for deals over $1 million. 27 of the top 30 deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million, a 69% increase over Q3 of last fiscal year, and 5 deals exceeded $5 million, a new quarterly record.
Approximately 40% of our top deals include a middleware component, with 4 being standalone middleware deals. All 4 standalone middleware deals were over $1 million.
The 3 largest verticals represented within the top 30 deals were financial services, technology and governments around the world. We continue to see large deals and growth potential across a number of verticals, including those that are facing greater macro challenges.
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Channel bookings generated 64% of our Q3 volume, and 36% came from direct sales versus a 57%/43% split in Q2. Several of our largest deals this quarter came through the channel in the Americas, somewhat skewing the channel and geographic mix in that direction.
In terms of geography, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 16% from Asia-Pacific compared to 58%, 25%, 17% split last quarter. We continued to see solid performance in each geography with double-digit growth across all regions. However, as I just mentioned, on a relative basis, Americas was a higher percentage this quarter as a result of a number of large deals and the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to virtually every other currency.
Our billings proxy for the quarter was $322 million, up 23% year-over-year, representing 6 straight quarters of 20%-plus growth. This is the highest Q3 billings growth rate in 4 years. Average contract duration continues to be approximately 21 months. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact.
Now let's shift to the income statement. Third quarter revenue was $290 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 24% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $247 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constituted 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 18% from last year and up 1% sequentially.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for the third quarter. Subscription gross margin was steady at 94%, and training and services gross margin showed nice improvement of 38% from 33% last quarter. Higher services margin were driven by better performance and better utilization rates in both consulting and training.
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses, we continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering, leaving the Q3 non-GAAP operating expense of $169 million, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. We added over 250 net new employees during the quarter, including over 60 from the acquisition of Gluster.
Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $79 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, in line sequentially but up 260 basis points year-over-year. This was well above our guidance as a result of better performance from our Servers business and continued operational efficiencies from our G&A team. We're just at the beginning of building out our storage effort, and I'll have more to say about this in my comments on guidance.
Net interest and other income of $2 million is in line with guidance and Q3 last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.28, which is $0.02 higher than the high end of our guidance and up 40% compared to last year.
Most foreign currencies weakened against the dollar in Q3 and have continued that trend to date. Looking at the impact of foreign exchange in our income statement, if Q3 had been at the same foreign exchange rate as Q2, revenue would have been $5 million higher, expenses $4 million higher and operating income higher -- $1 million higher than we expected -- than we reported, sorry. In Q3 -- if Q3 had been reported using the same FX rates as Q3 last year, revenue would have been $2 million lower, expenses $1 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $1 million lower operating income.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow of $97 million was up 36% from Q3 last year. Strong growth in net income and deferred revenue contributed to the strong cash flow performance. FX-adjusted DSO was 60 days, up from last quarter and the year-ago quarter but still within our target range. Accounts receivable and DSO were both up at November 30 due to the large number of high-value deals that closed towards the end of the quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $820 million, an increase of $134 million or 20% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 20% in U.S. dollar terms while long-term deferred revenue grew 19% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $6 million from last quarter. Exchange rate changes were significant quarter-over-quarter so let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you.
Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $602 million had real growth in Q3 of $25 million and decreased $17 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $610 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $212 million, had a real increase in Q3 of approximately $7 million and was hurt by changes in FX spot rates by $9 million, ending Q3 at $210 million. The total increase in deferred revenue, without the impact to currency changes, was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast FX rates for purposes of guidance, I will use FX rates for Q4 based upon where they were yesterday, that is the euro at $1.30 and the yen at JPY 78 to the dollar. Compared to the exchange rates I used when I last gave guidance and the rates used in most recent analyst models of Red Hat, the euro is now 5% weaker and the yen is 1% weaker. Despite the global economic turmoil, continuous stock market volatility and the FX rate assumptions, which I just mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance on several key financial metrics based on year-to-date results and the ongoing momentum of our business.
While these FX rate assumptions negatively impact Q4 revenue by approximately $4 million versus my last guidance, we remain reasonably, naturally hedged with offshore expenses, thus resulting in minimal net P&L impact. With these FX assumptions, Q4 revenue is estimated to be approximately $289 million to $292 million, meaning that despite the currency changes, we still expect to be near the high end of my previous revenue guidance for the full year.
As a reminder, to those of you building models, our service business normally declines sequentially in Q4 as a result of holiday downtime at our customers. We expect the same this year with a sequential service revenue decline of $2 million to $3 million.
Operating income and margins continued to beat our estimates in Q3 and year-to-date. As a result, we are again raising guidance for operating margin and earnings per share. We expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to exceed 26%, a more than 120-basis point increase from the prior year. Q4 operating margin is expected to be approximately 25.5%, reflecting investments as we ramp up our Storage business as described in our October 4 conference call.
Q4 non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.26 to $0.27, and full year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07 to $1.08. Again, we are assuming a 31% effective tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefit that were recorded in the second quarter.
As you know, I do not guide quarterly cash flow. However, in light of the continued strong cash flow, it appears evident that our annual operating cash flow will exceed $360 million, the previous high end of our guidance. I believe it's appropriate to once again raise our operating cash flow estimate for this fiscal year by another $15 million to a range of $370 million to $375 million.
As a reminder, we will also produce approximately $33 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities.
In summary, we continue to execute well and deliver consistent growth in all of our financial metrics. We believe we're well-positioned to continue to deliver value and innovation for our customers and results for our shareholders.

The difference between the 2 is off-balance sheet backlog, and that is a year-end disclosure requirement and I will comment further on it at the end of the year, as well as provide some additional statistics about bookings at that time."

So just slowing growth rate would drive through a revenue number that was closer to our billings number, right? So if our revenue numbers were billings, already, you would add quite a bit to our margins.

Market demand for Red Hat remained strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our c",1098,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. Market demand for Red Hat remained strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our customers. The combination of these factors contributed to strong year-over-year organic growth across each of our key financial metrics, including billings, revenue, operating income and cash flow, leading to results that were at or above the high end of our expectations for every metric.
Even in a challenging global economy, demand for Red Hat's innovative solutions continue to benefit from customers, who are driving productivity gains and agility across their organizations by investing in their IT infrastructure.
Now let me provide some recent business highlights. Our big news this quarter was the further expansion of our market opportunity and footprint in the data center by entering the storage space via the acquisition of the open source software company, Gluster, Inc. This software-only solution addresses storage of unstructured data spanning from bare metal to virtualized instances and in cloud deployments. This $4 billion addressable market, which is growing rapidly, is a great place for Red Hat to enter the big data world and provide storage in the cloud.
Storage is complementary to our business, fits with our core infrastructure stack and is aligned with our enterprise customer base. Also, the Gluster technology has me excited. It is a software solution for solving the scale-out storage problem. It's open source with a vibrant community and fits well with our cloud vision of being able to deploy applications anywhere. It's already used by companies like Pandora and Limelight [ph] for their unstructured data needs.
Because the IT landscape is changing, storage architectures are changing, too. Traditional hardware-based storage solutions present a problem for customers who are now faced with having to replicate data in multiple cloud, including on-premise and public. There's a need for a common storage solution for customer data, whether that data -- wherever that data maybe. Because Gluster is software-based, it's a great solution for the challenge of storage in the cloud.
For example, you can't ship hardware to Amazon to run on top of their cloud but you can move the Gluster solution into a virtual machine instance running on a public cloud. Gluster provides choice. It's already available on Amazon's Cloud, and we are driving innovation to enable it with other cloud offerings. The Gluster technology, now known as Red Hat Storage, will be a foundation to bring products to market that not only provide a compelling value and performance proposition but solve some of the new challenges of storing the explosion of unstructured data.
I'm pleased to announce that we rapidly completed integration and launched the first Red Hat-branded storage product earlier this month. It is an enterprise-ready product hardened by our engineering team running on RHEL and supported by the broader Red Hat team. It is initially launched in North America, and our plan is to take this product global as we build out our sales and support team over the next year.
Open source technologies like Red Hat Storage are not only disrupting antiquated expensive IT products in the market today but more importantly, they are providing solutions to the new challenges facing enterprises.
On the product front, we also continue to evolve our overall set of core solutions for the data center. We launched the latest version of our flagship operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2. RHEL 6.2 includes significant improvements in virtualization, resource management and high-availability. The enhancements in RHEL 6.2 are designed to increase performance and scalability for running enterprise workloads across physical, virtual and cloud computing environments.
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization or RHEV 3.0, the next generation of Red Hat's virtualization management product, continues to proceed well through the product delivery process. RHEV 3, which runs as a Java application on JBoss Middleware and RHEL is currently in public beta. The customer reaction has been very positive. Since the public release, we have seen significant downloads from customers who are looking for choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions for their virtual infrastructure. We expect to have general availability of RHEV 3.0 later this quarter.
Also during this quarter, we continued to take an active leadership role in the open-source community. Here are a few highlights. We announced our participation in the Open Compute Project established by Facebook, with the goal to building one of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. We released Fedora 16, our community-supported open source Linux distribution. As a vehicle for the initial integration of cutting-edge technology, Fedora enables us to vet nascent capabilities in areas such as cloud and virtualization.
We've also increased our activity in the OpenStack community by way of joining the core development team, integration into Facebook and with the acquisition of Gluster. The Open Virtualization Alliance continues to thrive in support of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization's core hypervisor technology, KVM, while over 200 industry leaders have joined the alliance in support of KVM since May.
As a final highlight, Red Hat was recognized by Forbes as one of their Top 10 Most Innovative Growth Companies, providing our customers with proven innovative solutions that drive greater performance, increases the loyalty of our customers. This high level of trust and loyalty that Red Hat -- that customers have placed in Red Hat is evident in our largest deals that renewed last quarter. Once again, we renewed 25 out of 25 deals, and they did so at a total value of over 130% of the original value.
This rate of upsell is particularly promising since it includes some of our largest financial services deals from 3 years ago. This is a sector that has not fully recovered from the recession but continues to increase its collaboration and purchases with Red Hat to drive innovation, performance and cost savings.
In summary, we continue to extend Red Hat's market leadership position by providing innovative open source solutions with strong ROIs for the enterprise customer. I want to thank our associates around the globe for their hard work that continue to produce exceptional results for our shareholders.
I also want to recognize Alex Pinchev, our Head of Global Sales, for his service to Red Hat, and we wish him great success at his new position. Alex will be leaving Red Hat next month to become CEO of Acronis, a Red Hat partner.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,143832151,202783,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 19, 2011",2011-12-19,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D.Here are just a few of the finan",1741,"Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D.
Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year basis: Organic billings and revenue growth of 23%, total deferred revenue growth of 20%, even faster growth and profitability and cash flow with non-GAAP operating income growth of 36%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 40% and operating cash flow growth of 36%. We're continuing to gain market share in the data center. With focused spending and investing in Q3, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver expanding profitability and cash flow margins.
These metrics are some of the highest in our sector when compared to other successful software companies when they reach the $1 billion in revenue mark. Our top 30 deal metrics for the quarter provide further evidence of Red Hat's execution. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we set a record for deals over $1 million. 27 of the top 30 deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million, a 69% increase over Q3 of last fiscal year, and 5 deals exceeded $5 million, a new quarterly record.
Approximately 40% of our top deals include a middleware component, with 4 being standalone middleware deals. All 4 standalone middleware deals were over $1 million.
The 3 largest verticals represented within the top 30 deals were financial services, technology and governments around the world. We continue to see large deals and growth potential across a number of verticals, including those that are facing greater macro challenges.
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Channel bookings generated 64% of our Q3 volume, and 36% came from direct sales versus a 57%-43% split in Q2. Several of our largest deals this quarter came through the channel in the Americas, somewhat skewing the channel and geographic mix in that direction.
In terms of geography, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 16% from Asia-Pacific compared to 58%-25%-17% split last quarter. We continued to see solid performance in each geography with double-digit growth across all regions. However, as I just mentioned, on a relative basis, Americas was a higher percentage this quarter as a result of a number of large deals and the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to virtually every other currency.
Our billings proxy for the quarter was $322 million, up 23% year-over-year, representing 6 straight quarters of 20%-plus growth. This is the highest Q3 billings growth rate in 4 years. Average contract duration continues to be approximately 21 months. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact.
Now let's shift to the income statement. Third quarter revenue was $290 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 24% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $247 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constituted 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 18% from last year and up 1% sequentially.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for the third quarter. Subscription gross margin was steady at 94%, and training and services gross margin showed nice improvement to 38% from 33% last quarter. Higher services margin were driven by better performance and better utilization rates in both consulting and training.
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. We continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering, leaving the Q3 non-GAAP operating expense of $169 million, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. We added over 250 net new employees during the quarter, including over 60 from the acquisition of Gluster.
Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $79 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, in line sequentially but up 260 basis points year-over-year. This was well above our guidance as a result of better performance from our service business and continued operational efficiencies from our G&A team. We are just the beginning of building out our storage effort, and I'll have more to say about this in my comments on guidance.
Net interest and other income of $2 million is in line with guidance and Q3 last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.28, which is $0.02 higher than the high end of our guidance and up 40% compared to last year.
Most foreign currencies weakened against the dollar in Q3 and have continued that trend to date. Looking at the impact of foreign exchange in our income statement, if Q3 had been at the same foreign exchange rate as Q2, revenue would have been $5 million higher, expenses $4 million higher and operating income higher -- $1 million higher than we expected -- than we reported, sorry. In Q3 -- if Q3 had been reported using the same FX rates as Q3 last year, revenue would have been $2 million lower, expenses $1 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $1 million lower operating income.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow of $97 million was up 36% from Q3 last year. Strong growth in net income and deferred revenue contributed to the strong cash flow performance. FX-adjusted DSO was 60 days, up from last quarter and the year-ago quarter but still within our target range. Accounts receivable and DSO were both up at November 30 due to the large number of high-value deals that closed towards the end of the quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $820 million, an increase of $134 million or 20% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 20% in U.S. dollar terms while long-term deferred revenue grew 19% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $6 million from last quarter. Exchange rate changes were significant quarter-over-quarter so let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you.
Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $602 million, had real growth in Q3 of $25 million and decreased $17 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $610 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $212 million, had a real increase in Q3 of approximately $7 million and was hurt by changes in FX spot rates by $9 million, ending Q3 at $210 million. The total increase in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast FX rates for purposes of guidance, I will use FX rates for Q4 based upon where they were yesterday, that is the euro at $1.30 and the yen at JPY 78 to the dollar. Compared to the exchange rates I used when I last gave guidance and the rates used in most recent analyst models of Red Hat, the euro is now 5% weaker and the yen is 1% weaker. Despite the global economic turmoil, continuous stock market volatility and the FX rate assumptions, which I just mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance on several key financial metrics based on year-to-date results and the ongoing momentum of our business.
While these FX rate assumptions negatively impact Q4 revenue by approximately $4 million versus my last guidance, we remain reasonably, naturally hedged with offshore expenses, thus resulting in minimal net P&L impact. With these FX assumptions, Q4 revenue is estimated to be approximately $289 million to $292 million, meaning that despite the currency changes, we still expect to be near the high end of my previous revenue guidance for the full year.
As a reminder, to those of you building models, our service business normally declines sequentially in Q4 as a result of holiday downtime at our customers. We expect the same this year with a sequential service revenue decline of $2 million to $3 million.
Operating income and margins continued to beat our estimates in Q3 and year-to-date. As a result, we are again raising guidance for operating margin and earnings per share. We expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to exceed 26%, a more than 120-basis point increase from the prior year. Q4 operating margin is expected to be approximately 25.5%, reflecting investments as we ramp up our storage business as described in our October 4 conference call.
Q4 non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.26 to $0.27, and full year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07 to $1.08. Again, we are assuming a 31% effective tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefit that we recorded in the second quarter.
As you know, I do not guide quarterly cash flow. However, in light of the continued strong cash flow, it appears evident that our annual operating cash flow will exceed $360 million, the previous high end of our guidance. I believe it's appropriate to once again raise our operating cash flow estimate for this fiscal year by another $15 million to a range of $370 million to $375 million.
As a reminder, we will also produce approximately $33 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities.
In summary, we continue to execute well and deliver consistent growth in all of our financial metrics. We believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver value and innovation for our customers and results for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to remind our financial community about the 2012 Analyst Day, which will be held during Red Hat Summit in JBoss World June 26 to June 29 in Boston. Please save the date and invitations with more details will be forthcoming.

On the part of the question, was anything a little different, you heard me comment in terms of receivables and DSOs being a little bit higher. We had a -- our linearity of quarterly bookings historically in a good quarter is 25%-25%-50% in terms of monthly split.

Market demand for Red Hat remained strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our c",1098,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. Market demand for Red Hat remained strong on a global basis, and we continue to gain market share as a result of strong execution and our ability to deliver value to our customers. The combination of these factors contributed to strong year-over-year organic growth across each of our key financial metrics, including billings, revenue, operating income and cash flow, leading to results that were at or above the high end of our expectations for every metric.
Even in a challenging global economy, demand for Red Hat's innovative solutions continue to benefit from customers, who are driving productivity gains and agility across their organizations by investing in their IT infrastructure.
Now let me provide some recent business highlights. Our big news this quarter was the further expansion of our market opportunity and footprint in the data center by entering the storage space via the acquisition of the open source software company, Gluster, Inc. This software-only solution addresses storage of unstructured data spanning from bare metal to virtualized instances and in cloud deployments. This $4 billion addressable market, which is growing rapidly, is a great place for Red Hat to enter the big data world and provide storage in the cloud.
Storage is complementary to our business, fits with our core infrastructure stack and is aligned with our enterprise customer base. Also, the Gluster technology has me excited. It is a software solution for solving the scale-out storage problem. It's open source with a vibrant community and fits well with our cloud vision of being able to deploy applications anywhere. It's already used by companies like Pandora and Limelight [ph] for their unstructured data needs.
Because the IT landscape is changing, storage architectures are changing, too. Traditional hardware-based storage solutions present a problem for customers who are now faced with having to replicate data in multiple cloud, including on-premise and public. There's a need for a common storage solution for customer data, whether that data -- wherever that data maybe. Because Gluster is software-based, it's a great solution for the challenge of storage in the cloud.
For example, you can't ship hardware to Amazon to run on top of their cloud but you can move the Gluster solution into a virtual machine instance running on a public cloud. Gluster provides choice. It's already available on Amazon's Cloud, and we are driving innovation to enable it with other cloud offerings. The Gluster technology, now known as Red Hat Storage, will be a foundation to bring products to market that not only provide a compelling value and performance proposition but solve some of the new challenges of storing the explosion of unstructured data.
I'm pleased to announce that we rapidly completed integration and launched the first Red Hat-branded storage product earlier this month. It is an enterprise-ready product hardened by our engineering team running on RHEL and supported by the broader Red Hat team. It is initially launched in North America, and our plan is to take this product global as we build out our sales and support team over the next year.
Open source technologies like Red Hat Storage are not only disrupting antiquated expensive IT products in the market today but more importantly, they are providing solutions to the new challenges facing enterprises.
On the product front, we also continue to evolve our overall set of core solutions for the data center. We launched the latest version of our flagship operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2. RHEL 6.2 includes significant improvements in virtualization, resource management and high-availability. The enhancements in RHEL 6.2 are designed to increase performance and scalability for running enterprise workloads across physical, virtual and cloud computing environments.
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization or RHEV 3.0, the next generation of Red Hat's virtualization management product, continues to proceed well through the product delivery process. RHEV 3, which runs as a Java application on JBoss Middleware and RHEL is currently in public beta. The customer reaction has been very positive. Since the public release, we have seen significant downloads from customers who are looking for choice, interoperability and integrated management solutions for their virtual infrastructure. We expect to have general availability of RHEV 3.0 later this quarter.
Also during this quarter, we continued to take an active leadership role in the open-source community. Here are a few highlights. We announced our participation in the Open Compute Project established by Facebook, with the goal to building one of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. We released Fedora 16, our community-supported open source Linux distribution. As a vehicle for the initial integration of cutting-edge technology, Fedora enables us to vet nascent capabilities in areas such as cloud and virtualization.
We've also increased our activity in the OpenStack community by way of joining the core development team, integration into Facebook and with the acquisition of Gluster. The Open Virtualization Alliance continues to thrive in support of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization's core hypervisor technology, KVM, while over 200 industry leaders have joined the alliance in support of KVM since May.
As a final highlight, Red Hat was recognized by Forbes as one of their Top 10 Most Innovative Growth Companies, providing our customers with proven innovative solutions that drive greater performance, increases the loyalty of our customers. This high level of trust and loyalty that Red Hat -- that customers have placed in Red Hat is evident in our largest deals that renewed last quarter. Once again, we renewed 25 out of 25 deals, and they did so at a total value of over 130% of the original value.
This rate of upsell is particularly promising since it includes some of our largest financial services deals from 3 years ago. This is a sector that has not fully recovered from the recession but continues to increase its collaboration and purchases with Red Hat to drive innovation, performance and cost savings.
In summary, we continue to extend Red Hat's market leadership position by providing innovative open source solutions with strong ROIs for the enterprise customer. I want to thank our associates around the globe for their hard work that continue to produce exceptional results for our shareholders.
I also want to recognize Alex Pinchev, our Head of Global Sales, for his service to Red Hat, and we wish him great success at his new position. Alex will be leaving Red Hat next month to become CEO of Acronis, a Red Hat partner.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,143832151,202789,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 19, 2011",2011-12-19,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D.Here are just a few of the finan",1741,"Thanks, Jim. Once again, Red Hat has delivered a strong quarter of consistent growth across all of our key financial metrics. We've continued to see strong demand and return on our investments in sales, marketing and R&D.
Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year basis: Organic billings and revenue growth of 23%, total deferred revenue growth of 20%, even faster growth and profitability and cash flow with non-GAAP operating income growth of 36%, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 40% and operating cash flow growth of 36%. We're continuing to gain market share in the data center. With focused spending and investing in Q3, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver expanding profitability and cash flow margins.
These metrics are some of the highest in our sector when compared to other successful software companies when they reach the $1 billion in revenue mark. Our top 30 deal metrics for the quarter provide further evidence of Red Hat's execution. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we set a record for deals over $1 million. 27 of the top 30 deals in the quarter exceeded $1 million, a 69% increase over Q3 of last fiscal year, and 5 deals exceeded $5 million, a new quarterly record.
Approximately 40% of our top deals include a middleware component, with 4 being standalone middleware deals. All 4 standalone middleware deals were over $1 million.
The 3 largest verticals represented within the top 30 deals were financial services, technology and governments around the world. We continue to see large deals and growth potential across a number of verticals, including those that are facing greater macro challenges.
Now let's turn to our financial performance. Channel bookings generated 64% of our Q3 volume, and 36% came from direct sales versus a 57%-43% split in Q2. Several of our largest deals this quarter came through the channel in the Americas, somewhat skewing the channel and geographic mix in that direction.
In terms of geography, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 16% from Asia-Pacific compared to 58%-25%-17% split last quarter. We continued to see solid performance in each geography with double-digit growth across all regions. However, as I just mentioned, on a relative basis, Americas was a higher percentage this quarter as a result of a number of large deals and the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to virtually every other currency.
Our billings proxy for the quarter was $322 million, up 23% year-over-year, representing 6 straight quarters of 20%-plus growth. This is the highest Q3 billings growth rate in 4 years. Average contract duration continues to be approximately 21 months. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement, which eliminates most foreign exchange impact.
Now let's shift to the income statement. Third quarter revenue was $290 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by both subscription revenue and service revenue. Subscription revenue was up 24% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $247 million. Subscription revenue, which is renewable, constituted 85% of total revenue. The training and services component of revenue was $43 million, up 18% from last year and up 1% sequentially.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense, overall gross margin was 85% for the third quarter. Subscription gross margin was steady at 94%, and training and services gross margin showed nice improvement to 38% from 33% last quarter. Higher services margin were driven by better performance and better utilization rates in both consulting and training.
Moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. We continued to increase investments in the business, principally in sales, marketing and engineering, leaving the Q3 non-GAAP operating expense of $169 million, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. We added over 250 net new employees during the quarter, including over 60 from the acquisition of Gluster.
Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $79 million, producing an operating margin of 27%, in line sequentially but up 260 basis points year-over-year. This was well above our guidance as a result of better performance from our service business and continued operational efficiencies from our G&A team. We are just the beginning of building out our storage effort, and I'll have more to say about this in my comments on guidance.
Net interest and other income of $2 million is in line with guidance and Q3 last year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is 31% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.28, which is $0.02 higher than the high end of our guidance and up 40% compared to last year.
Most foreign currencies weakened against the dollar in Q3 and have continued that trend to date. Looking at the impact of foreign exchange in our income statement, if Q3 had been at the same foreign exchange rate as Q2, revenue would have been $5 million higher, expenses $4 million higher and operating income higher -- $1 million higher than we expected -- than we reported, sorry. In Q3 -- if Q3 had been reported using the same FX rates as Q3 last year, revenue would have been $2 million lower, expenses $1 million lower than we reported, which would have resulted in about $1 million lower operating income.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow of $97 million was up 36% from Q3 last year. Strong growth in net income and deferred revenue contributed to the strong cash flow performance. FX-adjusted DSO was 60 days, up from last quarter and the year-ago quarter but still within our target range. Accounts receivable and DSO were both up at November 30 due to the large number of high-value deals that closed towards the end of the quarter. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $820 million, an increase of $134 million or 20% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 20% in U.S. dollar terms while long-term deferred revenue grew 19% from one year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $6 million from last quarter. Exchange rate changes were significant quarter-over-quarter so let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you.
Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $602 million, had real growth in Q3 of $25 million and decreased $17 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q3 at $610 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q2 at $212 million, had a real increase in Q3 of approximately $7 million and was hurt by changes in FX spot rates by $9 million, ending Q3 at $210 million. The total increase in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Since I do not forecast FX rates for purposes of guidance, I will use FX rates for Q4 based upon where they were yesterday, that is the euro at $1.30 and the yen at JPY 78 to the dollar. Compared to the exchange rates I used when I last gave guidance and the rates used in most recent analyst models of Red Hat, the euro is now 5% weaker and the yen is 1% weaker. Despite the global economic turmoil, continuous stock market volatility and the FX rate assumptions, which I just mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance on several key financial metrics based on year-to-date results and the ongoing momentum of our business.
While these FX rate assumptions negatively impact Q4 revenue by approximately $4 million versus my last guidance, we remain reasonably, naturally hedged with offshore expenses, thus resulting in minimal net P&L impact. With these FX assumptions, Q4 revenue is estimated to be approximately $289 million to $292 million, meaning that despite the currency changes, we still expect to be near the high end of my previous revenue guidance for the full year.
As a reminder, to those of you building models, our service business normally declines sequentially in Q4 as a result of holiday downtime at our customers. We expect the same this year with a sequential service revenue decline of $2 million to $3 million.
Operating income and margins continued to beat our estimates in Q3 and year-to-date. As a result, we are again raising guidance for operating margin and earnings per share. We expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to exceed 26%, a more than 120-basis point increase from the prior year. Q4 operating margin is expected to be approximately 25.5%, reflecting investments as we ramp up our storage business as described in our October 4 conference call.
Q4 non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.26 to $0.27, and full year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07 to $1.08. Again, we are assuming a 31% effective tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefit that we recorded in the second quarter.
As you know, I do not guide quarterly cash flow. However, in light of the continued strong cash flow, it appears evident that our annual operating cash flow will exceed $360 million, the previous high end of our guidance. I believe it's appropriate to once again raise our operating cash flow estimate for this fiscal year by another $15 million to a range of $370 million to $375 million.
As a reminder, we will also produce approximately $33 million of additional cash from excess tax benefits from stock compensation deductions, which is included in cash flow from financing activities.
In summary, we continue to execute well and deliver consistent growth in all of our financial metrics. We believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver value and innovation for our customers and results for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to remind our financial community about the 2012 Analyst Day, which will be held during Red Hat Summit in JBoss World June 26 to June 29 in Boston. Please save the date and invitations with more details will be forthcoming.
Operator, I would now like to turn it back over to you for the first question."

First on the billing side, I think we've consistently kept our billings proxy as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue off of the cash flow statement.

So I don't think you're out of line with that suggestion. On the part of the question, was anything a little different, you heard me comment in terms of receivables and DSOs being a little bit higher. We had a -- our linearity of quarterly bookings historically in a good quarter is 25%-25%-50% in terms of monthly split. This quarter was more like 20%-20%-60%, a little more back-end loaded, which also might have had some small impact on revenue since we recognize revenue on a daily basis, but apart from that, nothing else."

We agree with what you said. Our position there is still young. We've got a lot of work to do. We have not provided any guidance relative to 3 or 5 years. But if you look backward, I would say, to how we grew on the Linux side of how we've grown on the middleware side over the years, I would expect that same sort of penetration in these addressable markets over time.

Just a very narrowly defined unstructured data storage market is $4 billion. Obviously, that's exploding. So you start looking at the total addressable market opportunities for us out there to go disrupt, they're a very, very large markets. And obviously, at our price points, we significantly reduce the size of those markets.

Sometimes, we have to -- or the customer has to track down all their various approvers. It can take a little bit longer, so that may be part of it.

Obviously, we are still growing rapidly, and as you see our billings are larger in absolute terms than our revenues, and our bookings, because of our balance sheet, are even larger than that. If we were at a low growth rate, our bookings and our revenues would be quite similar. So today, we are paying the commercial expenses to generate the bookings and the billings level you see. So just slowing growth rate would drive through a revenue number that was closer to our billings number, right?
